Chapter Four Hundred and Thirty-Seven: Striking an Iron Plate At that moment, with the Blue Silver Golden Light Array activated, the firelight dimmed instantly, being drawn and guided downward. However, the Fire Gourd was not so easily subdued. It forcefully sucked upwards, capturing a portion of the flames, and 'whooshed' to the side, escaping the Blue Silver Golden Light Array's confines. The events unfolded rapidly, almost too swift for the eyes to keep up. This one's tricky! We must subdue her swiftly, lest the Enforcers arrive. As the Fire Gourd spewed flames downward, the woman reappeared, her eyes filled with malice, 'What are you doing?' As she spoke, a circle of magnificent light patterns quietly emerged beneath her, freezing her body instantly. Tang Wulin’s Blue Silver Grass entwined upwards in response, Ye Xinglan's Stargod Sword pointing directly at the adversary's chest, while Xie Xie, having silently moved behind her, positioned his Light Dragon Dagger at her neck. Everything was a setup. What could be better than Xu Xiaoyan’s Starlight Chains when dealing with a single opponent? The absolute binding effect of the Starlight Chains is indeed a heaven-defying presence! Just as everyone relaxed, believing the opponent was subdued, a sudden change occurred! The Stargod Sword was already at the front, and the sharp edge of the Light Dragon Dagger at the neck, when threatened with death, the woman's eyes suddenly brightened. A sonorous phoenix cry emanated from her, and immediately after, an immensely strong soul force burst forth from within her. Triggered, fiery red glows appeared beneath her clothes at her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, and knees. An incredibly formidable soul force erupted from the woman. It was many times stronger than before, and as the soul force rose, it transformed into a massive fiery ring that surged outward. The Fire Gourd in the sky now displayed fine golden patterns, and the once foot-tall Fire Gourd grew to two feet, increasing several sizes in an instant. The powerful fire elemental fluctuation erupted, forcefully repelling Tang Wulin and his companions with a violent impact, the flames gnawing at their soul powers like relentless parasites. The phoenix cries intensified, and the woman exuded a majestic aura. Immediately after, pieces of dark red armor rapidly materialized, covering her entire body. A phoenix helmet covered her head, with the dark red armor extending elegantly to both sides and downward in an arc, accentuating her feminine form. At her shoulders, soft lines enveloped and covered her entire arms. The dark red armor, adorned with flame patterns and a golden-red phoenix emblem on the breastplate, wasn't particularly extravagant, but once it covered the woman, her presence soared. 'Dou Kai!' Tang Wulin exclaimed, his face also showing a bitter smile. Yes, this was Dou Kai! Judging from its complexity and the aura fluctuations, it was indeed Single-Word Dou Kai. The light rings seen on the woman’s body were containers for storing the Dou Kai. Single-Word Dou Kai could not yet be integrated into a Dou Kai Master’s body. Even so, this was a complete set of Single-Word Dou Kai! It meant that the woman, originally with a five-ring cultivation, now had her strength boosted instantly to the seven-ring Soul Saint level. Yan Feng was extremely incensed. She had been in an exceptionally good mood today, elated. Just before, she had gone to the towering Sky Spirit Douluo Tower to officially register as a Single-Word Dou Kai Master. Dou Kai Masters are top-tier existences that any organization would eagerly support. During the contract signing, the Soul Transmission Tower had agreed to a series of welfare policies for her. At only twenty-seven years old, she was one of the youngest Dou Kai Masters in Sky Spirit City, with a limitless future. The Soul Transmission Tower had promised to support her with ample resources to help her strive towards becoming a Two-Word Dou Kai Master. Once she became a Two-Word Dou Kai Master, she would have a significant standing on the entire continent. But who could have expected that right after leaving the Soul Transmission Tower in high spirits, she would be ambushed by this group of youngsters. Moreover, their capabilities were formidable. If she hadn't activated her Dou Kai, she might have been caught off guard earlier. She was unaware that Tang Wulin and his teammates bore no malice. The Stargod Sword and Light Dragon Dagger had made her feel the threat of death. At that moment, Wu Zhangkong’s voice sounded in the ears of Tang Wulin and his five teammates, 'If you can defeat her, you will have passed this city’s challenge.' Tang Wulin’s lips twitched slightly. Teacher Wu, oh Teacher Wu, you indeed have a sly side! This is a fully equipped Single-Word Dou Kai Master, equivalent to a seven-ring Soul Saint-level powerhouse. Can we really win against her? Before he had time to ponder further, Yan Feng had already made her move. Her mighty soul power surged in an instant, and with a point of her right hand toward Tang Wulin, the Fire Gourd overhead immediately projected a line of fire that reached him in the blink of an eye. At this juncture, there was no choice but to give it a try; explanations were undoubtedly futile. By her expression, one could tell that she was provoked. They were not justified in this! First, they had to deal with the matter. Tang Wulin took a deep breath, the three purple soul rings on his body suddenly vanished, and golden rings emerged. The rings bloomed, his right arm expanded, golden dragon scales spread out, and simultaneously, brilliant star lines converged on his right hand, revealing his Dou Kai gauntlet. Against a true Dou Kai Master, how could he not go all out? 'Dou Kai?' Yan Feng was startled to see the Dou Kai on Tang Wulin’s right hand. Impossible was the word that flashed through her mind! How old was he? And she had clearly seen that Tang Wulin’s Dou Kai had emerged directly from his body. Could it be Two-Word Dou Kai? Even though it was just a single piece, having Dou Kai at such a young age was unthinkable. When she obtained her first piece of Dou Kai, she was already twenty-one, and even that was considered prodigious. After years of arduous cultivation, she had finally become a true Single-Word Dou Kai Master. But how old were these youngsters in front of her? As Tang Wulin initiated his action, the others also quickly sprang into action. Xu Lizhi, who had retreated a good distance earlier, silently flew out enchanted buns – Agile Steamed Buns, Bloodthirsty Red Bean Buns – one for each person. Tang Wulin, with his left hand behind him, caught two buns, and without any hesitation, he stuffed them into his mouth. A swift battle was necessary. Even if it was just Single-Word Dou Kai, once the full set was assembled, it had the capability to help soul masters quickly recover soul power. They had no chance in a drawn-out battle with her. He stomped his left foot on the ground with a thunderous roar, and Tang Wulin shot up like a dart, his right arm shielding in front, his blood boiling and the aura of the Golden Dragon King surging forth. His eyes turned completely golden, and the blood qi fluctuations radiating from his body were intense. The Golden Dragon Claw was poised to contend with the opposing flames, pushing forward against them. As the team leader and an aggressive battle soul master, he could not afford to retreat at this moment. Only by holding the frontline could his comrades have a chance. Bolstered by the Bloodthirsty Red Bean Bun, his own soul power and blood qi force instantly exploded to their peak, and his entire skin displayed faint golden scales, particularly on his right hand, right arm, and right chest, where the scales were exceptionally brilliant. He possessed a twin martial soul? Yan Feng was taken aback. 'Hmph!' She didn't evade, and the Fire Gourd above her head began to spin, transforming the original line of fire into a swath of flames that swept past Tang Wulin’s head, enveloping his companions and blocking the others. She sought to isolate Tang Wulin, planning to deal with this apparent leader of the group first. As the Golden Dragon Claw reached her swiftly, Yan Feng’s right hand also rose, forming a fist to clash head-on. As they were about to collide, the dragon’s chant within Tang Wulin’s body suddenly intensified, and a massive golden dragon head, over two feet in diameter, appeared out of nowhere, directly engulfing Yan Feng’s right arm. Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens! The meal of Ruby Shrimp had not allowed Tang Wulin to break through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, but it had significantly enhanced his abilities, making him more adept at controlling Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens. Yan Feng was also shocked. She felt a forceful impact head-on, and as her fist was unleashed, the flames seemed to be devoured. The Golden Dragon Claw, like a large pincer, clamped onto her right hand. The Golden Dragon Claw exerted its strength, and Yan Feng’s entire Single-Word Dou Kai illuminated. All the flame patterns on it seemed to come alive, especially the Fire Phoenix on her chest, which truly moved and turned into a phoenix shadow charging directly at Tang Wulin’s chest. This was... Chapter Four Hundred and Thirty-Eight: Big Sister, I Think There's Been a Misunderstanding Yan Feng was poised, her Fire Gourd atop her head at the ready. Her soul rings ignited, propelling a tangible, golden-red fireball that hurtled towards Tang Wulin’s chest with ferocious intensity. This was the essence of Battle Armor—a flawless amalgamation of offensive and defensive capabilities in one Battle Armor suit! Tang Wulin could feel it—the formidable power of his Golden Dragon Claw dissipated as soon as it came into contact with the opponent's Battle Armor, its potential for destruction utterly neutralized. The counterattack was swift and punishing. Even with the enhancements from Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens and his gauntlet Battle Armor, Tang Wulin was, at best, on par with a Four-Ringed Soul Sect Leader. But here he stood against a true Single-Word Battle Armor Master! Summoning his Right Arm Power, he tried to leverage his formidable strength to toss the foe aside. At the same time, a Blue Silver Grass shot up from beneath, a last-ditch effort to change direction and evade the relentless Phoenix and its fiery orb. Yet, against all odds, both fiery assailants tracked his movements, mirroring his evasive maneuvers. Just then, an Ice Spear, a silent harbinger of death, impaled the Phoenix with unerring precision, triggering an immediate explosion that sent Tang Wulin flying backward. The disparity in soul power was painfully clear! Despite the support from the Bloodthirsty Red Bean Bun, Tang Wulin felt an internal agony, as if his very essence had been shattered by the blast. Sword threads interwove into a defensive net, halting the pursuing golden-red fireball which exploded, accompanied by a muffled cry from Ye Xinglan. In terms of tactics and combat skill, Tang Wulin’s team was on equal footing with Yan Feng. The real hurdle was the overwhelming gulf in soul power. With her Single-Word Battle Armor, Yan Feng was an impenetrable fortress, untouchable by Tang Wulin and his allies at this stage. Xie Xie appeared behind Yan Feng like a wraith, his Light Dragon Dagger and Shadow Dragon Dagger poised to strike. But her Battle Armor flashed, repelling the attack with a burst of fiery brilliance. How could they continue the fight when they couldn’t breach her defenses? Yan Feng was rapidly gaining control of the battlefield. Suddenly, a premonition of danger washed over her, as a resplendent four-colored light orb appeared, swirling with blue, red, yellow, and green halos. The fist-sized sphere barreled towards her. Without hesitation, Yan Feng's fourth soul ring lit up, the Fire Gourd expanded, and a barrage of golden-red fireballs erupted forth. Like a volley of sequential fire cannonballs, they blocked the light sphere's path. Explosions thundered, unleashing a vicious Elemental Storm that filled the air. Tang Wulin had regained his footing, the Mysterious Heaven Technique coursing through him to quell the internal inferno. Unscathed physically, the battle had nonetheless become unwinnable! All eyes were now on Gu Yue's next move. As expected, the defense of a Single-Word Battle Armor Master was unassailable. The Elemental Storm ravaged the skies for an enduring six seconds before it began to subside. Yan Feng stood unyielding, her stance unchanged. Her Battle Armor, ablaze with golden-red flames, showed no signs of dimming. The Fire Gourd was once again aimed at Tang Wulin. "Big Sister, I think this is all just a misunderstanding," Tang Wulin said, managing a strained smile. At that moment, a piercing alarm blared, and three figures closed in rapidly. These were Mech Armors, though unlike the ones encountered in Sky Spirit City, these were entirely yellow, devoid of any purple. "Cease!" commanded an Electronic Voice, demanding obedience. Yan Feng, ready to strike, was forced to halt. The Fire Gourd tilted skyward, poised like a deadly sentinel as she glared at Tang Wulin, her eyes seething with indignation. Then, she noticed the boy who had first engaged her now wore an expression of profound grief and outrage. Descending from above, the three Mech Armors, each a towering ten meters tall, separated the combatants. "Waah!" Xu Xiaoyan's tears erupted as she clung to Ye Xinglan, sobbing uncontrollably. Xie Xie's head drooped in a show of despair, while Ye Xinglan seemed lost in a daze. Xu Lizhi sat on the ground, and Gu Yue maintained a neutral expression, a flicker of mirth dancing in her eyes. Tang Wulin stood protectively, drawing Gu Yue close behind him, his face etched with feigned sorrow. "Enforcer, your timing is impeccable. Please, save us. Had you arrived a moment later, we would have been incinerated." "What?" Yan Feng was taken aback, disbelief etched on her face—it was they who had attacked first! The Electronic Voice from the Mech Armor inquired, "What exactly is transpiring here? Why have you engaged these youths, Single-Word Battle Armor Master?" Yan Feng, a recent registrant as a Single-Word Battle Armor Master at the Sky Spirit Douluo Tower, was not recognized by the Enforcers. When the words 'Single-Word Battle Armor Master' were uttered, there was an undeniable edge of wariness in their tone. With their trio of Yellow Mech Armors and their level of cultivation, they stood no chance against a Single-Word Battle Armor Master. "They are the true aggressors," Yan Feng countered with vehemence. Tang Wulin blinked his large, innocent eyes, feigning shock, "You... what are you implying? We attacked you? You're a Single-Word Battle Armor Master! We are merely humble soul masters. Uncle Enforcer, I am but fourteen, and the youngest of my companions is a mere thirteen. Would we truly dare to challenge a Single-Word Battle Armor Master?" Yan Feng, trembling with barely contained fury, countered, "You're slandering me! It was you who initiated the attack, at which time my status as a Single-Word Battle Armor Master was unknown. We are strangers to each other." Without missing a beat, Tang Wulin fired back, "If we are strangers, why would we attack you? I clearly heard you boasting about your recent ascension to Single-Word Battle Armor Master and looking for someone to test your strength. Then, you turned towards us and struck without warning, forcing us into defense. My mentor always emphasized, 'With great power comes great responsibility,' yet you, a Single-Word Battle Armor Master, chose to bully us children. How dare you invert the truth?" Xu Xiaoyan's wails grew louder, her body almost hanging off Ye Xinglan. Ye Xinglan turned her head away, unable to bear the charade. Xie Xie let out a long, heavy sigh—his time with Tang Wulin had indeed sharpened his dramatic flair. With each side ardently defending their stories, the Enforcers were left confounded, yet instinctively, they leaned towards Tang Wulin and his team. The advantage of youth was clear; it seemed improbable for them to have provoked a Single-Word Battle Armor Master without provocation. "All parties, accompany us to the Soul Transmission Tower. We shall review the Surveillance Video to determine the truth," declared the lead Enforcer, his voice laden with authority. "Absolutely!" Tang Wulin readily agreed. Yan Feng, her teeth gritted in frustration, spat out, "Wait until the evidence is laid bare, you little miscreant. Then we'll see who's truly Calling a Deer a Horse." She was seething with fury! The three Mech Armors pivoted, forming a triangular formation around Yan Feng, signaling their readiness to escort her. "Proceed. Please deactivate your Battle Armor first." This was a preventative measure against any unexpected escape attempts. Yan Feng's anger was palpable, "Are you blind to the truth? What will you do if I refuse to deactivate it?" In an instant, the Mech Armors glowed ominously, their Soul Guidance Cannons locking onto her. "Uncle Enforcer, do you see? She remains as imperious and overbearing as ever," Tang Wulin observed, inching backwards as if bracing for a potential backlash. Yan Feng’s wrath could not be contained any longer, "I'll burn you to ashes!" she roared, charging towards Tang Wulin. The Mech Armors were no mere decorations; their Soul Guidance Cannons fired without hesitation, and the storm of Soul Guidance Cannon Shells erupted with devastating force. Chapter Four Hundred and Thirty-Nine: Heart-Racing Handsomeness The Soul Transmission Pagoda's Enforcers, all rigorously trained, confronted the mighty Yan Feng with the most foolproof tactics. They launched a trio of Soul Guidance Cannon Shells, not directly at Yan Feng, but detonating them mid-air. The resulting collision unleashed a violent Elemental Storm. Despite her Battle Armor, Yan Feng was knocked off balance by the ferocious energy shockwave. The three Mech Armors surged forth, ascending and raining down a relentless barrage from their Soul Guidance Cannons, sparing no energy in their assault. Faced with a Single-Word Battle Armor Master, they couldn't afford any half-measures. Moreover, the leading Enforcer had already called for reinforcements. They just needed to stall for a short while. Tang Wulin and his team now recognized the true strength of these Enforcers. If they hadn't managed to split the Enforcers in Sky Spirit City, preventing their teamwork, they would've faced serious trouble. The trio of Mech Armors coordinated perfectly, their Soul Guidance Cannons firing furiously in a seamless, interlocking pattern, enveloping the area. Yan Feng, despite her strength, found herself hard-pressed. Her main combat power lay in her Fire Gourd Martial Soul, and her newly attained Single-Word Battle Armor hadn't fully synchronized with her soul power. For a moment, she was truly suppressed. Tang Wulin wouldn't miss such an opportunity. Leading his friends, he beat a hasty retreat, shouting, 'Everyone be careful not to get hit. Let's fall back further. Enforcer, keep it up!' Xie Xie disappeared like a wisp of smoke, sprinting to the nearby Soul-Guided Vehicle. The rest of the team quickly boarded, even Xu Lizhi showing unexpected agility. The Soul-Guided Vehicle's engine roared, speeding off instantly. At that moment, the Enforcer's entire focus was on Yan Feng, the clamor of Soul Guidance Cannons drowning out the vehicle's startup noise. They failed to notice Tang Wulin and his companions' escape. Likewise, Yan Feng, blinded by the energy barrage, didn't realize they were gone. Without Tang Wulin's instruction, Xie Xie zigzagged through alleys, pushing the vehicle to its limits. 'We really hit a snag this time. Could our luck be any worse? Aren't Battle Armor Masters supposed to be incredibly rare? How did we manage to pick one?' Xu Xiaoyan grumbled, her face devoid of tears. Tang Wulin smiled bitterly, 'We need a new plan. This method is too unpredictable, and we're making enemies. Not a good idea! If we keep this up, we might end up on the Soul Transmission Pagoda's blacklist.' Gu Yue said, 'That won't happen with me here.' Xie Xie praised, 'Boss, your acting skills are top-notch! That performance was stellar!' Tang Wulin replied irritably, 'You think I wanted that? That Battle Armor Master's strength is clear; a few Mech Armors wouldn't stand a chance against her. If we hadn't acted that way, being caught by the Soul Transmission Pagoda would have cost us precious time. We'll find a way to apologize later.' At the Sky Spirit Soul Transmission Pagoda. With a 'slap,' Yan Feng struck the metal table before her, sparks flying, 'Now you all realize, right? Those kids were nothing but frauds. It was them who attacked me first, wasn't it?' As the Enforcers reviewed the surveillance feed, they were rendered speechless. Yan Feng had barely broken free from the Mech Armors' siege when she noticed Tang Wulin's group had vanished. Fuming, she considered pursuit, but by then, the Enforcers' reinforcements had arrived—three Purple Mech Armors quickly surrounded her. Confronted by six Mech Armors, Yan Feng, as a Single-Word Battle Armor Master, had limited options. She could've broken out, but that would've confirmed her involvement in the day's events! Instead, she opted to surrender and was brought back to view the footage. 'We apologize, Miss Yan Feng. We've confirmed your identity. We regret our earlier actions; we never imagined these young ones could be so devious,' the Enforcers apologized. Yan Feng, boiling with rage, demanded, 'What are you waiting for? Bring them back now!' The leading middle-aged Enforcer hesitated, 'That's not possible. Though the Soul Transmission Pagoda holds a unique status, it's not part of the Federation's enforcement. If we dispatch forces to apprehend them, we risk overstepping our authority, which would harm us. We've notified the government; it's up to them now. Besides, our evidence is limited. Most importantly, you're uninjured. Even if we brought them back, there would be little we could do. At most, they could be charged with disturbing the peace and detained for a few days.' Yan Feng calmed down a bit. She wasn't injured, so pressing charges would be difficult. They seemed truthful about their ages, thirteen or fourteen, protected under the Minor Protection Law. Detention would be challenging; likely ending with a guardian's fine and a stern warning. Those little devils, utterly infuriating! 'Miss Yan Feng, please calm down. We apologize for this situation,' the Enforcers collectively said, bowing slightly to her. Yan Feng's anger subsided slightly at their gesture. She waved them off, 'Forget it. Just make sure I don't run into them again. I'm leaving if there's nothing else.' The Enforcers respectfully escorted her from the Soul Transmission Pagoda. As a Battle Armor Master affiliated with the Sky Spirit Soul Transmission Pagoda, they held her in high regard. She could well become their superior one day! Upon leaving the Soul Transmission Pagoda, Yan Feng scanned her surroundings, searching for Tang Wulin and his team, but they had disappeared without a trace. Then, her gaze fixed in one direction. There stood a young man, her age, tall and dressed in white. His attire was reminiscent of ancient times, a white robe draping his figure, long indigo-blue hair cascading down his back, exuding a cool aura. Yan Feng's martial soul was of the Fire attribute, which influenced her fiery temperament. Yet, upon seeing this man, the fire within her inexplicably cooled. He was incredibly handsome. She involuntarily swallowed. No girl could resist such a handsome man, especially one so well-proportioned and attractive. Moreover, at just a glance, Yan Feng was shocked to find she couldn't gauge his cultivation level. Yet, she was certain he was a soul master whose strength surpassed her own. Could he be an Ice-attribute soul master? As a Fire-attribute soul master, she was keenly aware of Ice attributes. Is he walking towards me? Yan Feng's heartbeat quickened. Initially unsure, she soon realized the man was indeed walking straight toward her. His pace was steady, though unhurried. His gaze met hers. Such clear eyes! So incredibly handsome! Yan Feng could see her reflection in his eyes, but she suddenly realized her appearance was less than ideal. Her clothes and hair were disheveled from the earlier scuffle. Slightly flustered, she attempted to straighten up. Despite her efforts to be discreet, her cheeks felt warm. 'Hello,' his voice was cool. Yan Feng's heart skipped a beat. His voice was pleasing, albeit cold, but it struck a chord. 'You, hello!' Yan Feng, facing the handsome figure mere steps away, found her voice quivering. 'My name is Wu Zhangkong.' The man in white nodded to her. 'Oh, I'm Yan Feng.' She blurted out her name instinctively. 'I deeply regret the trouble caused today. Those children are my students. They're undergoing a test—their academy's end-of-term exam. Hence, they've been seeking sparring partners, with no malicious intent. I apologize on their behalf.' Wu Zhangkong bowed slightly to Yan Feng. 'Oh, it's alright,' Yan Feng replied, her heart racing. But then, her pulse abruptly paused, her pupils dilated, and her voice rose an octave, 'What did you say? Those kids, they're... your students?' 'Yes,' Wu Zhangkong affirmed. Yan Feng's breathing quickened, 'So their unprovoked attack on me was at your instruction?' Wu Zhangkong remained impassive, 'That was not my directive, but as their teacher, I am willing to accept responsibility. You may hold me accountable.' 'You...' Yan Feng suddenly found herself at a loss for words, her anger dissipating. Wu Zhangkong nodded at her once more, 'I apologize again, goodbye.' Turning, he began to walk away. 'Hey!' Yan Feng called out. Wu Zhangkong stopped and looked back, 'Is there something else?' Yan Feng protested, 'Is an apology all there is? We're just going to leave it at that?' Wu Zhangkong asked, 'What more would you have me do?' Chapter Four Hundred and Forty: Invite Me for a Meal Yan Feng stated, 'An apology should be sincere, shouldn't it? At the very least, you ought to treat me to a meal.' As she voiced this sentiment, she blushed on her own behalf. Yet, having dedicated herself to cultivation well into her twenties without ever having had a boyfriend, Yan Feng now unexpectedly encountered an instance that made her question her disbelief in love at first sight. The man before her, exuding an aura of cool detachment, had captured her fancy with his striking appearance. His handsomeness alone was utterly captivating! 'Agreed.' Wu Zhangkong gave a nod, 'What would you like to dine on?' Yan Feng responded eagerly. 'Your choice.' Contemplation flickered in Wu Zhangkong's eyes before he finally said, 'Come with me.' He began descending the staircase, his back to her. Such an impressive figure he cut, Yan Feng thought, her heart fluttering as she hurried after him. The annoyance she had felt towards the younger students earlier seemed to fade in light of her newfound admiration for their dashing instructor. She had decided to forgive them – such is the whimsy of fate! Wu Zhangkong walked with an unhurried grace, Yan Feng following quietly in his wake. She refrained from speaking, finding simple pleasure in observing him, much like one would savor the view of a breathtaking landscape. As they passed by, Wu Zhangkong drew the gaze of women of all ages, drawing silent accolades for his striking looks. Yan Feng, with her acute hearing of a five-ringed Soul King, overheard numerous swooning whispers, though none as frequent as her own internal exclaims of his attractiveness. Turning into an alley, Wu Zhangkong halted before a modest establishment with a narrow frontage. Through the window, the intimate interior was visible – it housed merely four tables. The lunch hour was approaching, and the appetizing scent of stir-fried dishes emanated from within. Wu Zhangkong stood at the entrance, lost in thought, a rare softness touching his usually icy gaze. From the side, Yan Feng could see the transformation. 'Ah, Zhangkong! You've arrived! Please, come in.' A man with short hair and a stout frame, appearing to be in his fifties, greeted them warmly. He was evidently well-acquainted with Wu Zhangkong, draping an arm over his shoulder and guiding him inwards. Had Tang Wulin and others witnessed this, their astonishment would have been palpable. Notoriously fastidious, Wu Zhangkong showed no signs of irritation from the man's touch. Instead, he nodded amiably and proceeded inside. Yan Feng followed suit into the eatery. The diner was indeed quaint, with the cleanliness leaving something to be desired. Under ordinary circumstances, such a venue might earn a poor rating from Yan Feng for a date. However, with Wu Zhangkong as her companion, the small diner took on a charm of its own – reflective of his unique persona. The world can indeed be prejudiced in favor of the handsome! 'Zhangkong, it has been a while. Are you well?' the portly owner inquired as he seated them at a table by the bed. Wu Zhangkong settled into his seat with a familiar ease, 'All is well.' 'And this is your friend?' The owner now noticed Yan Feng. Yan Feng, though not conventionally beautiful, possessed a certain allure, especially in the bloom of her youthful prime. 'Hello.' Yan Feng greeted the owner with a smile and took her seat across from Wu Zhangkong. The owner's mouth hung open for a moment in apparent surprise. 'The usual, if you please.' Wu Zhangkong indicated with a nod. The owner recovered from his astonishment, 'Of course, the usual. I'll prepare it right away. It's wonderful to see you like this, Zhangkong!' With that, he scurried off to attend to the order. With the owner's departure, the fleeting warmth on Wu Zhangkong's face reverted to its customary frost. Yan Feng, seated across from him, could now scrutinize his features more intently. His eyelashes were indeed lengthy, and his eyes, strikingly beautiful. His nose was straight, his lips perfectly proportioned. What would it feel like to be kissed by him? What am I thinking! Yan Feng's cheeks flushed with the thought. 'Do you frequent this place?' she ventured. Wu Zhangkong's gaze, usually so distant, finally settled on her. 'I used to,' he replied. Yan Feng remarked, 'That explains the owner's familiarity with you.' 'Indeed.' 'Do you reside in Sky Spirit City?' she probed further. Wu Zhangkong shook his head. 'Then where might you be based?' Yan Feng inquired. 'Shrek,' was Wu Zhangkong's terse reply. Yan Feng asked, 'How old are you this year?' Wu Zhangkong paused, then shook his head, declining to answer. Yan Feng ventured a guess, 'Twenty-seven?' Wu Zhangkong gave no response. 'Incorrect? Then twenty-six? Surely not twenty-eight?' A slight furrow appeared between Wu Zhangkong's brows, 'Thirty-three.' 'Thirty-three?' Yan Feng exclaimed in surprise, 'You certainly don't look it. Your complexion is remarkable. Had it not been for your mature air, I would have assumed you were barely past your twenties. I myself am nearing twenty-seven, which makes you more than six years my senior.' 'Indeed.' Yan Feng queried, 'Are you always so succinct in conversation?' 'Indeed.' 'What about those disciples of yours? What kind of assessment are they undergoing?' Yan Feng continued. 'Final exams,' Wu Zhangkong responded. Yan Feng huffed, 'That leader, he's really something. Not only did he strike me, but he also had the gall to play the victim convincingly. Is that what you taught him?' Wu Zhangkong replied with a helpless expression, 'Not by my instruction.' 'Then who did teach him such tactics?' she pressed on. A trace of a smile flickered across Wu Zhangkong's face – a rare sight for Yan Feng. 'He is naturally gifted,' Wu Zhangkong conceded with a hint of resignation. Yan Feng advised, 'You must be careful in selecting disciples. Like nurturing a sapling, you, as a teacher, must ensure they grow upright, not astray.' Wu Zhangkong assured her, 'He has a good heart. That will not happen.' Yan Feng scoffed, 'I beg to differ. But enough about him. Tell me about yourself. Are you affiliated with an academy? Which one is it?' At that moment, the robust owner reappeared, announcing the readiness of their meal. A few humble yet hearty dishes were served: Candied Sweet Potatoes, Yu Xiang Pork Strips (a spicy garlic pork dish), Kung Pao Chicken, and a Clay Pot Tofu Soup. Three dishes and soup, accompanied by two bowls of rice. Yan Feng felt her hunger piqued; in her excitement, she had skipped breakfast. Despite its unassuming appearance, the restaurant's offerings were delectable, surpassing even some of the grandest hotels in taste. 'Please, help yourself,' Wu Zhangkong invited. Yan Feng eagerly began her meal, her first bite of Yu Xiang Pork eliciting a delighted widening of her eyes. 'This is truly exquisite. Who would have thought such a modest place could serve such tantalizing fare? It's delightful.' Wu Zhangkong commenced his meal at a more measured pace, his attention divided between the dishes and the memories they seemed to evoke, his eyes clouding over with a distant haze. He savored a morsel of Candied Sweet Potatoes, lost in the flavors and perhaps in reminiscence. 'You've yet to disclose which academy you represent,' Yan Feng pressed between bites. 'Shrek,' Wu Zhangkong stated plainly. 'Shrek Academy? Ah! Shrek Academy?' Yan Feng's grip on her bowl nearly slackened in shock. Her eyes fixed on Wu Zhangkong, her tone rising slightly, 'You, you're a teacher at Shrek Academy?' 'Is there an issue?' Wu Zhangkong glanced her way. Yan Feng's demeanor shifted, 'No, not at all.' Internally, however, she cheered, Perfect! Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-One: Yan Feng and Sky Ice His dashing appearance was impeccable, and his status as a teacher at Shrek Academy only augmented his ideal image. 'I've long aspired to join Shrek Academy! I tried their entrance exams but sadly didn't pass. It's regrettable; I could've been under your tutelage.' Wu Zhangkong replied with cool detachment: 'Not a chance. We would've been peers. You wouldn't have been my student.' Yan Feng felt slighted. 'Is this your idea of conversation? That's hardly the way to address a lady.' Wu Zhangkong continued eating in silence, only adding to Yan Feng's irritation. This man! Nevertheless, her curiosity soon overtook her discretion, 'You must be a Battle Armor Master since you teach at Shrek, correct? Single-Word or Two-Word?' 'Two-Word,' Wu Zhangkong responded succinctly. Yan Feng was visibly impressed. A Two-Word Master at only thirty-three was remarkable! It explained why she had been unable to determine his cultivation level. 'I've recently advanced to Single-Word Master status, and I've named my armor 'Feng.' Single-Word Masters typically choose a name with a single syllable, and I chose my own name. What about you? What are the names of your Battle Armor?' 'Sky Ice,' Wu Zhangkong stated. 'Such a melodious name. Why 'Sky Ice'? Your martial soul must be ice-related to warrant such a name,' Yan Feng speculated. Wu Zhangkong met her gaze, 'Sky is part of my martial soul's name, and Ice is my wife's name. We should eat now; it's customary not to talk during meals.' His wife's name? That revelation hit her hard. She should have known better; a man as outstanding as him was bound to be taken. A profound sense of loss overshadowed her hunger. The rest of their meal proceeded in quiet; Wu Zhangkong was scarcely eating, his mind awash with memories... 'Zhangkong, I can never get enough of this place's honey-glazed winter melon. Who knew eggs could be this delicious? I'll learn this recipe and make it for you at home, alright?' 'Hold on, leave some tofu for me! They say tofu does wonders for the skin. While my skin might be slightly smoother than yours, I still aim to improve it further.' 'This garlic pork stir-fry is perfect with rice. Maybe I could have another half bowl? Tell me, you don't think I'll put on weight, do you?' 'You're such a klutz, you've got rice all over you. No, I won't kiss it off. Stop, don't rub it off on me!' ... After vacating the diner, the sun was at its zenith. 'Thank you for the lunch,' Yan Feng said, still smiling. Wu Zhangkong shook his head, 'I should be on my way.' 'Might I have your Soul-Guided Communication Number? I'm heading to the Soul Transmission Tower to have them retract the accusations against your disciples. I'll let you know once it's settled.' Wu Zhangkong hesitated but eventually disclosed a sequence of numbers. 'Perhaps I could invite you for a meal at Shrek in the future?' Yan Feng suggested optimistically. Wu Zhangkong offered her a fleeting look, 'I need to leave. Farewell.' He then turned and strode away. Yan Feng's gaze lingered on his departing silhouette until it vanished, followed by a soft sigh. 'The good ones are always taken. When will I stumble upon someone like him? Sky Spirit City seems too confined. I should relocate to Shrek City; my rank as a Single-Word Master should open doors. I'll request a transfer through the Soul Transmission Tower.' Their Soul-Guided Vehicle thrummed down the highway, aiming for the subsequent city. With the Sky Spirit City debacle behind them, they had to divert their path through another city. Despite their brainstorming, they couldn't devise a quicker strategy than stirring up trouble at the Soul Transmission Tower and dealing with the Enforcers. They had no choice but to tread the old paths. Fortune isn't always consistent; it fluctuates. In the following cities, they faced little resistance and effortlessly accomplished their final exams. Their guise as Inspectors was foolproof, and after several cities, their mission was half complete. 'It's the fourth day. We need to accelerate our efforts. Let's aim for two successes today, and two more tomorrow, then we'll arrive in Mingdu. Mingdu's brimming with strong Soul Masters, given its status as the Federation's hub. We'll just need to be more discreet.' Tang Wulin analyzed the map and formulated a plan with his comrades. From initial anxiety to a growing sense of ease, their journey was proving to be an invaluable experience. Throughout their final exam, they had encountered and surmounted various challenges. The confrontation with Yan Feng had been the most trying, revealing the sheer power of a Battle Armor Master. As students of Shrek, they could have potentially subdued a Six-Ringed Soul Emperor with their combined might. Yet, against a Battle Armor Master, they were completely outclassed and unable to breach the defenses. 'Wulin, I'm aware of an ideal locale in Mingdu for our final exam,' Ye Xinglan interjected suddenly. 'Oh? Where might that be?' Tang Wulin inquired, intrigued. A glint of excitement shone in Ye Xinglan's eyes, 'There's a longstanding rivalry between that institution and our academy. Completing our final exam there would carry significant weight.' Tang Wulin's eyes sparkled with resolve, 'It's a sound proposal. I concur.' 'Then it's decided,' Ye Xinglan affirmed, her fists balled in anticipation. 'Before we get too carried away, let's address the immediate challenge,' Xie Xie cautioned, his voice laced with apprehension. Peering forward through the windshield, they were confronted with an alarming sight. The highway ahead was blockaded by a line of over twenty mech armors—five in purple, fifteen in yellow—forming an intimidating barrier. There were no halted Soul-Guided Vehicles, suggesting the mech armors had only just descended. The insignia on their chests confirmed their affiliation with the Aether Transmission Spire. After five rounds of exams, the Aether Transmission Spire had caught up to them at last. 'Wulin, what's our course of action?' Xie Xie braked sharply, seeking guidance from Tang Wulin with a sense of urgency. Tang Wulin's eyes narrowed, the prelude to his typical surge of resolve. 'Halt the vehicle!' he commanded. With an elbow strike of practiced might, he sent the door flying, seized the roof, and sprung out. His prompt decision broadcasted to his comrades the need for immediate action—they would not yield easily. Being apprehended wouldn't be too severe—probably just a penalty and an apology—but it could mean being returned to Shrek Academy in disgrace, threatening their final exam. No class leader in Shrek Academy's history had ever failed. Tang Wulin was adamant about not becoming the first, nor would he let his teammates face disqualification. Xie Xie stomped on the brake and twisted the steering wheel, directing the Soul-Guided Vehicle toward the guardrail. As formidable Soul Masters of Shrek Academy, even Xu Lizhi was safeguarded by Tang Sect's esoteric techniques. They ejected from the vehicle as it collided with the guardrail, scattering in every direction. Gu Yue clutched Xu Xiaoyan protectively, declaring 'Elemental Storm!' Upon their exit, Xu Xiaoyan's martial soul flared to life, her third soul ring igniting with a bright glow. Supported by Gu Yue's Elemental Tide, a fierce blizzard unfurled from her core. With forests and fields on either side of the highway, Tang Wulin bellowed, 'Into the woods, quickly!' He propelled his friends forward, yet he himself remained steadfast. The mech armors, noting their abrupt change in direction, soared skyward. Soul Guidance Cannons locked on to them, advancing at breakneck speed. Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Two: Omnipotent Gu Yue Although mech armor flight does involve an acceleration process, it is incredibly swift, a speed unmatchable by their current pace. Only by darting into the forest did they have a sliver of hope for escape. Moreover, Tang Wulin had another advantage: these mechs belonged to the Soul Transmission Tower, not to official authorities. Mechs from the Soul Transmission Tower would not dare to kill easily, as the order of the Federation must not be disrupted. Thus, Tang Wulin concluded that the goal of these mechs was to capture them, not to kill. With this assessment, he had some confidence in leading his companions to evade capture. Indeed, as the mechs that flew into the air retracted their Soul Guidance Cannons and approached bare-handed, the five leading purple Mech Armors sped toward them like lightning. Tang Wulin lightly tapped his toe, and soared into the air. The golden light flickered, and the Golden Dragon King's power erupted, his body swelling with scales emerging. His right arm suddenly enlarged, and his Battle Armor gauntlet materialized. In an instant, he elevated himself to the strongest combat state. With the sound of dragon chants within him, Tang Wulin took a deep breath, circled his hands in front of him, placed his left hand on the Battle Armor on his right forearm, and with a fierce shout, he swung a claw into the void. Reverse Blood Qi Circulation, Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens, Golden Dragon Terrifying Claw! He channeled all his soul power through his hands into the Golden Dragon Claw on his right hand, using Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens to activate his Golden Dragon Terrifying Claw. Before this final exam, he dared not do so, as his right hand's Golden Dragon Claw would feel overwhelmed, but with the continuous enhancement of his blood qi after stepping out, although he did not break through the Golden Dragon King's Fourth Seal, his body's tolerance had evidently strengthened. Five splendid claw shadows swept across the sky, chilling to the bone with a dark golden gleam at the edges and a brilliant gold at the back, vaguely showing dragon scale patterns. The five claw shadows were only five feet long when first swung, but they swelled against the wind. In a blink, they became massive shadows of dozens of meters. Despite becoming more ethereal as they expanded, they perfectly blocked the path of the five purple Mech Armors. The purple mech pilots were startled by this sight, as a soul master's attack range is proportional to their strength. The golden light on Tang Wulin was naturally assumed as Soul Rings, but since when were there golden Soul Rings? Coupled with such a vast control range of the claw shadows, their first reaction was to activate their protective barriers to the extreme and defend with all their might. 'Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom—' Five roars exploded in the air, and the five mechs were struck and flew backward. With the core force of the Golden Dragon Terrifying Claw hitting one of them, its protective barrier was filled with cracks, nearly shattering. From afar, the scene was undoubtedly shocking. Faced with twenty mechs, that small figure leaped into the air, with one claw, five purple Mech Armors were swept away — what a display of overwhelming might! Although the fifteen yellow mechs followed closely, seeing the five purple mechs blasted away by Tang Wulin, they hesitated for a moment, not daring to rush forward directly. The force that could send purple mechs flying could likely tear their mechs apart! Tang Wulin landed with a thud, his toes tapped the ground, and he flew backward, disappearing into the blizzard that had already formed behind him. A soft hand quickly grabbed his, pulling him along at high speed. The blizzard unleashed by Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan was beyond the existence of an ordinary millennium soul ring technique. Especially when they only sought to obstruct sight and detection, without considering attack strength, in just a moment, they had already covered hundreds of square meters. The blizzard raged in the air, with a tornado emerging, swirling with snowflakes, severely obstructing the mech pilots' vision. Tang Wulin's strike not only blocked their pursuit but also had a strong deterrent effect. The purple-ranked mech pilots also had no confidence that they could emerge unscathed in a one-on-one situation. Therefore, they did not dare to scatter to search but had to gather together, using the mechs' radar to find their targets. However, the methods to counter mech radars were already covered by Shrek Academy early on when they started school. The energy fluctuations within the blizzard were chaotic, making it almost impossible for radars to be effective. Tang Wulin was pulled forward as he ran. Suddenly, the ground beneath him gave way, his body sank, and before he knew it, he was back on solid ground, then plunged into darkness as the light suddenly disappeared. Then, a golden light shone, and he could finally see. They were in a not-so-large space, surrounded by dirt, with all his companions there, and the one who had grabbed his hand was Gu Yue. The golden light was shining from her hand. She released Tang Wulin's hand, and without a word, her eyes lit up, and she unleashed both her soul skills, Elemental Tide and Earth Element Control. At once, Tang Wulin felt the ground beneath him slowly sinking, and more astonishingly, the dirt above them began to close on its own, as if constantly swallowing them down. At this moment, the companions looking at Gu Yue were all in awe, even the proud Ye Xinglan's eyes sparkled with admiration. Earth Element Control was simply divine under these circumstances! The earth elements beneath the ground were undoubtedly the most abundant. Gu Yue used her cultivation to control the dirt, sinking them deeper, with the soil enough to block most scans. The farther from the surface, the less likely they were to be detected. Naturally, they were safe. As the saying goes, 'no road leads to heaven, no door leads into the earth,' but Gu Yue had opened that door for them. The Soul Transmission Tower's mech pilots could never dream that they could escape underground, and they had no way to pursue them, unless they had used the Soul Guidance Cannons for carpet bombing immediately. But these mech pilots were from the Soul Transmission Tower, and Tang Wulin and his comrades had not committed any grave sins, at most they were just causing trouble, so how could they make such a grand display? After a full ten minutes or more, Gu Yue, sweating from her forehead, finally stopped controlling the earth elements. 'Everyone, control your breathing, the air is thin underground,' Tang Wulin told his friends. They couldn't afford to escape the pursuit only to suffocate underground. 'It's fine,' Gu Yue said. She flicked her left hand, and a ball of water hung in mid-air, her right hand gently rubbed on the water ball, and it gradually shrank, making the air in this underground space much more comfortable. 'I learned from the teacher how to separate water elements, which can create the oxygen we need. There will be no problem for a short time.' 'Gu Yue, you are truly all-around amazing!' Xu Xiaoyan exclaimed in admiration. Gu Yue smiled faintly, 'Don't talk about this, they probably can't find us now. We'll go out later. But what do we do next? The Soul Transmission Tower is after us, and all the city towers must have received the message, they will be on high alert, our previous methods won't work. We need to change.' Tang Wulin's eyes narrowed slightly, 'The cities we're going to are all big cities. Big cities must have soul master academies. There won't be a lack of soul masters with cultivation higher than ours. We can do this...' His thoughts were still on the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy he had mentioned earlier. Since they couldn't go through the Soul Transmission Tower's route, that would do. A full hour later, Gu Yue controlled the soil to push them back up to the surface, and as expected, the mechs were gone, leaving no trace. But to their frustration, their vehicle was also destroyed and could not be driven. Tang Wulin had already checked the map. From their location, the next city was less than two hundred kilometers away. With no other choice, there was only one word for it — run! With Gu Yue's Wind Element Control and Xu Lizhi's Agile Steamed Bun, Tang Wulin carried a bit of Xu Lizhi, Ye Xinglan helped Xu Xiaoyan, and the six could only rely on their legs, following the path near the highway to the next city. Chapter 443: Challenging the Academy! For Tang Wulin, two hundred kilometers was but a minor stretch for his robust physique. However, for Xu Lizhi, even with the revitalizing effects of his Agile Steamed Buns and Bloodthirsty Red Bean Buns, the journey took its toll, leaving him visibly leaner. 'The Soul Transmission Tower!' Xu Lizhi muttered, his fist clenched not so much in anger but in a mix of exhaustion and a defiant resolve. 'And what will you do?' Gu Yue asked, a hint of mockery in her voice. Glancing at her, Xu Lizhi declared, 'They can forget about ever tasting my buns again!' Ye Xinglan couldn't help but retort, 'Such grand ambitions.' Tang Wulin pondered for a moment, 'Originally, we planned to cover two cities today. Now, it seems we must adjust to just one. Everyone, take a moment to rest. We'll seek out the academy this afternoon.' Settling into a modest inn, they quickly recovered, their resilient soul master constitutions accelerating their recuperation. Tang Wulin utilized this pause to inquire about the whereabouts of the local Soul Master Academy. Here in Sky Destiny City, and with Mingdu still some two thousand kilometers ahead, interspersed with several cities, they would need to complete their mission before they could board a soul-guided train westward. The academy in question was none other than the famous Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy, an institution that exclusively enrolled soul masters endowed with the gift of flight. Although the advanced institute specialized in cultivating elite soul masters, mech armor masters, and battle armor masters, the group agreed that a staunch focus on the latter wasn't necessary. Graduates typically left the advanced institute in their early to mid-twenties. At Shrek Academy, it was a rarity for someone to forge a Single-Word Battle Armor by that age, much less at other academies. 'We have found our mark!' Tang Wulin resolved. While the others rested, he felt reinvigorated. Borrowing a soul-guided communicator from the inn, he connected with a number he knew well. 'Master Uncle Zhentai,' Tang Wulin greeted, his voice filled with respect. 'Wulin, how is the final exam progressing? Smoothly, I hope?' came the gentle inquiry from Zhentai. Tang Wulin confessed, 'It's proving to be rather challenging, with a few unforeseen complications. I find myself in need of funds to continue with the exams. At present, I'm in Sky Destiny City. Without my blacksmith badge, I'm unable to take on forging tasks. Could you possibly intercede with the local Blacksmith Association on my behalf? I'd like to undertake a refinement forging or spirit forging assignment. Additionally, I need to borrow a forging hammer and plan to trade the finished product for travel expenses.' Zhentai's voice carried a hint of amusement, 'You're really in a bind, aren't you? Forego the forging. With your level of skill and your youth, it might attract unnecessary attention. I've made arrangements with the Sky Destiny Blacksmith Association to provide you with some funds instead.' 'Thank you, Master Uncle Zhentai,' Tang Wulin said, his gratitude apparent. He internally commended his generous uncle. Zhentai chuckled, 'There's no need for thanks; we're family, after all. Do visit the headquarters when you get the chance.' 'I most certainly will.' Tang Wulin assured him, already looking forward to the guidance from the divine craftsman and the enticing culinary delights that awaited him. After a visit to the Blacksmith Association, Tang Wulin rejoined his companions in the afternoon, now a million Federation coins richer. 'Shall we procure another vehicle?' Xie Xie suggested, a hint of eagerness in his voice. 'What are your thoughts?' Tang Wulin sought the consensus of his friends. Ye Xinglan contributed, 'A vehicle would indeed make things more convenient. It might not be as swift as the soul-guided train, but it would certainly ease our navigation within the city. The navigation system could save us considerable time.' 'Then let's purchase one!' With the newly acquired funds, they secured another vehicle of comparable size. Armed with Tang Wulin's researched address, they set their course for the Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy. The Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy, situated in the southwestern corner of Sky Destiny City, had a history spanning nearly two millennia. Although not as venerable as Shrek Academy, with its roots tracing back to the dawn of civilization, Destiny Skyreach Academy nonetheless had its own lengthy and storied past. The academy had nurtured numerous talents and maintained a close alliance with the military. In days past, when the military sought soul-guided masters, their preference leaned towards those with native flight capabilities. Soul-guided devices enabled soul masters to ascend the skies, yet those with innate flight abilities had a distinct advantage in aerial supremacy. The appearance of soul-guided devices had once significantly narrowed the gap between average soul masters and the exceptionally gifted. The advent of mech armors momentarily made the intrinsic strength of soul masters inconsequential in deciding the outcomes of combat. It wasn't until the emergence of battle armors that soul masters reclaimed their prominence. Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy prided itself on its specialization in training soul-guided masters, particularly those adept in flight. Consequently, their mech armor masters were renowned throughout the Federation, highly desired by military districts. With military support, the Academy had thrived and expanded rapidly. Even among second-tier institutions, it was considered a frontrunner, trailing only the ancient, prestigious academies. A modest soul-guided vehicle halted in an alley not far from the Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy. Six individuals in verdant sportswear alighted — green, the emblematic hue of Shrek Academy. Tang Wulin, the leader, donned the newly acquired sportswear. As they approached the grandiose academy gate, towering over twenty meters high and forty meters wide to accommodate mech armors, he exchanged a glance with Xie Xie, who unfurled a banner supported by two bamboo poles. The banner, ten meters wide, sported white fabric adorned with bold green lettering, perhaps not calligraphy but clearly legible nonetheless. Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi each took a pole, securing them into the ground. As students began their day, they were met with this unexpected sight, prompting a range of reactions from astonishment to curiosity. A passerby read aloud from the banner: 'From Shrek Academy, we challenge your strongest team under twenty.' Was this a declaration of challenge? Indeed, it was Tang Wulin's straightforward and bold strategy — simple, unrefined, direct, and efficient. Security was present at the Academy's entrance, and as the day was just beginning, students arriving were promptly met with this bold declaration. Their reactions varied from awe to confusion, anger, and curiosity. Soon enough, the academy's entrance was encircled by spectators. The name 'Shrek Academy' commanded the most attention — a moniker that signified legend to any student. Were students from the fabled Shrek Academy truly here issuing a challenge? A contest with the strongest team under twenty? They looked to be no older than fifteen. Tang Wulin stood at the forefront, stoic, convinced that the Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy could not refuse such a direct challenge. To do so would tarnish their reputation irreparably and deal a severe blow to their students' morale. 'Are you truly from Shrek Academy?' a young man, likely seventeen or eighteen, inquired of Tang Wulin, skepticism etched into his voice. Tang Wulin nodded, 'Hello, we are indeed from Shrek. We seek a friendly exchange and the opportunity to engage in a match with your esteemed academy.' The young man probed further, 'How can you prove you're from Shrek?' Tang Wulin responded with a slight smile as a glint of gold flashed in his eyes. A radiant surge of golden light erupted from beneath him, casting an awe-inspiring halo around him, drawing gasps from the crowd. Gold? What could a golden soul ring represent? Legends spoke of powerful soul spirits with orange rings, but a golden one? Golden soul rings were steeped in myth, rumored to be the sacred marks of the gods. Oblivious to the onlookers, Tang Wulin was not revealing an ordinary soul ring, but a 气血魂环, a rarity of immense power and significance. Tang Wulin knew well the predicament he faced. How could he prove his identity when every item of authenticity had been seized by the academy? He refrained from revealing his three purple soul rings, opting to unveil the golden ring for its profound impact — to command immediate attention and respect. The young man appeared taken aback, instinctively retreating a few steps. Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Four: Skyreach Starry Sky Academy At that moment, the grand gates of the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy swung open, revealing several figures who strode out. They appeared to be over forty years old, with the lead figure standing tall and robust, his streaks of gray hair standing proudly, exuding a vibrant spirit. Tang Wulin made no effort to conceal his gleaming Golden Soul Ring imbued with Blood Qi, and upon his emergence, it immediately caught the leader's eye, prompting a fleeting expression of astonishment. The man advanced a few steps before halting. "From Shrek Academy, are you? Are you members of its outer or inner court?" he inquired. "Outer court, first-year Class One, class president, Tang Wulin," was the response. This was not a mere spar like those sought at the Soul Transmission Tower—this was a formal challenge. "Class president?" The man's face registered greater surprise than when he had first seen Wulin's golden soul ring. "Please roll up your banners and come inside," he directed, stepping aside to provide them with passage. With a signal from Wulin, Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi promptly stowed the banner away. They had adhered to the necessary protocols; a confrontation at the gate would be improper. When issuing a challenge to an esteemed institution, maintaining decorum was essential. "Resume your studies now; there's no need to gather here," the middle-aged man declared, his commanding voice clearly holding sway within the academy. The students scattered like startled birds, heading back into the academy. Wulin and his companions followed the man into the academy, a venerable establishment with extensive grounds and refined ambiance, its pathways adorned with many intricate sculptures. "I am Li Zhilong, Director of Education at Skyreach Starry Sky Academy," the man introduced himself. "Our academy boasts a long-standing tradition as the foremost high-level soul master institution in Sky Destiny City, specializing in the training of flight-type soul masters, soul guidance masters, and mech armor pilots. We also host a graduate school dedicated to the cultivation of Battle Armor Masters. Are you here on behalf of Shrek Academy?" As Li Zhilong mentioned 'Shrek Academy,' Wulin felt a stir within him and opted for transparency. "Director Li, we are here not as representatives of our academy, but on personal initiative. This is a trial set by our academy, which commands us to seek out and engage in combat with adversaries who surpass our own might in various cities. Bereft of all identification and equipment, we found ourselves compelled to adopt this strategy, for which we ask for your understanding. We chose Skyreach Starry Sky Academy knowing full well that it stands as the pinnacle of education in Sky Destiny City and the entire northwest region." Gu Yue and Ye Xinglan exchanged glances with Wulin, their expressions tinged with puzzlement. When had he become so forthright? Was this a new side of him? Yet, Li Zhilong's reaction to Wulin's candidness proved even more unexpected. He let out a hearty laugh. "Ah, the audacity of youth is a hallmark of the prodigies nurtured by Shrek Academy. Your restraint from barging through our gates has already shown us respect. I remember, back in our day, an upperclassman undertook an academy mission that led him to single-handedly challenge a military encampment, causing quite the commotion." The words 'our Shrek Academy' elicited a collective startle from the group. Wulin, equally startled, asked, "You, too, are a Shrek Academy alumnus?" Li Zhilong's face lit up with pride. "Indeed, I am. Perhaps some fifteen classes before yours. Regrettably, I barely graduated from the outer court." Though he claimed it was a narrow success, his face betrayed no sign of struggle—only pride. Graduating from Shrek Academy was a source of immense pride in his life. Wulin returned the smile. "Then, we should address you as 'Senior.' Greetings, Senior Li. We apologize for any inconvenience. Should this be unsuitable, we will take our leave and seek alternative means to fulfill our final exam requirements." Li Zhilong dismissed the idea with a wave. "Why talk of leaving? You've come all this way. Besides, after the spectacle at our academy's entrance, if we don't present some form of resolution, I'll be hard-pressed to explain it to our students. Rest assured, I will find you worthy opponents—the strongest under-twenty team. I am also eager to gauge the disparity between our students and yours. It's been a long time since I last visited Shrek. Oh, how I miss the Spirit Ice Plaza! My greatest hope was to study by the Sea God Lake and enter the inner court. Alas, it was not to be." A wistful look clouded his eyes, filled with reminiscences. Wulin maintained his genial demeanor, his forthrightness having been a strategic choice, informed by the familiarity detected in Li Zhilong's initial gaze and the emotional shifts that followed whenever Shrek was mentioned. It was this insight that had prompted him to speak openly, resonating with the director's heart. The Skyreach Starry Sky Academy's main teaching building was an imposing edifice, a towering dome nearly a hundred meters high that rivaled the main building of Shrek Academy, albeit slightly smaller in scale. Li Zhilong led them to a lounge before inquiring, "You've come for a sparring match among soul masters, have you not? Will you be utilizing mechs?" Wulin quickly refuted the possibility, "No, sir. Would it be conceivable for the academy to sanction us to bring mechs under our current circumstances?" "Very well, take a moment to rest, have some water, and I will arrange the rest. We shall talk more later." "When did you become so forthright?" Xie Xie blurted out, barely containing his curiosity after Li Zhilong had departed. Gu Yue chimed in, "He must have noticed some connection. Director Li must share a history with our academy, hence Wulin's candor. Isn't that right?" Initially befuddled, she began to piece together the underlying dynamics as the conversation progressed. Wulin merely smiled, tapping his temple with a finger. Ye Xinglan emitted a disdainful snort. Wulin addressed them, "Prepare yourselves. The forthcoming exchange will be challenging. Though Director Li is our senior and has endorsed our examination, he now represents the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy. He will surely select their finest students for the match. Their expertise in flight will make for a demanding challenge. Let us proceed according to the plan we've discussed." Heads nodded in agreement as Wulin closed his eyes to focus. Shortly after, Li Zhilong returned. "Do you require a moment to adjust?" he inquired upon entry. Standing, Wulin replied, "No need, Senior Li. We have to travel to the next city to continue with our exam. The quicker we resolve this battle, the better for all of us." "As class president, you're not apprehensive about the prospect of elimination?" Li Zhilong teased with a wry smile. Wulin shook his head, "That's not my concern. Rather, I aim to amass as many points as possible to distribute among my classmates. My aspiration is for every member of our class to remain until the end." Li Zhilong's expression softened, touched by the sentiment. "Commendable indeed! You are truly a class president. With that, let us proceed." The group was surprised to find that the towering academic building lacked elevators, relying solely on spiraling staircases for ascent, designed to provide constant physical training. They climbed to the summit, entering an expansive hall that, to their amazement, was open to the sky above, unencumbered by a dome. "This is our academy's Astronomy Platform, a vital space for practical training. It spans a full three hundred meters, and since we specialize in nurturing flight-type soul masters, there are no height restrictions," Li Zhilong explained. "It's a magnificent sight," Wulin observed. "Gazing at the stars from here at night must be an incredibly beautiful experience." Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Five: The Stargazing Platform Li Zhilong smiled and said, 'Witnessing the stars here is effortless; shortly, you'll be in awe of them. Our Stargazing Platform is endowed with unique properties. Whether day or night, once activated, it draws us nearer to the cosmos, presenting a closer view of the stars. The platform's grand Soul Guidance Formation captures the astral forces from space, channeling the purest energy to aid our students' cultivation. Only our exceptional disciples are granted access at designated times for their training. It's predominantly a retreat for our postgraduate students to temper their bodies and Battle Armors with the quintessence of the stars.' Tang Wulin's astonishment was evident; the Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy indeed harbored extraordinary secrets. The impending match seemed daunting. But wait—astral forces? Starlight? He instinctively glanced at Xu Xiaoyan, who also seemed bewildered. 'Please familiarize yourselves with the ambiance. Our students will join you shortly.' The Stargazing Platform was encircled by a towering thirty-meter wall. Upon closer examination, the wall was adorned with elaborate patterns and glyphs, intricately crafted from rare metals. With Li Zhilong's introduction and their own heightened senses, they could detect the immense latent energy within the platform. Soul Guidance Formations have been integrated into daily life for many years, yet the quest to unlock their full potential has been inexhaustible. Increasingly complex formations have been developed, each with distinct functions. The military's vast formations are notably prevalent, essential to their defense systems. The formation before Tang Wulin was, without a doubt, the most elaborate and extensive he'd ever encountered. It made him wonder if Shrek Academy had something of equivalent grandeur. After all, it is the preeminent academy on the continent. As they absorbed the surroundings, a group of pupils appeared, dressed in the black uniforms of Destiny Soul Master Academy, each chest emblazoned with star-shaped embroidery. The silver stars denoted their cultivation level, with additional stars indicating higher Soul Energy. In the postgraduate phase, these silver stars would change to gold. The stars clearly signified the strength of each student. The six who arrived, all adorned with silver stars, were a mix of four men and two women, aged between eighteen to twenty. They regarded Tang Wulin's group with eyes reflecting curiosity. A single glance allowed Tang Wulin to estimate their capacities. The strongest sported forty-six silver stars, and the others also surpassed forty, aligning with the criteria for their challenge. From Shrek Academy, they were unfazed by higher-level adversaries. However, Tang Wulin was intrigued by the Stargazing Platform. Undoubtedly, Li Zhilong's decision to host the contest here was strategic. Li Zhilong, still wearing a warm smile, said, 'Let me introduce you all. These six are the elite students of Shrek Academy. And our six are the most exemplary of our students, up to the postgraduate level. Now, please introduce yourselves.' Tang Wulin nodded to the opposite group. 'I am the team captain, Tang Wulin, a Battle Soul Master specializing in offensive control.' A young man with a tall and lean stature stepped forward, returning the greeting with a smile. 'Hello, and welcome to Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy. I am the captain, Xiao Tian Tian. Interestingly, I also specialize in offensive control as a Battle Soul Master, just like you.' Their eyes met—both smiling, each gauging the other. Due to his age, Xiao Tian Tian was more elongated and slender than Tang Wulin, yet he couldn't discern any emotion in Tang Wulin's gaze. Gu Yue was concise, 'Gu Yue, an Offensive Battle Soul Master.' The second from Destiny Skyreach, a slim male, appeared unremarkable, yet he was the second most potent there, at Level 44. 'Ye Zishu, a Swift Attack Battle Soul Master.' 'Xie Xie, also a Swift Attack Battle Soul Master.' The third member of Destiny Skyreach was a towering figure, the most robust of the six. 'Jian Mochen, a Swift Attack Battle Soul Master.' Despite his build suggesting an Offensive Battle Soul Master, he was identified as Swift Attack—a curiosity. 'Ye Xinglan, an Offensive Battle Soul Master.' The fourth from Destiny Skyreach was a youth of average build but with a magnetic presence. With a faint smile, his voice resonated deeply with Tang Wulin's group, 'Zhang Xining, a Control Battle Soul Master.' 'Xu Xiaoyan, a Control Battle Soul Master.' Xu Xiaoyan's voice carried a trace of confusion as she introduced herself. The fifth member of Destiny Skyreach was a petite and beautiful girl who giggled, 'I'm Li Yaoyao, an Offensive Battle Soul Master.' 'Xu Lizhi, a Gastronomic Tool Soul Master,' The last student from Destiny Skyreach was a woman with both a striking appearance and figure, her demeanor exuding gentleness yet fortitude. 'I'm Han Yushang, a Control Battle Soul Master.' Another specialist in control? As the introductions concluded, Tang Wulin grew more cautious. Their captain, Xiao Tian Tian, was a Battle Soul Master focused on offense and control, and they had two additional pure Control Battle Soul Masters. Only six people—half were dedicated to control. What did that imply? Moreover, given the distinctive traits of Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy, all six were flying soul masters, now poised to compete on their specialized field, all above Level 40. This promised to be quite the confrontation. Tang Wulin glanced at Gu Yue, who caught his gaze and returned it. They shared a quiet nod, an unspoken agreement between them. 'The teacher in charge of the Stargazing Platform will activate the barrier shortly. This is a friendly match, so exercise restraint,' Li Zhilong instructed, his voice imbued with eager anticipation. He took pride in being a Shrek Academy alumnus, but the prospect of his proteges outshining those from Shrek thrilled him even more. Although Tang Wulin's team was young, his role as class president symbolically embodied Shrek. Victory in this match wouldn't just address an age difference; it would also herald a milestone for Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy. Which academy had ever vanquished a younger team from Shrek? The teams retreated to their respective positions, adhering to the rule of a minimum one hundred-meter distance before the battle's commencement. As they positioned themselves, Tang Wulin's eyes gleamed with a resolute light. Those familiar with him understood that the greater the pressure, the more his fighting spirit ignited, unleashing his potential. The six adversaries before him were formidable, indeed. But were they as formidable as the top five young geniuses of their time? Having overcome even martial soul fusion techniques, Tang Wulin was confident that even here, in this specialized arena, they could still triumph. This was the indomitable spirit of Shrek. They stood not just for themselves, but for the glory of Shrek! In a triangular formation, Tang Wulin led the way, with Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan at his heels. Gu Yue, Xu Xiaoyan, and Xu Lizhi were at the back. The Destiny Skyreach team, however, seemed indifferent to strategic positioning, simply aligning side by side. A six-on-six team battle would test the individual strengths and the synergy between teammates. 'Ready!' Li Zhilong took on the role of the match referee. A resonant hum pierced the air as the walls encircling the Stargazing Platform blazed to life. Patterns that had lain dormant now seemed animated under the glow, which surged skyward, converging into beams that joined and erupted into a massive column reaching for the heavens. Such was the grandeur of the Stargazing Platform. Tang Wulin felt the energy fluctuations around him. The sky was swiftly eclipsed; the golden daylight receded, yielding to an endless nocturnal canvas sprinkled with stars that felt tantalizingly close. Enigmatic and pristine energy descended, cloaking the entire platform. Tang Wulin saw that each of the six opponents was enveloped in a faint golden aura, their presences subtly bolstered. Clearly, in this environment, they had the upper hand. 'Hmm?' A soft sound emanated from behind him. Turning, Tang Wulin was greeted by an astonishing sight. A brilliant golden light erupted from behind him. The golden mist rose, nearly veiling the figure nearby from view. 'Xiaoyan,' Tang Wulin whispered her name with a mix of wonder and concern. Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Six: I'm Perfectly Fine, It's Wondrous "I'm unscathed. I'm perfectly fine; this feeling is wondrous!" Xu Xiaoyan's voice trembled lightly, yet it clearly quivered with excitement. The referee for this match, Li Zhilong, was somewhat surprised. He was the most familiar with the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, a place where students could hone their bodies by absorbing Astral Force, effective only for soul masters possessing flight-type martial souls. This platform was the very foundation of the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy. Engaging in combat here naturally amplified one's soul power, and the recovery speed was substantially greater than in the external world. But what about that girl from Shrek Academy? Could that be her true martial soul? Students varied in their sensitivity and absorption capacity towards Astral Force. The more attuned they were with the Astral Force, the more pronounced the Astral Force fluctuations would appear on the platform. The faint golden halo that Tang Wulin previously observed was indicative of this, and within the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, only a select few students could physically manifest Astral Force, a state not visible on most students, where a vague golden mist was the manifestation. The golden mist surrounding Xu Xiaoyan had almost materialized, so much so that even Li Zhilong, who was well-acquainted with the place, couldn't decipher the changes occurring within her. "Begin!" Following Li Zhilong's thunderous shout, the confrontation between six first-year students from Shrek Academy and the strongest under-twenty team of Skyreach Starry Sky Academy commenced. From Shrek Academy's side, three figures dashed out as quick as lightning. Tang Wulin attracted the most attention, stamping his left foot on the ground and propelling forward like a cannonball, his velocity astonishing. At the moment of his launch, his martial soul also emerged, with three dazzling purple soul rings, and a swarm of Blue Silver Grass vines sprouted forth. Yet, it was challenging to recognize these as Blue Silver Grass, with their translucent blue vines marked with gold, and upon closer examination, one could discern faint scale-like patterns on their surface. Advancing with him were Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan. Xie Xie moved with a lightness, lacking Tang Wulin's brute force, but matching his speed. Ye Xinglan's velocity was so rapid it was almost invisible. All three, each adorned with the luminescence of three soul rings, were like three swift arrows, charging towards their opponents. The six students from the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy responded in unison; they jumped and ascended at the same time. Xiao Tian Tian leaned slightly forward, and a surge of dark red light burst from him, his eyes also turning a deep crimson. Wings akin to those of a bat spread from his back, and with a powerful flap, he rocketed skyward. His four purple soul rings shimmered, radiating an awe-inspiring aura. As he released his martial soul, his initially slender frame began to expand, growing more robust. What kind of martial soul was this? Tang Wulin took a moment to recognize it. Next to Xiao Tian Tian, Ye Zishu was particularly unusual. He brought his hands together in front of him, and a beam of yellow light shone, remarkably transforming into a lengthy bamboo stick. Then, as his second soul ring flickered, the bamboo gently swayed, and a multitude of bamboo leaves took flight, gathering behind him into a pair of wings. With a push from the stick on the ground, he vaulted and soared. His flight was ethereal, more like a tuft of cotton floating upwards than actual flight. Gu Yue let out a sound similar to an eagle's call, and a set of wings unfolded, his hair now noticeably adorned with feathers. With a flap, he surged into the heavens determinedly. His martial soul was the Skyscraper War Eagle! Zhang Xining also had a set of wings, but compared to Gu Yue's, his were significantly smaller and more agile. With a light flap of his white wings, he glided up, hiding behind Gu Yue as if he were a little bird that had been startled. What left Tang Wulin agape was Li Yaoyao. As this seemingly delicate and lovely young woman ascended, an intense blaze surrounded her. Subsequently, her entire skin turned dark, and her arms each solidified into what seemed like boulders, with flames propelling her upwards. Among the six who had flown up together, she was the quickest. What kind of martial soul was that? It was truly an eye-opener from a flight martial soul academy. Finally, Han Yushang was somewhat more typical. The wings she unfurled resembled those of a colorful butterfly. With a soft flutter, she ascended elegantly. Indeed, all six were capable of flight! For soul masters with more than three rings, a hundred meters was merely a matter of a few breaths. As Tang Wulin and his team thrust forward fifty meters, Tang Wulin suddenly leaped, landing on his feet and using the momentum to heave a trailing Blue Silver Grass vine forcefully. Pulled by the Blue Silver Grass, a silhouette shot up like a missile, heading straight for the six from the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, who had already risen at least thirty meters into the air. It wasn't just him who stopped. Ye Xinglan and Xie Xie also ceased their advance, leaping towards Tang Wulin. He spread his arms, grabbing their waists, and his body began to spin on the spot. After three swift rotations, he flung them out, and both Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan ascended. Lacking flying martial souls themselves, they couldn't halt the ascent of their adversaries from a hundred meters away. However, they could intercept them mid-air before they reached an untouchable altitude. The one Tang Wulin first hurled into the air was none other than Xu Lizhi, whose robust figure was now coiled into a ball, resembling a meatball-shaped projectile, aimed towards Skyscraper War Eagle Gu Yue and his protectee, Zhang Xining. Control-type battle soul masters were always more challenging than assault-type counterparts, a fact Tang Wulin firmly believed in. That's why he sought to neutralize the control-type battle soul masters among the enemies first. Xie Xie, catapulted into the fray, aimed for Butterfly Wing Han Yushang, while Ye Xinglan targeted the opposing team's captain, the formidable Xiao Tian Tian. The trio dispersed in three directions, and just this act alone showcased Tang Wulin's immense strength and control prowess. A careful observation would reveal that although they were airborne, each of their waists was coiled with a Blue Silver Grass vine. Tang Wulin's position was right at the core of the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy. A barrage of fireballs erupted, each with a diameter of more than a foot, trailing brilliant tails of fire, bombarding Ye Zishu and Li Yaoyao. Tang Wulin's plan was simple. He aimed to block the opponents as quickly as possible, with Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan providing remote support from the ground, while he coordinated from the center, always ready to launch assaults. He did not anticipate defeating the opponents outright but intended to eliminate a portion of them. Next would be a war of attrition. Although flying soul masters held certain advantages over standard soul masters, the soul power expenditure while flying was significantly higher than that of a soul master standing on solid ground. Therefore, Tang Wulin was not daunted by the possibility of the opponents remaining high above, out of reach. The first engagement occurred on Xu Lizhi's front. He was the initial one propelled by Tang Wulin, and with the thrust of the momentum and Tang Wulin's formidable arm strength, he was unquestionably much faster than those who relied on wings to fly. Gu Yue had just reached his prescribed altitude when an enormous meatball-like figure from the opposition charged directly at him. Behind him, the first soul ring on Zhang Xining illuminated, and a piercing trill filled the air. His voice was truly melodious, enchanting, and lingering. His martial soul was the Hundred Spirits Bird, and as a flyer, he commanded his foes with his voice. His primary soul skill was deceleration—to weaken the opponent. Yet, his slowing ability had no immediate effect on Xu Lizhi. After all, Xu Lizhi wasn't flying through his power but was launched by Tang Wulin. Gu Yue, as a leading student of the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, reacted swiftly. His first soul ring lit up, and he flapped his wings vigorously forward, with dozens of eagle feathers transforming into arrows, targeting Xu Lizhi. In aerial combat, the skill to attack from a distance was essential, as it was easy for the combatants to create a gap between them. The eagle feathers sliced through the air, producing a series of 'pupu' sounds. Unfortunately for Gu Yue, what he was unaware of was that his opponent was from the Tang Sect. What was the cornerstone of the Tang Sect at its foundation? Hidden weapons! In mid-air, the previously balled-up Xu Lizhi suddenly stretched out, his hands forming a circle in front, his face still wearing a simple smile, his chubby palms glistening like jade. The eagle feathers, as though pulled into a vortex, converged inward and were effortlessly snatched in his hands. Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Seven: The Disparity Xu Lizhi extended his hands forward, transitioning from Dragon Grasp to Crane Control, as a volley of tenacious and sharp Eagle Feathers shot forth. Propelled by his rich soul power and amplified by the Tang Sect's secret technique, Celestial Flower Scatter, the feathers sped toward the Hundred Spirits Bird Soul Master, Zhang Xining, with even greater velocity than before. Meanwhile, Xu Lizhi had already reached Gu Tianming. Confronted with Xu Lizhi's towering presence, Gu Tianming realized he could no longer protect Zhang Xining. His second soul ring glowed, his Eagle Wings doubling in size in an attempt to intercept the Eagle Feathers while simultaneously preparing his second soul skill, Eagle Wing Strike! However, Xu Lizhi simply smiled and mockingly waved at him, halting his forward momentum mid-air as a burst of icy radiance shot forth like a myriad of frozen arrows, gracefully bypassing Gu Tianming, and homing in on Zhang Xining. This was Xu Lizhi's true lethal move; the initial Eagle Feathers were merely a clever feint. Before the Eagle Wing Strike could connect, Xu Lizhi swiftly retreated, his smile unwavering as he waved to Gu Tianming. It was too late for Gu Tianming to assist Zhang Xining. Although many of the Eagle Feathers were blocked, a few still reached their target. Zhang Xining, a pure controller with a sound-based martial soul, had nearly no offensive capabilities but unparalleled control powers. Caught off guard, he flapped his wings desperately to dodge but was still nicked by several feathers, leaving behind cuts. Just as he thought he had dodged the worst, a vast expanse of icy light appeared before him. Hundreds of steel needles, each imbued with dense soul power, covered all his possible escape routes. Inescapable! A sigh echoed in his ear, followed by a series of 'ding ding' sounds as he plummeted from the sky. "Zhang Xining, eliminated," Li Zhilong's voice was tinged with helplessness. However, there was no choice but to intervene. With just one exchange, they had lost a key control-type warrior with no flight-type soul master to counter. Shrek Academy, indeed a breeding ground for prodigies. Zhang Xining's face flushed with embarrassment, indignation filling his heart. But in the unforgiving arena of competition, discontent could not change the outcome. Xu Lizhi landed beside Tang Wulin, who used Crane Control to skillfully redirect the momentum and place Xu Lizhi by his side. Xu Lizhi's hand was already offering a restorative meat bun to Tang Wulin, who bit into it and quickly consumed it. Meanwhile, Xie Xie ascended, closing in on Han Yushang. Swift attack-types like him have an advantage over controllers, and once in close quarters, turning the tide was nearly impossible. Yet, Han Yushang remained unusually composed. Her second soul ring flared, but no visible change occurred. She seemed to manipulate unseen strings in front of her, then gently tapped her wings behind her. Xie Xie experienced a distorted reality, the world abruptly appearing in black and white, followed by the sensation of something shattering. Han Yushang seemed within reach, his Light Dragon Dagger slicing through air but only hitting an illusion. A faint pain on his shoulder, and he began to fall. To the observers, Xie Xie seemed to lash out inexplicably at thin air, while Han Yushang, with a tap of her Butterfly Wings, soared skyward. A chill ran down Tang Wulin's spine. Mental Control System! Xie Xie's errant strike could only mean he was ensnared by Han Yushang's illusion. She was more than a flight-type martial soul; she possessed a mental control-type martial soul as well. As Xie Xie fell, a dazzling burst of firelight erupted, not from a fireball by Gu Yue but from the swiftly ascending Li Yaoyao. It was challenging to discern the glow of her soul ring, but her entire form seemed to coil up in midair, then transformed into a meteor plummeting toward earth, targeting Xie Xie with incredible speed and fierce momentum. What kind of martial soul was this? A Meteorite? Xie Xie, a swift attack-type soul master, was vulnerable during his fall. Swift attack-types are known for their lower defenses. As Xie Xie began to fall, Li Yaoyao, having shattered one of Gu Yue's fireballs, charged at him. Their practiced synergy was evident. Tang Wulin's Blue Silver Grass wrapped around Xie Xie's waist, pulling him sideways through the air, narrowly evading Li Yaoyao's meteoric assault. Yet, Li Yaoyao did not relent in her descent; she continued her ferocious dive, with Tang Wulin now in her crosshairs. The linchpin of Shrek Academy's team was unmistakably Tang Wulin. Offensive Control System. Tang Wulin, seemingly oblivious to Li Yaoyao's approach, tugged on the Blue Silver Grass entwining Xie Xie's waist and shook it with force. Xie Xie's descent stopped abruptly, and as he was propelled back into the air, his target remained the Butterfly Soul Master, Han Yushang. Ye Xinglan and Xiao Tiantian clashed in the sky. Ye Xinglan, her form fused with her sword, shot towards Xiao Tiantian like a piercing cold star. Xiao Tiantian's body surged with starlight, his massive figure extending his wings to their fullest. With both hands, he shot a blinding dark-red fireball at Ye Xinglan, blocking her path. The Sword Deity Star shone, transforming into streams of golden light, akin to countless stars bursting forth. A soft golden aura enveloped Ye Xinglan, making the Circumpolar Constellation seem to brighten with her presence. The dark-red fireball disintegrated, and her sword's edge reached Xiao Tiantian in an instant. Xiao Tiantian was taken aback; he hadn't anticipated Ye Xinglan could also harness the Strength of Starlight for an attack, and it was clearly more in sync than his own. His third soul ring shimmered, and horns emerged from his forehead. A dark-red electric net exploded outwards from his center, turning him into a colossal electric sphere in a split second. "Ding!" The Star God Sword was deflected, and Ye Xinglan, with no leverage in the void, seemed set to fall. But at that moment, she lifted the Star God Sword, her third soul ring glowing. A dazzling light surged, and her body, defying gravity, shot upwards like a comet piercing the sky. Li Zhilong watched, somewhat dumbfounded. He recognized that Ye Xinglan's martial soul must be tied to the stars; without that connection, she couldn't manipulate starlight so fluidly. A foreboding feeling settled in. As Tang Wulin shook the Blue Silver Grass to help Xie Xie rise, Li Yaoyao, now a meteorite, was upon them. The thunderous momentum, her solid form, and the scorching flames highlighted her explosive attack power. Facing such a meteorite, Tang Wulin raised his right hand, golden scales surging, revealing the Golden Dragon Claw. Clasping his claw into a fist, the Force of Vitality within him surged in reverse, a golden radiance rising around him. This wasn't power borrowed from the starlight but the physical manifestation of his vitality swelling to its zenith. "Boom—" Tang Wulin stood firm, unyielding, as Li Yaoyao, transformed into a meteorite, halted abruptly before his fist. In that moment, time on the Astronomy Platform seemed to stand still. The violent roar captured everyone's attention. Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Eight: At This Moment, The Stars Shine Brightly Li Yaoyao's attacks were renowned for their ferocity, her Martial Soul being the extraordinary Meteorite. Although incapable of true flight, she could soar skyward with the propulsion of her Martial Soul's tail flame and plummet down with devastating force upon her foes. Each of her Soul Skills enhanced this method of attack. At her current strength as a Four-Ringed Soul Sect Leader, her full-powered impacts could exceed three thousand kilograms of force. Even if the initial strike didn't subdue her opponent, she could vault skyward for another onslaught, a tactic that instilled fear in her adversaries. Her defenses were as formidable as a meteorite's crust, making her the ace of their group, the omnipresent warrior capable of altering her trajectory mid-descent. However, against Tang Wulin, her prowess proved ineffectual; he didn't even attempt to evade. The severe collision left both warriors motionless. What was this anomaly? Li Zhilong moved closer, poised to assist either combatant should the need arise. In an instant, his pupils constricted. Centered around Tang Wulin's Golden Dragon Claw, minuscule fractures appeared on the Meteorite, quickly spreading to every inch. The Meteorite crumbled with a thunderous crash, and Li Yaoyao, with a delicate cry, collapsed from within its core. A tendril of Blue Silver Grass swiftly entwined her, binding her securely. Li Yaoyao's complexion turned ghostly pale, her body writhing in agony from the intense collision, yet the shock in her heart surpassed the physical trauma she endured. How was it possible? A single hand had stopped her mightiest blow! Tang Wulin shook his right hand, feeling a tingle of numbness—the impact was indeed formidable. He mused, 'Is that the best they can do?' Another one down! A second contender from Skyreach Starry Sky Academy had been defeated. Tang Wulin looked to the heavens as Ye Xinglan's third Soul Skill, the Stargod Sword's Descent, fell from above. Illuminated by the Circumpolar Constellation around the Astronomy Platform, her Starfall was akin to a meteor chasing the moon, the most powerful she had ever unleashed since Wulin had known her. The Strength of Starlight proved invaluable, especially in empowering allies. Xiao Tiantian's fourth Soul Ring ignited, and suddenly, his presence stilled, his face obscured, leaving only his blood-red eyes visible. An abyssal aura surrounded him. With a forceful motion, he drew a circle in midair, unleashing a surge of black energy that formed a vortex overhead. Starfall plunged into the vortex, which trembled violently. The next instant, Xiao Tiantian vanished, and Ye Xinglan with him. What had just happened? Was this a spatial technique? No, there were no fluctuations of spatial elemental energy. In the wake of Tang Wulin's shock, a dark red luminescence flashed, and Xiao Tiantian reemerged in the air, but Ye Xinglan was absent. What kind of Soul Skill was this? Xiao Tiantian spread his wings, diving rapidly, his form changing as he targeted Gu Yue. Clapping his hands into the void, a dark red glow erupted in front of Tang Wulin, resembling a black hole poised to devour him. Concurrently, countless green shadows descended from above—these were bamboo leaves, twisting and turning in the air, like arrows raining down, blanketing the field and obscuring Ye Zishu's figure. Amongst the multitude of bamboo leaves, seven shimmered with a golden hue, drawing in the surrounding starlight. His Martial Soul, the Seven Ingenious Star Bamboo, grew more versatile with each new Soul Ring, one such evolution being the gift of flight. The seven star-infused bamboo leaves were his most formidable attack, his fourth Soul Skill. The battle had only been underway for a short time, yet two of their team had already fallen. The six from Shrek Academy, though lesser in cultivation, each wielded a solid foundation and extraordinary combat prowess. Without unleashing their full power now, they would have no chance. Therefore, as Xiao Tiantian unleashed his power, so did he. Elsewhere on the battlefield, Gu Tianming, the Skyscraper War Eagle, spread his wings wide, hurtling towards Xie Xie in the sky and sheltering Han Yushang, the Butterfly Soul Master. Han Yushang's fourth Soul Ring lit up, her butterfly wings abruptly doubling in size, flapping mightily towards Tang Wulin. Butterfly Wings, the moniker of her fourth Soul Skill. Tang Wulin felt as though a Sea of Consciousness had materialized before him, its waves battering his mind with relentless intensity. This onslaught was no mere control; it was a formidable spiritual assault. He quickly realized that Han Yushang's spiritual power must have reached the Spirit Sea Realm, on par with Gu Yue's level. Since Tang Wulin's spiritual power had approached the Spirit Sea Realm threshold, it had ceased to progress. The Spirit Sea Realm was a monumental barrier in spiritual cultivation, and he had been tirelessly cultivating his Mysterious Heaven Technique, anticipating a breakthrough. He was certain that, by the time he unraveled the Golden Dragon King's Fourth Seal, he would also transcend into the Spirit Sea Realm. Presently, the immense spiritual waves that surged towards him caused his head to ache intensely, and Xiao Tiantian's assault was already imminent. A golden halo enveloped Tang Wulin, revealing the Golden Dragon Body. He was shrouded in a sheath of golden light, covered in expansive golden scales, etched with elaborate patterns, his vitality surging forth. He suddenly crouched down, hugging his knees, coiling into himself. Xie Xie's figure, ethereal in the sky, hurled his Light Dragon Dagger with a blinding slash of light, aiming for the Skyscraper War Eagle, Gu Tianming. His silhouette flickered incessantly in the void, dancing on air. Gu Tianming, thrown off by the elusive foe, managed to block the Light Dragon Dagger with his wing. Almost instantly, Xie Xie was upon him, and a burst of gold emerged from his underarm. Gu Tianming felt a tightening grip, ensnared in a golden snare. Xie Xie retracted his Light Dragon Dagger, repelling the winged assault, and with that force, he leaped upwards, executing an aerial somersault. His dagger traced radiant arcs, his form weaving in and out of existence. The golden radiance that bound Gu Tianming rapidly climbed, and as he grappled with Xie Xie's swift onslaught, he couldn't contend. Xie Xie's attacks were exceedingly fast, ghostlike in their precision, invariably striking where Gu Tianming was most vulnerable. The unyielding tempo left him breathless. Eventually, the golden radiance ensnared one of his wings, and Xie Xie, spinning in the air, commanded a Light Dragon Storm, overwhelming Gu Tianming as they descended from the heavens. After dispatching the Butterfly Wings at Tang Wulin, Han Yushang pivoted to assist Gu Tianming, but he was already under Xie Xie's control. She prepared a spiritual attack against Xie Xie when suddenly, a profound sense of peril emerged within her, her body plummeting abruptly. An unseen edge grazed by her. Han Yushang was startled. "Don't move!" A steady hand now encircled her waist from behind, a chilling breath on her neck. "Your spiritual power is strong, and I'm uncertain if I could withstand your spiritual assault. But I am certain of this—if I falter, I'm bound to leave some marks on your neck, or perhaps inadvertently, on your lovely face. So, let's descend calmly, shall we?" Han Yushang had never been so intimately close to anyone; her lovely face blushed with mortification, rendering her incapable of initiating any spiritual attack. Overwhelmed by a mix of anger and embarrassment, she could only gently beat her wings and descend. Xie Xie, through his sole efforts, had vanquished two more foes. Meanwhile, Tang Wulin remained coiled, weathering the storm of attacks. The bamboo leaves descended, targeting Tang Wulin, Gu Yue, Xu Lizhi, and Xu Xiaoyan, who had remained still but was bathed in resplendent golden light. The seven golden leaves, hidden among the throng, each zeroed in on their targets. Gu Yue remained composed as a tempest erupted around her, deflecting the bamboo leaves. A glint of silver, and she evaded Xiao Tiantian's lunge, reappearing beside Xu Xiaoyan. As for Xu Lizhi, being in Tang Wulin's proximity, she assumed he required no additional protection. As Gu Yue was about to unleash her abilities to safeguard Xu Xiaoyan, she detected a peculiar energy fluctuation and spun around in astonishment, only to hear Xu Xiaoyan's soft voice. "Stars, shine in all your splendor!" Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Nine: Stellar Mutation The Starwheel Ice Staff, gleaming with captivating brilliance, was raised high above Xu Xiaoyan's head. In an instant, countless beams of starlight burst forth. The intense starlight, in harmony with the Zhou Tian Xing Dou, swiftly filled the Stargazing Platform. Every bamboo leaf vanished beneath the radiant starlight, leaving behind only seven golden bamboo leaves suspended midair, motionless. It wasn't just the leaves; Xiao Tiantian, who had missed his mark, Ye Zishu still aloft, Gu Tianming, grounded by Xie Xie's Golden Words Entwining, and Han Yushang, the Butterfly Soul Master descending with Xie Xie's Shadow Clone, were all enveloped in golden light. The figures in the sky, in the next moment, descended rapidly, transitioning to a free fall. Those on the ground found themselves completely immobilized. For that brief instant, the entire world seemed bathed in gold. Xu Xiaoyan, shrouded in starlight, appeared like a goddess incarnate, with flecks of golden light weaving a breathtaking radiance around her. A pattern, identical to the one on the top of her Starwheel Ice Staff, had mysteriously appeared on her forehead. As the starlight shone with commanding presence, the light seemed to soften, as if in acknowledgment of its sovereign. The patterns of the entire Stargazing Platform's formation lit up, the stars in the heavens regained their brilliance, and a deluge of starlight madly surged toward her. Xu Xiaoyan, light as a feather, floated upward, with the starlight converging rapidly toward her. Tang Wulin, having regained his footing, was rendered speechless by the sight. He didn't forget to move forward, subduing the golden Xiao Tiantian with a swift motion, and catching Ye Zishu with a tendril of Blue Silver Grass to prevent him from harm as he descended from the sky. Xie Xie's Shadow Clone, with Han Yushang in tow, rolled on the ground to cushion their landing, standing firm. They, too, looked up at the strange phenomenon unfolding above. Everyone could sense it—Xu Xiaoyan's essence was transforming, undergoing a fundamental change. Martial Soul Mutation! Indeed, only such a mutation could trigger these intense energy flares and the spectacle unfolding before them. Moreover, her current state indicated a positive change, a remarkably beneficial one. Li Zhilong stood stunned; such a turn of events in the match was beyond his expectations. Even without Xu Xiaoyan's outburst, the match's outcome was clear. Neither Xiao Tiantian's attacks nor Han Yushang's psychic strikes had inflicted significant damage on Tang Wulin. In terms of endurance, Tang Wulin was unmatched among all present. Having withstood even Yuanen Yehui's powerful assaults, the current skirmish seemed trivial by comparison. The talents from the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, though strong with their four-ring capabilities, were not a match for Yuanen Yehui. If Yuanen were here, he could have single-handedly crushed the entire opposing team. The Stargazing Platform, which Tang Wulin had feared, ended up being the catalyst for Xu Xiaoyan's transformation. Flickers of light danced across the sky as Ye Xinglan reemerged, suspended in the air. Bathed in starlight, her form radiated a golden glow, with the Stargod Sword in her grasp shining with a splendor akin to the stars themselves. She was absorbing the starlight, albeit in smaller amounts compared to Xu Xiaoyan, and her body gently descended to the earth. She sat down cross-legged on the ground and began to meditate. Opportunities like this were fleeting, and the students of Shrek Academy never lacked the acumen to seize them. The golden hues on the students from the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy slowly faded, restoring their mobility. They, too, were shaken by what they had witnessed. The match no longer needed to continue; the outcome was clear. Tang Wulin turned to Li Zhilong, who was still in a daze, and approached quickly, whispering, "Senior, regarding this..." Li Zhilong snapped back to reality, asking instinctively, "Your classmate, her Martial Soul—it's tied to starlight?" Tang Wulin nodded. Li Zhilong inhaled sharply. "I've never seen a soul master so in tune with starlight. This is truly..." He longed to say how fortunate it would be if she were a student at their academy. His years at Skyreach Starry Sky Academy had given him a deep understanding of the Stargazing Platform, and he knew that this baptism of starlight, whatever mutation it triggered, would surely bring immense benefits to Xu Xiaoyan. A talent of her magnitude was undoubtedly a prodigy! To nurture such an individual would bring unparalleled enhancement to the entire Skyreach Starry Sky Academy. But it was clear that this was not possible; she hailed from Shrek. Tang Wulin said, "Senior, could you perhaps not interrupt the stellar display? Xiaoyan's condition..." "Of course!" Li Zhilong interrupted, stating firmly, "Even though she's not our student, this once-in-a-lifetime event is a fortunate encounter for her and an opportunity for us. We will record this data for posterity; it will be invaluable for the study of starlight. Don't worry. Starlight is infinite; let her absorb it." Turning to the six students from the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, he commanded, "You too should pay close attention to the shifts in starlight, and see if you can glean any insights from it." "Yes!" Xiao Tiantian and his peers answered respectfully. Their spirits, however, had taken a hit. As the outstanding young talents of Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, they had always held themselves in high esteem. Reaching a six-ring cultivation before twenty, with three specializing in control, they had been unrivaled in competitions throughout Sky Destiny City and its neighboring cities. Xiao Tiantian’s Demon King Martial Soul was particularly formidable. But today, they had been thoroughly outmatched by a younger Shrek Academy with an average cultivation one ring lower, and without even a single flying soul master on their side. It was a gap that lay at the very foundation of their strength. How could they not feel disheartened? The starlight absorption lasted for more than an hour before Xu Xiaoyan's figure gently landed on the ground. Radiant points of light emerged on her skin, each one shimmering like a star in the night sky. Tang Wulin, using his spiritual power, estimated the number of these points—around three hundred and sixty-five. Xu Xiaoyan sat cross-legged, activating the Mysterious Heaven Technique, with the three hundred and sixty-five golden spots on her flickering intermittently. Her Starwheel Ice Staff, standing tall beside her, had turned completely golden, especially the starwheel at the top, which now seemed ethereal, as if it bore the imprint of the Zhou Tian Xing Dou, giving one the sensation of looking up at the starry sky. Her Martial Soul had undoubtedly evolved, especially the starwheel. The oscillations of soul power around Xu Xiaoyan had not increased significantly, but the aura she exuded was one of purified essence. In the embrace of the starlight, her entire being seemed to become translucent, marvelously peculiar. Xu Xiaoyan had always been the weakest link in the team, managing to contribute only through the control of her Starwheel Ice Staff at night and the recent ability to use her first soul ring's Starwheel Chains during the day. Now, it seemed she had truly ascended. The Zhou Tian Xing Dou gradually returned to normal, and the glow of the Stargazing Platform dimmed. The starlight on Xu Xiaoyan, as if absorbed back into her, quietly vanished. Her already beautiful visage now glowed with a lustrous sheen, subtly twinkling like the light of a gem. Drawing a deep breath, Xu Xiaoyan slowly opened her eyes to find every gaze in the vicinity focused on her, causing her pretty face to blush with a delicate touch of rose. Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty: Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy 'How do you feel?' Tang Wulin inquired. Xu Xiaoyan furrowed her brow, 'It's rather peculiar, difficult to articulate.' Tang Wulin could discern from her gaze; it wasn't that she found it indescribable, she simply preferred not to discuss it in the current setting. 'Senior, we regret the inconvenience today. Now that Xiaoyan has recovered, we shall take our leave,' Tang Wulin conveyed to Li Senior. Li Zhilong looked to Xu Xiaoyan, 'Junior, your experience was quite unusual, and we've captured everything for analysis. Could you provide a Soul-Guided Communication Device Number for ongoing dialogue?' 'Of course.' Having benefited from their assistance, Xu Xiaoyan naturally would not decline such a request, leaving behind her Soul-Guided Communication Device Number. Naturally, this would be relevant once they reclaimed their Soul-Guided Communication Devices from the academy. Presently, all devices were in the academy's custody. Stealthily departing Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy, they got into their vehicle. Xie Xie steered towards the next city. 'That sparring session with the academy proved beneficial,' Tang Wulin reflected. 'It genuinely facilitates our development. Moving forward, we must adopt a more tactful approach in the next city.' Gu Yue mused, 'Will luck grace us once more in the future? This time was pure serendipity, encountering a Shrek Academy graduate.' Tang Wulin chuckled, pulling out a piece of paper from his pocket. 'Before we departed, I sought advice from Senior Li. Our academy's alumni are cherished everywhere. Which institution wouldn't desire a teacher from Shrek? Senior Li provided a list of academies within the cities ahead, with Shrek graduates and their contacts. Armed with this, we can arrange sparring sessions well in advance.' 'Is that possible...?' Gu Yue stared at him, astonished. Xu Xiaoyan also commented, 'Captain, had you anticipated this strategy? It's ingenious. Had we known, we would have initiated with this method.' Tang Wulin inquired, 'Xiaoyan, your martial soul has mutated, correct? What sensations do you have?' Xu Xiaoyan appeared bemused, 'Indeed, it has mutated. Who could have imagined the presence of such immense astral force? At first, I was perplexed, but as that vast astral force merged with my martial soul, it seemed to rapidly mature, akin to an awakening.' 'If I'm not mistaken, my original martial soul was immature, perhaps flawed. That's why my capabilities varied between day and night. While my cultivation would slowly compensate for this defect, it would persist and possibly cause greater issues later. This astral absorption has mended these imperfections and cleansed my martial soul, enhancing its refinement.' 'Why then do I sense your soul power hasn't significantly increased after absorbing so much astral force?' Tang Wulin pondered. Xu Xiaoyan wore an odd look, 'With gain comes loss. My martial soul has been replenished, but in the process, some elements were lost. My Starwheel Staff should be renamed simply as Star Staff. The ice attribute has been eradicated by the astral force, leaving only the pristine Starwheel.' Tang Wulin was stunned, 'Is that plausible? So, you've lost all your ice-attribute soul skills?' Xu Xiaoyan nodded. Gu Yue questioned, 'With the transformation of your Starwheel Staff, have your soul skills evolved?' Xu Xiaoyan smiled, 'Certainly. Otherwise, it would have been a net loss. With my martial soul's evolution, my soul skills have naturally advanced. All three have undergone notable changes. I'll demonstrate them in our next clash. Like the captain, I've evolved into an Offensive Control type.' Tang Wulin gave a thumbs up, noting that Xu Xiaoyan seemed far more self-assured after the evolution. 'Xinglan, and you? You also absorbed some astral force, right? Your thoughts?' Ye Xinglan smiled faintly, 'My martial soul resonates well with astral force, yet is quite stable. As a result, my soul power alone has elevated. I have reached level forty.' Level forty! This revelation caused even Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi to whirl around. Xu Lizhi beamed with joy, 'Sister Xinglan, congratulations for achieving level forty!' Ye Xinglan acknowledged the sentiment with a gentle nod. With Ye Xinglan attaining level forty, she merely needed to fuse a new soul spirit and secure her fourth soul ring to ascend to the Soul Ancestor realm. She was the first among the sextet to reach this level. Given her innate talent and the might of the Stargod Sword, her overall strength at level forty would scarcely be lesser than Yuanen Yehui's. Tang Wulin directed Xie Xie, 'Let's not rush onto the expressway; we should find a place to purchase Soul-Guided Communication Devices.' The single purpose of acquiring a communication device was clear. 'Greetings, is this Senior Zhang from Shrek Academy? We are from Shrek Academy...' As Tang Wulin had professed, Shrek's influence was extensive, and alumni looked after their juniors. Additionally, the presence of distinguished students from Shrek for knowledge exchange and sparring was beneficial for these academies as well. In the subsequent days, their journey proceeded without a hitch, engaging in two exchanges daily and successfully concluding the ninth task of the final exam. Just one more, and they could pass this final exam and return to their academy. 'Why are there no seniors from our academy at Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy? Aren't they ranked among the continent's elite institutions? Why is that?' Xu Xiaoyan queried with curiosity. Tang Wulin clarified, 'From what I've learned from the previous academy's senior, Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy was once decimated, and our academy was implicated. Since then, their antagonism has persisted. Thus, Sun-Moon Royal is the sole academy that rejects Shrek graduates as instructors. Similarly, our seniors are disinclined to assume positions here. Although they don't compare to Shrek, Sun-Moon's enmity towards us has never waned.' Xie Xie proposed, 'Should we still opt for this academy? I've heard about Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy; their nurtured elites are also quite formidable. Many of the Federation's high-ranking officials are alumni. Perhaps we should contemplate an alternative?' Tang Wulin's smile was composed, his eyes sparkling, 'What's our examination's purpose? The academy stripped us of all possessions, sending us on this trial. It's not merely about completing the exam; it's about obtaining meaningful growth. Do we lack confidence?' Xie Xie's gaze hardened, and he flashed a thumbs-up to Tang Wulin. Xu Xiaoyan was eager, 'In the previous bouts, I have yet to truly perform.' Ye Xinglan remarked calmly, 'Indeed, we have yet to showcase our abilities.' Gu Yue glanced at Tang Wulin, 'This is the final confrontation, isn't it?' Tang Wulin and she shared a glance, his face breaking into a smile. Against an archenemy, victory was the sole option. 'Victory yields additional points.' Suddenly, a cool voice echoed within the vehicle, startling everyone. 'Wu Zhangkong?' Tang Wulin exclaimed, then spotted Wu Zhangkong outside the window. Wu Zhangkong, as if sauntering through the void, glided effortlessly alongside their swiftly moving car, his voice emanating from within. Tang Wulin's lips twitched, 'Wu Zhangkong, can you hear our conversation?' Wu Zhangkong peered through the window at him and nodded. 'You represent Shrek's honor. Having chosen Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, failure is unacceptable. I will accompany you as the team's instructor.' A teacher-led exchange competition certainly presented a far more formal affair. Tang Wulin ventured, 'What's the incentive for victory?' Wu Zhangkong replied, 'Win, and each of you will receive full marks, plus an extra ten points. That is to say, you may distribute fifty additional points amongst others.' 'A deal it is!' Tang Wulin agreed without hesitation. Such a score would ensure the attainment of his goal. An additional three hundred points among the six could significantly assist many classmates. Wu Zhangkong's tone was even, 'Lose, and all prior efforts turn futile. You will all fail outright.' 'That harsh?' Tang Wulin was flabbergasted. Wu Zhangkong elaborated, 'The feud between the academies is more severe than you imagine. Hence, should you lose, I too shall tender my resignation, accepting responsibility.' Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-One: The Unyielding Teacher Wu This wasn't just about being tough on us; Teacher Wu was equally stringent with himself! Tang Wulin started to doubt whether deciding to challenge the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had been the right choice. The pressure was truly immense. Mingdu! The most technologically advanced city on the Douluo Continent, Mingdu stands proudly in the western part of the continent, embodying the very heart of the entire West. Upon entering Mingdu's boundaries, Tang Wulin and his companions encountered a sight rarely seen elsewhere. "Is that a flying car? A high-altitude flying car?" Xu Xiaoyan exclaimed, pointing at an object soaring in the sky. "Precisely. The high-altitude flying cars are still in the trial phase. As the Federation's most important technological hub, Mingdu is at the forefront of these groundbreaking tests," Xie Xie confirmed, his eyes filled with wonderment. As the flow of traffic began to constrict, they noticed something unusual ahead. Dozens of mech armors—gargantuan suits designed for combat—were patrolling the highway exit, though their exact purpose remained veiled by distance. "They're not conducting identity checks, are they?" Xie Xie suddenly voiced his concern, anxiety creeping into his voice. His words sent a ripple of apprehension through the group. They each possessed an identity card, a metallic card imprinted with their personal information. Although, before departing the academy, these had been confiscated. An epiphany struck Tang Wulin. "The academy's plan must have been to send us to Mingdu for our final stop. This... The tests truly are ubiquitous. No wonder our identity cards were seized." "So, what's the plan?" Xu Lizhi turned to him, his expression fraught with worry. Should they be checked and found without identity cards, intense questioning would surely follow. Tang Wulin had no idea what might unfold next. They had never been in such a predicament before, nor had they faced such scrutiny in any other city they had passed through. Gauging the distance to the highway exit, Tang Wulin instructed Xie Xie, "Drive the car to the side." Xie Xie, who had recently honed his driving skills, adeptly maneuvered the soul-guided vehicle to the edge of the highway. "Abandon the car?" Xie Xie queried. "Could Teacher Wu present our identity cards for us? He was just following us, wasn't he?" While speaking, he glanced out the window, only to confront a stark reality. Teacher Wu Zhangkong was nowhere to be seen. "Never mind, wrong guess," Tang Wulin muttered before turning to Gu Yue. "Prepare to do what we discussed..." Nearing the highway exit, where officials were indeed verifying the identity cards of all travelers, Gu Yue made her move. With a flash of silver light, Gu Yue vanished from the vehicle, reappearing moments later dozens of meters away in mid-air. With an elegant gesture, she summoned a massive, three-meter-wide Fireball, which shot into the sky. Its rising form resembled a radiant morning sun, increasing in size and trailing a tail of flames as it climbed. The spectacle drew the immediate attention of both the passing vehicles and the patrolling mech armors. Several units ascended to locate Gu Yue, but their focus was largely captured by the expanding Fireball. The team's vehicle discreetly pulled to the side, and as they watched, the Fireball detonated in the sky with a resounding explosion, scattering a cascade of sparks that resembled the most magnificent fireworks. Gu Yue's aim was to make the Fireball as imposing in appearance as possible, with little emphasis on its destructive power. The doors opened, and six silhouettes exited stealthily. They refrained from fleeing immediately; by this time, numerous soul-guided vehicles had halted to observe the aerial display. Tang Wulin scanned the area and commanded in a hushed tone, "Go!" They vaulted over the guardrails with ease and sprinted into the distance, swiftly disappearing into a cluster of buildings adjacent to the highway. Only then did the alarm sound from the direction of the highway. Tang Wulin, leading Xu Lizhi, with Ye Xinglan guiding Xu Xiaoyan, and the Agile Steamed Bun, along with Gu Yue's wind element aid, made a hasty retreat. After a lengthy sprint covering several kilometers, they boarded a bus headed for central Mingdu, finally allowing themselves to relax. Their youthful appearance, being only thirteen or fourteen years of age, made them less likely to draw attention. Tang Wulin purchased bus tickets and handed them out to his companions. That's when he spotted a familiar countenance. Teacher Wu Zhangkong was seated at the back of the bus, gazing out the window, seemingly lost in contemplation. Tang Wulin approached and took a seat beside him. "Can we now head directly to the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy? Please, let's not wander any further. Lead the way," Tang Wulin pleaded. Teacher Wu Zhangkong glanced at him and remarked, "Your reaction was commendable." A sheepish grin spread across Tang Wulin's face, but it quickly dissolved when Teacher Wu Zhangkong added his next comment. "You're usually so frugal. Losing two vehicles must hurt, doesn't it?" Three strands of exasperation fell from Tang Wulin's forehead. Of course, it hurt. But what could be done? It was all a result of the academy's exacting final exam. Teacher Wu Zhangkong offered no further comment and closed his eyes, seemingly to meditate. Tang Wulin couldn't help but inwardly grumble about the academy's rigorous comprehensive training. With Teacher Wu Zhangkong present, there was no need to rush. They would disembark when he did. Moreover, Teacher Wu Zhangkong had assured them that victory over their opponents in the impending exchange match with the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy would earn them a perfect score on the final exam, with additional points to boot. The architectural style of Mingdu starkly contrasted with that of Shrek City. Whereas Shrek City harmonized classical and modern elements, exuding a cultural aura, Mingdu was a pure high-tech steel jungle. Gigantic buildings with distinctive designs and features stood shoulder to shoulder, many so bizarre and eye-catching they demanded attention. Certainly, Mingdu was immense, its streets teeming with activity. Even after an hour-long bus ride, they only felt like they had penetrated a section of the steel jungle, with no idea of their precise location within Mingdu. Teacher Wu Zhangkong rose, exited the bus, and the six students quickly followed suit. Passersby surged past, a testament to the city's unrelenting pace. Teacher Wu Zhangkong led them toward a particular direction, and at a bus station, they boarded another bus. The students promptly followed. After switching buses thrice, Tang Wulin felt as if they were still ensnared within an endless metal forest. Mingdu might not rival Shrek City in sheer size, but in terms of building density and population, it unquestionably surpassed it. "I dislike this place; it's too hectic, too claustrophobic," Xu Xiaoyan voiced her discomfort, her lips pursed in displeasure. "I concur, it's excessively bustling," Xie Xie chimed in, ruffling his hair. As they conversed, a towering building ahead captured their gaze. Emblazoned at its peak were the prominent characters: Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. The structure, a veritable metal fortress, with adjunct buildings radiating from its core and merging with three other towers, constituted an impressive complex. Was this truly an institute of learning? Was the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy really such a place? Tang Wulin glanced at Teacher Wu Zhangkong, contemplating whether to inquire if they should proceed directly or if Teacher Wu Zhangkong would formally request a sparring match using his Shrek official identity. Before he could articulate his thoughts, Teacher Wu Zhangkong had already advanced toward the building. Standing before the structure, a device materialized in Teacher Wu Zhangkong's hand with a flicker of light— a soul guidance loudspeaker. Without a moment to gather their thoughts, he pressed a button, raised the device to his lips, and projected his voice toward the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy's imposing edifice. "Hear this, students of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy! We six hail from Shrek Academy, our average age a mere fourteen. We challenge your finest under twenty. Our arrival serves a single purpose—to demonstrate to you the chasm that lies between you and the continent's paramount academy." Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-Two: Is Such Ruthlessness Necessary? The chilling voice boomed like rolling thunder, audible throughout the surrounding streets. In Wu Zhangkong's hands was none other than a Soul Guidance Loudspeaker! Having spoken his piece, he pressed a button and handed the loudspeaker to Tang Wulin. 'Teacher Wu, do you have to be so merciless?' Tang Wulin sighed. Wu Zhangkong replied coolly, 'Is a perfect score that easy to obtain?' Before Tang Wulin could argue, the loudspeaker in his hand came to life again, 'Hear this, students of Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. We are a group of six from Shrek Academy with an average age of fourteen. We challenge your strongest under twenty to demonstrate the chasm between your academy and the continent's finest.' So, the loudspeaker has a recording function... And then, Wu Zhangkong vanished into thin air... A solitary gust swept by, tinged with melancholy! Teacher Wu, what about leading us? What about the trust between teacher and student? The Soul Guidance Loudspeaker sounded once more, and Xie Xie looked at Tang Wulin, 'It seems we've been set up.' Xu Xiaoyan swallowed hard, 'Is this the legendary extra without extra charge? A perfect score isn't easily earned!' Ye Xinglan clenched her fists, 'Then let's fight. If it were me, I'd shout the same challenge.' Next to Ye Xinglan, Xu Lizhi raised his plump hand, 'I agree!' Gu Yue moved next to Tang Wulin, examining the Soul Guidance Loudspeaker, 'It seems nothing incorrect was said.' Tang Wulin sighed, 'I want to give Teacher Wu a nickname - how about 'Pit King'? He finally found the switch on the loudspeaker and turned off the device that had been broadcasting their challenge four times over. Within minutes, they drew a crowd. Students and staff from Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, as well as passersby, had gathered around. A blond middle-aged man emerged from the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy building, his face grim as he watched Tang Wulin turn off the loudspeaker. 'Shrek Academy?' The middle-aged man stepped forward, his face stern as he inquired. Tang Wulin stored the loudspeaker in the ring given by his master, 'We come from class one, grade one of the Shrek Academy outer court.' 'You're here to challenge us? Very well. Follow me.' The man stated, as a powerful aura surged around him. It was sharp, piercing the heavens, making the onlookers feel as though they might be torn apart. The crowd was shocked. 'Disperse. Those who wish to know the outcome, watch the large screen for the live broadcast shortly.' With that, the middle-aged man retracted his aura and headed back inside. Was it truly that straightforward? Tang Wulin glanced at his peers, a sense of foreboding settling over him. The power radiating from this individual was clearly beyond their capacity; he might indeed be on the same level as Teacher Wu. Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, with its renowned reputation on the continent, ranked just below Shrek Academy. As Wu Zhangkong had indicated, a perfect score was indeed hard to come by! But no matter what, they had no retreat. The pressure intensified; they were representing not just themselves but also Shrek Academy. Around the corner, Wu Zhangkong stood silently, observing Tang Wulin and the group follow the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy staff member inside. His face remained expressionless, but the corners of his mouth lifted slightly. The upcoming battle would be their true test. Upon entering the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, Tang Wulin felt as though he had stepped into a high-tech factory. Metal was everywhere; in the center of the grand hall, a massive metal sphere rotated silently, brimming with potent soul guidance energy. Its soft light rendered the hall luminous and inviting. The reception area appeared more like that of a corporate headquarters than an academy. The sleek metal desk glistened with cloud-like patterns. Clearly, this was a rare metal, a testament to opulence. If only he had brought his forging hammer, Tang Wulin might have been tempted to refine it right there and then. The middle-aged man remained silent, leading them onwards. As they passed the reception, two beautiful attendants stood and bowed respectfully. Various individuals of differing ages were present in the hall, most in the white uniforms of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. Their gazes towards Tang Wulin's group were curious, yet tinged with rejection and malice. It seemed the welcoming atmosphere Shrek Academy enjoyed elsewhere did not extend to this place. Here, they were viewed as formidable adversaries. Had these students been indoctrinated? Tang Wulin silently mused while discreetly observing his surroundings. Now, his only hope was that the upcoming contest would be fair. If not, the academy could easily set a trap for them with its profound resources. The elevator, expansive and immaculately white, ascended swiftly and smoothly. The middle-aged man kept his silence, and Tang Wulin's group exchanged glances, all maintaining composure. The elevator halted on the sixteenth floor, and the middle-aged man led them out, Tang Wulin and the others in tow. They arrived at a room that resembled a conference hall. 'Sit,' the middle-aged man commanded, dispensing with any pleasantries. Tang Wulin had braced for this; they had come to stir the pot and were prepared for whatever came their way. It would have been strange indeed if the academy had received them warmly. Teacher Wu, you truly are the 'Pit King'. 'So, you've come to issue a challenge?' The middle-aged man seemed to seek confirmation once again from Tang Wulin. Tang Wulin nodded, 'A sparring match, if you will.' 'Very well. In a moment, we will provide you with a space to select your opponents. We at Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy will not take advantage of your youth. State your ages.' Tang Wulin let out a quiet sigh of relief. Facing opponents of the same age, they had no fear. 'We average fourteen years,' Tang Wulin declared. The middle-aged man's eyes narrowed, 'Excellent, our representatives will be no older than fifteen. Their ages will essentially match yours. However, there are two things you should be aware of. First, this match will be witnessed by our entire academy. Second, it will be broadcast across all major screens within Mingdu City.' Tang Wulin's heart steeled, 'Isn't that a bit excessive for a simple private sparring match?' he inquired. The middle-aged man replied flatly, 'It is necessary! If you win, it will be an incentive for our entire student body. If you lose, we will have the opportunity to severely strike at Shrek's reputation. So, it is essential.' Such deep-seated animosity, such intensity. Only now did Tang Wulin grasp the full extent of why Teacher Wu had chosen this particular method for their challenge. The rivalry between the two academies was far fiercer than they had imagined. But the path was set; there was no turning back, and this was a battle they couldn't afford to lose. 'Very well!' Tang Wulin's reply was a single, resolute word. 'Wait here.' The middle-aged man stood and left, leaving Tang Wulin and his six companions alone in the conference room. Gu Yue was about to speak, but Tang Wulin signaled for silence, 'Let's adjust our states and prepare for the battle ahead.' They were in enemy territory, and for all they knew, listening devices could be present. Too much talk could lead to trouble. No words needed, let our battle speak, then we shall depart. Gu Yue quickly caught on to his intent, and all six sat cross-legged on the chairs, entering a meditative state, each tuning their condition. Unbeknownst to them, their arrival had set the entire Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy in motion. Within an hour, promotions for the upcoming match had spread across Mingdu and the Federation. Half an hour after Tang Wulin and his group arrived, the Sun-Moon Television Station announced it would broadcast the battle live across all Federation cities. The clash was proclaimed as the 'Soul Master World's Youth Summit Battle.' On the street, Wu Zhangkong watched the large screen on the building, listening to the announcement echoing down the streets, his eyes slightly narrowed. Just then, his soul guidance communicator came to life. 'What's all this about?' Shen Yi's voice came through, tinged with surprise. Wu Zhangkong responded calmly, 'Nothing much. The kids have issued a challenge at the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. I simply lit the fuse to their courage.' Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-Three: Flaunting Their Might Shen Yi's voice carried a solemn weight. 'This matter is quite serious! Senior Brother, why didn't you inform us earlier? The academy is now at a disadvantage. The Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy's promotional campaign is massive, and the entire city of Mingdu, along with neighboring cities, is abuzz. The news has even spread throughout the Federation. If we lose this match, the blow to our academy's reputation will be colossal. Have you considered these repercussions?' Wu Zhangkong replied, 'I understand my disciples, which is why I made this decision. It's under great pressure that their potential is best unleashed. If they lose, I will take responsibility for the defeat and resign. However, if they win, I am convinced they will be worthy to challenge the present generation of the Shrek Seven Monsters. I have faith in them to uphold the academy's honor with their utmost effort, and I trust in my students.' After a moment's reflection, Shen Yi replied, 'Alright, I'll consult with the academy on their stance and get back to you.' Five minutes later, the Soul-Guided Communication Device rang once more. 'Elder Cai has given you the go-ahead. The outcome is secondary; win or lose, the priority is to return those young talents unscathed. They are the future's hope. Also, Elder Cai mentioned...' 'What did she say?' Wu Zhangkong asked, intrigued. Shen Yi continued, 'Elder Cai said she would actually prefer to see Tang Wulin and the others lose the match. Sometimes, defeat is not necessarily detrimental.' Wu Zhangkong asserted with conviction, 'Failure can indeed be the mother of success, but only through continuous victories and building unyielding momentum can one ascend to the pinnacle of success. I believe they will emerge victorious in this match.' Shen Yi affirmed, 'Understood, the academy will also make arrangements. Just ensure their safety.' Inside the conference room of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. Tang Wulin opened his eyes, glancing at the wall clock and frowning slightly. Two hours had passed since they had been left waiting, with no word from the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy about the match. Were they intentionally leaving them to stew? Through meditation, he had achieved a state of peak readiness. As Wu Zhangkong had stated, the pressure had honed his mental sharpness, leaving him feeling like an inexhaustible force. His teammates concluded their meditation in succession. 'No news yet? Shall we go out and inquire?' Xie Xie asked Tang Wulin. 'Let's wait a little longer,' Tang Wulin suggested. 'Since they invited us here, I doubt they'll just leave us sidelined. Perhaps they need time for preparations or to select our opponents. Let's be patient.' As they spoke, the conference room door swung open, and the middle-aged man from earlier entered once again. 'The stage is set, and the Great Soul Fighting Arena awaits our valorous clash. Do you need more time to prepare?' 'We are ready as well,' declared Tang Wulin. 'Then, please follow me.' The middle-aged man, devoid of any intention to introduce himself or inquire about their names, turned and led the way. Following him into the elevator, they ascended directly to the thirty-sixth floor before transferring to another elevator, which moved laterally before descending. After a two-minute descent, the doors opened to a stone chamber that replaced the metallic confines they had become accustomed to. The ancient stones seemed to pulse with a strange energy. Once inside, Tang Wulin and his companions felt their soul power slightly boiling, as if the environment was enhancing their ability to wield it. The man remained silent, guiding them through the expansive stone space, until they reached a grand hall. The ceiling was adorned with a stunning fresco depicting a narrative: a youth sat in a plaza surrounded by individuals clad in the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy uniforms, distinctly more archaic than their present garb. Among them, a youth stood out, donned in the unmistakable uniform of Shrek Academy, drawing Tang Wulin's gaze with a peculiar sense of familiarity. Who could this be? There was something about that Shrek Academy youth that seemed oddly recognizable to Tang Wulin. On one side of the hall stood a massive archway formed by two doors, each towering over fifteen meters and stretching thirty meters wide, easily accommodating a mech's passage. 'This is the waiting area for the Great Soul Fighting Arena. You will be summoned to enter for the match,' the middle-aged man informed them, gesturing towards the stone benches where they could sit and wait. Was the waiting area always this grand? Tang Wulin had assumed this was their battlefield. He could vaguely hear the distant commotion outside, not quite discernible, yet he was certain of its existence. The atmosphere of the forthcoming match was suffocating with anticipation. In the past two hours, the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy must have executed extensive preparations. The man made his way to a side door, and just as he left, the previously muted noise from outside exploded into a cacophony. A wave of sound surged through the hall, catching Tang Wulin and his team off guard. A rousing voice boomed, 'Shrek Academy has come to provoke us; will we stand for this? Fellow students of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, let's rally behind our contenders. We shall have Shrek's delegation retreat in defeat. We shall proclaim to the continent that we are the supreme academy.' Was this... the ambiance of the competition venue? Amidst the provocative rhetoric, the clamor of cheering, jeering, and assorted cries filled the air. 'Is this their way of flaunting their might?' Gu Yue's eyes narrowed. 'It seems they want to impose some pressure on us. Everyone, stay calm,' counseled Tang Wulin. Xie Xie scoffed, 'Pressure? How much does that weigh?' Xu Xiaoyan, brimming with excitement, said, 'Looks like there's quite a crowd. To unveil my evolved martial soul before so many, do you think I might have a chance to join the inner court?' 'My Stargod Sword is eager for action!' Ye Xinglan declared with a hint of eagerness. Xie Xie laughed, 'Eager for action doesn't quite sound right coming from a lady, does it?' 'Do you wish for death?' Two voices chimed in unison. Besides Ye Xinglan, the other was Xu Lizhi, who then promptly stuffed a gigantic steamed bun into Xie Xie's mouth, effectively silencing him. Xie Xie ducked behind Tang Wulin, removed the bun, and said with an exaggerated tremble, 'Captain, I'm genuinely terrified here.' Tang Wulin rolled his eyes, 'Your acting skills need work. Xinglan, I swear I don't know him. If you feel like teaching him a lesson, I'll assist you in holding him down.' Ye Xinglan snorted, 'I'll remember this. We'll settle it later. Wulin, let's strategize.' A gleam sparked in Tang Wulin's eyes as he nodded. Gu Yue raised her hands, summoning an ice-blue halo at her feet that gradually formed into a dome, enveloping the six of them in an isolated sanctuary, silent and cut off from the world outside. After ten minutes, 'The match is about to commence; please prepare to make your entrance,' a detached voice announced. The ice dome didn't shatter but seamlessly melted away from the top, its water constituents evaporating into the air. Observing the vanishing ice dome, the middle-aged man's eyes shifted, reflecting silent acknowledgment of their impressive control. Before them, the towering doors gradually parted, and the already intense noise from before swelled into a tumultuous roar as an exuberant atmosphere engulfed them. Beyond the archway, a world of blinding brightness awaited, beckoning them to step forward. The middle-aged man led the way to the threshold. Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-Four: Entering the Arena Tang Wulin strode confidently forward, taking the lead with his head held high, followed by his teammates Gu Yue, Ye Xinglan, Xie Xie, Xu Xiaoyan, and Xu Lizhi. Chests puffed out with pride, they were no longer just individuals or students completing their final exams, but warriors battling for the glory of Shrek Academy! It was only upon their entrance into the vastness of the Great Soul Dueling Arena that they could grasp the sheer magnitude of the structure. Not even within the esteemed walls of Shrek Academy existed an edifice of such scale. Fashioned after the ancient colosseums, the arena’s diameter spanned over a staggering one thousand five hundred meters, with stands that could house an audience exceeding one hundred and fifty thousand spectators. Tang Wulin was certain – this had to be the largest stadium across all of Douluo Continent. It likely served as the central hub encircled by the towering structures of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. The stands, though not filled to capacity, were bustling with life, occupied by at least sixty to seventy percent of its volume. These were not solely academy members; the crowd was too large, its origins enigmatic. Upon the central chairman’s stand, Tang Wulin could sense several imposing auras, as heavy and immovable as mountains, their focus intently fixed upon the six newly emerged competitors. When Tang Wulin and his comrades stepped into the heart of the Great Soul Dueling Arena, the cacophony of the crowd abated abruptly, and in that brief moment, they became the sole focus of over a hundred thousand pairs of eyes. Despite their steely composure, the weight of such attention was a formidable pressure to bear. Xu Xiaoyan and Xu Lizhi were visibly affected, a pallor creeping onto their faces. Each spectator's aura, unique and palpable, created an almost tangible pressure when combined, challenging the competitors' mental fortitude and resolve on a profound level. The scenario was proving to be more challenging than they had initially anticipated. With a deep breath, Tang Wulin's right foot stamped forward assertively, triggering a radiant ring of golden light to erupt from beneath him. In that moment, centered upon his being, a potent wave of blood qi surged forth. Though invisible to the eye, it wrapped protectively around his allies. Bathed in the tumultuous tide of Wulin's blood qi, the others found respite from the pressure; the external noise diminished, and, more crucially, their dampened spirits began to rise again under the fiery embrace of Wulin's blood qi. Atop the chairman's stand, a senior elder squinted, "Golden soul rings? Such rarity. Could it be... a million-year spirit beast? Impossible! Not even the Soul Transmission Tower boasts such ancient creatures. In our recorded history, sightings of million-year spirit beasts are scarce, a mere one or two occurrences at most." "Yet, each instance seems to intertwine with Shrek Academy," the middle-aged man beside the elder commented, his brows knitted in concern. "Keep vigilant," the elder instructed firmly. "Understood!" As the onlookers noted the golden soul rings manifesting around him, and his frame seemingly expanded, the hostile tension in the spectator seats lessened slightly. However, it was not long before the jeering and cursing resumed, now amplified. Tang Wulin paid no heed to the crowd, continuing his march toward the arena's epicenter with unyielding determination. It was there that he spotted six individuals already standing in wait. Adorned in the pristine white uniforms of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, they certainly appeared to be peers in age to Wulin's own team. Besides these six, another figure loomed overhead, a middle-aged man clad in a suit of Battle Armor that exuded the splendor of a Three-Word Battle Armor Master. Was he the referee, or was his presence another tactic to exert pressure? This was their first encounter with such a grand spectacle, and while it was natural to feel a hint of nervousness, Tang Wulin thrived under such conditions. His teammates often joked that he was like a coiled spring; the greater the pressure applied, the more forceful his rebound. Clad not in their academy uniforms but in the vibrant dark green of Shrek Academy's tracksuits, they faced their opponents with poised readiness. "Now, the rules of the match will be announced," the middle-aged man hovering above declared with a commanding tone. "What?" Tang Wulin gestured, indicating that he couldn't hear. "I said the rules of the match will now be announced!" the middle-aged man repeated, his voice tinged with soul power. "What are you saying? I can't hear a thing! It's far too noisy here. Maybe spray some insecticide to quiet down the flies?" Though Tang Wulin feigned an inability to hear, his voice was loud and clear, amplified by soul power. While it didn't reach the entire arena, the venue's sound system captured and broadcasted his words. "Activate the protective shield," the middle-aged man ordered, his expression darkening. A dome of white, translucent energy slowly ascended, forming a barrier that solidified high above at a hundred meters. This shield not only acted as a physical barrier but also muffled the ambient sounds, bringing an abrupt stillness to the arena. "Can you hear clearly now?" he asked Tang Wulin, his gaze icy. Tang Wulin nodded, then theatrically extracted wads of paper from each ear, declaring, "The world has quieted down." His teammates followed suit, each removing their own earplugs, prompting a visible twitch in the middle-aged man's facial muscles. Were it not for the thousands of eyes upon them, he might have descended to give them a piece of his mind. This spectacle was not just for those present; it was being broadcast across the continent to every soul guidance television station possible. The intent was to amplify the grandeur of the event. All previous preparations were designed to impose pressure on these students from Shrek. At an average age of just fourteen, their youthful nature was immutable. If they could be daunted, the chances of victory for his side would increase significantly. What he hadn't anticipated was Tang Wulin's unconventional approach. A simple act of pulling out earplugs had incited the crowd, provoking a symphony of outrage that, regrettably, was now silenced by the protective shield. To those watching the match on soul guidance television without bias, or those who favored Shrek Academy, the sight elicited laughter. Shrek Academy truly had cultivated a handful of treasures. "The competition rules will now be announced," the middle-aged man stated once more. "Go ahead," Tang Wulin responded, this time with feigned compliance. "This match is primarily a sparring exercise. However, to ensure both parties can fully exhibit their capabilities, I will only intervene as referee to stop the match or to declare a disqualification if there is a threat of severe injury, disability, or death. Victory will be determined by which side retains combatants after the complete incapacitation of the opposing team. Is that clear?" "So, as long as we don't kill them, anything goes, and there are no other limits, right?" Tang Wulin clarified, with a hint of mischief in his tone. Across from him, the six opponents glared, their anger palpable. Yet, restrained by the hovering referee's authority, they remained silent. "You can interpret it that way," the middle-aged man replied coolly, his eyes flashing with an unspoken warning. Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-Five: No More Jokes Tang Wulin spoke, "Before we commence, may I be granted a few words?" The middle-aged man replied, "Speak your mind." Given the multitude of eyes upon them, disallowing Tang Wulin's request would seem discourteous. Tang Wulin began, "Firstly, while we hail from Shrek Academy, we approached this challenge out of admiration for the esteemed strength of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. Having only joined Shrek for a single term, we hardly stand as its delegates. Thus, we are here as individuals. It's only fair to mention, within the hallowed halls of Shrek, we're but the least among our peers, not fitting emissaries of the academy's caliber." The middle-aged man stood aghast. Neither he nor the upper echelon of Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had foreseen such words from this youth! They had orchestrated an elaborate setup, poised for a victory they were confident would elevate their academy's prestige while dealing a crushing blow to Shrek. Tang Wulin's declaration, however, that they were mere novices and not official representatives, meant that even a victory would be devoid of its intended glory. And should they face defeat, the disgrace would be intensified. The middle-aged man, barely containing his wrath as he hovered above, descended to confront Tang Wulin. "Did you not previously assert yourselves as emissaries of Shrek Academy in this friendly contest?" he demanded, his voice laced with anger. Tang Wulin exhaled deeply, a flicker of light in his hand revealing the soul-amplifying device. Pressing the button, Wu Zhangkong's voice emerged, resounding across the venue, "Heed this, pupils of Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. We six, average age fourteen from Shrek Academy, challenge your most formidable under twenty. Our intent is not to represent, but to manifest the chasm between your institution and the continent’s apex academy." "This declaration does not once imply our participation as Shrek Academy's envoys! It merely acknowledges our association with Shrek Academy, our mean age, followed by a challenge. To display the gap. But the mantle we bear is our own!" The middle-aged man seemed on the verge of an eruption. "After all the preparations, this is your ploy? This is outright..." Could children of merely fourteen conceive such a brazen scheme? Despite longstanding rivalry, Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had never doubted Shrek's might and dignity. Upon Tang Wulin and his cohort's arrival, they had mobilized their strongest warriors, eager to diminish Shrek's renown. They hadn't anticipated that their full-force strike would feel akin to hitting a tuft of cotton. The middle-aged man longed to confront Shrek's newfound impudence but resisted. Denigrating Shrek Academy was not a venture he dared entertain. Tang Wulin blinked with feigned innocence, "Shall we then proceed with the bout? Should you opt for surrender, we could dispense with the formalities." The middle-aged man, adorned in his Three-Word Battle Armor—a testament to a stature akin to a Title Douluo—radiated with pent-up might. Annihilating Tang Wulin and his companions would be as trivial as flexing a finger. "Enough with the frivolity. We stand before you as Shrek Academy's chosen. For the glory of Shrek, we shall engage in battle and seize victory!" Just as the middle-aged man verged on his wit's end, Tang Wulin's demeanor transformed abruptly, his voice resonating with the conviction of their pledge. The middle-aged man stilled, a breath of relief escaping him. Thankfully, the young ones refrained from prolonging their charade. The illustrious Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy could not be perceived as afflicting mere children. "Prepare for the commencement of the match," he declared, ascending once again. "Additionally, while we do represent the academy, my prior statement stands firm: we indeed rank amongst the most modest at Shrek," Tang Wulin asserted. The middle-aged man, ascending, swayed, nearly tumbling from the heavens. Tang Wulin offered a subtle smile and stepped forward, addressing his adversaries, "I am Tang Wulin, of Shrek Academy’s outer court, first-year class one." He deliberately neglected his title as class leader; the first-year outer court was indeed the most basic tier. Tang Wulin's recent words had significantly dampened the audience's fervor for Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. The confidence of his opponents appeared shaken. "Long Chen!" The vanguard of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, Long Chen, stood with an air of unyielding resolve, his youthful visage contrasting his impressive stature. As Tang Wulin spoke earlier, Long Chen was the single Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy member whose expression remained steadfast, his composure unshaken. Tang Wulin quipped, "Considering your stature, surely you haven't surpassed twenty years? Victory would be void if that were the case." Long Chen cast him a frigid glance, "I hope your prowess matches the agility of your tongue." Gu Yue moved to Tang Wulin's side, "Gu Yue from the outer court's first-year class one, Shrek Academy." Another figure, a female, advanced next to Long Chen, "Xue Liushuang!" Her beauty was striking, her form graceful, standing next to Long Chen, they appeared quite the match. Though Tang Wulin surpassed Long Chen in attractiveness and build, he lacked Long Chen's towering height. Xue Liushuang's gaze did not rest on Gu Yue but fixated on Tang Wulin, her curiosity evident. "Ye Xinglan." Ye Xinglan took her stance beside Tang Wulin. Another from Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy approached, "You Dingqi!" His physique was average in height, yet robust, with broad shoulders and muscular arms that bespoke his strength. "Xie Xie!" "Xu Xiaoyan!" "Xu Lizhi!" The remaining Shrek trio announced themselves together. Their counterparts followed suit. "Jian Mochen!" A plump youth, his girth rivaling that of Xu Lizhi. "Kuang Zhantian!" An imposing girl exuding a powerful spirit! Her petite stature and rebellious gaze belied the boldness of her name. Tang Wulin almost suggested that with such uniqueness, she would thrive at Shrek Academy. "Weng Daimin!" The final introduction came from a gentle girl with blue hair cascading to her shoulders, her innocence palpable. Six against six. Unlike their prior academy challenges, neither group divulged their soul master types, sharing only their names. "Both teams, retreat and prepare for the contest. Withdraw to a distance of one hundred meters," the middle-aged man aloft commanded, his voice steady once more. Whatever the outcome, narrative threads would be plentiful post-battle. Even if Tang Wulin's team later disavowed representing the academy, it would be too late—they were Shrek Academy students, in essence and in truth. The teams gradually retreated, and Tang Wulin's previously nonchalant expression shifted to one of solemn concentration. The adversaries, seemingly equal in age, each radiated a unique aura. On their home ground, they would indeed be formidable. Vigilance and caution were of the essence. As they backed away, their triangular battle formation emerged. Long Chen stood at the forefront, the brawny You Dingqi and the stout Jian Mochen at his sides. Could they be agility-type soul masters? Behind them were Xue Liushuang, Weng Daimin, and Kuang Zhantian, arrayed in a line, with Weng Daimin at the center. Weng Daimin's positioning suggested she was likely a control-type soul master, while the roles of Xue Liushuang and Kuang Zhantian remained enigmatic. Once the hundred-meter gap was established, they faced each other, poised for engagement. "The contest, commence!" Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-Six: The Battle Begins With the middle-aged man's thunderous shout, the clash representing the might of two elite academies—and the culmination of Tang Wulin and his team's final exams—finally erupted. This time, Tang Wulin didn't rush headlong into the fray; instead, he and his comrades summoned their martial souls in unison. A multitude of purple soul rings, emblems of their advanced cultivation, ascended majestically, with Wulin's own trio of rings shimmering conspicuously. Their opponents from the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy were quick to respond, calling forth their martial souls as well. Long Chen moved forward, his stature rising by three inches as four soul rings spiraled up from beneath him—each one a regal purple, indicative of a four-ringed Soul Sect Leader. Long Chen's impressive display of four purple soul rings could easily rival that of Wu Siduo, a fellow prodigy on the young geniuses roster, who was known for her twin martial soul and soul fusion skill. Yet here stood Long Chen, with a seeming single martial soul, but with a rank approaching Wu Siduo's—a clear testament to his formidable strength. He was undoubtedly the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy's trump card in this age bracket. Beside Long Chen, Jian Mochen and You Dingqi each revealed their martial souls. You Dingqi's soul weapon was not a mere hammer but a meteor hammer, distinguished by its short handle and the long chain that coiled around his arm—three purple soul rings graced his presence, signifying an extraordinary soul master, though he lacked a fourth. Jian Mochen, with two yellow and two purple soul rings, manifested a large round shield as his martial soul. The shield, adorned with intricate patterns resembling a tiger's head, was large enough to shield his robust figure entirely, marking him as a defensive soul master. Among the three women in their rear, Xue Liushuang displayed four purple soul rings, Weng Daimin had three, and Kuang Zhantian also bore three purple soul rings. Within this sextet, three were four-ringed Soul Sect Leaders—a force that could easily stand toe-to-toe with the young prodigies of their class. Wulin inwardly commended their formidable strength. As he did, he considered that their prowess might only extend so far. The six selected by Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy were undeniably talented, but Wulin believed that if they were to face Wu Siduo and her quintet, the outcome would be far from certain—even though his own team had triumphed over Wu Siduo and her allies. This generation of Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy students did indeed wield impressive strength; however, they likely lacked an in-depth understanding of Shrek Academy. This cohort of Shrek Academy's outer court freshmen could only be described as 'brilliantly exceptional.' Unbeknownst to Tang Wulin, after Shrek Academy completed its enrollment, Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had acquired some information. They were aware that five prodigies from the roster of young talents had become part of this generation at Shrek Academy, although that was the extent of their knowledge. While Tang Wulin and his team were preparing earlier, Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had conducted their investigation; among their six, none were listed among the young talents. Therefore, their conviction in a forthcoming victory was not unfounded. Long Chen's left foot pressed against the earth, propelling him forward and leading the charge towards Tang Wulin's team. His second soul ring glimmered, heralding a resonant Dragon's Roar. His second soul skill, Dragon's Roar, sent powerful waves echoing around him, a faint golden silhouette appearing as if a mighty dragon was stirring. A dominant aura of light burst forth without restraint. His martial soul, the Radiant Holy Dragon—Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy's ace of aces! Proclaimed as the most promising of his generation to become a Four-Word Battle Armor Master, he was truly a child of the heavens. Once Long Chen saw that none among Shrek Academy's six had four soul rings, he felt certain of the modesty Wulin had claimed earlier. Long Chen was acutely aware that this match was being live broadcast with countless eyes upon them. This was his moment to shine, to rise to prominence on the backs of Shrek Academy's students, and to establish his standing in the soul master realm. 'Hehe,' Tang Wulin chuckled, a sentiment echoed by his comrades. Wulin gestured with his hand, signaling that there was no need for the others to advance, and with a light tap of his toes, moved to meet Long Chen. His approach was unassuming, lacking the oppressive air of his opponent. Wulin's three purple soul rings withdrew, and the golden halo that once awed the crowd reemerged, with golden scales unfurling across his skin. 'Roar!' The intensity of Long Chen's Dragon's Roar grew louder. In a one-on-one clash, his trio of rings challenged Long Chen's quartet, and Long Chen's martial soul was the illustrious Radiant Holy Dragon. Excitement surged within Long Chen's heart. To defeat the opposing leader in a one-on-one confrontation was the optimal moment to demonstrate his prowess. As the distance between them closed, Long Chen felt something amiss. His adversary seemed impervious to his Dragon's Roar; his eyes were radiant, and the look he directed at Long Chen was suffused with an inexplicable sense of pity. Pity for what? The gap between them closed in the blink of an eye, and Tang Wulin too ascended, his golden soul ring radiating as he rose. The Reverse Blood Qi Circulation technique activated, unleashing the formidable presence of the Golden Dragon King from within him. Long Chen's foot struck the ground, propelling him skyward, his arms outstretched, activating his first soul skill, Dragon Claw! He harbored no trace of underestimation towards Tang Wulin. Renowned as the foremost genius of the younger generation from Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, he was composed and substantial, never taking an adversary lightly. Aware of his potential to dominate his rival, he gave his all. As the light from his first soul ring shone, the fourth illuminated as well, demonstrating a soul master's adeptness at soul ring manipulation. His fourth soul skill, Dragon's Force, channeled the mighty power of the Radiant Holy Dragon bloodline throughout his body. His dragon claws glimmered with brilliant gold, and a layer of embryonic scales now veiled his skin. While not true dragon scales, they hinted at their emerging form. His intent was to deliver a decisive blow, to vanquish Tang Wulin outright, and with their morale at its peak, to then overwhelm the rest of Shrek Academy's students. At that moment, even if they claimed not to be the strongest from Shrek Academy, they were still its students! With such a resounding defeat, what more could be said? However, at that critical moment, Tang Wulin's aura erupted. Their auras were destined to converge before their bodies clashed. In that fleeting instance, Long Chen was besieged by an indescribable terror that welled up from the deepest recesses of his heart. How could this be? How could he possibly be afraid? Overwhelmed with confusion, yet the reality was inescapably before him. It felt as if something had seized his heart, sending tremors through his blood vessels. Before him, Tang Wulin, who had also taken to the skies, seemed to grow ever more imposing, and Long Chen felt as if he was diminishing in his shadow. The strength of the Dragon Claw waned rapidly; he gritted his teeth, driving his soul power, striving to quell his quaking. But against his will, Wulin's aura was so overpowering that Long Chen's Dragon's Force crumbled. Dragon's Force was meant to enhance the aura of his Radiant Holy Dragon bloodline. But at that moment, his bloodline's aura was suppressed, and even the effects of the soul skill were forced back. This was the chasm between bloodlines, and it was precisely the manifestation of the Golden Dragon King bloodline's formidable power that Tang Wulin wielded.
