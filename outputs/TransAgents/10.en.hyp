Chapter 1064: Cross-Border Bombing Even on the frozen grounds of the north, within their own territory, the Finnish officials could not possibly remain ignorant of an uprising. Yet, they chose to maintain a complicit silence. The chaos was brought by Arrow Corporation's people, within their 'private territory.' Since the dead were not Finnish citizens and Arrow Corporation hadn't requested any aid, why should the authorities intervene? Partak Town's local police dispatched a few mounted officers to circle the refugee camp. These officers, however, lacked the courage to engage and promptly retreated after a brief appearance. Judging by the armaments held by the insurgents, this was beyond the local police's capacity to manage. The chief of police in Partak Town immediately decided to mobilize the local militia for defense within the town, striving to ensure the safety of the townspeople. His decision proved wise. In less than half an hour, directives came from above, urging the local police to protect Partak Town and dispatched Alpha Special Forces for support. As for the refugee camp, the Finnish Defence Forces, hundreds of kilometers away, would 'take over.' In name only. Through intelligence from the Russian Security Bureau, Jiang Chen learned of these developments. The silence of the Finnish officials was unexpected; he had anticipated that Finland would at least dispatch a rapid reaction force to stabilize the situation. Their subdued response suggested that perhaps Carmen, within the military base, was engaged in unsavory activities. Or did he believe the two brigades within the base were more than sufficient to handle these disorganized foes? Regardless of Carmen's reaction, Jiang Chen's plans were unfolding methodically. Most of these refugees hailed from the Middle East, many having been part of militia groups or conscripted as reservists, with basic military training under their belts. They couldn't be expected to operate tanks, but they were more than capable with mortars—at least they wouldn't drop shells on their own heads. With the second batch of equipment from the Russo-Finnish border arriving in Partak, Sami, bolstered by his swiftly growing prestige, assembled a ten-thousand-strong guerrilla force from the refugee camp. With the rallying cry 'Only by annihilating the infidels' army can we end oppressive rule,' he mobilized the entire camp for a decisive battle against Arrow Corporation. Crates of ammunition were loaded onto battered vans and trucks, and workers pulled welders from factories to mount heavy machine guns onto pickups. There was no doubt this ragtag force had no real combat prowess. Against formally trained mercenaries, they stood little chance, but Jiang Chen was brimming with confidence in the outcome of the war. The reason was simple. If marksmanship couldn't prevail, they'd win with firepower! At two in the morning, six hours after the insurrection began, leaving only two thousand to defend, the armed forces under Sami once again mobilized, advancing towards Arrow Corporation to 'liberate' their misled brethren. The formidable army reached two kilometers outside Arrow Corporation, spreading out to encircle the military base. Under the guidance of a few veterans, the militants dug simple artillery pits with shovels and hoes. Hundreds of mortars formed dozens of artillery positions. As a signal flare soared, the 'whoosh' of mortars firing blanketed the tundra, and bursts of explosive fire engulfed the base, disorienting the ready mercenaries. Of course, the mercenaries in the base weren't idle. At the first sign of artillery fire, all mercenaries rushed to bunkers. Simultaneously, the base's howitzers, based on coordinates from scouts, began counter-battery fire on the insurgents' mortar positions... But the mortar positions were too dispersed; the shells from all directions left the base's gunners running ragged. Despite their expertise in artillery, they were outnumbered drastically. A mortar shell hit the command post roof, crippling a corner of the concrete fortification. Yano, his face plastered with dust from the ceiling, steadied himself on the table, cursing as he looked out the window. 'Shit! Where did these bugs get so many mortars?!' The unexpected artillery strike caught everyone off guard. They had expected these disorganized foes to charge their machine gun emplacements with rifles, not to be met with support weapons leveling the ground. 'No doubt, it was Star Ring Trade that supplied them,' Saldes, back at the tactical map, glanced around at those present, 'Gents, we can't keep up this defense. No one knows how much ammunition they have because the man providing their arms is an unadulterated scoundrel. Yano, lead your men out and show them that modern warfare can't be won by numbers alone.' 'Yes!' Yano saluted, took the radio from his gear, and began issuing orders to units at all levels. After orders were given, the military ground's gates opened, and a dozen Humvees roared out, followed by four 'Cougar' armored vehicles, charging towards the rioters' positions. Under Jiang Chen's guidance, Sami decisively ordered his men, armed with crates of anti-armor weapons, to confront the oncoming threat. The frontline unfolded at the edge of a pine forest, where towering trees abounded. Upon meeting Sami's guerrilla force, Arrow Corporation's Humvees and armored vehicles slowed, their rooftop-mounted heavy machine guns firing bowl-sized bullets into the rioters' ranks. The mercenaries, too, dismounted, seeking cover to engage the rioters. However, they vastly underestimated the rioters' anti-armor capabilities. As the mercenaries fired their machine guns, RPG warheads—high-explosive and armor-piercing alike—flew haphazardly through the pines. Though lacking in accuracy, the sheer volume rendered the reactive armor on the armored vehicles ineffective, with only one managing to retreat unscathed. Of course, these alone couldn't offset the rioters' inexperience in warfare. Despite the sudden RPG fire catching Arrow Corporation's armored units off guard, even without the vehicles, these disorganized forces were no match for a regular army... In under ten minutes of combat, Sami's forces suffered over two hundred casualties, while Arrow Corporation had less than fifty. Seeing they were outmatched, Sami panicked, urgently calling Jiang Chen for aid. 'Our frontline troops are beginning to falter; their sharpshooting is too precise! Many have never handled a gun before; we simply can't best them...' 'Don't worry, it will soon be resolved.' Jiang Chen's words left Sami momentarily stunned. Soon be resolved? What did he mean? While he was still bewildered, the ground suddenly shook violently, and a thunderous explosion echoed from afar. The blast wave swept through the pine forest, across the tundra, and even ruffled his bangs. Before Sami could grasp what had happened, billowing smoke rose from the direction of the military base, his mouth agape in shock. Standing on a hill on the other side of the battlefield, Jiang Chen observed the dramatic display through his binoculars, a smirk appearing on his lips. It appeared that the Alpha Special Forces had made their move. (To be continued.) Chapter 1065: Arrow Corporation's Demise Under the relentless barrage of mortar fire, the base descended into chaos, and no one noticed a special forces team sneaking into the camp. Kutepov effortlessly placed a beacon on the designated target and then led his squad out of the base. Upon safely reaching the evacuation point, he called in an airstrike. Russian stealth bombers soon swooped down from above the clouds, dropping four cruise missiles that accurately hit two ammunition depots and two fuel stores within the base. The explosion's shockwave swept through the camp, collapsing a circle of concrete buildings. The exploding ordnance and the fiery blasts careened across the camp, setting off a series of chain reactions—flames, blood, and corpses were everywhere. The personal guard brigade within the camp suffered nearly a fifty percent casualty rate instantly, with most of the remaining soldiers injured—it was nearly impossible to find someone unharmed. Medics, carrying stretchers, wove through the base, searching for incapacitated wounded. Sappers, clad in bomb-proof attire, braved the inferno to drag undetonated ammunition from the rubble. All able-bodied soldiers sprang into action, searching for their units to regroup. Saldes, the notorious general manager of Arrow Corporation and supreme commander, gazed out the window at the flames. Despair slowly crept into his vacant eyes. The smoke obscured the entire base, while the fires turned the night sky red—it resembled the apocalypse. "Damn it..." He murmured, his leaden legs moving him away from the window. Turning, he locked eyes with the command center's staff. "Commander, what should we... do?" The aftermath of the explosions finally subsided; no more sounds of detonating ammunition echoed throughout the base. But tranquility eluded everyone's hearts. The mercenaries who had narrowly escaped the explosion knew that their real nightmare was just beginning. The initial blasts seemed to have ignited a beacon, signaling the charge for Sami's forces. At Jiang Chen's behest, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity, rallying the remaining insurgents to storm the front lines. More than six thousand individuals surged across the tundra toward the flickering pine woods—a magnificent scene from afar. Meanwhile, as the mercenaries at the front lines saw the smoke rising from their rear, panic set in. Their morale plummeted in an instant. Confronted by the insurgent tide, even if they had the strength to hold the line, their will to continue fighting had dissipated. Without a doubt, Arrow Corporation's defenses were breached, and the mercenaries scattered before Sami's overwhelming numbers. Some retreated to the burning base, but most turned deserter, fleeing into the depths of the forest. No prompt from Jiang Chen was necessary; even the dimmest would know what to do at this juncture. Watching Sami lead the insurgents in their assault on the military base, Jiang Chen stowed his binoculars and summoned the pre-prepared off-road motorcycle from his storage space, giving Aisha a gentle pat on the back. "It's time. Let's move out." "Understood!" Aisha nodded in agreement, and once Jiang Chen was seated, she swiftly mounted the motorcycle behind him. The engine roared to life, kicking up a spray of snow. Jiang Chen rode the motorcycle down the hillside, bringing Aisha to the side of the base. They stopped the bike at the roadside, and he retrieved a Laser Sword from the storage space. With ease, he sliced through the steel wire mesh protective wall. The base was engulfed in fire and disorder, with the occasional sound of mortar fire. All armed mercenaries were at the front, battling the insurgents for control of the main gate. Aside from a security squad at the command center, the entire rear area appeared deserted. For Jiang Chen and Aisha, it was as if there were no defenses at all. Ten guards in total—two in the watchtower, the rest stationed at the entrances on the first and second floors. Aisha took out the Ghost Sniper Rifle and silently dispatched the watchtower guards. Then, exploiting the blind spots, she systematically eliminated the eight others. After Aisha cleared the command center's security detail, Jiang Chen took his rifle and approached the entrance. As he passed by the Humvee, he ran into Saldes fleeing the command center along with the staff. Their eyes met, and both parties were momentarily stunned. The staff member reacted first, reaching into his chest to draw a weapon. But before his hand reached his chest, Aisha, quicker on the draw, ended his resistance. Saldes, about to fight back, found himself easily subdued by Jiang Chen, who pressed him against the Humvee with his hands twisted behind his back. "Saldes, male, 43. You're the general manager of Arrow Corporation and the supreme commander, am I right?" Although it was their first meeting, Jiang Chen's holographic helmet, linked to the Ghost Agent database, held his photo and personal information. With just a glance, Saldes' profile was projected onto the holographic screen. With his face pressed against the vehicle, Saldes displayed his stubbornness, refusing to surrender, his teeth gritted. "I won't say anything. You might as well kill me..." "Kill you? I haven't asked you anything yet." Jiang Chen grinned, unfazed by his uncooperative attitude. He retrieved a syringe and injected it unceremoniously into Saldes' shoulder. "Ugh—!" Saldes grunted in defiance, his eyes popping with veins, but his gaze soon dimmed. Jiang Chen let go of him; there wasn't a single precedent of someone resisting the effects of the truth serum. Turning Saldes over, Jiang Chen asked pointedly, "Where's Carmen?" "Underground bunker... inside the research institute." "Where's the entrance to the underground bunker?" "At the center of the base, only accessible by elevator. You'll see the two helipads next to the entrance." The information flowed like a rehearsed script. "Good, now you can have your wish." Jiang Chen pulled out his handgun and fired a bullet into Saldes' head before tossing his body aside. A swift death indeed, but for the well-known Saldes of Arrow Corporation, to die so anonymously might have been worse than death itself... If the dead could suffer. "The underground bunker, then." Jiang Chen looked toward the center of the base, a cold smile playing on his lips. Whatever Carmen was plotting, his luck was about to run out. The fate of the Rothschild family was about to echo their ascent—gained fame from a war, and now they were about to fade into obscurity because of one... However, just then, a piercing scream echoed from afar. (To be continued.) Chapter 1066: Iblis! A ghastly wail tore through the battlefield, eclipsing even the staccato of gunfire. Amidst the fierce clash between mercenaries and insurgents, a sinister shape plunged into the fray. Illuminated by the flare's incandescence, all could discern the monstrous visage: a creature with limbs arched like a bow, arms that ended in dark, scythe-like blades, and a shuttle-shaped beak bristling with rice-grain-sized teeth. A pair of stubby wings adorned its back, giving it the eerie appearance of a humanoid mantis. The fusillade ceased for an ephemeral two seconds. All combatants were transfixed by the spectacle before them. But in the lull of gunfire, the 'mantis' sprang into action. Its bow-shaped legs catapulted it forward, its seven-foot frame launching through the air with unnatural velocity. The insurgent nearest to it barely had time to react before crisscrossing blades decapitated him, his lifeblood spurting as he collapsed. The creature pinned its quarry to the ground, its beak-like maw violently plunging into the neck's gaping breach. With a series of crunchy, gnawing noises, it voraciously devoured the marrow and flesh, its ferocity akin to a wild beast quenching its bloodlust. Even the battle-hardened militants felt their stomachs churn at the sight, their legs quivering as they retreated in dread. 'Iblis...' That was the name of a demon, reminiscent of Satan from the Bible. 'It's Iblis!' Someone cried out, and soon after, screams rippled through the air. The insurgents hefted their G36 rifles, fingers white-knuckled on the triggers, unleashing a fusillade on the beast. But the mantis merely raised its bladed limbs, letting the bullets clink harmlessly off its chitinous armor, utterly unconcerned by the 5.56mm rounds. Most dreadfully, this mantis-like entity was not alone. From the underground bunker's entrance, a multitude of dark silhouettes emerged, their blades flashing as they charged towards the insurgents. Once in close quarters, the insurgents faced nothing but a massacre. Amidst the mantises, another grotesque form appeared: bloated, maggot-like creatures ejecting highly corrosive saliva that could consume steel and concrete, let alone human flesh. Confronted with these demonic beings of legend, the zealots finally felt the grip of fear. As disorganized as their arrival, the insurgents' collapse was uncontrollable. On the other side, the mercenaries' cries of elation soared. They were comrades, despite the grotesque appearances. Their cries, however, were fleeting as a similar nightmare soon befell them. Dense spore clusters drifted from the underground bunker, stealthily enveloping the camp. In the dark of night, they were nearly imperceptible. Those first exposed to the spores began to struggle for breath, followed by excruciating pain radiating from their chests. Writhing in agony, they clawed at their skin, blood flowing unabated. Quickly, they lost sensation throughout their bodies, becoming akin to the walking dead. Only those encased in powered armors were spared. On the battlefield, everyone else, regardless of allegiance, was swallowed by the spore cloud. In a desperate bid for survival, mercenaries and insurgents turned their guns upon each other, facing a common adversary. But from the start, they stood no chance... 'What the hell is that thing?!' A creature bearing resemblance to a deathclaw lunged; Jiang Chen, his back slick with cold sweat, planted a firm boot into its chest. He discarded his empty rifle, drawing his laser sword in a swift motion, its blade arcing through the air to sever a limb. Greenish blood spurted out, vaporizing under the heat of the blade. As the creature recoiled with a howl, Jiang Chen refrained from pursuit. With a flick of his wrist, a spinning blade of light detached from the hilt, cleaving the creature's face in half. Aisha, steadied with her Ghost sniper rifle, coolly dispatched two more alien creatures, their heads erupting. 'Their numbers are overwhelming; we can't hold this position,' Jiang Chen declared, retrieving a PK2000 from the ground and inserting a new magazine. 'Time to retreat.' Aisha nodded but didn't move. 'I'll cover our retreat—' 'You take the lead, quickly!' Jiang Chen patted Aisha's shoulder, propelling her forward, and raised his rifle to mow down a group of zombies lurching towards him. True, they were zombies. But differing from those he had faced in Cagayan City, these seemed to be the result not of viral infection but of something akin to the zombies from the wastelands. 【Warning: Unidentified bacteria detected in the air. Filtration system activated automatically. To deactivate, please...】 The alert on his helmet's display was clear, and Jiang Chen understood the nature of these beings. They were all too familiar. He had faced similar threats in Wanghai City. Without a moment's hesitation, Jiang Chen exercised his supreme command authority within Star Ring Trade, circumventing all bureaucratic layers, directly linking to Electromanta C-1 in synchronous orbit. He designated the entrance to the base's central underground bunker as the target, initiating an orbital airstrike. Diplomatic issues would take a backseat to humanity's crisis. Compensation could be addressed later. 'This is Electromanta C-1, airstrike target confirmed. Tungsten-core rounds have detached, departing synchronous orbit. Airstrike estimated to impact in ten minutes. All combat personnel must evacuate the target area...' After silencing the comm, Jiang Chen emptied his rifle's magazine and sprinted toward the protective wall. Aisha, who had already reached the perimeter, set up her sniper rifle, covering Jiang Chen's retreat. For reasons unknown, these alien creatures seemed to be purposefully pursuing them, as if controlled by some malevolent consciousness. Before the horde of zombies and mutants could encircle them, Jiang Chen successfully breached the protective wall and tossed a nuclear hand grenade behind him. Without looking back, he and Aisha fled. Once assured that no pursuers had emerged from the explosion that decimated the horde, Jiang Chen took an off-road motorcycle from his storage space and, with Aisha, sped toward the mountain, not towards the refugee camp but in the direction of the Russian-Finnish border. The motorcycle crested the hill, and Jiang Chen paused, glancing at his watch before looking back toward the military base. In the sporadic light of flames, he could barely make out with the naked eye that the base no longer harbored life. As specks of white light appeared in the night sky, trailing slender flames, a volley of tungsten-core rounds hammered the base's center, raising plumes of dust skyward. 'That ought to have finished them off,' Jiang Chen murmured, extracting binoculars from his pocket. When the dust settled, a crater dozens of meters wide stood at the base's heart, a chasm as if leading to hell itself. Yet from the depths of the crater, more alien creatures continued to crawl out... (To be continued.) Chapter 1067: Finland Caught in the Crossfire The sky was beginning to lighten, marking the approach of six in the morning. An orange-red civilian helicopter circled in the high skies, its side marked with the letters YLE. When the ammunition depot exploded, sending a column of black smoke skyward, YLE had immediately dispatched their helicopter to the scene. They had anticipated a forest fire, but what they encountered was far from natural. It was the military base of the controversial Arrow Corporation, situated within Finnish territory, now looking like a battlefield. At the epicenter of the turmoil was a massive, seemingly bottomless pit. "This is YLE, live at the scene of what was initially believed to be a forest fire in the outskirts of Partak Town... It has now been established that this is not simply a fire, but an explosion caused by human intervention. We have identified a huge crater on site... Wait, what's that?" The camera shook violently, refocusing and zooming in towards the direction of the military base engulfed in flames. Seen through the lens, undead roamed aimlessly while bizarre creatures intermittently crawled out of the pit. "...We seem to have stumbled upon something extraordinary. The speculations about Arrow Corporation conducting secretive experiments here might indeed be true. What are these creatures? Aliens? Zombies? Extraterrestrials? My God..." While the helicopter relayed this shocking footage to the people of Finland and the world, Jiang Chen stood on a hill, his concern for the situation inside the base evident. It was apparent that Carmen had put considerable effort into constructing this underground bunker. The tungsten-core rounds that had rained down from above had not completely destroyed it but merely collapsed the elevator shaft that accessed the underground bunker. Spores kept pouring out from the underground lab, now spreading beyond the confines of the base. Jiang Chen observed that the terrifying bacteria could mutate not only the animals that wandered into its range but also the vegetation rooted in the area. "Aisha." Jiang Chen called out. "Yes?" Aisha turned to face him, her striking chestnut hair waving in the wind. "I think... we might have stirred up a hornet's nest," Jiang Chen admitted with a bitter smile as he lowered his binoculars. "Stirred up a hornet's nest?" Aisha furrowed her brows in confusion, not grasping the meaning behind Jiang Chen's words. 'Hornet's nest'? What could that mean? Jiang Chen clarified, "It means we've caused a big problem that's likely to provoke a strong reaction." Just then, an unsettling premonition surged within him. Jiang Chen and Aisha simultaneously turned and aimed their guns toward the path ahead. "Come out, I'll count to three," Jiang Chen announced, his finger sliding off the safety catch. A figure, hands held high and dressed in arctic camo, emerged—a Russian. He spoke in thickly accented Chinese, "Don't be alarmed, I'm one of you." Recognizing the face, as lined with scars as it was with wrinkles, Jiang Chen holstered his gun, signaling Aisha to do the same. A wry smile appeared on his face. "I was close to pulling the trigger," Jiang Chen confessed. "I appreciate your restraint," Kutepov replied, lowering his hands and stepping closer, nodding towards the fiery installation below. "What's the situation down there?" "It's a complex situation. Better discussed when we return," Jiang Chen replied, shaking his head. "Then, shall we join forces?" Kutepov gestured towards the peak. "If you're not planning to return to the refugee camp, you could join us at the evacuation point. We've got a helicopter waiting." Returning to the refugee camp was out of the question for Jiang Chen. He had not only incited an uprising within the confines of another nation but had also left a significant mark on their map, to say nothing of the considerable mess left behind. Assuming the Finnish government was not blissfully ignorant, they would certainly be in an uproar. Without a moment's hesitation, Jiang Chen, accompanied by Aisha, took the 'convenient flight' offered by the Alpha Special Forces, retreating back to Russian territory. As if to confirm Jiang Chen's hunch, the Finnish Defence Forces were dispatched to Partak just as he crossed into Russian territory. With national security on the line, the Finnish authorities could no longer afford to be concerned with humanitarian crises. Tanks and armored vehicles forcefully entered the refugee camp, and fully armed soldiers quickly took control of the ammunition factory and warehouses, disarming the defeated insurgents. During the disarmament process, the Finnish Defence Forces encountered no resistance. In fact, Sami promptly surrendered his weapons and obediently boarded the prison truck, crouching in a corner, visibly shaken, incessantly invoking the name of the esteemed Iblis, begging for divine mercy. Many of the rioters who had narrowly escaped death bore the same look of terror. When questioned about the previous night's events, their fragmented responses repeatedly circled back to a few words—'Iblis,' 'demons,' 'monsters,' 'massacre'... The most absurd part of it all for the commanders was the insurgents' apparent eagerness to confess. In their desperation to leave this damned place, over a thousand claimed to have taken part in the execution of captives. Yet, the actual number of mercenaries executed that night was barely ten... "What in the world? Iblis? What sort of devilry is that?" Duwiao slammed the briefing onto the table, his gaze fixed on the map. "How are things at the military base?" "Our choppers have surveyed the site, but we can't make anything out. The entire base is shrouded in a sickly yellow fog. For fear of toxic exposure, our pilots didn't dare get too close," Duwiao's aide reported. "Send in the recon, and make sure they're suited up in protective gear," Duwiao instructed. Before he could finish his order, an officer entered the makeshift command tent, saluted, and handed Duwiao an envelope. "Sir, a directive from the Ministry of Defence." Duwiao's eyebrows lifted as he broke the seal. His frown deepened as he read, and upon finishing, he rubbed his temples and tossed the letter aside. "Cancel the mission. There's no need to send out the recon." The deputy looked at his superior in surprise, unsure of what had prompted such a sudden change of heart. Out of a sense of duty, he still prompted his superior, "Without confirming the base's situation, we can't devise a strategy or begin rescue operations." "There's no need for strategies or rescues. Thanks to the quick actions of our officials, the reporters got there first. They've confirmed it—there are no survivors," Duwiao said, tapping the envelope. "This is an order from the Ministry of Defence. We are prohibited from approaching within one kilometre of the incident site. Our only task now is to secure the perimeter, assist the police in evacuating the citizens of Partak, and relocate the refugees to two camps along the Norwegian border." After a pause, Duwiao frowned and looked outside the tent, muttering lowly, "Let those bureaucrats argue with Russia. If they think squabbling will solve everything." As he uttered these complaints, a government aircraft had already taken off from Helsinki International Airport, carrying the Finnish Minister of Defence and the Deputy President towards Murmansk—Russia's largest city on the Arctic Ocean coast. At the same time, the Russian Minister of Defence and the Director of the Russian Security Bureau were urgently en route to meet and discuss potential resolutions with their Finnish counterparts... (To be continued.) Chapter 1068: Only Star Ring Trade Can Save You The trouble with Harmonic Civilization lies in their advanced understanding of biology, which far outstrips the fledgling human civilization's imagination. While nations worldwide were busy exporting ideologies, they had already begun to spread something much more dangerous—their insidious genes. Their DNA code is to biology what a computer virus is to computing systems. Whether Carmen lives or dies is no longer Jiang Chen's pressing concern. Even if Carmen were still alive, it's likely he's barely clinging to life. The greatest concession the Harmonic Civilization could offer him is a small reserve territory, similar to the parcels of land once promised to the Native Americans by the United States, allowing him and a handful of natives to survive as 'specimens' of human civilization. Jiang Chen is relieved that the Commonwealth Society's influence is waning. If Carmen had made contact with Harmonic Civilization at the zenith of his power, it's conceivable that half of Europe would now be overrun, serving as a breeding ground for the Alien Species. But, if not for being driven into a corner by the Future Group, if the Golden Apples, once fervently sought after, hadn't become obsolete, would Carmen have ever resorted to such desperate measures? Jiang Chen is certain Carmen recognizes the danger of Harmonic Civilization, a civilization that seems to have invasion encoded in their very cells. In Murmansk, Russia's strategic stronghold on the Arctic Ocean coast and a mere ninety kilometers from the Russo-Finnish border, the situation is dire. Realizing the gravity of the crisis, the Finnish Minister of Defence, alongside the Vice President, made an urgent visit to Russia. The Finnish President had planned to personally attend, but diplomatic procedures and the need to stabilize the nation's internal affairs prevented him. Given the incident's closeness to the Russian border, a mishandling could even necessitate evacuating Murmansk. Russia took the incident seriously, with Sergei Shoigu, Russian Minister of Defence, and Bart, Director of the Russian Security Bureau, flying in from Moscow to meet the Finnish officials. Apart from the high-ranking officials of both nations, a foreigner with a unique status also participated in this meeting—or rather, a strategic briefing. Jiang Chen succinctly summarized the clandestine experiments by the Rothschild family, uncovered by Star Ring Trade, to the officials. He emphasized that the unapproved military operation in northern Finland was for the safety of both the nation and the world. This rationale effortlessly won the applause of the Russian officials, as it was a stance prearranged by Jiang Chen and Bart before the meeting. However, the Finnish officials were not so easily persuaded, and both the Vice President and Minister of Defence met the claims with skepticism. Seeing that he hadn't made the desired impact, Jiang Chen shifted to the meeting's focal point—the danger of the X2 Bacterium. 'At the heart of the military base, the source of infection we refer to as the 'Nest Core' can produce a distinct bacterium with properties akin to spores,' Jiang Chen elaborated. 'Our scientists have named it the X2 Bacterium. It's highly invasive and can easily infect organisms without antibodies, turning them into substrates for its reproduction. The infected will show heightened aggression and invasiveness, modifying their original DNA, leading to unusual enhancements. It's somewhat similar to what you'd see with Spider-Man or the Hulk.' 'So are you insinuating that soon, all Finnish citizens will become Spider-Men?' the Finnish Vice President asked, his tone laced with sarcasm. 'Ah... there's no need for immediate concern,' Jiang Chen clarified, circling an area on the satellite map and tapping the encircled pine woods with a marker. 'Do you see those withered pines? Those Alien Species... they can't leave the spore-affected area. Of course, we can't discount their potential to venture out in search of food or the possibility of the spores continuing to spread.' Jiang Chen omitted his deepest concern: the potential for an X2 adaptation or even an unknown X3 Bacterium. Biology excels at evolution, and after being defeated by his incendiary shells nearly four years ago, it's uncertain if Harmonic Civilization might have developed a new biological weapon. 'At present, only Star Ring Trade has the expertise to save you. Matters like these are best left to the professionals,' Bart, the Director of the Russian Security Bureau, emphasized. 'Wouldn't this disaster have been averted if it weren't for your actions!' At this, the Finnish Minister of Defence became infuriated, slamming the table as he exclaimed, 'Now you say only you can solve this—what reason do we have to believe you?' The Russian Security Bureau Director managed a strained smile, rubbing his brow and awkwardly looking away. Jiang Chen also felt somewhat awkward as he touched his nose and gave a light cough, 'To clarify, I am surely not responsible for today's situation, Carmen is. If you hadn't welcomed Arrow Corporation, leasing the northern wastelands for refugee camps, would we be in this predicament? Were you unaware of their research on your own soil, and don't you hold some accountability?' 'What would you do if we entrusted this to you?' the Finnish Vice President probed, his gaze fixed on Jiang Chen. 'Send in the Orbital Airborne Regiment,' Jiang Chen replied without hesitation. 'Aren't both of your Orbital Airborne Regiments currently deployed in Ukraine?' the Finnish Minister of Defence questioned, puzzled. 'In fact, we have another secret force that has been training for an extended period,' Jiang Chen disclosed, coughing gently. 'I had not planned to reveal this so soon, but urgency leaves me no choice.' As he spoke, he conveyed the notion of making a significant concession. The Finnish Vice President and Minister of Defence exchanged glances, their gaze moving between Jiang Chen and the Russian officials, finally settling on Sergei Shoigu, the Russian Minister of Defence. 'We regret to say we doubt your sincerity. We believe NATO is more capable of resolving the current issue—at least they would not violate airspace without notification. You were the first to break the rules of engagement, so do not blame us for this tough decision.' The issue of Finland's NATO membership has been debated since the Cold War yet remains undetermined. The upcoming parliamentary election is poised to set the NATO membership agenda, but the most significant hurdle is the public referendum, with Finnish citizens reluctant to abandon their neutral status. If NATO resolved Finland's crisis, even the challenging referendum might face little resistance. Finland joining NATO would mean Russia suddenly dealing with a new, armed defensive line spanning thousands of kilometers, with strategically important cities like Saint Petersburg and Murmansk just beyond. This scenario is Russia's greatest fear, one it wishes to avoid at all costs. 'Russia cannot accept NATO forces within Finland. You have other, better options,' Sergei Shoigu stood up, asserting, 'If you persist with the wrong decision, the situation will only deteriorate.' 'Is that a threat?' the Finnish Vice President countered coldly. 'That's a suggestion,' Bart intervened, aiming to moderate the tone. 'The Finnish people are confronting a life-threatening peril; nothing could be worse than the current situation. We appreciate your 'advice.' In fact, our President has already met with the NATO Secretary-General in Helsinki two hours ago. Goodbye.' With that, the Finnish officials stood and left. Sergei Shoigu attempted to keep them, but his expression remained frozen. 'Remember to use incendiary shells. They might be more effective against those creatures than bullets and pesticides combined,' Jiang Chen, unconcerned with the international dispute, advised. 'Moreover, if NATO does intervene, make sure they don't use 5.56mm ammunition. The keratinous armor of the Alien Species is naturally resistant to small-caliber rounds—deploying more soldiers would only result in more casualties.' 'And if you find yourselves at a loss, remember to call me.' The Finnish Vice President gestured dismissively, whether he heard Jiang Chen's advice or not, and exited with the Minister of Defence and their officials without looking back. (To be continued.) Chapter 1069: Bugs Do Evolve The conference room was eerily silent. Halfway through the agenda, Finnish officials from Partak Town had already made their exit. Sergei Shoigu, the Minister of Defence, caught between standing and sitting, exchanged a knowing glance with his secretary, who promptly came forward to tidy up the desk. The sounds of chairs moving and papers rustling filled the room as even the minister began to pack up, prompting the Russian officials to also gather their things and leave the long table. The meeting had ended prematurely, not even achieving half its intended goals. Jiang Chen, who had been analyzing the satellite map, tossed his marker aside and headed for the door. He had arrived with just one assistant and had little to pack up. On his way out, he dialed Aisha, asking her to book a warm dinner at the front desk. All he desired now was a hot meal; it had been a full twenty-four hours since his last proper meal. After being out all of last night and reaching Murmansk by helicopter with Kutepov, his first call was to the Hilton Hotel for a room reservation. Upon his return to the hotel, he collapsed into sleep without changing, until a call from Bart, the Director of the Russian Security Bureau, woke him for the meeting. It was now seven in the evening, and he had managed only a tube of fruit-flavored nutritional supplement before the meeting started—his stomach was protesting. As he stepped out of the government building, Bart called out to him. Without waiting for Jiang Chen to come over, Bart briskly approached, giving his shoulder a friendly pat and a broad smile. "How about dinner together? There's a fine restaurant nearby, and it's on me." "I've already reserved dinner at the Hilton Hotel; let me be the host," Jiang Chen responded, calling Aisha again to instruct the front desk to serve the dinner in a private dining room and to set an additional place. "Alright then," Bart agreed, seeing Jiang Chen's arrangements, and pulled out his car keys. "My car?" "That would be great," Jiang Chen replied with a smile. Unlike Sergei Shoigu, Bart drove himself due to his job's nature, in what appeared to be a Russian-made car unknown to Jiang Chen. Secured in the passenger seat, Jiang Chen fastened his seatbelt as the car roared to life and Bart's expression turned somber. "Comrade, you've brought us a serious problem." Jiang Chen gave him a sideways glance, slightly irked. "Why do you, like those from Partak Town, toss the blame onto me at the first sign of trouble? If your Alpha Squad had taken out Carmen, we wouldn't have all this mess! I heard it was just a 500-meter gap; you had the chance to eliminate him but chose to bomb an ammo depot instead?" Bart seemed taken aback, his brows knitting together. "Can one person really make that much difference?" Jiang Chen scoffed, leaning back to rest, "Give him a decade to develop, and he might transform the entirety of Russia just like that." "What do we do now?" Bart inquired. "We wait." "Wait?" "We'll wait for NATO to stumble there; they'll naturally remember us then," Jiang Chen chuckled softly. "You think NATO can't handle a few alien creatures?" Bart frowned. In his view, not even needing NATO's intervention, the Russian border guards could easily squish those extraterrestrial threats. Hearing such naïve words, Jiang Chen just laughed. "Just a few alien creatures?" Clutching the steering wheel, Bart fell into a reflective silence. Just as Jiang Chen almost dozed off, Bart ventured a question. "If I may ask, why are you so sure? I mean no offense... I'm simply curious; you seem very familiar with these situations? It was the same with the T-Virus, and now with this X2 Bacterium." Years of intelligence work had given Bart the sense that these two seemingly unrelated events were actually deeply connected. Jiang Chen's partially closed eye cracked open wider, giving Bart a longer look. Just as he was about to spin a convenient lie, he suddenly recalled the coveted Golden Apples that had leaked from the Rothschild-controlled facilities. It was those very Golden Apples that had forced a change in his plans. Perhaps it was time to open up? After pondering for a moment, Jiang Chen broke into a chuckle and said. "Yes, I am quite knowledgeable about these things, and I also know how Carmen got his hands on them. Want to know why?" "If it's not too much trouble." Though Bart seemed casual, Jiang Chen could clearly feel a deep interest in his tone. "Let's talk over dinner; we can take our time with the topic." Jiang Chen gave no answer but closed his eyes again, returning to his meditative state. With half an hour's drive to the Hilton Hotel still ahead, he needed to carefully consider how to articulate his story. Germany was in the throes of a revolution, too preoccupied to send support to their allies. The US aircraft carriers were too distant, and shifting them from the Mediterranean to the Baltic seemed unrealistic and would likely disturb the Russians' fragile sensibilities. The UK, having left the EU but not NATO, was the last to offer help. However, the British had clearly underestimated the danger of the 'Level Two Nest Core,' sending only a mechanized brigade, swiftly deployed to northern Finland via heavy-lift aircraft. Whether they heeded Jiang Chen's advice was unclear, but the Finnish government sent engineers to clear trees around the 'Infected Zone,' creating a fifty-meter-wide quarantine belt. Then the British Army unleashed twenty White Phosphorus Shells at the 'Nest Core,' aiming to sterilize the area before entering the Infected Zone. The outcome was unexpected; the White Phosphorus Shells did burst into brilliant sparks, but the flames quickly died in mid-air as if snuffed out. The charred spores soon rose from beneath the earth, replenishing what was lost. Upon realizing something was amiss, they extracted Spore Suspensions from the Infected Zone for the analysis and found that under high temperatures, these unicellular organisms rapidly consume themselves, secreting a unique High-Temperature Resistant Fluid that snuffs out flames by enveloping the burning material—cells with built-in fire extinguishers. Such a bewildering discovery left the biologists, brought in for the analysis of the Infected Zone's spores, stupefied. Even with their decades of experience, they could not fathom what was happening. Jiang Chen wasn't surprised by these developments. Bugs do evolve. If they have mastered the inconceivable feat of interstellar travel, extinguishing a mere fire is child's play by comparison. (To be continued.) Chapter 1070: Let the Experts Handle It! Attempts with white phosphorus shells and gasoline bombs proved futile; even flamethrowers were ineffective. Besides incendiary shells, the British had also tried various methods such as pesticides, insecticides, and even potent chemical weapons, which would be inhumane under normal circumstances, but there was no need for such considerations against a swarm of insects. Regrettably, the insects were utterly impervious to their chemical weapons; there was no reaction whatsoever. Furthermore, the UK had contemplated deploying larger-scale incendiary bombs, theoretically capable of drying out all the air in the Infected Zone at once, but the Finnish government disapproved. A larger-scale incendiary bomb would undoubtedly render the fifty-meter isolation strip useless, and if it accidentally sparked a forest fire, the damage would be catastrophic! This is the Arctic Circle, home to the pristine pine forests—living fossils. The Finns were already heartbroken over felling trees for the incendiary bombs. Moreover, the British couldn't guarantee that larger incendiary bombs wouldn't be 'frozen' by those bizarre spores. If they were prohibited from using them, so be it. It was an excellent opportunity to demonstrate their strength to their future allies and reassure them about joining NATO's ranks. The UK Ministry of Defence made a decision, and the dispatched commander didn't take it lightly, deploying two mechanized companies, totaling forty 'Ajax' armored fighting vehicles to lead the way, followed closely by over three hundred infantrymen in chemical protective suits. The battle plan was straightforward: eliminate all Alien Species within the Infected Zone within ten minutes, secure the entrance within twenty, then deploy Special Forces Rappelling into the underground bunker to eradicate the source of infection. The soldiers, donned in chemical suits, were oblivious to the mission's peril, jesting before the media that had the Nest Core appeared in London, the fire brigade might have handled it without their intervention. The emergence of the Nest Core drew global attention, and of course, the interview was broadcast live worldwide. In the same conference room as the day before, the satellite map on the large screen was replaced by a live interview from a Russian TV station reporter with the British forces poised for the mission in Partak. Initially, Jiang Chen had no desire to join the old Russians in watching the news, as he had a good idea of the eventual outcome. But since the Finnish Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoigu, had extended a personal invitation, Jiang Chen couldn't refuse without causing offense, so he attended. Honestly, watching a gathering of bigwigs quietly focused on the news felt quite peculiar. "Are you certain they can't handle it?" Sergei turned to Jiang Chen, asking incredulously, "I'm not gloating over the misfortune, but this is crucial for Russia's defense strategy. If the British succeed, it would mean an additional defense line of thousands of kilometers for us." "Just watch." Settling back in his chair, Jiang Chen glanced at the screen where the self-assured British soldier was featured and smirked. 'The London fire brigade?' Even if you enlisted every urban management officer from the Celestial Empire, Japanese high school students, and American vagrants, it would be to no avail! As the military convoy set out, the TV scene shifted, the reporter gave a close-up of the forty armored vehicles on their way, then the camera swiftly moved from the ground to the air. The helicopter kept a safe distance from the mechanized force, watching them enter the spore-enshrouded Infected Zone. Confident in their 'extermination' strategy, the British commander, with the Ministry of Defence's approval, exceptionally allowed some non-sensitive battle communications to be shared with reporters, to display NATO's combat prowess. As for the battle footage, due to military confidentiality, it wouldn't be disclosed. "This is the 12th Company, we've arrived at the target area, no anomalies detected so far." "Alien Species sighted. Safety off, open fire at will." The intense gunfire and the roars of the Alien Species lasted for two full minutes. The Russian officials before the screen, especially the Minister of Defence, gradually showed more interest. As military elites, the sounds alone told them that the British forces were likely in a grim situation. "...... We're engaged with the Alien Species! Their numbers are vast, but our firepower is superior—" "Damn it! They're so fast! F*ck! Infantry, fall back! I repeat, infantry, fall back! Charlis! You're insane, get your men out—zzz—" The communications were abruptly cut off, clearly, the British commander had realized that the unfolding events were no longer suitable for public broadcast. The only indicator left of the battle's ferocity for those in the conference room was the intermittent glow of gunfire amidst the murky fog on the screen. An eerie silence fell over the conference room as Russian military leaders exchanged bewildered looks. No one anticipated such a turn of events, no one imagined a mechanized brigade succumbing to a horde of mutant creatures... Except for one person. Jiang Chen. If they underestimated their anti-armor capabilities simply because they were insects, he was not surprised that the British suffered a setback. He was merely curious about how many armored vehicles could be safely withdrawn. As for the infantry, he didn't need to think about it; by now, they were likely reduced to gnawed bones. "There's been a slight mishap in the Nest Core clean-up. We will now broadcast a brief news update... "On the screen, the reporter, looking somewhat sheepish, announced. Now, even the footage was gone. Just then, Jiang Chen's wristwatch vibrated. "I need to step outside for a call." Murmuring to Sergei beside him, Jiang Chen rose and left the conference room. The call was from the Finnish Presidential Office. No need to ask how he knew; it was obvious. Stepping outside, Jiang Chen approached the window in the corridor, opened the holographic screen, and hit the answer button. The call connected, and the other side remained silent. After a brief, somewhat awkward pause, the person on the other end, somewhat reluctantly, broke the silence. "...... The British forces are retreating." It was as expected; regular armies are not mercenaries, and in times of peace, each life is precious. Now, with a battalion inexplicably lost in the Infected Zone and the entrance to the bunker unlocated, there was likely uproar back in Britain. "Oh." "The Americans want to observe for a while longer, but the spore coverage is expanding, now including the fifty-meter isolation strip," the President of Finland informed. Hearing this, Jiang Chen's expression was one of 'I knew it.' The British casualties provided the Nest Core with readily absorbable organic material, including human remains, which served as a better incubator for spores than wood or insects. With just a battalion's worth of force devoured, the Nest Core was already eager to expand its spore domain. This behavior was certainly in line with Carmen's modus operandi. With his suspicions confirmed, Jiang Chen's confidence in resolving this predicament increased. But at that moment, he refrained from speaking; the other end was clearly pleading. If he gave in too easily, it would be too lenient! He had initially intended to resolve this issue for free, but they had been reluctant. Now they were asking for help? Why the delay! "Hmm." Adjusting his tone, Jiang Chen spoke coolly. "Speak plainly if you have something to say." "Well... how about we leave it to you guys?" the President of Finland suggested, with a hint of desperation. Pretending to ponder, Jiang Chen paused before responding slowly. "The Infected Zone has grown substantially, and even the British mechanized brigade was at a loss. It seems quite challenging. Why not try carpet bombing? Although the spores can block combustion, it's hard to imagine they could also withstand high-explosive bombs, right?" "We've already attempted that, to no avail. The spores removed don't keep pace with their secretion, and the blasts have scattered them even further," the Finnish President explained with a wry laugh, "Let's cut to the chase. You're a businessman, so name your price." A sly smile crept across Jiang Chen's face as he responded genially. "300 million New Dollars." At the mention of this sum, the Finnish President's eyebrows twitched significantly. "...Could you consider a lower price?" The New Dollar was not cheap, and with the Euro recently devalued, it was unthinkable to allocate the entire annual budget of the Finnish Defence Forces. "If you can't afford the payment, we can consider another arrangement. For instance, you could sell Arrow Corporation's assets in Finland to us as a package. After such an event, we would only appraise their assets at 300 million New Dollars. Trust me, that's a very fair price, considerably higher than any bank's valuation," Jiang Chen stated, a hint of malice in his heart. Arrow Corporation, though a long-standing adversary, had mercenaries with no personal vendetta against him. Following this incident, Arrow Corporation would surely go bankrupt due to the Finnish government's hefty fine. Acquiring Arrow Corporation in Finland would mean inheriting over twenty thousand seasoned veterans—a significant boon for Star Ring Trade. Once integrated into their training camps and with improved benefits, these soldiers would soon be loyal to their new employer. If concerns arose about management, a complete overhaul was an option, while the rank-and-file could be vetted and absorbed, with surplus arms sold off to Africa. As for the two associated refugee camps, they could serve as leverage in negotiations with the European Union when used judiciously. Regarding the two accompanying military bases, Jiang Chen had substantial plans. The Finnish President, though reluctant, nodded in agreement. "Deal." Jiang Chen nodded, his smile cordial. "Pleasure doing business with you." "How soon can your team be here? If we're talking ten days or half a month, we might not be able to wait..." "It won't require that long," Jiang Chen glanced at the holographic screen for the time, "just give me five hours. And inform the British forces for me—tell them they can pack up and head home. Leave it to the experts." Chapter 1071: Nest Core A vast sinkhole, spanning several meters, dominated the military base's center. Deep beneath the chasm, some five hundred meters down, lay the Rothschild-crafted underground bunker, a structure wrought for experiments of the most clandestine nature. Now, this subterranean fortress was devoid of any vestige of human presence, swathed in sinister blood-red flesh bubbles emitting an arcane stench. Those who could suppress their revulsion and peer closer might see the flesh bubbles' surfaces teeming with dense clusters of pus blisters, each the size of a sesame seed. With each blister's rupture, a cloud of spore gas was unleashed. These myriad flesh bubbles tirelessly generated spores that ascended through the breach to the surface, contributing to the relentless territorial expansion of the Nest Core. At the underground research facility's heart, a fleshy colossus pulsed with bloated bubbles, its vast root-like system reminiscent of a prehistoric tree. This behemoth functioned as both the heart and 'central processor' of the Nest Core. Tentacles stretching from its foundation to its crest acted as conduits of communication, akin to data cables linking a mainframe to its peripherals. Embedded within its bowels was a coffin, or more fittingly, a 'cultivation chamber', sculpted from a resinous substance. In stark contrast to the flesh-red Nest Core, this obsidian chamber manifested a formidable solidity. Gazing through the semi-transparent membrane, one could barely discern a figure lying inside, their gaze locked on a series of digits displayed upon it. 【14731】 Four thousand were refugee recruits he had led into the abyss. Over three thousand stemmed from the personal guard brigade and the institute's researchers, while the largest share, seven thousand, was contributed by the mercenaries and rioters ensnared in the base's melee. The British had also recently augmented the tally by approximately six to seven hundred. Each soul yielded two units of organic matter, half of which he had already expended to fortify the Nest Core and spawn alien kin. "Insufficient," Carmen mused within the cultivation pod, contemplating whether his display of power had been too ostentatious. Had he not obliterated them so thoroughly, perhaps he could have seduced the British into a delusion of near victory, compelling them to send more fodder into this death trap, providing him with the additional organic matter required to augment his forces. But now, the British had adopted a stance of wariness. Apart from the relentless artillery barrages upon the area, they had refrained from further troop deployments. Evolving to a Level Two Nest Core demanded an astronomical five hundred thousand units of organic matter. There were two methods of garnering organic matter: the primal method of photosynthesis, a sluggish accumulation over time, and the far more rapacious and efficient method of continual consumption. By devouring the living and assimilating their essence, he could amplify his own existence. Carmen's preference naturally skewed towards the latter. If he were to rely solely on photosynthesis to extract organic matter from soil and air, it could take centuries before the Nest Core's dominion could shroud the entire globe. Yet, with unrelenting consumption, he could precipitate this evolutionary leap within a mere span of days. A venomous glint flitted across Carmen's visage at the thought. He had chosen this locus for the Nest Core precisely due to the adjacent refugee camp, teeming with nearly half a million souls. Had he devoured the denizens of the camp and Partak Town, he would have already transcended the first phase of evolution! A Level Two Nest Core would harness unspeakable power, extending the predation radius of the alien horde to a hundred kilometers and unlocking new 'troop types'. One such monstrosity, the Meat Mountain, was rumored capable of withstanding the onslaught of tank shells with its sheer girth. However, Jiang Chen's unforeseen intervention had thrown all his schemes into disarray. At this thought, Carmen clenched his teeth in vexation. Spores served as his eyes and ears; he could sense everything transpiring within the spore-enveloped domain. He was certain that he had 'seen' Jiang Chen that night within the military compound, and it was a pity he hadn't ensnared him. 【Alert, the host is still a considerable distance from the required five hundred thousand units of organic matter. It is recommended to upgrade troop types to ease through the initial phase.】 The thought, an advisory from the Nest Core, materialized directly in his consciousness. Communication through direct consciousness, forgoing the need for vocal cords, circumvented the barriers of language and expression, granting Carmen an unprecedented convenience. This was precisely why, after having witnessed the grandeur of a biological civilization through the Golden Apples, he held it in such high esteem. 【Upgrading troops? Your suggestion is prudent.】Carmen mentally concurred, closing his eyes to meld his consciousness with the Nest Core's nexus. A catalog of streamlined upgrade options materialized before him. After a meticulous selection, he allocated five thousand units of organic matter to fortify the 'Blade Warrior's' wings. Blade Warrior, the appellation he had ascribed to the mantis-like alien species. The augmented Blade Warriors would boast elongated, more potent wings, transcending their ancillary role in boosting leap strength, evolving into true wings capable of short flights. As Carmen allocated the organic matter, formless viscous fluids snaked through the ducts to the cluster of insect eggs before the Nest Core. Infused with the organic matter, the eggs began to mutate, as did the imminent new generation of 'Blade Warriors' ready to erupt from their confines. These eggs served as incubators for the alien species, a 'barracks' of sorts for him. At that moment, a severe tremor rattled the ceiling. With a slight lift of his eyelids, Carmen's lips curled into a cold smirk. The earth above the sanctuary had been reinforced by the Nest Core, with root fibers intricately woven, creating a 'bulletproof vest' layer half a kilometer thick, its resistance to explosions and seismic forces on par with steel-reinforced concrete. The British had hurled no less than a hundred shells at him, only managing to etch away a thin layer of concrete. It was solely because Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons had struck while the Nest Core was still nascent, before he had the chance to fortify the aperture... Abruptly, his expression darkened, and simultaneously, the Nest Core's consciousness broadcast an urgent alert within his mind. 【Warning, the protective layer has sustained impacts from external forces, causing fractures in structural tissues. Immediate use of organic matter for repairs is mandated, host.】 "Damn it! Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons!" Carmen cursed under his breath, now fully cognizant that he had underestimated the potency of Star Ring Trade's orbital arsenal. He had presumed the tungsten-core rounds would only inflict superficial damage to the Nest Core's protective carapace, but the harm was more severe than a mere superficial wound. The damage to the protective layer required a prompt infusion of organic matter for repairs, a significant setback given his already scant reserves. As the quantity of organic matter rapidly depleted, Carmen frantically rerouted it to the breaches. Then, a series of devastating fractures reverberated from above. Realizing the catastrophe that had unfolded, Carmen's features contorted in a visceral snarl. "Damn them!" (To be continued.) Chapter 1072: Overcoming with Force A formidable convoy of over forty armored vehicles entered the Infected Zone with an imposing presence, and just when everyone thought this would be a unilateral display of British might, the situation underwent a dramatic shift within a mere minute. No one knew how fierce the firefight within the Infected Zone was, but the entire world witnessed the outcome of the engagement. Of the forty armored vehicles, a mere five returned, and the entire infantry unit was lost. Colonel Moston, who commanded the operation, was unable to accept such a defeat at the hands of mere insect-like creatures. Not just him, the masses following the catastrophe on their smartphones were equally unable to accept this harsh reality. From Cagayan de Oro to Tokyo, the term 'Biohazard Crisis' repeatedly struck a nerve with people across the globe—a term once relegated to the realms of literature and film, now easily inciting global attention and panic. On social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Weibo, the discourse surrounding the X2 Bacterium reached a fever pitch. "Last time it was the T-Virus, this time the X2 Bacterium? God, have those capitalists lost their minds? Why would they create such things? Governments should legislate to ban such perilous research!" "Unbelievable, were those really British forces that went in? Are the UK's armored vehicles made of paper? Just a horde of alien creatures, why not just run them over? Could their teeth really bite through armor?" "End Times Survival Handbook, a decade's worth of survival tips from an apocalypse enthusiast, limited supply, act fast." "Deploy peacekeeping forces, this isn't a single nation's issue, it's a global crisis..." "I'm now curious, does every Arrow Corporation military base house such research institutes?" ... Colonel Moston, for the time being, was blind to the social media frenzy. He was now fretting over how to report this disastrous defeat to the Ministry of Defence and the Parliament. An entire mechanized battalion had been overrun without the slightest chance to retaliate! Good Lord, the Prime Minister had expected him to resolve this neatly and bring Finland into NATO's embrace. But now, with a ghostly pale face, he lacked even the courage to devise a battle plan, refusing to send more troops into the fray. Forget a brigade of mechanized forces; even an entire division might not suffice! The Finnish government, in desperation, half-threatened to seek a resolution from Star Ring Trade if they couldn't contain the Nest Core threat. Moston scoffed at Finland's stance, knowing this was not an issue of combat strength. If armored vehicles were being dissolved by acid, how could Star Ring Trade's mechanical exoskeletons fare any better? Better to let the scientists fully investigate the X2 Bacterium and determine what it really was. Moston had a hunch that if they could find a way to kill those Spore Suspensions, the alien creatures would eventually die out. "I admit we underestimated the Nest Core's might, and hastily sending troops into the Infected Zone was a mistake," Moston stated firmly to the media, "The scientific research team from London is already analyzing the DNA structure of these spores, and I believe it won't be long until they can design a method to neutralize the X2 Bacterium." The reporter probed further: "Colonel Moston, does this mean that the UK will abandon military aid to Finland?" "NATO will never abandon any cooperative partner, but this crisis extends beyond the capabilities of any single nation." "Good heavens... Look there! What is that?" As Colonel Moston was occupied with addressing the media, a cry of astonishment erupted from the crowd around him. A female journalist, looking skyward in amazement, pointed towards the Infected Zone. Cascades of 'fireballs' rained down from above. Despite the distance, the sonic booms as they pierced the sound barrier were distinctly audible. The cameras, which had been trained on Moston, now swiveled to capture the unfolding spectacle in the sky. In unison, a tremor that shook the earth to its core emanated from beneath everyone's feet, jolting not just their vision but also their very souls. Without a doubt, this marked the inaugural appearance of Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons before the lenses of the media. Moston was relieved to have the cameras off him; he knew all too well that his current expression was one of bewilderment. ... Farther off, a hundred kilometers away in the presidential suite of the Hilton Hotel in Murmansk, Jiang Chen lounged on the sofa with his legs crossed, overseeing the conflict between Star Ring Trade and the alien threat through a holographic screen, executing remote command over the battle. The space-based weaponry briefly cleared the Spore Suspensions shrouding the military base, and following the bombardment, Jiang Chen, utilizing a brief pause, observed the shattered terrain on the satellite map. "Hmm? It hasn't collapsed?" Gazing at the holographic screen, Jiang Chen expressed his surprise. Logically, even if the underground bunker extended over five hundred meters deep, it should not withstand the tungsten-core round's impact. These were tungsten-core rounds plummeting from a synchronous orbit; even if the entire five hundred meters were composed of reinforced concrete, by now it should have been reduced to rubble. The Nest Core was indeed an anomaly. Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed slightly as he issued orders to Ivan. "Continue the bombardment! If the first round is ineffective, initiate the second! Continue until their true form is unveiled!" The regenerative abilities of the alien creatures were formidable; minor wounds could heal at a visibly rapid pace with just a few breaths of air laced with spores. The British forces had executed multiple rounds of bombings on the military base, yet they had not truly killed many of the alien creatures. To humans, severed limbs might spell death, but to these organized alien creatures, it was a mere inconvenience, requiring only a brief respite in the Nest Core to recover. Even if they were obliterated on the spot, dragging the remains back would allow them to be recycled into organic matter and rebirthed into new alien creatures. Moreover, most of the alien creatures were concealed underground. Jiang Chen's strategy was straightforward and brute: a war of attrition, bombarding incessantly with space-based weapons! As long as the defense could be breached, if one blow did not vanquish them, another would follow, until the Nest Core displayed its true nature! These tungsten-core rounds were not targeted at the alien creatures from the outset, but at the obliteration of the underground bunker. All impacts were concentrated within a ten-meter diameter circle; even if the Nest Core's recuperative powers were as formidable as those of the alien creatures, Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons were not to be underestimated. For vertical penetration power, no nation on this planet could match their arsenal! Jiang Chen was unaware that his direct and forceful plan had Carmen, concealed underground, in a state of distress. First round, second round... One barrage after another of tungsten-core rounds descended from synchronous orbit. Jiang Chen was expending money, Carmen was consuming organic matter. Both parties were internally hemorrhaging, but obviously, Carmen, with limited resources, was the more pained. Soon, the Nest Core could withstand no more. How did Jiang Chen discern this? The satellite images made it clear. As the dust settled, the soil layer had been fully stripped away, unveiling the entangled roots beneath. Indisputably, these sturdy roots were the reason for the bunker's resilience, the soil fortified by them providing a defense akin to concrete. The Nest Core futilely expelled spore gas, attempting to mask its frailty, but Jiang Chen did not miss the opportunity, directing Ivan to capitalize on their advantage. The onslaught from synchronous orbit persisted, and when the Electromanta C-1, stationed in synchronous orbit, released its last tungsten-core round, the tentacles shielding the bunker above also fractured. With its defenses utterly disintegrated, the Nest Core laid bare the flesh bubbles hidden within the underground bunker. Upon witnessing this scene, Jiang Chen knew the moment had arrived, he immediately instructed Ivan. "The Nest Core has exposed its essence, cease the orbital weapon assault. Pass down my command, Third Powered Armor Brigade, commence the airborne operation!" "Affirmative!" Ivan answered with conviction. The relentless orbital barrage came to an end, fifteen arduous minutes having elapsed from its inception. The journalists, military personnel, and townsfolk stationed near Partak Town remained transfixed, their gazes locked at a forty-five-degree angle, captivated by the clear expanse above. Colonel Moston's mouth opened and closed in silence, wordless. The Finnish Minister of Defence at his side wore a grim expression, filled with regret for not having enlisted Star Ring Trade's intervention from the beginning. As for the reporters, their minds were already racing, contemplating the prose to accompany their accounts of this apocalyptic 'airstrike'. No one had quite recovered from their astonishment. Just when all believed the spectacle had reached its conclusion, a series of luminescent trails began to descend from the serene sky towards the earth... (To be continued.) Chapter 1073: Steel and Blood For the onlookers standing in front of Partak Town, it was merely a moment before the thunderous clash of steel and earth echoed from several kilometers away. The executives of YLE hastily gestured to their reporters, and soon the broadcasting helicopter was airborne again, heading toward the military base. Not just the media, but the British and Finnish Defence Forces were intrigued by Star Ring Trade's Orbital Airborne Regiment, dispatching two helicopters. Officially, they were to support Star Ring Trade if needed, but their true intentions were clear to all. Jiang Chen, observing via satellite, saw Finland's and the UK's maneuvers but remained unfazed. With the deployment of the powered armors, secrecy was no longer his concern. The 'Micro Regiment'—merely two hundred strong—had been under development for two years. Kept hidden due to the lack of formidable adversaries and to avoid an arms race impacting his economic strategies, the time to unveil them was now, as past concerns were rendered moot. As for the reasons, they would be disclosed post-conflict. The descent of fifty drop pods was swift; dust from the blasts had barely settled when two hundred fully-armed T3 Powered Armors, wielding Tactical Rifles, burst from the pods onto the spore-infested battlefield, advancing towards the Breach Point gouged by orbital weaponry. Sensing the intrusion, the Nest emitted a harrowing shriek, and 'Blade Warriors' with quivering wings soared from the abyss. During the bombardment, these aliens had sheltered underground, but now, drawn by the scent of life, their predatory instincts were unleashed, eager to rip apart their prey with razor-sharp Claws. But their predation was thwarted; these foes were unlike any they had faced before. 'Roar—!' A Blade Warrior lunged. Its curved legs sprung, and strengthened wings propelled it forward, serrated scythes aiming to cleave the nearest powered armor. Such force could rend steel, yet in a flash, an invisible Shield unfolded from the armor's arm. The Blade Warrior collided with the Shield, its assault futile, its keratin blades shattered. Its Shuttle-shaped Beak emitted a piercing scream. Retreating, the Blade Warrior raised its arms defensively, but the powered armor, with a Shield bash, broke through, and with a Tactical Dagger, pierced and eviscerated the alien. The encounter was over in an instant. Carmen, within the Hibernation Pod, was dumbfounded. He had never seen such formidable technology; it reminded him of rumors about the Koro Island Iron Man. After the Los Angeles Assault Incident, there were whispers of Star Ring Trade's 'Iron Battle Suit.' Some even speculated that Jiang Chen was the 'Iron Man' seen in Koro City, bearing a resemblance to the Heir of Stark Industries. Carmen, sweating, had not dismissed the rumors but never envisioned that Jiang Chen had not only crafted an 'Iron Battle Suit' for himself but had also equipped an entire military force with such costly gear! Amidst his astonishment, he had no alternative but to act. Though small, this force was Star Ring Trade's elite, and elites were few. If he could survive this initial phase, the entire forest would succumb to his Nest Consciousness. To strike at Star Ring Trade, even at the cost of flooding them with a swarm, he had to anchor this trump card here! Even at a great cost. Resolute, Carmen gritted his teeth, connecting his consciousness with that of the Nest. At that moment, the Nest's blood-red vessels pulsated like burrowing rodents, the shadowed flesh bubbles swelled tumultuously, and sesame-sized pus blisters grew to the size of green beans before bursting, releasing spores laden with Rage Factors. Every dark green eye turned blood-red in an instant. 'Roar—!' The roar became savage as all Blade Warriors frenzied, swarming the two hundred powered armors. Yet, before they could close in, they met the barrage of the fire net. Jiang Chen had tailored this batch of T3 Powered Armors for the Current World, featuring functional subdivisions to fit modern combat. The right arms, once uniform rotary machine guns, now bore modular attachments like Grenade Launchers, Expandable Shields, and Plasma Cutting Daggers, as dictated by battlefield requirements. The front powered armors kneeled, hoisting man-high Shields, their right arms emanating a faint bluish glow. The rear echelons raised their Triangular Barrels, unleashing a torrent of firepower. And behind, Powered Armors with anchored feet and 72mm Anti-Vehicle Cannons, ripped through the alien formation with High-Explosive Shells. Firepower alone made this two-hundred-strong unit more formidable than the British mechanized battalion—twice over. Considering mobility and defense, Jiang Chen could confidently claim they could overpower a NATO Infantry Division, airstrike support aside. The front Blade Warriors were decimated by the fire net; those reaching close quarters were bisected by Plasma Cutting Daggers protruding from behind Shields. The Keratinous Armor, impervious to bullets, was no match for the intense heat of Plasma Jets. Green blood and acidic spatter painted the battlefield. Carmen, hell-bent on a standoff with Star Ring Trade, wouldn't retreat. Pushing the Nest's incubation and digestion to the limit, he spared no resource, converting all organic matter into Blade Warriors and Spitters, and sent them to the front. The swarm's only advantage was its disregard for death. Under the Nest Consciousness, even the last alien would plunge into gunfire without a second thought. As the battle raged, the gap narrowed, shifting from suppression to close-quarter melee. Even the mighty armors began to falter, casualties emerging amidst the fray. Seeing this, a glimmer of triumph flickered across Carmen's face, confident that Star Ring Trade would falter first! With that, he pushed all his resources forward. But at that moment, his elation turned to despair, as his face grew pale with hopelessness. Through a Blade Warrior's eyes, he saw a series of flashes in the sky. Star Ring Trade's second air drop commenced. This time, it was Drone Hives, not soldiers. Before the drop, the powered armors engaging the aliens retreated orderly, maintaining fire, and leaving ample space for those emerging from the pit. As they reached the military base's edge, Drone Hives landed behind the alien horde. From these hives, thousands of drones swarmed towards the wound inflicted by the orbital weapons on the Nest. Too late to react, Carmen was helpless. The underground aliens, mostly on the surface, left only newly hatched ones in the bunker. Despite their numbers, they couldn't stop the drones that ignored their attacks and targeted the bursting insect eggs. Carmen's face turned a desperate green. 'Fuck!' One hundred kilometers away, Jiang Chen bolted upright on the sofa, his fist thundering down on the coffee table. 'Detonate!' Chapter 1074: A Swift End As the unmanned drones closed in on the insect eggs, they detonated abruptly, shrouding the surging eggs in a blaze and obliterating them in an instant. Mixtures of crimson and dark green plasma splattered from the ruptured flesh bubbles, the heat charring both blood and flesh. Part of this blood belonged to the Nest Core, and the rest to the Alien Species embryos, not yet fully formed. Carmen, ensconced in the cultivation chamber, felt a chill from head to toe... If he were still capable of feeling cold. A profound sense of defeat washed over him. The situation resembled a gamer's high from a winning streak, suddenly quashed by the enemy bombing their barracks. [Warning, extensive damage to the Incubation Section. Host, immediate repairs required.] The consciousness of the Nest echoed in his mind. Carmen hastily checked the reserves of organic matter. The sight of the glaring triple-digit number drained the last vestiges of color from his face. He had just allocated all his resources to the insect eggs, to hatch the Blade Warriors. But now, following the drones' kamikaze attack, his stock of organic matter had been severely depleted. Digesting the remnants on the ground was possible, yet converting them into organic matter would take time, dependent on the form of carbon present and the efficiency of the spores' photosynthesis. Exactly how long it would take was unclear to Carmen, but it would certainly be several hours. And would Star Ring Trade afford him this time? The breeding pace halted, the Alien Species' assault lost momentum. The Powered Armor Brigade, having secured their position, launched a counterattack on command, targeting the weakened aliens! Here, Spitters were shredded by the fire net, there, Blade Warriors were gutted by plasma cutting daggers, their corrosive dark green blood washing away the paint from the Powered Armor. Thousands of Alien Species might seem numerous, but with no reinforcements, their annihilation became inevitable. The confrontation between flesh and steel, the Harmonic Civilization's first clash with a pure civilization, concluded as the smoke settled. The dust cleared to reveal no more aliens emerging from the pit. At the forefront, a Powered Armor knelt, retracted its shield, and slowly rose from the ground. "Damn, is it over?" "It looks to be over at last..." A fellow soldier, covered in slime, responded with a heavy voice. As the battle subsided, no one removed their masks. The air was still thick with high-density spore clusters, dangerous even for those inoculated with the genetic serum. Some stood awaiting orders; others sat among the alien corpses, undisturbed by the revulsion. There were no cheers, only a collective sigh of relief. Forty T3 Powered Armors were scrapped, over thirty lives lost — a heavy toll for the nascent brigade, yet the spoils were of epic proportions. Nearly ten thousand Alien Species lay defeated by their fire net. It's fair to say, even an entire NATO division might not have achieved such a victory — perhaps even bolstering the enemy ranks instead. The Brigade Commander surveyed his troops, "Alright, gentlemen, our mission is not yet complete. Let's descend and eradicate this vermin. Let me check..." He tapped on his arm's control panel, piloting a reconnaissance drone into the depths. Before the aliens destroyed it, he saw the situation below, "About thirty remain. Who's still got the strength for one last push?" A soldier rose, steadying his rifle, "I'm in, I can still move." "I'm with you." Selecting eleven more, the Brigade Commander led them to the pit's edge, their vortex engines flaring as they dove. Twelve Powered Armors touched down, and hiding Blade Warriors lunged, poised for a final struggle. The Commander, unfazed, grasped an alien by the neck, calmly shooting it in the head before discarding the limp form. The rest, too distant to pounce, were promptly riddled by the soldiers' fire. Stepping past the corpses, they approached the Nest Core. Before them lay the remnants of the eggs and a mixture of dark green and crimson fluids. "Damn, this is vile." "The quicker we finish here, the sooner we go up." Sappers distributed thermite agents, instructing, "Insert the red end deep inside." While spores could snuff out flames, the Nest lacked this ability. By stuffing the incendiaries deep into the Nest Core, the burning would remain unaffected by the spore gas. Carmen watched the Star Ring Trade soldiers with growing panic. As thermite agents were secured to the Nest, his eyes reddened with rage, "No——!" The nearest soldier glanced at Carmen, smirked behind his mask, and thrust the thermite deep into the Nest's heart. Brilliant flames burst from the cracks, the Nest Core disintegrating rapidly under the intense heat. As he watched, Carmen felt his heart being torn apart. For this Nest, he had sacrificed his researchers, his loyal guards, his closest allies. Yet now, right before his eyes, it was being destroyed by Star Ring Trade. Hatred, fury, fear... A torrent of negative emotions twisted his face grotesquely. At that moment, the Brigade Commander approached, tapping the resin coffin and signaling to Carmen. He drew a Future Phone, unfolded it, and pressed it against the chamber's membrane. "We meet again." From the presidential suite at the Hilton Hotel, Jiang Chen regarded the figure in the chamber, "I never imagined our reunion would be this ironic." Carmen glared at Jiang Chen on the screen, "Are you here to mock me?" "Yes and no." Jiang Chen shook his head, pity in his tone as he observed the grotesque figure, "I'm simply wondering what brought my adversary to this state." Carmen remained silent, consumed by hatred. Jiang Chen noticed the black sphere overhead. "Golden Apples?" he mused, recalling the Rothschild family's susceptibility to Klein Particle Waves, an innate sensitivity to the cosmos's random waves. Carmen, already predisposed to Klein Particle sensitivity, was obsessed with the Golden Apples, akin to placing a magnet atop a television — it was bound to cause distortion. He had lost his sanity. Realizing this, Jiang Chen's interest waned. The conversation he intended to have with Carmen seemed pointless now. With a sigh, he cut the communication and instructed the Commander, "Make it quick for him." "Affirmative." The dark muzzle pressed against the chamber's membrane, Carmen watching dully as the gun pointed at his head. Bang——! The gunshot echoed, his consciousness plunging into the abyss without a sound. (To be continued.) Chapter 1075: The Pentagon's Worries Observers of this battle were not limited to the British and Finns present at the scene; the United States, across the Atlantic, was also closely monitoring the developments in Finland. When Star Ring Trade deployed their space-based weapons, a somber mood took over everyone. Later, as the Powered Armor Brigade and unmanned aerial vehicle airdrop tactics were introduced, the atmosphere inside the Pentagon's conference room turned icy. The footage captured by the British might have been blurry, but those watching through the screens could still sense the terror of the alien species flooding in like a tide and the formidable strength of the Powered Armor that resisted the alien onslaught. If K1 Type Exoskeletons were likened to bicycles, then Powered Armors would undoubtedly be the motorcycles. They not only provide soldiers with highly mobile armor but also serve as a pivot for firepower output, elevating the individual combat power of the soldiers to the extreme. From the standpoint of humanity, what the US Secretary of Defense least wanted to see at this moment was Star Ring Trade ultimately defeating the Alien Species. Ideally, as per a typical Hollywood script, both the British and the New Federal Reserve forces would fall to the aliens, and in the end, the US Marine Corps would emerge as the savior, waging a war to save all of mankind. The Secretary of Defense inwardly prayed for the swarm to overwhelm these two hundred 'humanoid armored vehicles,' but reality did not conform to his wishes. The moment the drone swarm penetrated the alien nest, the defeat of the Alien Species was sealed. When the last Blade Warrior had its head cleaved off by a Plasma Cutting Dagger, silence befell the meeting room. 'These hypocrites, they go back on their word! They clearly said there were only two Orbital Airborne Regiments; now how come there's another one?' a high-ranking Pentagon official couldn't help but curse as he broke the silence. Secretary Ashton Carter glanced at the officer and shook his head. Believing others who claimed there were only two Orbital Airborne Regiments was naive. There are plenty of undisclosed equipment in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and failing to get the news in advance can only be blamed on inadequate intelligence work. Nevertheless, it was an unavoidable situation; the counterintelligence capabilities of Ghost agents were just too formidable. The CIA had long attempted to infiltrate Star Ring Trade to steal space elevator technology, but all agents sent to the New Federal Reserve returned empty-handed, with some who overstepped disappearing altogether. At this moment, comrade Hillary, better known as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, spoke up. 'More than the Orbital Airborne Regiments and Powered Armor Brigade, I'm concerned about their space-based weapons. If they can deliver dozens of tons of tungsten-core rounds above our heads whenever they wish, it poses a grave threat to the national security of the United States,' she declared. Those present nodded in agreement. The Outer Space Treaty of 1966, which prohibits weaponization and militarization of outer space, was brought up, but in practice, securing absolute air superiority and a strategic vantage point for national security has long been a shared strategic goal among the major powers. Strictly adhering to the treaty would mean the non-existence of all high-orbit missiles—which is, of course, unrealistic. After a glance at those present, the CIA Director coughed lightly and spoke, 'Regarding their space-based weapons, we managed to acquire some tungsten-core rounds from Ukraine. CIA technicians have analyzed them and concluded that the technology involved is not complex; it's essentially a tungsten alloy sphere, roughly the size of a watermelon, with a guidance component akin to a gyroscope at its core.' 'Replicating their weapons is easy,' he continued, pausing with a trace of helplessness on his face, 'The real challenge is how to transport these tungsten spheres to synchronous orbit.' Without an economical way to deliver these spheres to synchronous orbit, the development of space-based weapons would be meaningless. 'Exactly,' the White House Military Advisor commented with a wry smile, 'Using rockets to send these things to synchronous orbit before dropping them back down is entirely redundant. The danger with Star Ring Trade lies in the absence of a binding international convention that limits the scale of private armaments. Without a way to intervene as they continue to expand, we are at a disadvantage.' Hillary tapped the armrest of her chair, pondering, 'What if we push for an international convention now?' 'We might end up the biggest losers,' the Secretary of Defense Carter admitted with difficulty, 'As you know, a significant portion of our annual defense budget goes to military contractors. They have, in no small terms, become an integral part of the US Army.' With Hillary included, the high-ranking officials from both the Department of Defense and the White House fell silent. Wall Street would be the first to oppose any action against private military contractors. Tampering with the military-industrial complex meant tampering with the wallets of all American consortia. Infamous private military contractors such as Blackwater, Triple Canopy, and Deyang International all have deep ties with Wall Street capital. With the 2020 Elections on the horizon, staying in position means winning the public's favor without excessively offending the American consortia. With Goldman Sachs recently collapsed, WASP consortia like Morgan Stanley and First Boston now dominate the North American financial sphere. No one wants to provoke those capital giants at this juncture. What's to be done? Hillary's brows furrowed as she pondered... The war was over, and under Jiang Chen's directive, the Powered Armor Brigade, having destroyed the Nest Core, took control of the military base. Seeing the outcome decided, the Brigade Commander of the British Mechanized Brigade approached the military base's entrance, requesting permission from Star Ring Trade to enter the premises. His reasons seemed sound, such as 'recovering the bodies of fallen soldiers' and 'removing the wreckage of the scrapped armored vehicles,' yet Star Ring Trade flatly refused. The reason for the refusal was straightforward: there were no bodies left to recover. The Alien Species devoured captured life forms for their flesh and blood immediately, using them as high-quality sustenance and incubators for spawning spores within the Nest. Star Ring Trade only promised that if any dog tags with English letters were found, they'd be sent to the British forces. Such excuses were far from sufficient for the British. Recovering bodies was secondary; most likely, not even the bones remained. Their true intent was to closely observe Star Ring Trade's Powered Armor and gather as much intelligence on this new equipment as possible. Besides this factor, their chief concern was the potential appropriation of the X2 Bacterium by Star Ring Trade. The impression left by the merciless Alien Species was profound, and the thought of them being used for military purposes was a chilling prospect. The best way to overcome fear is to possess a piece for oneself, much like with nuclear weapons. Brigadier Moston resolved that once they entered the military base, they had no intention of leaving. Star Ring Trade likely didn't have the audacity to confront the British directly. Once London's Scientific Research Team arrived, they were determined to understand the Nest's formation mechanism. Even if it wasn't for military use, they intended to archive a sample within their own national repository, ready for unforeseen needs. However, Star Ring Trade refused without courtesy, declaring the entire military base as private property. Even Finnish officials' attempts at mediation were futile. When Finland's President requested military assistance from Star Ring Trade, they had already sold the nationalized assets of Arrow Corporation at a discounted rate of 300 million New Dollars to Star Ring Trade. By law, the treaty between Arrow Corporation and the Finnish government now extended to Jiang Chen. For instance, this military base now belonged to the private assets of Star Ring Trade and was protected by Finnish legislation. The Brigade Commander of the Powered Armor Brigade had no plans for dialogue with Moston, and the two soldiers at the gate turned him away. Despite Moston's deep reluctance, he had no choice but to return to the military camp near Partak Town, report the situation to his superiors, and await the Ministry of Defence's decision. (To be continued.) Chapter 1076: Right Beside Us The great battle had subsided, and by dawn, a light snow began to fall. In late May, the Northern Hemisphere was on the cusp of summer, but the permafrost of northern Finland remained unaffected. Within the Arctic Circle, locals could still spot snow well into mid-June, should the Arctic Ocean monsoon pass through. At present, the military base near Partak Town flew the flag of Star Ring Trade high. The base, having undergone multiple bombardments, bore no intact structures. Following an agreement with Finnish authorities, logistical support was channeled through Russia by Star Ring Trade. Logistics personnel and a scientific research team who flew into Murmansk set up camp with marching tents outside the military base. Contrary to the X2 Bacterium Jiang Chen had previously encountered, these modified strains proved exceptionally tenacious, capable of surviving independently for extended periods in the absence of a Nest Core. As such, the decision was made to eradicate them, as their continued existence posed significant risk. Without inoculation from a genetic serum, the inhalation of a sufficient concentration of spore gas would trigger a 'zombification' response in any organism, especially in primates, seemingly due to their advanced brains making them more susceptible to these noxious bacteria. Upon the arrival of the logistics team, Jiang Chen's initial order was clear: annihilate the airborne spores and eradicate all infection sources. While an agent to kill the spores hadn't been identified, not all solutions necessitated technological intervention. The spores could quench flames, but since they sacrificed themselves to do so, and with no Nest Core to produce more, their pyrophilic trait would ultimately hasten their extinction. A simple flamethrower could yield unexpectedly effective results. The base remained enveloped in spores, with only those in powered armors and logistics personnel donned in orange chemical protective suits staying behind. Alien carcasses were amassed a kilometer from the base, drenched in gasoline and incinerated. The dark smoke that began the previous day persisted into the morning, visible from Partak Town miles away. In the command barracks adjacent to the base, Brigade Commander Moston, free from his powered armor and clad in a heavy cold-weather outfit, stood before his command table processing reports. '...Columbia TV from America has requested access to the base to film the underground bunker and remnants of the Nest Core.' 'Direct them to Star Ring Trade for authorization. We're soldiers, not gatekeepers,' Moston replied, his patience wearing thin. This was the fifth media outlet to approach the military camp, as global attention zeroed in on this base, eager to learn of Star Ring Trade's next move. 'Additionally, we've been contacted by Finnish Presidential Office officials this morning. The President seeks dialogue regarding the disposal of alien bodies, urging us to consider an eco-friendlier alternative to mass burning.' Upon hearing the update, Moston raised an eyebrow. 'Then communicate our stance: they either accept our method or find their own solution for these contagions. Should they require, we're willing to transport them to nearby warehouses at no cost.' 'Understood, sir.' The non-commissioned officer saluted crisply before exiting the barracks. Moston settled back, attempting a brief respite, but before he could relax, another officer hastened into the barracks, abruptly awakening him with a succinct six-word report that surprisingly didn't incite Moston's ire despite the interruption. 'Report! The boss is coming.' ... Around noon, a helicopter crested the mountains, descending gracefully onto the base's helipad. Jiang Chen, encased in a chemical suit and gas mask, disembarked. Though unaffected without the gear, the dense spore concentration suggested a more subdued approach was prudent. He was followed by Bart, the Director of the Russian Security Bureau, who was equally garbed in protective gear, surveying the chaotic aftermath of the base. Aisha had intended to accompany them, but with the stay in Finland lasting no more than two days, Jiang Chen had her return to Koro Island. Moston, in his powered armor, saluted Jiang Chen, who acknowledged the gesture. 'Your efforts are commendable.' 'It’s our duty!' Moston smiled. 'What's the status underground?' inquired Jiang Chen. 'Nest Core is confirmed deceased, no living aliens remain. The logistics team continues to purge the X2 Bacteria, while researchers from Koro Island are sampling the Nest Remains,' Moston reported. 'Lead us there.' 'Yes, sir!' Moston saluted. Following Moston, Jiang Chen and Bart approached the gaping pit at the base's core, once the entrance to the underground bunker. Star Ring Trade's tungsten-core rounds had collapsed it days prior. The logistics team, in support, had installed a makeshift elevator at the site. Descending to the bunker's entrance, five hundred meters below, they arrived at the heart of the Nest Core. 'This is the interior of the Nest Core? Those flesh bubbles on the walls are quite revolting,' Bart commented, eyeing the wall's residue with disgust. 'Consider it as such. Before the core's destruction, the Nest Core had transformed the entire bunker into its own habitat,' Jiang Chen clarified. Nearby, researchers were busy examining the insect egg remnants, their unprecedented DNA codes and existence challenging the scholars' very understanding of biology. Their dedication was palpable, as they immersed themselves in the study of these valuable specimens, a treasure trove for human civilization. While Jiang Chen had only glimpsed the Harmonic Civilization, his knowledge of them was almost non-existent. He harbored no illusions of discovering their vulnerabilities from the Nest Remains, yet it remained the sole method Earth's civilization had to glean insight into them. Despite the protective suits, Jiang Chen's identity remained unrecognized. After Moston received salutes from the guards, they allowed passage. In Moston's company, the two discreetly stood beside what was left of the Nest Core. Bart surveyed the miserable remains and through the damaged membrane of the resin 'coffin,' recognized a familiar face. 'Carmen Rothschild?' 'Indeed.' 'You actually did it—you killed him.' Bart mused, 'In my opinion, the International Court would have been the ideal destination for him.' 'Keeping him would have been a liability,' Jiang Chen said nonchalantly. He didn't know how much the Harmonic Civilization had revealed to Carmen. If they had disclosed his time-traveling abilities, it would pose a significant problem. The Rothschild family had generated countless Golden Apples, a lurking danger to him and to human civilization. Now, he was here to eradicate that menace! Jiang Chen signaled Moston, then pointed to the head section of the resin coffin. Moston got the hint, extracted a tactical dagger, and sliced through the resin to retrieve a black orb from within. As Bart caught sight of the sphere, his expression turned subtle. 'The Golden Apple,' Jiang Chen announced, receiving the sphere from Moston and assessing its heft, 'we once believed it to be a conduit to the future, but that's far from the truth.' 'It does facilitate communication, but its true essence lies in indoctrination—covertly infecting its holders, transforming them into minions. Whether Tanaka of the past or Carmen of the present, they're fundamentally similar.' Jiang Chen feigned distaste as he flipped the Golden Apple back to Moston, indicating it should be reinserted. Though Bart's countenance was obscured by his suit, Jiang Chen's seasoned instincts suggested his objective was likely achieved. With the German revolution nearing triumph and Russia probably having secured numerous Golden Apples from the insurgents, they might well unearth significant findings should they persist with their experiments. Before they deciphered the Golden Apple's utility, Jiang Chen needed to implant a seed of dread about these devices. 'The most alarming fact is, the civilization that the Golden Apples connect to isn't from the future.' Pausing, Jiang Chen cast a meaningful glance at Bart. 'Rather, it's right beside us.' (To be continued.) Chapter 1077: A Recruitment Ad that Packs a Punch Before the Munich Incident, Carmen had consolidated control over the Rothschild family's power by a series of maneuvers. Following the orchestration of his brother James's demise with the help of Star Ring Trade during the Pearson Church Massacre, he had essentially become the sole authority within the family. Consequently, with his death, the Rothschild dynasty teetered on the verge of collapse. Jiang Chen anticipated that, once the revolution in Germany prevailed with the Christian Democratic Union supplanting the New Choice Party, the first action would likely be settling the Commonwealth Society's accounts for crimes committed during their governance. It was foreseeable that the Rothschilds' assets, among others, would be auctioned off to satisfy the exorbitant fines imposed by the courts. The Rothschilds were poised to dwindle in the ensuing asset division frenzy, even if Jiang Chen remained passive. Their excessive wealth had indeed rendered them excessively vulnerable. Jiang Chen harbored no concerns about their swift decline. However, he was apprehensive about the destiny of the Golden Apples, previously under Rothschild dominion. With Carmen's demise, these Golden Apples would undoubtedly disseminate. It wasn't just Russia; Jiang Chen was convinced that nations like the United States, United Kingdom, France, and even China, on the opposite side of the globe, would covet these artifacts. Various powers would surely vie to secure them for study. The Harmonic Civilization had already infiltrated the communication channels of the Golden Apples. If global leaders failed to recognize the inherent danger, it was uncertain where the next Nest Core might manifest. Aboard the flight returning to Moscow, Bart ruminated on his dialogue with Jiang Chen in the underground bunker and the revelations within the Nest Core... "...Are you suggesting this is the work of the extraterrestrial civilization you mentioned?" Bart still struggled to accept the reality Jiang Chen had presented, his brows knitted in disbelief as he gazed upon Carmen in the resin coffin, "And the Golden Apples are merely a brainwashing tool?" "Precisely," Jiang Chen affirmed with a nod. "That's hard to believe." "It does sound like an April Fool's joke, but that's the stark reality. On June 15th, at the Outer Space Security Summit in Koro City, we will disclose all evidence we've accumulated on extraterrestrial civilizations through our space endeavors. I've shared everything I know with you candidly. Whether you take this to heart is your prerogative." Overwhelmed by the enormity of information, Bart was momentarily stunned. An extraterrestrial civilization? Was this some sort of jest? Even though Jiang Chen had hinted at this during their previous encounter in Murmansk, Bart's skepticism persisted. The notion that the Golden Apples—a prize the Russian Security Bureau had painstakingly obtained—were part of an alien scheme to invade Earth was inconceivable. It was difficult to accept that a scenario fit for a Hollywood epic could unfold before his very eyes. Yet, recalling the grave expression on Jiang Chen's face, Bart's skepticism began to waver. If the Golden Apples indeed possessed the ability to covertly transform their holders into pawns of an extraterrestrial force, they were undeniably dangerous. It was impossible to identify the brainwashed, nor would such individuals willingly come forward. If an unsuspecting brainwashed individual were to construct a Nest Core within Russia... A chill ran down Bart's spine at the thought. Reflecting on the Golden Apples' journey from the Rebels to the Russian Security Bureau and the numerous hands they had passed through, Bart recognized the gravity of the situation and made a decision. At the very least, he would wait until June 15th to assess the evidence Star Ring Trade would present. Until then, he resolved to seal the Golden Apples away, barring anyone from further access. Should they prove as hazardous as Jiang Chen claimed, it would not be too late to destroy them then... Through the lens of YLE, the Finnish national broadcaster, Star Ring Trade's orbital weapons and the formidable powered armor suits became known to every corner of the globe. The populace, once disheartened by the British military's defeat, were reinvigorated by the decisive victory of two hundred against ten thousand. The vile Alien Species, falling one by one before the stalwart steel armors, their dark green blood splattered amidst bursts of orange-yellow munitions, culminated in a climactic melee that set viewers' blood racing. "Absolutely epic, are those two hundred Gundams? Or two hundred Iron Men? I just want to know if joining Star Ring Trade means I can wear that gear. If so, I'm signing up for the Foreign Legion on their site right now." "@RobertDowneyJr, what's your take?" "That right arm equipped with a laser knife is so up my alley! The way it cleaved the alien in half was jaw-dropping. It's a shame the footage was blurry; if only the Finnish TV cameras were higher quality." Aside from frivolous social media banter, military forums were ablaze with debates over the practicality of these weapons. Enthusiasts split into factions: some believed that the so-called Powered Armor could revolutionize modern warfare, while others remained skeptical. "This individual soldier armor reminds me of World War I-era bulletproof gear, but with a mounted machine gun? I see no cause for such excitement—it's just a mechanical exoskeleton clad in steel. Rather than developing a contraption that encases a person, why not produce more tanks or armored vehicles?" "You're thinking too narrowly. What became of the British Mechanized Brigade? Practice is the sole criterion for truth! Infantry with the combined capabilities of protection, mobility, support, and even anti-armor will become the battlefield's unstoppable force—and they're mass-producible! Regarding welding steel plates onto an exoskeleton to create Powered Armor, you must be referring to Krupp's ‘Lightning’ series. But please, don't equate it with Future Group's military tech; they're not even in the same league!" Of course, not all discourse favored Star Ring Trade. With the biohazard crisis averted, the public began to ponder another issue: what significance did borders hold if Star Ring Trade could deploy a division-strength Powered Armor brigade to any world corner within hours? Provoked by opportunists, pacifists in cities like New York and Los Angeles conducted demonstrations, protesting Star Ring Trade's repeated militarization of space. However, these protests failed to gain traction. Despite the mainstream media, which typically echoed the elite's interests, siding with the protesters, online sentiment was decidedly pro-Star Ring Trade. Engrossed in compensation negotiations with the Finnish government, Jiang Chen had paid little attention to the internet. It was during a layover at the Moscow Airport that he discovered Star Ring Trade's Powered Armor Brigade had unexpectedly become a viral phenomenon. This unforeseen popularity took Jiang Chen aback. Although he had anticipated the Powered Armors would garner widespread governmental attention, he hadn't expected such a degree of public fascination. The long-term impact of this development was still uncertain to Jiang Chen, but one aspect was indisputable. The high-definition footage from YLE was tantamount to an extraordinary, cost-free recruitment advertisement for Star Ring Trade... (To be continued.) Chapter 1078: Drive Safely Days have passed since Star Ring Trade's military operation to eradicate the alien Nest Core, and the White House and The Pentagon had held a series of extensive meetings on the subject. "... I don't care what methods you use, but within three days, I need to see DARPA's project proposal for powered armor research, separated from the mechanical exoskeleton project. Don't worry about the budget; I'll discuss it with Congress. According to the Finnish Minister of Defence, this powered armor is projected to be an infantry squad's fire support, with a minimum of fifty kilograms in ammunition loadout and NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection. Moreover, it must provide absolute protection against ammunition calibers of 12.7mm and below..." In a small conference room within the White House, the President's Advisor was engaged in a one-on-one meeting with the DARPA Director. DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is colloquially known as the real-life S.H.I.E.L.D., and is involved in numerous defense and aerospace projects. This includes the Faraday Spray, designed to counter EMP weapons, a joint effort between DARPA and Lockheed Martin Corporation. Star Ring Trade had surpassed America in defense technology, forcing the Advisor to rely on DARPA. Having taken careful note of the President's Advisor's requests, the DARPA Director fiddled with his pen and tapped it lightly on his notepad. "We'll expedite the initiation of the project. Lockheed Martin Corporation has already achieved significant progress in exoskeleton research, and we can leverage the existing technology. Additionally, I suggest we initiate talks with Germany to obtain data on the improved 'Lightning' exoskeleton from the Krupp Consortium. They have nearly developed a working model of powered armor, albeit with some design flaws." "I'll have Secretary Kerry handle that," replied the Advisor. After exchanging further details, the DARPA Director closed his notebook, stood up, and prepared to leave. He had several meetings awaiting him and needed to prepare the project proposal within two days to meet the Congressional Budget Committee's hearing deadline. A billion-dollar research initiative wasn't something he could decide on with just a signature. As he reached the door, it opened, and a White House aide entered with a document in hand. "Madam Advisor." The Advisor turned to her assistant, asking with a serious tone, "What's the matter?" "The President of the New State has sent an invitation." The aide placed the document on the desk, "They are inviting us to the Outer Space Security Summit on June 15th." "Outer Space Security Summit?" The Advisor scoffed, her crow's feet deepening with disdain. Star Ring Trade dares to host a summit on outer space security? Who exactly is the one exploiting space resources for weapon development? "Draft a polite refusal for me. State that the US regrets Star Ring Trade's breach of the Outer Space Treaty. Until Star Ring Trade and New State provide explanations, we will not initiate high-level bilateral talks with New State." "Understood." The aide nodded and left. The Advisor leaned back, rubbing her tired eyes. Another meeting was imminent in ten minutes. As she was about to steal a moment of rest, she noticed the invitation letter. After hesitating, adhering to diplomatic protocol, she pulled out the invitation. Upon skimming the document, her eyes locked onto a key term, and she froze. "Extraterrestrial civilization?" As she read down the invitation, her expression fluctuated. When she reached the last line, she tossed the invitation on the table, stood up abruptly, and quickly followed the aide out... On June 1st, just after midnight, a Gulfstream jet landed at Koro City Airport. Surrounded by bodyguards, Jiang Chen, yawning, passed through the VIP corridor to his Rurka sedan. After a bodyguard opened the door for him, he settled into the passenger seat. Aisha, already in the driver's seat, skillfully started the engine and, upon reaching initial speed, pressed the magnetic levitation activation button, smoothly lifting the car into the air. Koro City's central thoroughfares had been upgraded for magnetic levitation traffic, with nearly half the private cars floating mid-air. The endless stream of traffic, alongside the neon lights of the streetscape set against the backdrop of skyscrapers and countless home lights, transformed the city into a resplendent jewel, a dreamy and beautiful sight. It was hard to imagine what this place looked like just four years ago. In the car, Jiang Chen unexpectedly received a call from Warner Bros. Christopher Nolan, who had previously collaborated with him, reached out, expressing Warner Bros.' keen interest in adapting the battle between humans and Alien Species for the 'bigger' screen, and inquired if Star Ring Trade could provide assistance during filming. Considering the positive exposure for Star Ring Trade, Jiang Chen accepted Warner Bros.' proposal, stating that as long as Star Ring Trade was portrayed positively, they would offer production support at no cost. After ending the call, Jiang Chen retracted the holographic display and stretched, still struggling with jet lag and feeling rather groggy. Aisha glanced at Jiang Chen with a concerned look and softly asked, "How was it in Finland?" "Busy, but it was alright." "Did you see Natasha?" "We had dinner before my flight." Jiang Chen turned to Aisha, who was focused on driving, and smiled. His hand casually wrapped around her slender waist. "Don't worry about me. Did you miss me these past few days?" Her cheeks flushed, Aisha whispered, "I thought about you every day." As his hand began to move, Aisha squirmed but did not resist. Jiang wasn't worried about accidents; magnetic levitation was far safer than road travel. Designated lanes at specific altitudes enforced speed limits, and at the highest cruising orbit, drivers could leave the steering entirely to the intelligent driving system. Initially, Jiang simply held Aisha's waist, but soon became more daring. The gentle lamb allowed his hand to wander higher... Biting her lip, Aisha, unable to contain her emotions and blushing deeply, steered the car into the cruising orbit and entrusted the driving to the intelligent driving system. She deftly turned and straddled Jiang's lap. With her arms around his neck, Aisha looked into his eyes with her clear, sapphire-like gaze. Caught under such scrutiny, Jiang, typically bold, felt shy. "Err, you should concentrate on driving—" Before he could finish, Aisha's warm lips silenced him, and her tender tongue invaded... Beside them, the cityscape, awash with colors, flew by beyond the tinted glass. In such a moment, everything naturally fell into place. Jiang felt the fatigue of several days melt away with the warmth of their closeness. Within the glittering night, a tale of speed and passion unfolded... (To be continued.) Chapter 1079: The Epilogue of Conflict Xia Shiyu glanced at the wall clock for the third time, releasing a deep sigh before murmuring, "Why hasn't he returned yet?" Half an hour ago, Aisha had driven off to the airport to fetch Jiang Chen, prompting Xia Shiyu to take a refreshing shower. Despite the summer's embrace, Xia Shiyu, freshly bathed, hadn't rushed to dress. Instead, her damp hair was wrapped in a white towel, and she was clad in a bathrobe, seated on the living room couch. She reveled in the fantasy of Jiang Chen's flushed, panting expression upon seeing her, which coaxed a gentle smile onto her lips. Suddenly, realizing she was indulging in embarrassingly intimate thoughts, Xia Shiyu blushed. With a light cough and clenched fists, she took several deep breaths to regain her composure, resuming her usual poised and ethereal demeanor. Yet, the gaze she couldn't help but direct towards the window, along with the glint of love and anticipation in her eyes, betrayed her inner turmoil. As the minutes ticked by, and it was well past one o'clock, concern began to cloud Xia Shiyu's calm facade upon another glance at the clock. 'Could it be a traffic jam?... Impossible, maglev cars don't experience traffic. Could there have been an accident?' Anxiety mounting, Xia Shiyu quickly picked up her smartphone from the coffee table and dialed Jiang Chen's number. The phone rang for what felt like an eternity, unanswered. She then tried Aisha, only to discover her phone was off. Worry gnawed at Xia Shiyu. Just as she stood to dress and investigate, the villa's door finally swung open. The headlights flickered briefly as the familiar Rurka sedan slid into the garage. Soon after, two figures entered the living room. Relieved at their safe return, Xia Shiyu approached Jiang Chen and asked with a hint of reproach, "Why are you so late?" Jiang Chen, sheepishly, replied with a smile, "Got held up on the road. Why haven't you gone to sleep?" Xia Shiyu scrutinized Jiang Chen with suspicion. Something was amiss. Normally, her appearance in just a bathrobe would elicit a distinct reaction from him, but now his calm seemed too unwavering. What she didn't realize was that Jiang Chen, having recently exerted himself to the limit, was now in a state of post-exertion clarity, impervious to even the most provocative sights. Unaware of Xia Shiyu's puzzled thoughts and feeling slightly uneasy under her probing gaze, Jiang Chen self-consciously touched his face, asking softly, "Is there something on my face?" Xia Shiyu shook her head, then turned her gaze to Aisha. Aisha, cheeks flushed, averted her gaze. Realization struck Jiang Chen, and he internally cursed. Busted! Indeed, Xia Shiyu had caught on and, with a mischievous grin, moved closer to Jiang Chen, tenderly linking arms with him. "There does seem to be something. Let me take a look." The scent of lilacs filled Jiang Chen's nostrils as the damp hair, still covered in a mist, cascaded down beside her exquisite face, leading to an expanse of fair skin that hinted at hidden depths. The proximity to such beauty caused Jiang Chen to react with a mix of unease and pleasure. "There's quite a bit, actually," Xia Shiyu carefully examined Jiang Chen's profile, nodding earnestly. After a jealous glance at Aisha, her 'murderous' smile remained unaltered, "Let's go upstairs, I'll help you clean up thoroughly~" With that, Xia Shiyu, holding the front of her bathrobe with one hand and grasping Jiang Chen's arm with the other, briskly made her way upstairs. Jiang Chen's expression—a blend of amusement and chagrin—stirred a measure of sympathy from Aisha. But the young girl merely offered a silent second of condolence in her heart before humming a lively tune and dashing to the upstairs bathroom. In Koro City's sweltering summer heat, her skin felt sticky. She longed to shower and then slip into bed for a blissful night's sleep. ... It wasn't until noon that Jiang Chen, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, finally sat up in bed. The woman who had shared his slumber was already up and about. As the old adage goes, 'the fields may never be overworked, but the oxen toiling might just die from exhaustion.' He had used every trick in the book the previous night, leaving Xia Shiyu pleading for mercy with his exhausted body. Yet, the committed CEO managed to rise on time for work the next day. At that thought, Jiang Chen chuckled, shook his head, then swung his legs off the bed and tossed aside the comforter. Hearing movement within the bedroom, the attentive Aisha entered with clothes, dressing Jiang Chen with a gentle touch, and softly inquired, "Do you have any plans for today?" "Yes," Jiang Chen stroked Aisha's hair affectionately, "the entire day is dedicated to the two of you." Savoring his warm touch, Aisha smiled softly and suggested, "Spend more time with Sister Shiyu. She's always waiting for you at home alone, and I occasionally have the chance to accompany you out. Even though she rarely speaks of it, I can sense that her love for you is just as deep as mine." Gazing into those clear eyes, Jiang Chen felt a twinge of regret. As he opened his mouth to speak, Aisha's soft fingertip pressed against his lips. "No need for words." After murmuring, Aisha tiptoed to gently kiss his lips. With a gaze filled with affection, she reached out to neaten his collar. "It's time for lunch." Jiang Chen, moved by her proximity, couldn't resist wrapping an arm around her waist, whispering in her ear, "May I have a taste of you first?" "Not now, you have to head to the office this afternoon." Bowing her head to touch his chest with her forehead, Aisha softly insisted, "Don't put off the important tasks, or Sister Shiyu will feel jealous again." Jiang Chen was certain that if he insisted, Aisha wouldn't resist. However, taking Xia Shiyu's feelings and the harmony of his inner circle into account, he heeded the young woman's advice. After sharing lunch, Jiang Chen rested on the sofa for a bit before driving to the company. Ascending to the top floor in the elevator, he stopped by Xia Shiyu's office to greet her. While she didn't express it, Jiang Chen could plainly sense Xia Shiyu's delight at his afternoon visit. What mattered to her wasn't how engrossed Jiang Chen was in his work—she had long been accustomed to shouldering those heavy tasks for him—but his willingness to spend more time with her. She didn't expect her share of Jiang Chen's affections to exceed Aisha's, his steadfast partner through thick and thin; she only hoped not to lag too far behind in their emotional connection... Settling into his office, Jiang Chen requested his striking secretary to prepare a cup of coffee and summoned David Smith, CEO of Future Bank, from downstairs. Before long, Mr. Smith appeared before his desk. With work to be done, Jiang Chen got straight to the point. "Within three days, I need to see 150 billion New Dollars in Future Bank's accounts, available for discretionary use. Also, send me the reports on Daimler, BMW, and the Volkswagen Group. And compile a list of top German companies in the electric industry—email that to me as well." Hearing Jiang Chen's instructions, Smith's face displayed his astonishment. A seasoned finance professional, he was keen on the subtlest shifts of capital on the international stage. Without Jiang Chen's prompting, Future Bank had been gearing up to capitalize on the European economic downturn, with liquid assets at the ready. His team was now strategizing on where to begin for optimal returns and the highest success rate. Companies like Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen, with their technological prowess and market potential, were naturally prime investment targets. Yet, such acquisitions weren't impulsive decisions; even with a substantial premium, they depended on the German government's willingness to sell. Still, Smith hadn't foreseen his boss's vast influence, capable of potentially securing the pillars of the German automotive industry. Would the German government simply stand by and watch their industrial mainstays be claimed by foreign investment? "No problem," Smith confirmed. Though surprised, he had no recourse but to nod in agreement. "Then make it quick." "Yes, sir." After Smith departed, Jiang Chen accepted the mocha from his secretary and leaned back in his chair, savoring the brew contentedly. The conflict had ended, the capital had been deployed, and the casualties had almost ceased. The German Revolution hovered on the precipice of triumph, with Carmen perished in Finland and the Commonwealth Society, led by the Rothschild family, faltering. Now, the true climax of the conflict was about to unfurl. The moment to distribute the spoils had arrived! (To be continued.) Chapter 1080: Frenzied Acquisition In the northwestern German city of Bremen, a man of Germanic heritage was frantically packing his bags in a budget hotel. Amidst his rush, he accidentally sent his phone tumbling from the table to the floor. Quickly stooping to retrieve it, he shoved it into his pocket, cursing under his breath. 'Damn that Carmen, nothing but a liability! How did I ever get mixed up with him... Damn it!' Still cursing, he snapped his suitcase shut and strode towards the door. Karl-Friedrich Krupp, a name that once resonated with prestige in Germany's upper echelons, now lived like a vagabond, wrapped in a coat worth mere euros, staying in cheap motels, and always hiding behind sunglasses and a baseball cap, fearful of being recognized. He found himself reminiscing about his brother, Glennar Krupp, who had vehemently opposed any alliance with the Rothschild family and had been the cornerstone of the Krupp family. If only he hadn't been blinded by power, had he warned Glennar about Carmen that fatal night, perhaps the Krupp family's fortunes would be different. Exiting the elevator, he banished these impractical musings. Reflecting on the past served only to aggravate his distress. A flicker of hope ignited within Karl-Friedrich as he stepped into the hotel lobby. If he could just reach South America, lie low for a while, and later discreetly funnel his Cayman Islands funds through an offshore company, he could still enjoy a wealthy lifestyle. A hundred million dollars would suffice for the remainder of his life. The Krupp family's fiasco was now for his two brothers and sister to handle. Upon leaving the hotel, his presence immediately caught the attention of four men in black suits who stood up and moved towards him from all directions in the lobby. Realizing he was the focus of their interest, panic surged through him. He spun around to flee, only to discover there was no way out; within moments, he was surrounded. The man standing directly in front of him presented a badge. 'Mr. Karl-Friedrich Krupp, I presume?' 'You must be mistaken...' Karl-Friedrich's voice trembled with apprehension, 'I am Francis Aude, a businessman hailing from South America in the food processing industry. I am merely here in Germany on an inspection...' However, the agent was unyielding and proceeded, 'We represent the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection. Mr. Krupp, you face over twenty charges, including treason. You must come with us.' Desperate, Karl-Friedrich attempted to push past the man beside him in a bid for freedom. But his slight stature was no match for the experienced agents. The man next to him didn't budge, effortlessly restraining Karl-Friedrich's desperate efforts to escape. 'No! I won't go anywhere! I need to catch a flight! Help! Someone...' His screams grew increasingly shrill as he struggled in vain, his condition as pitiful as it was desperate. The federal agent, seeing no cooperation from Karl-Friedrich, gave a decisive nod to his assistant. 'Take him away.' 'Understood!'... On June 3rd, the German People's Liberation Front marched into Berlin unopposed, with the city's citizens lining the streets to welcome them. The revolution, which had been simmering for months, finally came to a victorious close after a month of armed conflict. On June 5th, Evelyn, the exiled government leader, returned from Russia to the Chancellor's Office in Berlin, bringing an end to his years in exile. Standing before the German people, he was sworn in as Chancellor, representing the Christian Democratic Union. That same afternoon, twenty-seven members of the New Choice Party faced charges including war crimes and crimes against the federal constitution, with the possibility of life imprisonment without parole. Concurrently, several European companies, including the Rothschild Bank and Krupp Group, suspected of offering substantial political contributions to the New Choice Party, were prosecuted by the German government. The Supreme Court swiftly froze their assets within Germany and initiated expedited trial proceedings. If convicted, the Rothschild Bank could be slapped with a trillion-euro fine—a sum far beyond the Rothschilds' reach. Evelyn had no intention of collecting this money. After the sentencing, shares in various companies held by the Rothschild Bank would be nationalized and auctioned. The proceeds would be channeled into the national treasury to revitalize an economy paralyzed by revolution. As per the agreement, Jiang Chen secured shares from the German government at a 20% premium, surpassing the European consortiums, including the Rothschilds, to become the majority shareholder of the automotive giants Daimler, Volkswagen, and BMW. With the European Union's integration crumbling and the euro's value plummeting, the exchange rate to the new dollar plummeted to as low as 1:3. One hundred and fifty billion new dollars, when exchanged for euros, resulted in a four hundred billion deal on the currency market. Of this, two hundred billion euros were loans from Future Bank to the German Central Bank. One hundred billion euros were invested in acquiring a 37% stake in Volkswagen, a 41% stake in Daimler, and a 39% stake in BMW, and the remaining hundred billion euros were an impromptu investment by Jiang Chen in five additional electrical industrial companies, including Siemens and Bosch. In the division of the European consortium's assets, Jiang Chen's Future Group emerged as the dominant victor, branding Germany's key industries with the Future Group's insignia. Jiang Chen had also considered acquiring the Krupp Group, but Evelyn proved less accommodating this time around. The Krupp Group was the lifeblood of German industry. Despite their ill-advised alignment with the New Choice Party, the Supreme Court refrained from meting out harsh punishment. As a traditional Prussian nobility not of Jewish descent, the Krupp Group had never been integral to the inner workings of the Commonwealth Society. With new leadership at the helm, the Krupp Group resolutely sided with the victors, decisively distancing itself from the Rothschild family and the Commonwealth Society. Evelyn decided against excessive scrutiny, and thus a chapter was closed. The European Union's integration efforts had not even survived a hundred days before Carmen's demise brought the farce to a sudden, anticlimactic end... (To be continued.) Chapter 1081: Another Possibility As the heart of the EU, the triumph of the German Revolution inspired the beleaguered peoples of Europe. The downfall of the Rothschild Empire hastened the pace of 'de-rightization' across European nations, leading people to question whether the choices they made two years ago were indeed correct, and if the rise of far-right parties truly steered their countries in a better direction. In stark contrast to Europe’s turmoil, the economy of Asia on the other side of the globe was on a steady climb. Particularly in that nation sprawling across the vast waters of the Western Pacific, where its GDP was skyrocketing as though aboard a space elevator. On June 10th, emissaries from Japan proactively arrived in Koro City, spearheading a consortium with Central Electric Power Company and Tokyo Electric Power Company, to broker an expanded agreement for power imports. This would increase the total amount of electricity imported for the latter half of the year by 31% to compensate for two domestic nuclear power stations that had ceased operations. Currently, the rate of Helium-3 extraction in Guanghan City far outpaces consumption, and the second Nuclear Fusion Power Plant is nearing completion, with ample excess capacity. For such an agreement, Jiang Chen was, of course, wholeheartedly receptive. It wasn't just Japan; the much-desired Chinese market also loosened its policies, dispatching numerous power company delegations to the New Country for exploratory visits. As the world's number one consumer of electricity, China's power market is larger than that of the United States and India combined. If China were to retire half of its coal power, it would spell astronomical profits for Star Ring Trade. As of early June, the first and most critical step of the Global Electricity Network Project had been completed. Thanks to the concerted efforts of many, Star Ring Trade's submarine cables had successfully enveloped the entirety of Australia and covered eighty percent of the countries and regions in Asia, accounting for 88% of the total domestic electricity output. Benefiting from the boon of affordable electricity and based on the proportion of imported electricity in national usage, the industrial cost reduction for countries part of the Global Electricity Network Project reached up to a maximum of 1.7%, with a minimum of 0.3%. This one or two percentage points reduction might seem trivial, but when applied to a GDP measured in trillions, the resulting energy is beyond imagination! Not to mention the myriad of benefits concerning the ecological environment, investment climate, competitiveness of exported goods, acceleration of electrification, and weakening of domestic industries' dependence on the energy market. In essence, governments that have tasted the fruits have, in turn, signaled positively, sending their entrepreneurs to the New Country for negotiations to possibly increase their import quotas. The New York Times went so far as to proclaim that the New Country had become a 'nation on a pole.' The Washington Post, on the other hand, published a cartoon rich in irony, depicting leashes stretching out from the Western Pacific and tethering the surrounding nations, regardless of their size. Regardless of how the media spins it, the countries that have bought tickets are already on the fast track to electrification. Having tasted the sweetness, there's no rationale for them to leap off. Through a network of submarine cables, Jiang Chen has harvested not just a continuous cash flow but also solid diplomatic capital. Why has the dollar dominated the global market for over half a century? One of the main reasons is that any nation seeking to develop its light and heavy industries cannot forgo oil, which is intrinsically linked to the dollar. If your nation's crude oil production fails to meet domestic demands, then you must stockpile more foreign reserves as a risk aversion measure. Now, the same principle applies as Asian countries are bolstering their New Dollar reserves. When the rise and fall of the New Dollar can sway the industrial and residential electricity costs of multiple nations, even if Koro City is not the financial hub of the world, the New Federal Reserve indeed possesses the potential to challenge the dollar's hegemony. This isn't about finance; it's about tangible power. ... With the Outer Space Security Summit only five days away, Jiang Chen has dispatched invitations to ten major global powers, subtly implying in the invitations that the topics of discussion will relate to extraterrestrial civilization. To date, all ten recipients of the invitations have confirmed their intentions to send high-level ministers to attend. The summit is set to proceed without a doubt. For Jiang Chen, the crucial issue is what evidence to present at the meeting. Currently, the space telescope that he has brought over from the post-apocalyptic world has been installed on the space elevator and dispatched to geostationary orbit. While Jiang Chen is not precisely aware of the colonial ship's exact coordinates, he is privy to its origin and destination—and that is quite sufficient. The Gliese 581 star system, roughly 2 degrees north of Beta Librae, lies 20.5 light-years from Earth. A week prior to the dispatch of the invitations, the Astronomical Observation Group of Star Ring Trade's Aerospace Department conducted a prolonged observation and analysis of the star system, and ultimately they unearthed an astonishing... For Jiang Chen, an anticipated revelation. The probability of life on planet Gliese 581g has been assessed at 90%. 'Incredible...' Holding a dossier brimming with astronomical data, Kelvin entered Jiang Chen's office and expressed his disbelief, 'Your hypothesis is correct; there indeed exists a potential for life. However, I can confidently assert that even if life exists, it could not possibly have developed a civilization beyond the Stone Age.' Jiang Chen lifted an eyebrow and asked with a smile, 'Oh? Why's that?' 'Firstly, due to tidal locking, the habitable zone on the planet is restricted solely to the area around the terminator line, which determines their spatial limits for living.' As he spoke, Kelvin extracted a spectrograph from the stack of documents and laid it before Jiang Chen, 'Next is the crux of the matter. The planet's elemental composition is abundant in hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, but it's markedly deficient in mineral elements like iron and aluminum. Coupled with the gravitational data we've observed, it's most likely that a variety of arthropod insects inhabit the terminator line, and even mammals are nonexistent!' Upon hearing this, Jiang Chen nodded approvingly. Granted, this was with the aid of 22nd-century observation equipment, but to deduce so much valuable intelligence from limited data was already quite a feat. 'But have you contemplated an alternative possibility?' 'An alternative possibility?' Kelvin furrowed his brow. 'We have always assumed that the progression of civilization is linear: from the Stone Age to the Iron Age, then advancing from the feudal era to the Industrial Revolution, and ultimately stepping through the gateway of the information age into the future.' 'What's incorrect about that?' Kelvin challenged doubtfully. 'A conclusion derived from a single frame of reference cannot be universally applicable. We cannot negate the potential for different forms of civilization just because the trajectory of human civilization is linear,' Jiang Chen explained. 'You're suggesting that a group of insects might foster a civilization? Stop joking; they...' Kelvin began to shake his head, about to remark that they lacked even the most basic appendages, but he abruptly came to a halt. He was suddenly reminded of the recent military operations by Star Ring Trade in the tundra of northern Finland. There, the vaunted Power Armor Brigade of Star Ring Trade seemed to have encountered an army of alien species that had emerged from insect eggs. Why had Jiang Chen directed Star Ring Trade's Aerospace Department to survey the Gliese star system, why had he unexpectedly journeyed to Finland before the X2 Bacterium outbreak, and why was he so firmly convinced of the Nest's peril from the very outset... All the clues coalesced in Kelvin's mind. He looked at Jiang Chen, thunderstruck, as he eked out a few words. 'Are you suggesting...' 'Precisely,' Jiang Chen nodded solemnly, 'The inception and conclusion of the X2 Bacterium is not as publicized to the outside world as merely a research mishap. From the beginning, it has been a stratagem by an extraterrestrial civilization.' (To be continued.) Chapter 1082: Underdevelopment? Upon departing Jiang Chen's office, Kelvin's thoughts incessantly replayed the serious conversation he just had with his boss. The Outer Space Security Summit was looming, a mere five days away, where Star Ring Trade was set to present concrete evidence to the world's leaders, revealing the existence and hostile intentions of extraterrestrial civilizations... Frankly, proving such an assertion was hardly necessary. When two civilizations, each with their own distinct values, come into contact, the notion of trade is a non-starter. As each perceives the other as nothing more than insects, it appears that the only way to establish dominance on the food chain is through conflict. War. Looking at the document in his hands with a complicated gaze, Kelvin thought about the mission his boss had entrusted to him just a minute prior. For the first time, he truly grasped the weight of the responsibilities resting on his shoulders... ...... Instead of heading straight home after work, Jiang Chen took a solitary boat trip to Coconut Island. This island had been entirely repurposed by him into a transshipment hub for resources between the current world and the apocalypse. Each month, cargo ships docked, unloading unsellable foodstuffs, household supplies, and on occasion, sealed containers packed with advanced industrial machinery, Sixth District's T3 Type Powered Armor, and other cutting-edge technological products. Though the island had no permanent military presence, it was protected by a full squadron of unmanned combat drones. No foreign operative had ever managed to infiltrate this 'mysterious little island'. After mooring his boat at the dock and having his identity verified by a reconnaissance drone, Jiang Chen made his way to the central warehouse. In a corner lay the 'Hamster Killer No.1', a machine that Jiang Chen had named himself. Lin Ling had previously used this machine to transport a chubby hamster from the current world to the post-apocalyptic one and back, marking a significant breakthrough in trans-dimensional living being transport. While transporting humans was not yet feasible, this was a significant first step. Jiang Chen had never imagined that the device would be needed so soon. Seated next to the machine, Jiang Chen extracted several vials brimming with a dark green substance from his pocket and placed them in the center of two discs. He then strapped on the gauntlets filled with wires and turned on the machine. As he watched the electrical arcs jump and flicker, he steeled himself and hit the switch. After a bit of effort, he managed to send the vials to the post-apocalyptic world. Quickly removing the gauntlets, he switched off the machine and crossed over himself. ...... One vial contained substances extracted from the remnants of a Nest Core, while the others contained spore and insect egg extracts. The cells within the vials had not undergone the process of inactivation, allowing for the movement of the unidentified substances to be visible within the dark green medium. Upon receiving the vials from Jiang Chen, Lin Ling immediately submerged herself in her laboratory work. Not long after, the lab door swung open again, and Lin Ling emerged, gesturing for Jiang Chen to come over to a specialized microscope. Alongside the vials he had provided, Jiang Chen noticed two other familiar ones. 'The sample you've brought is significantly different from what we've retrieved from Shelter 005 and the Nest Core we encountered in the city center. Their DNA codes, however, share a number of similarities. The Nest Core you came across is undoubtedly an evolved form, but due to its underdevelopment, many of its functionalities have not manifested,' Lin Ling elucidated. Upon hearing this, Jiang Chen's eyebrows twitched involuntarily. 'Underdevelopment?' It had taken hundreds of tungsten-core rounds and an entire brigade of Powered Armor to subdue this formidable adversary. And now he was being told it was underdeveloped? If they allowed it to reach full maturity, would they stand any chance at all? Lin Ling solemnly nodded in affirmation. 'Precisely. If it is provided with an abundance of organic matter and sufficient time to undergo photosynthesis, to digest and incorporate these materials, the Nest Core would gradually evolve to its mature state. Based on a simulation of its entire DNA sequence, a mature Nest Core would become an unfathomable terror.' She paused, her tone growing grave, 'With our current level of technology, I cannot envision a method to wholly eradicate it. Each spore cell possesses the capability to develop into a complete Nest Core, and their division is now unlimited. Unless we manage to exterminate every single spore, it is inevitable that it will resurface from some obscure corner.' After listening to Lin Ling's detailed briefing, the potential for the Nest Core's rapid evolution sent a shiver down Jiang Chen's spine. For these extraterrestrial beings, Earth was a completely alien environment. Whether it was gravity, atmospheric composition, or the magnetic field, understanding these factors didn't necessarily translate to full adaptation. In this war, humans initially had the advantage of fighting on familiar terrain. However, with each encounter, their alien adversaries evolved at a staggering rate. If there were several more Nest Core incidents, it would be challenging to predict the posture the Harmonic Civilization might adopt when their colonization fleets made landfall. Realizing the deeper implications of the situation, Jiang Chen paused briefly before issuing an order. 'Compile all available data on this Nest Core, with particular focus on the genetic similarities between the X2 Bacterium and the T-Virus. I need both a hard copy and a digital file—the digital copy should be a comprehensible holographic representation.' 'Hey, do you think I'm your secretary? This is a lot of work, you know!' protested Lin Ling, puffing out her cheeks. 'Ten boxes of mango pudding,' Jiang Chen offered as a compromise. Lin Ling pondered for a moment, then replied with a hint of bargaining, 'Fifteen boxes, strawberry flavor.' Jiang Chen chuckled and nodded. For her, no request was too burdensome. 'I'll bring them along next time. But I thought you were fond of the mango flavor?' Lin Ling playfully stuck out her tongue and shyly looked away, 'I've had an overabundance of mango; I haven't even finished the batch you brought me last time.' While compiling the entirety of the Nest Core data was no small endeavor, for Lin Ling, a digital entity, it presented no difficulty. With the promise of pudding secured, she gave her assurance to Jiang Chen that everything would be prepared within a maximum of three days. Leaving the lively research institute, Jiang Chen passed through the backyard gate and made his way back to the villa. He had informed Aisha beforehand that he would be staying in this world until Lin Ling had finished compiling the Nest Core data. This information would be critical at the impending Outer Space Security Summit. Whether it would draw the global community's full attention was now contingent upon it. (To be continued.) Chapter 1083: Lurking Threats At the Morgan Stanley skyscraper on Wall Street, New York, an informal Federal Reserve shareholders' meeting was in progress. Seated near the entrance was Daniel Morgan, the incumbent patriarch of the Morgan family. Joining him around the conference table were representatives from the Rockefeller family, the Rocky family emblematic of the Boston Consortium... Even the Giannini family, proprietors of the distant Californian Consortium, had sent their delegates. To say those eligible to sit at this table were as symbolic to Americans as the image of Franklin on the hundred-dollar bill would not be an exaggeration—except these figures were the living embodiment of their wealth. A solitary decision from this assembly could induce financial earthquakes. Frankly, the wealth corresponding to a third of the world's capital was concentrated within this moderately-sized room. "To commence, a toast to our shared victory," Daniel Morgan lifted a champagne flute from the table, loftily raising it as his eyes swept across the attendees, "Victory is ours—the WASP's—and so is Wall Street!" The term 'WASP' aligned with the acronym for the WASP Consortium, and its members often referred to themselves by this appellation. Old Rockefeller, with a knowing smile, also raised his glass in accord. Dispensing with unnecessary pomp, twelve glasses were raised in honor of the consortium's collective success, promptly drained following Daniel's cue. Twelve servers approached, offering towels with utmost deference. After use, the towels and glasses were tactfully cleared from the conference room. Having swiftly discarded his towel onto the server’s tray, Daniel surveyed the table with a sense of fulfillment. Among the titans of finance present, he, at forty, was the youngest and one of the most triumphant. Once the servers had left, Daniel clapped softly, signaling everyone to direct their attention to him. "Yesterday, Morgan Bank concluded the acquisition of key assets from Rothschild Bank, including shares of Citibank and others. It's my privilege to announce that we have decisively expelled those troublesome financiers from the street at our feet." Appreciative applause rippled around the table, with old Rockefeller participating with a subtle clap, though his eyes flickered with a thought-provoking luster. Daniel modestly acknowledged the commendations from the core members of the WASP Consortium directed towards him and his illustrious surname. Mentioning the Rothschild family's control over America inevitably leads to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve, effectively America's central bank, commands the macroeconomic regulation of the 'world currency.' A mere increase in interest rates could cripple vulnerable economies, turning months of industrial labor to naught and piling up national debts—a fiscal doomsday device. And this 'nuclear weapon' was in private hands. Federal Reserve Board members, nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, are technically government officials, but the Owen-Glass Act established twelve reserve districts, each with an independently chartered district reserve bank. The equity of each district's Fed is proportionally subscribed by its member banks based on their assets. Take the New York Reserve District as an example, where recent disclosures show Citibank with 15%, Chase Manhattan with 14%, Morgan Trust with 9%, Hanwha with 8%, and Hanover with 7%. These institutions often have the backing of financial dynasties like Rockefeller, Morgan, and Rothschild. Goldman Sachs collapsed last year, and now the Rothschild lineage has been unequivocally ousted, with their stakes in Citibank, Hanover, and more divided between the titans Rockefeller and Morgan. If Wall Street in 2018 was a shared stage for Jews and Anglo-Saxons, by 2019, it had been claimed by the WASP Consortium. Old Rockefeller interrupted Daniel's celebratory stupor with a soft cough. "We can save the festivity for tonight's banquet. Gentlemen, there are urgent matters that necessitate our immediate attention." "Certainly," Daniel affirmed, his smile betraying no irritation. Without uttering a word, old Rockefeller beckoned with a gesture; his secretary, perceiving the signal, stepped forth and laid a document upon the conference table. Straightening up, old Rockefeller adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses and perused the document. "On the eleventh of June, just yesterday, Japan's Central Electric Power Company and Tokyo Electric Power Company expanded their power import contract with Star Ring Trade. Considering Japan’s total electric consumption last year, Star Ring Trade has effectively secured a monopoly on twenty percent of the nation’s electrical supply." As this revelation was made, those present exchanged contemplative glances, with a flicker of astonishment in even Daniel’s eyes. "This information hasn't yet been made public, and you may not have been notified. I owe my intel to a certain government official." With meaningful looks, old Rockefeller canvassed the room, "There's no need for further elaboration; you've no doubt sensed it already." "We are relinquishing our grasp on the situation in Asia." This proclamation sent a wave of consternation through the assembly. Each person was a representative of a significant consortium, a colossus of Wall Street finance; with their acumen and intuition, they wouldn't miss such a pivotal shift. However, in recent times, all had been preoccupied with Europe, so immersed in extracting every last morsel from the Rothschild carcass that they overlooked the developments on the other side of the globe. "The dollar’s supremacy is being challenged; perhaps toppling the Commonwealth Society so swiftly was an oversight." "What are our alternatives? Are we to resurrect them from their graves?" "We might consider bolstering the Krupp Consortium. As long as there's a new challenger to counter the Future Group—" "That's less feasible." Cutting through the burgeoning discussion, Daniel shook his head, his fingers interlaced contemplatively before him. The previous sense of victory had dissipated, giving way to an awareness of the crisis looming over the WASP Consortium, "We must curb Star Ring Trade's continued expansion of their sway. The ominous signs are evident; if we allow their global electricity network project to advance unimpeded, we'll find ourselves increasingly cornered." "Precisely," Rockefeller nodded, his gaze methodically scanning the assembly, "I'm aware many here have engagements with the Future Group across various sectors, but if they unsettle the dollar's bedrock, I trust you all grasp the implications." The financial empire of Wall Street is predicated on the dollar. Wielding the levers of exchange rates and markets, Wall Street’s magnates have reaped the world's wealth for nearly a century. If the dollar were stripped of its 'world currency' stature, and central banks worldwide began to divest their dollar holdings, every Federal Reserve note could devolve into mere paper. The paper-built financial empire of Wall Street would disintegrate overnight. The subsequent two hours of the meeting served as a clarion call for all, Daniel included. Everyone was roused from their state of celebratory intoxication. The Jewish financial consortium had crumbled, yet the beasts that feasted upon it remained hungry. Now, their predatory gaze was fixed on the Pacific’s far shore. As the threat to their collective interests became apparent, the WASP Consortium united like never before, dedicating these two hours to devising a containment strategy against Star Ring Trade’s 'global electricity network plan.' Following the adjournment, consortium representatives briskly exited the venue. Daniel Morgan, the convener of this meeting, remained in his seat, reclining contemplatively in his chair. In that moment, he recollected a phone call from a month prior with Carmen. The once-formidable Rothschild family had humbled themselves, seeking his assistance, yet he had nearly instinctively rebuffed Carmen’s overture. "...On the contrary, I am overwhelmingly convinced that one day I will be grateful for today's decision... right?" His fingers tapped lightly on the table's surface as Daniel replayed his past dialogue in a whisper, but now, his voice carried a shade of hesitation, lacking the decisiveness it once had.
