Chapter 1303: Only You (1) 'What is the meaning of this?!' Grand Elder Donggong demanded, his voice filled with anger as he tapped his cane. 'Our Ancestor will be here shortly, so please, Grand Elder Donggong, be patient. You will understand our actions soon,' the lead man responded. Grand Elder Donggong knew exactly whom they referred to as 'Ancestor.' He was somewhat perturbed, uncertain of Pei Yi's reasons for coming. To have a feud with DK was no small matter, especially in Country R, where despite everyone's desire to oust DK, it remained an unattainable dream. Minutes later, Pei Yi's vehicle arrived. He stepped out, his attention quickly shifting to a nearby car. An Xiaoning caught sight of him and, keeping her mask and wig firmly in place, also disembarked. Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind. 'You've arrived,' An Xiaoning called out. Pei Yi gave her a once-over and actually chuckled. He moved closer and whispered, 'Wow, with this get-up, they'd have a hard time guessing it's you, right?' 'Exactly, I don't want them to know who I am yet, that's why I asked for your help. It's not the right time yet.' Pei Yi's gaze inadvertently fell on Wu Lianzhi. 'What are you doing with him?' 'There's a situation to handle.' He straightened up, facing the Donggong family with a casual smile. 'I wonder what my kin has done to offend the Donggong Clan to the point of them wanting her dead? Do you truly dare to challenge DK's might?' The Donggong family turned pale at his words. Pei Yi's kin? Since when did he have kin? Elder Madam Donggong spoke up, 'We honestly had no clue about Mr. Pei's kin...' 'Good, now you do,' Pei Yi retorted coldly, his voice carrying an edge of steel. 'I hope that's clear.' 'If Mr. Pei claims she's his kin, then by all means, take her with you. As for Donggong Lianzhi, his name remains in our family records, and he has yet to be formally disowned. He is still of the Donggong Clan, and how we deal with him is our family's business.' Before Pei Yi could reply, An Xiaoning seized the moment to cry out to him, 'Brother, he's my boyfriend, and I'm pregnant with his child. You can't just leave him behind.' Pei Yi had intended to rescue only her, but the situation had suddenly turned complicated. Yet, his style was to be assertive and imperious. If he wanted to get something done, this was hardly an obstacle. 'Elder Madam Donggong, you've heard her. He's practically my brother-in-law now, and they're expecting. To hand him over to you is to deprive a child of their father. Do you really think I would agree to that?' Elder Madam Donggong knew very well that if Pei Yi took them away, they wouldn't be able to openly deal with their grandson in the future. Despite her fear of DK's influence, she couldn't show weakness. 'Mr. Pei, that will not be possible. Our family has its traditions, and outsiders have no right to meddle in our affairs.' 'Didn't you hear that he's going to be the father of my kin's baby? Are you going deaf in your old age?' Pei Yi shifted his intense gaze to Wu Lianzhi. 'What do you think? Are you a member of the Donggong Clan?' 'This morning, when my mother tried to poison me, I renounced my ties to her then and there. And when the Donggong Clan plotted to kill Miss An and her people, I made my position clear. Though the name Donggong Lianzhi still exists in the family registry, I no longer carry the Donggong surname. My name is now Wu Lianzhi, and I am no longer a part of the Donggong Clan!' His words resonated with determination and a chilling resolve. Declaring this in front of so many witnesses solidified his decision. 'It's not for you to decide!' Elder Madam Donggong snapped. 'Once you enter our Donggong doors, in life you belong to us, and in death, you are our ghost!' 'Grand Madam Donggong, do you not worry that Country S may issue a formal protest over your plot to kill Miss An, which she has already uncovered? Are you in any position to punish and deal with me now?' Wu Lianzhi spoke with an unfamiliar and fearless tone. 'I've had dealings with Miss An Xiaoning.' Pei Yi's smile slightly widened. 'She's not the type to forgive and forget a grudge. You sought her life; would she let it go unpunished? Enough with the chit-chat. My time is valuable, and I'm taking both of them with me.' As the Donggong family attempted to interject, he warned, 'Unless you want a bloodbath here.' And so, the Donggong family could only watch as their surefire catch flew the coop. Fuming, Elder Madam Donggong and Grand Elder Donggong were beside themselves with rage. In the end, Elder Madam Donggong conceded defeat. 'Fine, remove his name from the family records, and annul his family registry!' 'We must return to Country S.' Pei Yi gave her a sidelong glance. 'So you use me and then leave? Didn't you promise to fulfill one of my requests? And now you're already talking about returning?' 'I urgently need to go back for an issue, but I did promise you a request. What is it?' 'My request might make things difficult for you...' 'Then don't bring it up. Make one that won't be difficult.' Pei Yi faced her squarely, his gaze unyielding. 'You haven't changed a bit. Accompany me for half a month.' 'What do you mean by accompany?' 'The same as before.' An Xiaoning stared at him, her expression a mix of concern and defiance. 'No, first, no chains, no restrictions on my freedom. Second, half a month is too long. Two days.' '...' Pei Yi's smile slightly dimmed, but his eyes held a playful glint. 'That's too much. Five days, not a day less. You made a promise, and you'll have your freedom.' 'Can I first return to my country?' 'No.' '...' Wu Lianzhi, sitting in the car, listened to their exchange and couldn't help but wonder if there was more to their relationship. Could it be that their relationship was not entirely proper? Their conversation seemed to suggest it. But if that were the case, their lack of discretion in his presence was astonishing. 'Let him return to Country S first, and I'll stay with you alone, okay?' 'I won't harm either of you, stay together.' His tone was final. An Xiaoning said no more. They were close to Qingping Mountain, so they arrived quickly. Returning to this place, she was flooded with mixed emotions. Upon seeing An Xiaoning, Qin Guo couldn't hide her displeasure. As they walked in, she rolled her eyes. She wondered in exasperation why her esteemed ancestor had once again invited this harbinger of misfortune into their fold. Chapter 1304: Only You (2) After delivering the pastries and tea, Qin Guo, seized by curiosity, ventured, 'Elder of the Donggong Clan, may I know who this gentleman is...?' 'Your name?' asked Pei Yi. 'Wu Lianzhi, I believe I've mentioned it already.' 'I overlooked it.' Pei Yi responded coolly, then instructed Qin Guo, 'Please prepare a room for him.' 'Certainly, sir. And for Miss An, should I arrange one as well?' 'No need.' Wu Lianzhi had surmised correctly; it appeared he would be sharing accommodations with An Xiaoning. An Xiaoning caught the peculiar look he threw her way when glancing between her and Pei Yi, and immediately deduced that he had misconstrued their rapport. She couldn't explain why, but she loathed the idea of anyone misreading her connections with men—Jin Qingyan being the only exception. Her thoughts drifted to Jin Qingyan, leaving her feeling helpless. 'Lianzhi, come with me; there’s something we need to discuss.' 'Of course.' Once they were alone, she probed in a subdued voice, 'Have you misunderstood my association with Pei Yi?' 'Isn't it apparent that you two are...?' 'Not in the slightest. Normally, I sleep on the sofa we were just seated on. Even when he had me restrained, I would always end up sleeping on that couch.' 'He doesn’t harbor affections for you?' 'Dispense with such idle gossip.' An Xiaoning gently tapped his shoulder, 'We'll stay here for five days, then it's back home.' 'Understood.' Fang Erlan had been running ragged these last few days, with a relentless schedule of reshoots and promotions that filled her waking hours to the brim. Despite Xiao Chenyang's assiduous efforts to ensure she was well-nourished, she had still managed to lose a noticeable amount of weight. 'I fear I won't be able to accompany you in the upcoming days.' Xiao Chenyang revealed, after glancing over An Xiaoning's message to Fang Erlan. 'What tasks are you undertaking?' Xiao Chenyang had yet to share with her the truth of Jin Qingyan's dual personality, opting for discretion, 'There's an urgent issue I need to address, but I promise to return as promptly as I can.' 'I will come with you.' 'Your filming and promotional duties, remember?' 'They can wait until my return.' Xiao Chenyang tenderly caressed her head, reveling in her evident anxiety and reliance on him, 'I'd feel at ease with you by my side, knowing you’re in safety. However, this instance requires my solitary attention.' 'What is so urgent?' Fang Erlan pressed, 'Without an explanation, I cannot let you depart.' Faced with her anxious gaze, Xiao Chenyang conceded, 'You must vow to secrecy, this cannot reach another soul.' 'Without question, I will tell no one.' In a grave tone, Xiao Chenyang admitted, 'Qingyan has disappeared without a trace.' 'Vanished... could you elaborate?' 'He has an alternate personality, which has now gone missing. His whereabouts are unknown. It's as if he has evaporated. He might even have crossed borders, to where, we do not know. Hence, I must orchestrate a search. Moreover, with An Xiaoning in DK, I must make a sojourn to Country R. There resides someone from the Wu Clan who bears similarities to me.' 'Who is this person from the Wu Clan?' Xiao Chenyang clarified, 'Our country's once-renowned Witchcraft Cauldron lineage had cursed An Xiaoning and Qingyan. Then they inexplicably vanished, only to be found now. Their progeny have not carried on with the witchcraft traditions. Instead, we stumbled upon an individual akin to myself, presumably versed in the Witchcraft Cauldron arts. We must either capture or ensure he does not remain a threat to us.' Fang Erlan felt as if she were living within a fantastical saga, 'An Xiaoning is safe, isn’t she?' 'Yes, she's unharmed and will return shortly.' 'Then proceed. I will not accompany you; I refuse to be an encumbrance or a cause for concern. I'll request Sister Mei Yangyang to fortify my protection.' Xiao Chenyang stroked her hair, 'When will Qingyan come back to us?' 'Is he not your senior brother? Why do you address him by name and not with respect?' 'I prefer it this way. I seldom called him 'senior brother,' mostly when our master was around. Otherwise, it's always been informal between us—we've been close since we were children.' 'I see no point in arguing.' Xiao Chenyang planted a kiss atop her head, 'I shall leave as soon as the bodyguards arrive. Now, call Sister Mei Yangyang; I wish to instruct her personally.' 'Very well.' Fang Erlan fetched her phone and contacted Mei Yangyang. 'Sister Mei Yangyang, Chenyang would like a word.' Mei Yangyang responded affirmatively, 'Alright.' Passing the phone to Xiao Chenyang, he pressed it to his ear, 'I will be preoccupied with pressing matters for several days and will not be by Erlan's side. Please send eight bodyguards for her protection.' Fang Erlan hastily interjected, 'Four should be plenty.' 'Not nearly enough.' He countered, 'Send them without delay.' 'Alright, they'll be on their way shortly.' 'Very well.' Xiao Chenyang ended the call and turned to her with detailed instructions, 'In my absence, please ensure you eat well, rest adequately, and sleep immediately after finishing work. Refrain from using your phone late at night; it's detrimental to your eyesight.' 'I'll heed your advice.' An Xiaoning's spirits lifted with the news of Xiao Chenyang's arrival to Country R, fostering hope for Jin Qingyan's swift return. Instead of folding paper cranes to while away the time at Qingping Mountain, she had taken to practicing yoga on a sumptuous rug. Pei Yi, engrossed in his work, would occasionally glance up to observe her yoga postures. Even without much conversation, her mere presence seemed to brighten the room, and he felt a noticeable improvement in his mood. 'With the Marquis Jiaping of the West no longer present in DK, who is taking the reins?' 'He was the founder of DK. In his absence, there's no one else with the authority to fill his shoes.' While attending to his computer, he broached, 'Do you intend to remarry Jin Qingyan?' An Xiaoning adjusted her position to face him, settling into a cross-legged pose, 'In all honesty, whether we remarry or not seems inconsequential.' She had meant to reassure him of their eventual reunion, but the curse cast a shadow of doubt. 'How can that be inconsequential?' He challenged, 'Marriage is the most definitive testament to a couple's relationship. As his wife, you'd be known as Mrs. Jin instead of Miss An.' 'We’ll be united nonetheless.' Pei Yi inquired, 'Are you aware of why I insisted you remain here?' 'You crave diversion in your drab and mundane life; I'm merely your source of entertainment.' 'An Xiaoning, could you possibly be less insightful?' 'It's an innate trait of mine.' She retorted with a hint of lightness. He held back a chuckle, 'That's not the sole reason.' 'Is there another?' 'If you weren't already spoken for, I might have considered claiming you as my own.' 'Even with your aversion to germs, you find me appealing?' 'The allure of a truly enchanting woman eclipses her exterior; it's her essence that captivates.' Chapter 1305: Only You (3) Pei Yi's gaze met An Xiaoning's. 'I hold you in high esteem and would like to be friends, the kind who can meet often. Would you be open to that?' Rising from the blanket, An Xiaoning took a seat in the chair across his desk, her chin resting casually in her hand. 'Considering you're the head of DK's local division and I'm known as the daughter of the First Lady of Country S, wouldn't our friendship be viewed with suspicion, potentially as strategic collusion?' 'So you're... reluctant?' She faced him squarely. 'Pei Yi, I truly admire you. You possess a certain allure, and I mean that sincerely, not as flattery in response to your pleasing words. You are accomplished, but I adhere to one principle, do you understand it?' 'What principle?' 'I refuse to befriend anyone affiliated with terrorist organizations, even those who have saved me. It's not out of prejudice; consider the Donggong Clan, who, despite their respectable facade, commit ruthless acts. Pei Yi, my wish is for world peace, however unattainable that may seem. I don't want to see any more civilian casualties of war, nor can I bear the rumors of collusion with DK. My parents, being in their positions, shouldn't be pressured because of me. Given my status, malicious exploitation by others could cause irreparable damage.' Pei Yi nodded in understanding. 'I'm well aware of your concerns.' 'Perhaps, if one day you were to sever ties with DK, we might become good friends. But for now, it's best we maintain our current relationship.' Expecting him to profess eternal allegiance to DK, she was surprised when he said, 'In the future, who can say?' After lunch, with Pei Yi away on business, An Xiaoning and Wu Lianzhi were left alone, surrounded by surveillance. They refrained from touching anything in his office. Qin Guo, serving them begrudgingly, watched them play cards with visible disdain. 'Why the daze? Fetch me some cake; I have a craving,' An Xiaoning demanded. With a grumble, Qin Guo retorted, 'Do you think you're at home, An Xiaoning?' 'Are you not going to get it?' Departing with a mutter of 'May the cake make you fat,' Qin Guo reluctantly fulfilled the request. Returning with the cake, she couldn't resist commenting, 'I don't understand why Elder Donggong bothered bringing you here; all you do is indulge yourself.' 'That's a question for Elder Donggong, not me,' An Xiaoning replied with a smile. 'Qin Guo, if you're idle, why not join us for cards?' Qin Guo hesitated. 'Are you unwilling?' 'If Elder Donggong knew...' 'It's fine, I'll explain it to him. You're free anyway.' Won over by An Xiaoning's invitation, Qin Guo joined them. Playing cards, she inquired, 'Do you have feelings for Elder Donggong?' 'Would you prefer that I did or didn't?' 'I'm asking you—do you fancy him?' 'Why should I reveal my heart to you?' Stumped, Qin Guo pressed on, 'If you don't like him, please don't lead him on. Despite his cold and casual demeanor, he takes matters of the heart seriously.' 'Lead him on? You're mistaken; there's nothing romantic between us,' An Xiaoning clarified. Unconvinced, Qin Guo persisted, 'Really? You're being truthful, right?' 'Do you harbor feelings for him?' Qin Guo denied it, 'Of course not. We are unworthy of aspiring to Elder Donggong's affection.' 'That's evident. He's not the type to favor someone like you.' Qin Guo fell silent. 'He likely has a preference for two types of women.' 'Which types?' 'The first is a guileless, pure-hearted girl. The second, an empowered, capable woman who can earn his respect. Do you see yourself in either category?' Shaking her head, Qin Guo admitted, 'No.' 'Then there's your answer.' 'Qin Guo, what compelled you to join DK?' 'It's simple. My entire family joined; why would I exclude myself?' 'So you follow without question? Just because your family joined, is it necessarily right? Perhaps when you were born, your mother forgot to instill you with a sense of reason,' An Xiaoning chided. Qin Guo glared in response. 'What are you looking at? Isn't what I said true?' An Xiaoning pressed. 'You have a sharp tongue,' Qin Guo said. During her five-day stay, An Xiaoning remained serene and at ease. Though she felt some mental stress, her personal well-being was paramount. The days may have seemed lengthy, yet they flew by swiftly. For Pei Yi, they were all too brief. Regardless, he intended to honor his promise and release An Xiaoning. Just as she was preparing to depart, she received a call from Xiao Chenyang. He had reported the presence of Henry's traces in Country R. Subsequently, An Xiaoning and Wu Lianzhi set off to meet Xiao Chenyang. Upon their arrival, Xiao Chenyang expressed surprise at seeing Wu Lianzhi. 'So it is truly you.' 'Do we have an acquaintance?' Wu Lianzhi inquired. Xiao Chenyang burst into laughter, catching Wu Lianzhi off guard. 'What's his issue?' Wu Lianzhi asked An Xiaoning. 'He's never behaved this way; he must be having a fit,' An Xiaoning speculated as they entered. Following her inside, Wu Lianzhi watched Xiao Chenyang recover, drink some water, and say, 'I had my suspicions, but seeing you in person confirms it.' 'So you're aware of who he is, sparing me the introduction.' 'You truly have no recollection of him?' 'None whatsoever.' Xiao Chenyang lounged on the sofa, legs crossed atop the coffee table, grinning. 'The Wu family has only one such talent; he's somewhat memorable.' 'Enough with the mystery, what is it?' 'He's supposedly a friend with whom you share a significant past.' Thinking it trivial, An Xiaoning replied, 'I was already aware. Was that the cause of your prolonged laughter? I don't see the humor.' 'Ah... My amusement stemmed from picturing Long Tianze's despairing expression.' 'What does Long Tianze have to do with this...' 'It appears that in recalling your past life, you focused solely on your partner and yourself, giving little thought to anyone else.' Chapter 1306: Only You (4) An Xiaoning nodded. "It seems to be the case. Go on, please." "He was a lover of Yu Jiao from a past life, the same Yu Jiao who is now with Long Tianze," the revelation came. An Xiaoning's eyes widened. "You're not fooling me, are you?" "Would I gain anything from fooling you? Our esteemed Marquis Xi has been green with envy over him a few times. Occasionally, he has mentioned that his affections were never for you but for the maid by your side." "..." Wu Lianzhi seemed to grasp the underlying message. "Who is Yu Jiao?" An Xiaoning chuckled awkwardly. "In a past life, she was a maid serving me." "And in this life?" "In this life, she's married with children. Her husband, Long Tianze, is a prominent businessman involved in advertising, entertainment, and film production." Wu Lianzhi nodded in understanding. "Xiao Chenyang, did Yu Jiao and I have a relationship in that past life?" "You were lovers, yes. But clearly, there was no happy ending since I'm aware of your untimely demise at the hands of your own Wu family." "I see. But that's all history now. Xiaoning, is Yu Jiao doing well now?" "Yes, she's doing well. Her husband adores her, and they have a happy family with their children." "That's good to hear." Wu Lianzhi had come to terms with his past. "The past is the past. Our paths didn't cross early in this life, which means our connection ended in the last. Knowing she is happy now is enough for me. Is there a photograph of her?" "There is." An Xiaoning pulled out her smartphone, found Mei Yangyang's photo, and showed it to him. "This is her. In this life, she's called Mei Yangyang." Wu Lianzhi looked at the photo and smiled knowingly. "She is indeed quite pretty." "Right? Her daughter looks just like her, both with adorable dumpling faces." "Xiaoning." "Hmm?" "Let's not tell her or her husband about our past connection. I prefer things the way they are. I don't want my past to disturb their peaceful life." An Xiaoning felt a surge of warmth at his thoughtfulness. "Since you feel this way, we won't tell them. As you said, there's no longer a connection in this life, so it's best to let each lead their own lives." With that matter settled, it was time to address more pressing issues. "Have you found him?" "My men are on it. They've spotted him and will soon bring him in." Xiao Chenyang returned to his usual demeanor. "But did he come here specifically for you?" "I doubt it. I'm not sure, though. Have you visited the Donggong family estate?" "I have. I faced the revered elder. I expected a formidable opponent, but he was quickly subdued. He's now detained in Country S." "..." An Xiaoning gave a thumbs-up. "Impressive, truly remarkable." "You flatter me," Xiao Chenyang replied, seizing the moment to discuss Erlan's future. "Your studio should cultivate new talent, as Erlan won't continue acting after this film." "We're preparing for that. Yangyang and I anticipated you'd do this. When are you planning to wed?" "We haven't decided yet. A wedding shouldn't be rushed; it requires careful preparation. Initially, I thought a small ceremony with close friends and family would suffice. But I've changed my mind. On our wedding day, I want the entire world to know that she is mine." An Xiaoning teased, "Quite a grand affair. Planning to spend your entire fortune on it?" "Do you know how much I'm worth?" "Half a trillion?" Xiao Chenyang uncapped a bottle on the table and poured three glasses. "You underestimate me. I'll drink to that; you do as you please." With that, he took a sip. An Xiaoning handed a glass to Wu Lianzhi, then slowly raised her own. "Where did you get so much money?" "Let's just say I acquired it creatively." She scoffed. "Who are you trying to fool?" "Then how else do you think I got it?" An Xiaoning eyed him for a few seconds before drawing out her phone. "Erlan probably doesn't know about this. I should inform her; I'm curious about her reaction." Xiao Chenyang grabbed her wrist. "I was wrong." "How about more sincerity and less scheming from now on?" "Aside from my dormant periods, I've always engaged in business while searching for Erlan. The Xiao family has deep commercial roots, and as the youngest and sole son, the fortune inevitably came to me. Over time, my enterprises grew. In recent decades, I've invested in jewelry, gold, and real estate, making a fortune. I've begun the residency process in Country S, as not having local registration can be inconvenient." "Where's your current residency?" "Country Y. I've had to cancel and re-register every few decades. It's just a matter of transferring it here now." An Xiaoning turned to Wu Lianzhi. "And you? Have you thought about your future?" "Not until now." "It's time to start. Haven't you heard? The Donggong family elder, Wu Haigang, has been extradited to Country S. Your family will soon come for me, likely blaming me for his capture. I'll be sure to bring up your situation. You should consider your future plans now." "I hope to find someone who loves me, and whom I also love, to live a peaceful life together." "That will happen in due time." The three of them awaited news from Xiao Chenyang's men. After two hours, they finally received a lead on his whereabouts. Initially, they planned to apprehend him, but he proved too elusive. They rushed to his last known location. Upon seeing him, An Xiaoning quickly removed her mask and called out, "Henry!" Henry, startled, turned around. An Xiaoning hurried toward him, but he remained still. "Didn't I tell you to avoid trouble? Why can't you obey?" "The house felt too confining; I needed to get out." "If you wanted to get out, why not bring someone with you? You know you're free to travel." An Xiaoning attempted to take his arm, but he discreetly withdrew. "Everybody's trying to catch me, making me feel like a criminal." Chapter 1307: Only You (5) An Xiaoning clung to his arm tightly, fearful he might again become restless and try to flee, 'I was worried you'd get into mischief, which is why I wanted to find you as soon as possible.' 'Why has he come as well?' 'It's all because of you.' Henry didn't say anything else, simply joining her in walking towards Xiao Chenyang. —— Fan Shixin exhaled a sigh of relief upon the safe retrieval of Henry. He massaged his temples; from the moment Henry had escaped, there hadn't been a moment of respite for his nerves. After taking a brief pause, he summoned Xiao Huang. 'Captain Fan, did you call for me?' 'Bring He Yi to the duty room, I'll join you there shortly.' 'Understood.' After freshening up with a shower and donning fresh clothes, Fan Shixin left his quarters. He Yi, who had been confined to the basement, was at last allowed back into the light of day. Currently, he appeared quite ragged, a stark contrast to his initial composed state when first detained. Fan Shixin surveyed him with a stern gaze, 'Not just anyone can plot against our Young Madam Fan. It's ironic that you were once classmates with our Young Master at high school. This time, Young Madam Fan has decided to spare you just this once. There will be no repetition, and absolutely no next time. You may go.' The hands that were restraining He Yi loosened instantly. He Yi straightened himself up, fully aware that this was not the moment for bravado, and left without a word. Xiao Huang questioned, 'Captain Fan, why are we letting him go? Aren't those from the police department facing execution? Shouldn't he be serving some years at least?' 'It's the directive of Young Madam Fan. Furthermore, his involvement isn't on the same level as those sentenced to death,' Fan Shixin explained with a steady voice. 'He's merely a coerced first-time offender who ultimately failed to accomplish anything. A stern reprimand was deemed sufficient. The other seven or eight, however, were operatives that the Donggong Clan had stationed in Country S for intelligence-gathering. Our country enforces severe penalties on such individuals. Had He Yi been an operative from abroad, rest assured that Young Madam Fan would not have been so lenient.' 'Captain Fan, your hair's still wet. Have you just showered?' 'Yes, what of it?' 'Fresh out of the shower and into new clothes,' Xiao Huang remarked, rubbing his chin with a delighted grin, 'Could it be that Captain Fan is heading out on a date?' 'What, feeling envious?' he chuckled. 'I get it, for a lifelong bachelor like yourself, witnessing others go on dates must be quite the ordeal.' 'Captain Fan, can't you spare me the salt in the wound?!' Xiao Huang lamented. 'Enough, I'm off,' Fan Shixin glanced at the time and promptly exited. Between his trip to Country R and now, notably during the time of Henry's disappearance, Fan Shixin had been too swamped to entertain Wu Pingyang’s invitations. Now with an unexpected window of opportunity, he intended to make it up to her. He planned to pick up a gift for her first, thus he didn't call ahead. Wu Pingyang was at A City First People's Hospital. Fan Shixin was carrying a red rose gift box, knowing well that such a gesture would be cherished by most women, he selected it for his girlfriend. Arriving on the second floor, he saw the sign for the dental department and proceeded with the gift box in hand. At that moment, Wu Pingyang was busy fitting braces for a young boy and did not notice his presence. The other doctors, however, noticed him first and greeted him with a smile, 'Is that Captain Fan?' 'Hello.' Upon hearing his voice, Wu Pingyang looked up, her face immediately lit up with joy at the sight of him. 'I'll be right with you, please have a seat.' 'Alright.' Fan Shixin sat down, feeling somewhat awkward as the medical staff's curious eyes were all on him. This was Fan Shixin's first opportunity to observe his girlfriend while she was at work. Dressed in her white coat and blue mask, she was diligently focused on her tasks, her professionalism adding an extra layer of attraction. Once finished, Wu Pingyang, reveling in the envious looks from her female colleagues, felt a surge of pride. She quickly removed her mask and coat, 'Why are you here?' 'I've been preoccupied these past days, but I've finally managed to find some time to come and see you. I brought this for you.' Wu Pingyang eagerly received the gift box, and upon opening it to reveal the red roses, her face radiated happiness, 'They're beautiful. Do you have time this afternoon?' 'I believe so.' 'Wonderful, I had half a day blocked off just for you. My family is eager to meet you.' Wu Pingyang covered the box and lightly linked her arm with his, 'Let's talk outside.' 'Sure.' The duo stepped outside, with Fan Shixin asking, 'Your family has expressed a desire to meet me?' 'Yes, they inquired about when you would be available to join us for a meal at home. I explained your recent busyness to them.' 'Then let's make it this afternoon. We can dine at your place in the evening.' Wu Pingyang, elated by his consent, had been apprehensive that he might decline, especially since she had confidently assured her grandfather that Fan Shixin would definitely attend. 'That's settled, then. I'll inform my family right now.' 'Okay.' Wu Pingyang immediately relayed the news to her family. After hanging up, she faced Fan Shixin with a look of sheer excitement, 'We'll be visiting my grandfather's. Have you thought about what gift to bring?' 'Not yet.' 'My grandfather is particularly partial to that famous vintage from B City. I can't recall the name, but it's in English, that blue liquor that's so fragrant.' 'Ah, yes, that one. My grandfather has always talked about it. If you bring that, he'll be quite pleased.' 'Well...' Fan Shixin hesitated, 'That bottle of wine is priced at two hundred thousand, and it has become a collector's item. It's nearly impossible to find one for sale since they've ceased production. Perhaps we should consider another gift option.' Understanding the importance of a first impression when meeting a girlfriend's family, Fan Shixin was familiar with the custom of bringing a gift. Nonetheless, presenting something so costly could give off the wrong impression, suggesting that he was a careless spender from an affluent family. In reality, his circumstances were much different. While he did own a car and house, and his monthly income was substantial, he did not come from a wealthy background like Long Tianze, Ling Ciyi, or Jin Qingyan. His parents were laborers, working diligently every day at the Jin family household. Hearing his cautious approach, Wu Pingyang's mood deflated slightly, 'What's wrong with gifting a two-hundred-thousand-dollar bottle of wine? It's a sign of respect for my grandfather, which he can enjoy for a long time. Besides, it's a one-off. Won't the money spent on the wedding gifts eventually come back to us?' 'Respect for elders can be shown in many ways; it doesn't have to be extravagant,' Fan Shixin firmly resisted. 'As for the gift, I'll handle it; you needn't worry.' Taken aback, Wu Pingyang paused, 'Then, what do you intend to buy?' 'I'll have something in mind by the afternoon.' Chapter 1308: Only You (6) Wu Pingyang, careful not to stir any further tension, tactfully steered the conversation elsewhere. 'This gathering will likely see all the key members of our family. Please, make yourself comfortable when you arrive.' 'There is no need to worry.' He had navigated many a social maze; a few additional faces hardly posed a threat. 'But I must ask, why aren't we visiting your parents' home directly?' 'My grandfather is particularly eager to meet you,' she explained. 'My mother suggested it would be best to have the meeting at his estate.' Wu Pingyang gave him a pre-emptive heads-up, 'If my relatives bring up the matter of marriage... how do you plan on addressing it?' 'We can afford to take our time, to truly understand each other before delving into marriage talks. I entered this relationship with matrimony in mind, but we shouldn't rush. Marriage is, after all, a lifelong affair.' Wu Pingyang nodded in agreement. 'So, where to now?' 'What's your preference?' 'Let's head to the Winnie Community.' 'Agreed.' He led her back to Winnie Community, and as they stepped out of the car, she glanced at the main villa with curiosity. 'Shixin, could you possibly show me inside? I'm rather curious about Mr. Jin's living quarters.' Fan Shixin hesitated, 'Our master generally doesn't allow strangers into his private spaces, unless they're close acquaintances or have his express permission. But since you're my girlfriend, I suppose a brief tour of the living room could be arranged. The upper floor, however, is out of bounds.' She nodded, not wanting to trouble him, 'Of course.' Hand in hand, they approached the villa. At the threshold, the sight that greeted Wu Pingyang took her breath away. 'Wow, it's truly magnificent!' 'Come on in,' he invited, stepping through the doorway. She followed, taking in the surroundings. Her previous visit had been limited to his personal area, never daring to venture into the heart of the residence. Unbeknownst to her, a world of extravagance awaited. The luxury that unfolded before her was breathtaking—if destiny granted her the fortune to dwell in such a place, she would die content! After her tour, the desire to explore upstairs tugged at her, but she held back, remembering her promise. Once outside, Wu Pingyang asked in a low tone, 'Shixin, who was that woman we saw earlier?' 'That's Auntie Chen, the steward of our kitchens. Her culinary artistry is second to none,' he informed her. 'I see.' With noon on the horizon, Fan Shixin queried, 'Would you like to dine here, or shall I take you to a restaurant?' 'Here is fine; no need for extra fuss.' 'What would you like to eat?' he continued to probe. 'Is there a choice in the matter?' Wu Pingyang looked up, 'I am in the mood for something delectable.' 'Speak your wish. If it's within my means, I'll satisfy it.' 'I'm in the mood for red wine and steak.' Fan Shixin nodded, 'Consider it done. I'll speak to the kitchen. You can wait for me in the security office.' 'Very well.' She obediently made her way there while Fan Shixin went to pass on the instructions and also reached out to An Xiaoning. It was deep into the night in Country R, but An Xiaoning was still awake. 'Young Madam, have you retired for the night?' 'Not yet. What's on your mind, Shixin?' He pondered before speaking up, 'My girlfriend has invited me to dine with her family. I'm uncertain about the appropriate gifts to bring.' 'You should prepare at least two gifts, one for each of her parents.' 'It's not just her parents...' Fan Shixin coughed slightly, 'She's asked me to visit her grandfather's place—the Mu Family estate.' 'Isn't it customary to meet with the parents first? If you're heading to her grandfather's, you'll need to present gifts of a certain caliber. Otherwise, it might seem disrespectful. You'll have to consider gifts for her parents, uncles, aunts, and grandfather. However, if marriage isn't yet on the table, perhaps it's best not to meet all these relatives just yet. Or else, could you afford it if you had to do this every few weeks?' 'Today, she mentioned her grandfather has a taste for Blueocean. She suggested I bring a bottle, saying it would make a fine impression.' 'That's a rather forward request for such a new relationship,' An Xiaoning chuckled on the other end. 'There's no need for such grand gestures at this stage. Here's what you'll do: pick a bottle from our cellar, something in the range of twenty to thirty thousand, for her grandfather. Depending on how many uncles she has, get some fine cigars as well. Make sure her father gets the same treatment—fair is fair. There's no need to go out and buy anything; what we have at home is more than enough. That would already be a gesture of remarkable generosity.' Convinced by her advice, Fan Shixin expressed his thanks, 'I appreciate it, Young Madam.' 'Don't forget to dress smartly,' she added. 'Understood.' After the call, he promptly prepared the gifts, making sure they were nicely packaged. With the gifts in hand, he returned to the security office. Wu Pingyang, noticing the gift bags, inquired, 'What's all this?' 'Wine and cigars for your grandfather, uncles, and your father.' 'And what about my mother and aunts?' 'It's not necessary to gift something to everyone; we're not engaged, let alone married. The main thing is to bring a sign of goodwill.' 'How can you bring gifts for the men and not for the women? What would my mother and aunts think? Besides, this is your first visit; how can you be so casual?' 'Casual? These gifts are worth between fifty and sixty thousand. Are such valuable gifts really considered casual on a first visit? They're quite substantial.' Fan Shixin asked, 'Are you expecting me to bring over a hundred thousand in gifts on a first visit?' Wu Pingyang looked at him, her lip caught between her teeth, 'It's clear you don't care about me. I never asked for gifts of several thousands for my mother and aunts, but isn't a gesture of respect expected?' Holding back his frustration, Fan Shixin agreed, 'Alright, I'll pick up some additional gifts on our way.' Typically, Wu Pingyang's fiery spirit would have seen her leave by now, but she knew the stakes; any mistake here wouldn't be lightly overlooked by her family. She curbed her fiery temper, conceding with a pained admission, 'Alright, my hunger gnaws at me.' 'I'll take you to eat.' 'Yes.' Fan Shixin's first encounter with the Mu family left him feeling uneasy. Something about them—Wu Pingyang's grandfather, her parents, uncles, and aunts—didn't sit right with him. Their scrutinizing looks felt too revealing, their expectations too clear. Though he prided himself on being unflappable in any setting, he now realized the challenge of spending an afternoon, possibly even an evening, with a group so relentlessly inquisitive. They were tactless, broaching not only the subject of marriage but also other taboo topics—business dealings, and matters concerning Jin Qingyan and An Xiaoning. He expertly avoided these discussions, much to their visible chagrin, as they failed to extract any valuable information from him. Chapter 1309: Only You (7) Wu Pingyang could discern her grandfather's dissatisfaction, her own countenance losing its luster as she felt her esteem wane. She whispered to Fan Shixin, who was seated beside her, 'When Elder Donggong asks you something, can't you humor him a little? Your silence is unbearably dull.' Fan Shixin, unwavering in his integrity, responded, 'They persist in asking about matters I'm sworn to keep confidential. There are lines I cannot cross; it's a matter of principle.' 'Such a bore,' Wu Pingyang complained under her breath, her perception of him diverging from the man she had imagined. 'What did you utter?' Fan Shixin's brows drew together as he detected a fleeting expression of impatience on her visage. 'Nothing of consequence.' The inclination to leave immediately was strong for Fan Shixin, but duty bound, he endured and stayed until the evening drew to a close. At dinner, the attendees persistently offered him toasts. Even with his considerable tolerance for wine, the relentless drinking eventually led to a hint of inebriation. Repeatedly, he waved them off, citing the responsibility of driving himself home, but Wu Pingyang's uncle insisted, ensuring a chauffeur would take him back. Yielding to their insistent toasting, he continued to drink. Ultimately, with a nauseating sensation, he resolutely ceased drinking. As a key member of Jin Qingyan's inner circle, he adhered to a strict rule: never allow himself to be incapacitated by alcohol in such settings, to avoid vulnerability. His foresight proved prudent. Upon the suggestion by Wu Pingyang's mother that he stay the night at the Mu Family Manor, he became fully alert, declining repeatedly with resolve. Despite the Mu family's insistent hospitality, he remained firm in his refusal. They arranged for his car to be driven back, and Wu Pingyang was tasked with his care. Once at Winnie Community, Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai assisted Fan Shixin from the vehicle. Squinting, he addressed Wu Pingyang, 'Please return...' 'You've had too much to drink. I shall stay and take care of you,' she insisted. 'Young Madam, we are here for that. We shall look after him. You should go back,' Xiao Bai said with a hint of mirth. Before he could finish, Xiao Huang chided him, 'Mind your words.' Considering her intent to maintain an image of purity before Fan Shixin, Wu Pingyang nodded and re-entered the car, advising through the window, 'Prepare some hangover remedy for him.' 'Certainly, Young Madam. Travel safely,' they replied as her car departed. After she left, Xiao Huang commented, 'Why did you send her away when she was willing to stay, you fool?' 'Didn't you see the captain suggesting she leave? It's clear he doesn't want her to spend the night here,' Xiao Bai retorted. Xiao Huang turned to Fan Shixin, 'Captain, why did you drink so much?' 'I was being constantly plied with drinks... My stomach's in knots... Ugh...' Unable to hold back, Fan Shixin vomited there and then. The relief was immediate, and his mind began to clear. Xiao Bai called for someone to clean the mess, and after they escorted Fan Shixin inside, they served him a concoction to counteract the alcohol. They left once he had taken it. After a brief respite, Fan Shixin awoke with a headache that was no small matter, though the effects of the alcohol had largely subsided, leaving him with no desire to sleep. He washed up, dressed in clean clothes, and ventured outside. It was now eleven at night. Xiao Bai, on night duty, saw Fan Shixin rise and yawned, 'Captain, what brings you out of bed?' 'My head's pounding; sleep eludes me,' Fan Shixin replied, his voice rough with discomfort. 'I should have kept silent. Had Young Madam stayed by your side, you'd be sleeping soundly by now,' Xiao Bai teased, offering a conspiratorial wink. 'Enough. Do not call her Young Madam so casually; we have not yet taken marital vows,' Fan Shixin chided. 'What does it matter? Our Young Madam and Young Master haven't formalized their reunion, yet we still address her as Young Madam. Captain, perhaps you're merely shy? There's no need for such pretenses; the Young Madam herself wasn't perturbed.' Fan Shixin instructed him, 'Aren't you supposed to sleep during the day? Appear more alert.' 'Yes, Captain!' Xiao Bai jolted to attention, his eyes wide, mustering all his energy. Fan Shixin took hold of the mouse, scanning the community's surveillance. While monitoring, he noticed that the lights in his residence were still on. It was quite late; why had she not retired for the night? 'How has Miss Mu been coping with the meals you've been delivering?' he inquired. 'She's been managing well, but she no longer wishes us to deliver food,' Xiao Bai responded. 'Why is that?' Fan Shixin pressed. 'Miss Mu finds it burdensome for us to bring meals thrice daily. She suggested we deliver groceries, allowing her to cook for herself and fill her time. Today, we've stocked her refrigerator; she should have enough for the next few days.' Fan Shixin hummed in acknowledgment and departed from the guardroom. Droplets of rain began to fall outside. He exited the main gate and proceeded to his quarters. After entering his passcode, Fan Shixin silently advanced inside, the sound of the door closing barely perceptible. He paused at the guest bedroom door and knocked with decorum. Her voice inquired from within, 'Who is it?' 'It is I.' 'Enter, please.' Pushing the door open, he found her seated on the bed, engaged in cross-stitching, 'Not resting yet?' 'Sleep proves elusive.' Mu Wansheng detected a faint scent of alcohol, 'You have been drinking?' 'Even after a shower and brushing my teeth, the scent lingers, doesn't it?' he admitted. 'It is faint, but yes. You seem to have consumed a fair amount.' 'I paid a visit to your family this afternoon, and they saw fit to ply me with drink.' Mu Wansheng placed her needlework aside, 'Is there talk of an engagement?' 'No such discussions. Pingyang mentioned that Grand Elder Donggong wished to meet me, so I obliged.' 'It must have incurred a considerable expense?' Mu Wansheng inquired with certainty. 'Young Madam Mu had me select a bottle of wine valued in the tens of thousands and several fine cigars from the storeroom.' Mu Wansheng drew a deep breath, 'Captain Fan, does your heart lean towards Pingyang?' Fan Shixin locked eyes with her, 'One could say there's a measure of affection, yes.' Mu Wansheng hesitated, her voice caught. She harbored no desire to meddle, yet could not bear to see a benevolent man deceived, 'The Mu family elders, save for my mother, eagerly anticipate your union with Pingyang. To be precise, my grandfather is quite intent on it. However, Pingyang's affections towards you are not without ulterior motives.' She spoke with a subdued earnestness, her hands tightly clasping her blanket. 'Matches are not just about affection; they hinge on the right conditions,' Fan Shixin understood well, 'which is why I'm in no hurry to marry. It's prudent to thoroughly understand one another before making such a life-altering commitment.' Chapter 1310: Only You (8) Mu Wansheng offered a gentle smile. "Fan Shixin, your kindness won't go unnoticed by Pingyang."  "Do you really see goodness in me?"  "Undoubtedly, you are the kindest soul to me in the entire world."  Fan Shixin found himself unexpectedly moved by her mention of 'the entire world', a smile gracing his lips. "What if I choose to pursue you instead of Pingyang?"  Mu Wansheng looked at him, startled. "Captain..." Seeing her reaction, Fan Shixin let out a laugh. "Did that frighten you? I was only jesting." Mu Wansheng cast her gaze downward. "The night has grown late. You should return and rest; I'm quite tired myself." Fan Shixin's smile faded to a more serious expression. "Very well, good night." "Good night." Mu Wansheng slowly reclined, stretching out an arm to switch off the light. He quietly closed the door behind him. She touched her face, which felt feverishly hot. To her embarrassment, she realized she had taken his playful words to heart, her cheeks now flushed with a mix of embarrassment and shame. How could she have failed to recognize a simple jest? Was she too gullible? After all, he was Pingyang's boyfriend, and soon to be her own cousin-in-law. As the term 'cousin-in-law' crossed her mind, Mu Wansheng's spirits dampened, for she knew that once healed, she would have to face the Mu family again. She couldn't forever hide away in this room; there were debts awaiting repayment. The Mu family would, sooner or later, discover her whereabouts. Thinking of this, she cherished the present moment of safety and the lack of worries even more. Her lifelong yearning was for a warm home, a place where the wealth of her partner mattered little compared to kindness. She was ready to strive alongside him towards a future together. Now, all seemed lost, her hopes extinguished. Mu Wansheng closed her eyes, and a solitary tear traced its way down her cheek. As dawn approached, An Xiaoning, Henry, Wu Lianzhi, and Xiao Chenyang made their return. Upon arriving back at Winnie Community and stepping onto its soil, a sense of profound security enveloped them. An Xiaoning had begun to consider this place more than just a residence; it was her home. After settling Wu Lianzhi and Xiao Chenyang into their guest rooms, An Xiaoning and Henry ascended the stairs. Entering the bedroom, she flung off her slippers and dove onto the bed, sinking into its soft embrace. "Ah, what comfort this is." "After having rested for so long, do you still wish to sleep?" Henry inquired. "No, I shall first cleanse my face, apply a mask, and then lie in repose to contemplate our next steps," An Xiaoning replied. While Henry showered, she lay on the bed, leisurely applying a facial mask. Once he returned, clad in a bathrobe and towel-drying his hair, he began to rummage through her skincare products. "Your skin surpasses mine in quality without any effort; why do you bother with these?" he quipped. "Should one wait until they are old and withered before they start caring for their skin?" An Xiaoning retorted, a hint of a smile in her voice. "You'll never grow old, and you'll live for many years to come, so there's no need for concern," she added. He took her words lightly, jesting further. "If I were to stay forever young while you aged into a wrinkled old woman..." Her eyes shot him a sharp look as she interrupted, "Then prepare for disappointment, for I shall neither age nor perish." "What a delightful wish," he remarked casually. "I speak the truth," An Xiaoning insisted. "Oh, indeed?" Henry replied, his tone laced with playful skepticism. "Yes, really!" she affirmed. He patted his face with a towel, advancing toward her and nodding with faux solemnity. "Fine, I concede it's true." She stretched her leg out to the bed's edge as he made to sit down. He unhesitatingly took a seat atop her leg. "Ah!!!!" An Xiaoning rolled to her side and kicked at his neck with her free foot. "The bed is mine; seek your slumber upon the sofa." "Is it emblazoned with your name, by chance?" he teased. "If you stay, I'll be compelled to touch, to kiss, and who knows what else," she threatened playfully. "Then proceed. But do so knowing the risk of finding yourself against the wall once more," he warned, casually tossing her leg aside and settling into the bed. "Henry, you've grown quite audacious," An Xiaoning observed. "Even the meekest rabbit may leap when cornered," he responded with a proverbial shrug. An Xiaoning rose from the bed, fetched a needle so fine it was nearly invisible, and swiftly pricked his hand. He jerked in surprise, attempting to withdraw his hand, but she quickly brought it to her lips. "What are you doing?" Henry exclaimed, a mix of confusion and alarm in his voice. "Sampling your blood," she declared with a mysterious air. "...You've lost your mind," he stated flatly. An Xiaoning released his hand, seemingly indifferent, and settled back onto the bed. Henry eyed his hand, now glistening with her saliva, with an expression of utmost revulsion. He rose to cleanse it before returning. "That was revolting," he commented. "Oh, was it enough to make you wish for death?" An Xiaoning teased, her laugh carrying an unsettling undertone. "You call that revulsion?" she continued, drawing closer to him. "I could share a tale so vile it would render you speechless for a minute at least." "I'd rather remain ignorant," he declined. "Indulge me. It concerns your own deeds," she pressed. "I've made my stance clear: I do not wish to hear it," he said firmly, knowing full well his protests would do little to dissuade her. An Xiaoning whispered something then, a remark that turned Henry's face a shade of deep crimson. "Nonsense, I refuse to believe such a thing." She left the room, returning shortly with her phone in hand. "Disbelieving, are you? Allow me to present the surveillance footage," she offered. Conflicted yet curious, Henry snatched the phone from her and retreated to the bathroom. An Xiaoning watched his retreat with amusement, murmuring, "Let him deny it; the proof is irrefutable." Henry was at once astounded and incredulous, his mind struggling to accept that his body could have acted in such a manner. It felt as if his privacy had been stripped bare in an instant before An Xiaoning. He knew there had been numerous intimate moments between his body and An Xiaoning, as their child was living proof. But he hadn't anticipated that he would have personally cared for her needs. And allowed her to film it! In that moment, his mind seemed on the verge of imploding. He hastily deleted the video and emerged, glaring. An Xiaoning reached out, and he placed the phone in her hand, his voice silenced by shock and embarrassment. Observing that he had eradicated the video, she calmly informed him, "The original footage is stored on my computer; what you deleted was merely a duplicate." "Do you intend to have a tech wizard extract it and broadcast it for the entire world to see?" he asked, eyeing her warily. "Certainly not," she replied with a smile. Chapter 1311: Only You (9) "Certainly not, the video was made on a whim during an impassioned moment and later saved in a hidden file on my computer. But rest assured, I've already deleted it after copying it earlier. You looked so anxious." Relieved, Henry's tension eased. He had seen himself in an indescribable encounter with her in the video, but he had no recollection of it, nor any sense of what it might have felt like. "You're quite the thrill-seeker, aren't you?" "Isn't that quite normal?" An Xiaoning propped her head with one hand while looking at him, "Do you want to continue sleeping, or get up?" "And you?" "I'm wide awake now; I'll be getting up soon." "Then you go ahead, I want to sleep." "......" —— Dreams are full, but reality is harsh; Henry wished to sleep, but his wish was denied. During breakfast, everyone took their places, and Wu Lianzhi, being a guest, didn't appear as comfortable as the others, showing a hint of reserve. The mood was lively when Long Tianze arrived, humming a tune. "Hello, my dear friends, I've arrived." Xiao Chenyang glanced at An Xiaoning, who caught his silent cue, and they shared a tacit smile. "What's so special about your arrival?" asked Henry. "I missed you all, that's why!" "Get lost." Unfazed, Long Tianze shrugged, "I haven't eaten yet. Mind if I join you? Auntie Chen, can you pass me a pair of chopsticks?" "Of course." That was just like Long Tianze, casual and carefree among friends. After receiving chopsticks from Auntie Chen, he settled down to enjoy the meal. "And who might this be?" He looked in Wu Lianzhi's direction. "Hello, I am Wu Lianzhi." "Long Tianze." At the sound of his name, Wu Lianzhi froze momentarily, his memory of Long Tianze prompting him to take a second look. Sensing Wu Lianzhi's gaze, Long Tianze quipped, "Why keep staring? Taken a fancy to me?" Wu Lianzhi laughed off the remark, "Hardly, you just seem like a decent man." Pleased with the compliment, Long Tianze's grin widened, "Obviously, I'm Country S's number one great guy, right, Qingyan?" Henry bluntly stated, "You've blown your own trumpet so much you've almost forgotten your own name." "Is there a need for exaggeration? It's simply the truth. Xiaoning, haven't I always been good to our Yangyang? Whatever she says goes—I never argue." "Indeed, Tianze has been nothing but good to Yangyang," An Xiaoning affirmed. "Hear that, Qingyan?" Henry continued his meal in silence. After breakfast, Xiao Chenyang had someone bring over Wu Haigang, the elder of the Wu family. He then turned to An Xiaoning, "He may not have martial arts skills, but his Witchcraft Cauldron Technique is formidable. He could potentially lift the curse on you and Qingyan if we handle it right. Do you have any ideas on how to convince him to help?" "In the end, life is all anyone cares about. It's his choice whether he wants to cling to it. He must know that even if he helps lift the curse, he likely won't survive after revealing our Eight Characters of Birth Time—a crucial component of our astrological profiles. Knowing too much, how could we let him live? That path is doomed from the start. We might have better luck with a different approach, something he'd be willing to trade for." Xiao Chenyang listened intently, "What might that be?" "His family lineage. We both know why his family changed their surname and relocated to Country R. Changing one's family name is a significant ordeal, so future generations are of utmost importance." Xiao Chenyang agreed, "You make a good point. Let's proceed with that plan. After all, what's the distinction of his family if their unique skills are gone? They're no different from ordinary people. But aren't you going to check on everyone else?" An Xiaoning nodded, "I was just heading there. Will you wait here for me?" "Sure." As An Xiaoning visited the others, Long Tianze and Wu Lianzhi were conversing in the living room; Mei Yangyang was not in sight. "Long Tianze, where's Yangyang?" "She went to her studio early to talk to the two boys and a girl she picked from school." "What are you two gentlemen discussing?" "Just some man-to-man topics," Long Tianze said with a chuckle, "I’ve discovered that our friend Wu here has quite a sense of humor." "Humorous?" An Xiaoning mused, as she had yet to discern Wu Lianzhi's humorous streak. "Yes, Xiaoning, he's quite the character." "When will Yangyang return?" "Soon, I expect. She left for work without breakfast, planning to eat once she's back." An Xiaoning checked the time and then took a seat, "Lianzhi, did you know? Tianze and Yangyang's daughter has been betrothed to my son." Wu Lianzhi nodded, "He mentioned it, but it seems somewhat traditional to arrange betrothals for such young children." "I absolutely adore our little dumpling, little Xi. She's as plump and adorable as Yangyang - simply irresistible." Pride shone in Long Tianze's eyes, "That's my little sweetheart. You have to love her." An Xiaoning playfully remarked, "Just look at him, brimming with joy at the mention of his little treasure." Wu Lianzhi smiled, "It's evident, Brother Long, that you have a truly happy family." "Indeed," Long Tianze agreed. An Xiaoning expressed mild irritation, "Could you two please stop using those nicknames?" "Is there a problem?" "Certainly. Long Tianze, when you call him 'Brother Wu', it sounds like 'without chest', and Lianzhi, when you say 'Brother Long', others might think you're calling for a 'chest enhancement'. You two really are quite the match. Is this some sort of nickname camaraderie on your first meeting?" The playful analysis made both men chuckle, having not considered the nicknames' connotations. Half an hour later, Mei Yangyang returned. Dressed in jeans and a beige sweater, she entered, carrying her handbag. "Husband, I'm home." "Ah, wife, we have a guest," Long Tianze announced. "Who is it?" Mei Yangyang peered at the sofa as she finished changing her shoes. Upon seeing Wu Lianzhi, she hesitated, "And this is...?" "He's my friend, Wu Lianzhi. Tianze and he seem to have hit it off right from their first encounter today." Mei Yangyang approached with a smile, "He's always been quite the social butterfly." Chapter 1312: Only You (10) Wu Lianzhi watched her, his heart inexplicably warmed despite the absence of any shared memories. "Hello." Mei Yangyang responded, "Hello." ... As they left the courtyard, An Xiaoning could sense Wu Lianzhi's calm composure. "How do you feel?" she inquired. "Seeing her so content, I'm genuinely happy," he replied. An Xiaoning patted his shoulder reassuringly. "Don't worry, you'll find happiness too. Some ties are meant for past lives, not this one. Plan for your future and let me know what job you'd like. I'll help you arrange it if I can." Together, they entered the grand gate, and Wu Lianzhi reflected, "I can tell her husband is a good man. With such an optimistic partner, it's hard to have a bad life. I'm reassured and at peace. As for my future, I want to live a stable life, to share joy with a girl who can bring happiness. To meet the right girl, I suppose I should start in places where they're likely to be, right?" An Xiaoning agreed, "That's sound reasoning." Shortly after their return, Wu Haigang was brought before them. An Xiaoning scrutinized the man who looked to be in his forties yet showed no signs of age. "Hello, Mr. Wu. You're acquainted with this man; he was once of the Wu lineage, like yourself." He looked up, eyes flashing with disdain. "He is unworthy of the Wu name." "Oh? And you deem yourself worthy?" An Xiaoning retorted. "Today, you have no choice. Your life has long been inconsequential. It's whether you wish to doom your entire Wu lineage that's at stake. "Including him?" He pointed at Wu Lianzhi. "No, though he has reclaimed the Wu surname, he's no longer part of your family. Mr. Wu, you should be well aware of my status. A noble family in R country is trivial. One bomb could deal significant damage, don't you agree? With R country in turmoil, you must choose: lift our curse or protect your kin." "How can I trust you?" he started. "Trust that you won't go back on your word?" "You have no choice," An Xiaoning plainly stated. "Did you think I've forgotten your family's attempt on my life? A noble family conspiring to kill a foreign national, especially me, will not go unnoticed by my country. If I wish, I have many ways to make your family pay dearly and ensure their utter destruction. Wouldn't you wish to witness that?" Wu Haigang closed his eyes, bereft of words. Indeed, if it were just his life, so be it. But the prospect of his entire clan's annihilation would brand him as the Wu family's greatest traitor, incapable of facing his ancestors in the afterlife. He acknowledged the gravity of his situation. —— "Sister Erlan, I've heard that Director Jing Tian's filming has wrapped up, and he's leaving today." "Does his departure make any difference?" Fang Erlan mused, applying lipstick. "Aside from being diligent at the start, he's been absent. The director said a double completed many of his scenes. If this were his brother's production, such use of a double would be unacceptable." "Director Jing Tian has high standards and would never allow such frequent use of a double," Xiao Yue concurred. "By the way, Sister Erlan, when is Cousin-in-law returning?" "Very soon." "I'm craving the treats he brings you. I get to indulge too." "You little foodie," Fang Erlan chided playfully, rising from her seat. "Let's go." "Okay." Xiao Yue grabbed her bag and followed, with a line of bodyguards in tow. The queenly procession was hard to miss. While Yu Caiwei arrived with a handful of bodyguards, Erlan brought an entourage of eight. Their collective presence formed a stately convoy. They were at a promotional event for a TV drama – a meet-and-greet with fans. Most attendees were there for Yan Ge's female fans. Fang Erlan's fandom paled in comparison. Although her fame had risen, it benefited largely from her public relationship with Yan Ge. With none of her series aired, where would her fans come from? Unbeknownst to her, a modest group of about twenty fans had indeed arrived. They were a small contingent amongst the several hundred... The event neared its end after about half an hour when an incident occurred. As Fang Erlan descended, making her closest approach to the audience, a man in his fifties made an unexpected move towards her. It wasn't a typical lunge; he dodged under a bodyguard's arm to reach her. The venue instantly became chaotic. Fang Erlan was caught off guard and fell onto the bodyguard at her side. Another bodyguard instinctively yanked her away, tossing the intruder to the ground with lightning speed. The crowd recoiled, and the middle-aged man hit the floor hard. Fang Erlan stood firm, her composure quickly returning as she swiftly left the area. Xiao Yue was fuming, venting her anger in the van. "That damned old man must be tired of living. If Cousin-in-law were here, he'd break his arm for sure." Fang Erlan calmed herself, choosing silence over words. Xiao Yue mistook her silence for upset and tried to console her. "Sister Erlan, don't worry. Our bodyguard brothers took care of that old man, didn't they?" "Xiao Yue, what do you plan to do in the future?" Caught off guard, Xiao Yue replied, "What do I plan to do?" "I want to keep working with you." "What if I leave show business?" Xiao Yue looked steadfastly at her. "Then I'd still want to be with you, Sister Erlan." "If I leave the industry, you can't follow me. Xiao Yue, your family is just getting by, right? You once said owning a home in Alton City was your biggest dream, right?" "Yes, but with the housing prices, it's impossible on my salary." "How much have you saved?" Fang Erlan inquired. "A little over thirty thousand." "What if I bought you a one-bedroom apartment?" Xiao Yue was astounded. "Sister, that's extremely generous. Even the cheapest one-bedroom is over a million. I haven't been with you long enough; you've already done so much for me." Chapter 1313: Only You (11) "Are you certain you won't take it?" "No, thank you," Xiao Yue responded. "Fang Erlan, you earn your money through hard work every day. Please, keep it for yourself; I'm confident that I will eventually save enough for the down payment." Fang Erlan didn't press further. Returning to her hotel room for rest, she sat on the bed, engrossed in the search for real estate online. Xiao Yue had been part of her life for about a year. Their daily interactions would come to an end when Fang Erlan exited the entertainment world. She wished to do something meaningful for Xiao Yue. Xiao Yue had always been more than generous, caring for and looking after her. When the doorbell chimed, Fang Erlan had already been perusing several housing communities. Confident in the security presence, she opened the door without hesitation. Greeted by the man at the threshold, a smile graced her features, "Have you returned?" "Yes." He stepped in, shutting the door behind him. Sweeping her off her feet, he carried her further inside, "What have you been up to?" "House hunting." "House hunting?" Xiao Chenyang placed her gently on the bed, his gaze falling on the laptop. "For a one-bedroom place?" he questioned, puzzled. "Our home should have more space." "It's not for us; it's for Xiao Yue." Xiao Chenyang removed his shoes. "Does she have the financial means for a house?" "No, I intend to buy it for her." "That's commendable." He sat next to her, draping an arm over her shoulder, "So, which one caught your eye?" "Take a look at these," she said, pointing them out one by one. "This one in Sanqiao seems perfect—good ventilation and lighting. Plus, isn't An Xiaoning's apartment also in that area? Let's settle on this one." Encouraged by his endorsement, Fang Erlan made her choice and jotted down the contact information. Then she broached, "Should we also get our own house in order? It will take some time after renovation, not to mention, we can't move in immediately—it needs to air out for a few months." "There's no need for the hassle of another renovation. Let's find a place that's already furnished and well-decorated. Captain Fan mentioned a fully furnished villa in the Winnie District that's up for sale at a fair price. We should buy that." "A villa?" Fang Erlan sought confirmation. "Is it like the one Sister Yangyang lives in?" "Quite." "Then let's go ahead with that purchase." "Agreed." "Today, at an event, an elderly man took advantage of the situation and knocked me over." As she saw the flame ignite in his eyes, she quickly added, "Luckily, our bodyguard was on the ball and tossed him out immediately." Fang Erlan set aside the computer and small table, then took her seat beside him, facing him earnestly, "To be honest, did you miss me these past few days?" "I didn't miss you; I missed Fang Xiaogou more." She feigned annoyance. "You're the little dog." He enveloped her in his arms as they lay down. "Alright, I'm the little dog, and you're the woman who sleeps with the little dog." "..." Fang Erlan gave him a playful pinch. "Can't you speak properly?" "Certainly... Mrs. Xiao." Now satisfied, Fang Erlan inquired, "Is everything sorted out?" "Mostly, although it's been quite amusing." He turned toward her. "Let me recount the details to you." "I'm all ears," she replied, eager to listen. --- The hospital. An Xiaoning and Henry arrived together to visit Elder Jin. Captain Fan had informed them that Elder Jin had awakened and was no longer in critical condition; he simply needed to rest well in the hospital. Henry had been reluctant to come, but An Xiaoning had insisted. Upon their entry into the ward, they found Elder Jin engrossed in a newspaper. He looked up at their arrival and snorted, "So many days have passed, and this is when you, as a son, come to see me. Is that justifiable?" Without mincing words, Henry responded, "That I've come at all is nothing short of a miracle; what more do you expect?" "What do you mean by 'miracle'? Remember, I am your father!" "You recall now that you're my father?" Henry's tone was icy, not wishing to engage further, "When will you behave appropriately?" Elder Jin, choked with anger, abandoned the newspaper on the bedside table. "Uncle, how are you feeling?" An Xiaoning inquired, depositing the fruit basket. "Much better, thank you." "Qingyan has been feeling unwell these days and couldn't visit, but he has been worried about you. Uncle, could you perhaps avoid the casino in the future? You didn't go often before, and if you're bored now, maybe you could travel or partake in activities with your peers? That would be more substantial." Elder Jin let out a disdainful snort. "What's the point in mingling with people I don't know? It's pointless." "Yes, because losing money is so fulfilling," Henry interjected with a hint of sarcasm. "Now that you're in the hospital, you can't gamble, can you?" "Do you get a kick out of bickering with me?" Elder Jin retorted, frustration evident. "If you have nothing more to say, then leave—all of you, leave." Henry grabbed An Xiaoning's arm without another word, turned, and walked out. Once outside the room, he released her arm and remarked, "I told you it was pointless to visit him, but you insisted." "Your father is in the hospital, and it's proper that we visit to prevent any unpleasant talk. It was necessary," she explained. He was visibly impatient. "I would rather go home and see Wangcai and Fugui than visit him." "..." An Xiaoning was speechless. "Well, we've seen him; let's head back." Though the visit to Elder Jin was accomplished, another destination awaited them. When he realized she wasn't driving back to the Winnie District, he asked, "Where are you headed?" "To the Devil's Training Camp." He remained silent, letting her drive into the grounds of the training camp. On the way, An Xiaoning had procured gifts for the children, including two for Long Tianze's kids, one for each child. The children were delighted with their gifts. By the time they returned, an hour had passed. Wu Haigang had agreed to lift their curse, but it would have to wait until Jin Qingyan's birthday on the sixteenth of October. It was soon approaching, so there was no rush for these last few days. For the time being, Wu Haigang was being held in custody. An Xiaoning had also had someone check Wu Lianzhi's information abroad. She had initially planned to transfer her household registration to Country S, but to her surprise, it had been canceled there, saving her some trouble. He had gone to the Public Security Bureau to apply for his own household registration. Thanks to An Xiaoning's prior arrangements, it was processed swiftly. When he returned, he found An Xiaoning sipping coffee, waiting for him. "I almost forgot something," he began. "What is it?" "You still haven't answered my question about why your people here were after my hair," he said, a hint of embarrassment in his voice. Chapter 1314: Only You (12) "Honestly, I was hesitant to tell you, but after seeing that mural, I was struck by a rather audacious thought." "What kind of thought?" "I wanted to have your hair tested to see if we share any blood relation." An Xiaoning, taken aback, had not anticipated this reason at all. "I kept it to myself because I feared your revulsion." "There's nothing revolting about it." As she finished speaking, the voice of Xiao Lv filtered through from outside, "Madam, representatives from the Donggong Clan overseas have arrived at the gates." She had foreseen their approach, yet their promptness was unexpected. "Invite them in." "Very well." "Do I need to... excuse myself?" he inquired. "Why bother? Are we intimidated by them?" "Certainly not." An Xiaoning gestured to the servant, "Another cup of coffee, please." "Right away, Madam." The group from the Donggong Clan included several sons of the Donggong Patriarch and a number of grandsons. All were influential male members of the Clan. "Please, have a seat." One by one, the six or seven men sat down. The Eldest Elder Donggong initiated the conversation, "Miss An, we come today with two objectives: firstly, to offer you a sincere apology, and secondly, to plead for the release of our Elder Donggong." "I accept your apology. But as for releasing your elder—how does that arise? I know nothing of him. Who is he? What does he look like? What's his name?" Wu Lianzhi had not foreseen her outright denial, but guessing at her motives, remained silently seated. The men from the Donggong Clan were visibly confounded by her blunt denial. "Miss An, let's speak plainly. We've ascertained that our Elder Donggong is under your care." "Any proof to support that claim?" "Well..." The men exchanged glances, "But we're absolutely certain of it." "I'm sorry, but certainties are void without proof," she refused to concede any leverage, "Accusations cannot be made so recklessly." "Miss An," the Second Elder Donggong interjected, "state your terms. Whatever it takes to secure his release, we will comply." "Must I reiterate myself?" she responded with composure, "I truly have not taken your so-called elder." However, they did not believe her, convinced she was merely not admitting to it. Seeing her resolute stance, the men found themselves at an impasse. They were unaware that An Xiaoning intended for them to depart in vain, as she had no intention of sparing Wu Haigang's life. "Miss An..." After a tense minute of silence, the Eldest Elder Donggong spoke, "If you consent to free our Elder Donggong, the Donggong Clan will swear allegiance to you. This is the patriarch's own pledge." Wu Lianzhi froze completely. "Why would your father..." She trailed off, leaving her question unfinished. "Our Clan has long lost the Witchcraft Cauldron Technique, and the elder is the sole keeper of that knowledge. Without him, there is no hope for our revival." "Revival?" An Xiaoning queried with a sly smile, "To propagate your witchcraft and continue afflicting others?" "That wasn't my implication." Unmoved by his words, An Xiaoning remained firm, "I'm genuinely unaware of the elder's whereabouts. Please, if there's nothing more, I must ask you to leave; your company is no longer needed." She delivered a decisive expulsion. The Donggong delegation was left without recourse, even after playing their trump card. Her unwavering stance left them utterly out of options. And so it was. The Eldest Elder Donggong, left with no alternative, knelt down in a last-ditch gesture of desperation. "What are you doing? I've told you, I haven't seen your family elder. Do you expect me to conjure him out of thin air?" "..." Ultimately, they left with nothing to show for their visit. The living room fell silent. An Xiaoning glanced at Wu Lianzhi's stoic face and asked, "Do you see me as heartless too?" "Not in the slightest," Wu Lianzhi assured her with sincerity, "I understand your perspective, and your actions are justified. I am no longer affiliated with the Donggong Clan, hence this is now a matter for others. I withhold my opinion." "Once the curse is undone, this chapter will be conclusively closed. Truthfully, you are the one I should be most thankful to. If it wasn't for you reaching out to me, I might never have discovered your existence, or at least not without a prolonged period. Without your intervention, I wouldn't have learned of these events so swiftly. You know, Xiao Chenyang had sought the Wu descendants but found no trace. After all these years, it's not an easy task. We had presumed extinction due to backlash was the likely cause." "The fact that I could play a part in resolving this matter so fortuitously brings me joy. It's astonishing how fate has brought us together in such an extraordinary manner." As Henry descended the stairs, he caught sight of An Xiaoning and Wu Lianzhi sharing a moment of mutual understanding. Pausing on the staircase, he called to An Xiaoning in an offhand tone, "Come up here for a moment; I need to speak with you." "What about?" "You'll find out once you're here." With that, he turned and ascended, leaving An Xiaoning to follow, believing he had something important to say. It was only upon reaching him that she discovered it was a ruse. "You said you had something to discuss. Were you just toying with me?" "And what if I was?" Without a word, An Xiaoning shot him a look, "Fine, enjoy your games. I'll take my leave now." "Hold on." "Now what?" "When do you plan to send that fellow on his way?" "He'll reside here for the time being. We'll decide in due course," An Xiaoning reasoned, considering that the curse should be lifted and Wu Lianzhi's household registration settled before arranging his departure. "Decide in due course?" Henry's mood soured, "I find the presence of an unfamiliar man in our residence disconcerting." "Then put up with the inconvenience, it's only temporary." "An Xiaoning, this is my domain!" "Does that mean you're admitting to being Qingyan?" she approached him provocatively. "Who says we aren't one and the same? Aren't we inherently united?" "Perfect." She settled onto the bed, hands bracing her as she leaned back, a picture of contemplation, "I have a particular need right now, and I'm hoping you can oblige me." A spasm crossed Henry's lips, "You're starting this again..." "What's 'again'? Isn't this perfectly natural? Henry, I believe it's high time for us to establish a deeper connection. I trust you'll earnestly consider my proposal." Chapter 1315: Only You (13) "No need." An Xiaoning briskly turned and made her way out, as his voice echoed from behind, "Where to?" "To meet my destiny." "......" —— After descending from upstairs, An Xiaoning found that Wu Lianzhi was no longer there. She settled onto the couch and turned on the television, which was currently showing an archaeological documentary featuring an interview with Wang Jinsheng. Watching intently, her demeanor was completely relaxed. After a few minutes, she made a call to Pan Zhenghui. "Director Pan, it's me." "Ah... Xiaoning." "Is Wang Jinsheng still heading the archaeological team?" "Yes, but I've been meaning to discuss his case with you. Since your last mention of his involvement with tomb raiding, I've been covertly investigating him. We now have some findings." An Xiaoning was taken aback by the quick progress. "You work with remarkable efficiency." "How could I not take a matter you mentioned seriously?" Pan Zhenghui replied. "It's too convoluted to explain over the phone. Xiaoning, could you come over to the bureau?" "I'll be there shortly." "Good, good." She switched off the television and headed to the bureau. Pan Zhenghui had carefully prepared the documents, and by the time An Xiaoning arrived, he had even brewed some tea. "Here, Xiaoning, try this new tea I bought. Let's sit down and talk this through." Taking the tea, An Xiaoning sat opposite him. "What have you uncovered?" "The investigation into Captain Wang... has led to some dismay. He's always appeared upstanding, but upon closer scrutiny, his true colors have emerged. His recent association with He Yi isn't longstanding, but he's been implicated in transactions involving our nation's cultural relics, secretly profiting from their sale." An Xiaoning, momentarily at a loss for words, finally said, "Then proceed with the investigation and ensure he faces the fair consequences he deserves." "Certainly." "Additionally, keep an eye on He Yi. If he dares to continue his illicit tomb raiding within our borders, handle it as necessary." "Understood." An Xiaoning inquired, "Has the special team found a replacement for Yuan Mingzhu yet?" Pan Zhenghui sighed deeply. "If I had, you'd have been the first to know. It's not easy to find the right person. We thought we had a candidate, but he turned out to be a fraud. Xiaoning, we need your expertise, even if it's just occasionally. Can you manage that? There are cold cases from over two decades ago still unsolved. Without you, they might remain unsolved indefinitely—not due to a lack of evidence, but because of the political sensitivities involved." "What do you mean?" "Isn't it clear?" Pan Zhenghui's voice dropped to a whisper. "The suspects are well-connected; they're practically untouchable." "Alright," An Xiaoning said, "I'll remain as the head of the special team, but I can't be at the bureau every day. My schedule is packed; I can only come in sporadically—perhaps only a few days a month, or even just one." Pan Zhenghui nearly leapt with excitement at her agreement. "Fantastic! Even if it's just for one day, having you is invaluable. Our nation is in dire need of talents like you. There are many major unsolved cases, some for years. Without modern forensics, they were nearly impossible to crack in the past. And as for cases with evidence that we can't close due to powerful suspects, no one is more outraged than I am." "Collect all the information and evidence on those notorious cases and forward them to the special team. I'll review them there." "Will do." An Xiaoning put her teacup down, left the director's office, and headed towards the special team's room. It was unusually quiet. She pushed open the door and saw everyone deep in thought, silent. Zu Dong was the first to notice her and promptly stood up. "Ah, team leader, what brings you here?" "Why all the long faces?" she asked as she entered. "Just the usual case troubles. But what about you, Xiaoning? Is there an urgent matter?" "No, just needed to speak with the director. But I do have some good news to share with you all," she announced, sitting at the table. "Guess what?" The team looked at each other curiously. Good news? "What is it?" "Try guessing." Ma Jianguo speculated, "Could it be... you're rejoining us to lead the special team?" "How did you manage to guess correctly?" An Xiaoning asked with a smile. "Old Ma, you're showing remarkable insight." "Just a hunch," he replied with a chuckle. Gong Le chimed in, "Absolutely, Old Ma's intuition is spot-on—even the unusual doesn't escape his notice." "You rascal! Come here, and I'll show you!" Ma Jianguo feigned anger. Gong Le winked, "Old Ma's about to show his ire!" The previously subdued atmosphere turned lively with their banter. Once the excitement subsided, Ma Jianguo asked with a hint of uncertainty, "Team leader, are you really coming back? You're not just pulling our leg, are you?" "What would be the point in pulling your leg?" An Xiaoning said, leaning back. "I've already discussed it with the director. I can't commit to coming in daily—I'll be available sporadically, maybe just a few days a month, but the director agrees it's acceptable." "Didn't I say today felt like a day for good news? Whether it's a few days or not, just having you is what counts," Ma Jianguo said, his voice filled with excitement. "Indeed. We'll launch new cases once you're done with the current ones. I just wanted to stop by and let you all know ahead of time. I'll leave you to your tasks for now. Keep up the good work, and we'll talk soon." "You've barely warmed your chair, and you're leaving already?" "I wouldn't want to disrupt your focus. Carry on, and we'll catch up another time." With that, she stood and left. On her way back, An Xiaoning stopped at a supermarket to buy some water. Unexpectedly, she encountered Shi Shaochuan and... Bu Qianqian. She had heard that Shi and Bu had parted ways long ago. Curious turn of events, she thought. "Look at you, Bu Qianqian, making a return," An Xiaoning said, initiating conversation while holding a bottle of water. Chapter 1316: Only You (14) 'What do you mean by that?' Bu Qianqian faced her squarely, her eyes sharp. 'How am I capable?' 'Weren't you two split up? How come you're back together?' An Xiaoning's voice was tinged with a hint of mischief and an undercurrent of curiosity. 'That's a matter between us and doesn't concern you,' Bu Qianqian snapped back, her nervousness peeking through her defiance. 'So, mind your own business and move along.' An Xiaoning shrugged indifferently, her tone dripping with feigned concern, 'Oh well, good luck with that.' After watching An Xiaoning walk away, Bu Qianqian, clinging to Shi Shaochuan's arm, muttered, 'Isn't she just insufferable?' 'She's always been such an annoyance, hasn't she?' Shi Shaochuan responded, his voice as distant as a winter's echo. 'Don't bother with her. Did you find everything we came for?' 'Pretty much.' 'Let's go then,' Shi Shaochuan said, and they headed to the cashier. As they left the supermarket, they saw An Xiaoning standing by her car, sipping water and watching them with an inscrutable gaze. 'Shi Shaochuan.' Shi Shaochuan, disinterested, dismissed her with a wave. 'What is it?' 'Do you want a piece of advice, or would you rather not hear it?' An Xiaoning asked, her voice carrying an unspoken warning that seemed to resonate with the supernatural elements of their world. 'Keep your tricks to yourself.' An Xiaoning spread her hands, 'You said it, not me. I won't bother then. But don't you feel a sense of unease within?' She walked around the front of the car, intending to leave, but Shi Shaochuan called out to her, 'Wait.' She rolled down the window, 'Yes?' 'Did you notice something wrong?' he queried, a trace of suspicion in his voice. Bu Qianqian quickly interrupted, 'An Xiaoning, quit your act. We're not buying it.' 'Oh, Bu Qianqian, you're something else,' An Xiaoning said lazily, her eyes fixed on the duo outside, 'Under any other circumstance, Shi Shaochuan, I wouldn't bother giving you advice. You're not exactly a saint. But with Bu Qianqian, the woman I loathe the most, I just can't bear to see her so content. Shi Shaochuan, you're carrying a spectral passenger, a ghostly burden at that.' 'Carrying what?' He looked perplexed. She grinned at him mysteriously, 'What do you think? Figure it out yourself.' Without another word, she rolled up the window and drove off, leaving a sense of unease lingering in the air. Shi Shaochuan stood there, then turned to Bu Qianqian, 'Was she implying that you're the one orchestrating this?' 'Shaochuan, you can't possibly take her seriously. It wasn't me. How could I have such abilities? Don't accuse me wrongly,' Bu Qianqian insisted, her voice laced with desperation. 'She has a grudge against me. You heard her; she can't stand to see me at ease. That detestable An Xiaoning, always spouting nonsense to stir trouble. Don't believe her; she wants to make us both miserable.' 'But how would she know I'm feeling ill?' 'You're pale as death. Anyone with eyes can see that.' Bu Qianqian continued, 'Please, Shaochuan, don't listen to her.' Shi Shaochuan's temples throbbed with an ominous headache, as if presaging darker troubles ahead. He said no more and got into the car, with Bu Qianqian taking her place in the passenger seat as they drove towards the Shi residence. Their drive home was silent. Upon arrival, Shi Shaochuan headed straight to bed, falling into a heavy sleep, while Bu Qianqian sat on the bed's edge, a sly grin curling her lips. Yet, thinking of An Xiaoning, that scheming spirit, made her blood boil, and she yearned to smash her head with a mallet. Thankfully, it seemed Shi Shaochuan harbored no suspicions. Meanwhile, An Xiaoning was reflecting on the encounter during her drive. Shi Shaochuan was undoubtedly haunted by something sinister, a deed that reeked of Bu Qianqian's handiwork. The woman had sunk her claws into dark arts. But meddling with spirits is a perilous affair; fail to appease them, and they bite back. Did Bu Qianqian truly understand the rules of this dangerous game? Foolish woman, she toys with forces beyond her reckoning. An Xiaoning could not fathom her endgame. It appeared Bu Qianqian sought to continue leeching benefits from Shi Shaochuan. Beyond that, her motives were a mystery. An Xiaoning resolved to stay out of it. Everyone's fate was their own to bear. Later that afternoon, Jin Qingyue, heavy with child, arrived. With her due date approaching, the nursery was ready, but the baby's clothes were yet to be chosen. She sought An Xiaoning's company to select the little one's wardrobe. An Xiaoning, free of other commitments, agreed. Wu Lianzhi also came along, mainly to drive and carry purchases. Henry was the initial choice, but An Xiaoning, wary of his temperament, chose not to trouble him. Unbeknownst to her, Henry was sulking by the window, feeling left out. Jin Qingyue's hair was loosely styled, partially concealing her rounded cheeks, now sprinkled with freckles from her pregnancy. She had refrained from makeup throughout her term for the baby's sake, leaving her once radiant skin somewhat dull. Yet, her inherent grace remained undiminished. She carefully made her way downstairs, cautious of every step. An Xiaoning trailed behind, alert to any potential accidents. Wu Lianzhi drove them to a department store, one of the Jin family's many enterprises. Both An Xiaoning and Jin Qingyue rarely visited the store. To avoid attention, and because Jin Qingyue was without makeup, they wore hats and masks—a simple yet effective disguise. Jin Qingyue had come to shop, fully intending to pay rather than charge the family account, so a bit of incognito was easier. As they entered the store, Wu Lianzhi's undisguised face caught the attention of the staff. 'Bring us your best infant boy products and clothing, the whole lot,' he requested with authority. The clerk was stunned, 'Everything, sir?' 'Yes, everything. The finest you have. We'd like to take our pick,' he insisted. The clerk, flustered, quickly fetched the manager, and they presented an array of baby clothes and items. 'These are all the items we have. Please have a look,' the manager said. 'Place them here,' Wu Lianzhi instructed, stepping aside to let the two women make their selections. Jin Qingyue held the tiny garments in her hands, her face alight with joy. An Xiaoning felt a similar warmth at the sight, the instinctive surge of motherly love almost overwhelming. 'This is more than he'll ever wear. Jin Qingyue, let's choose what's comfortable. We don't need so much,' An Xiaoning suggested softly. Jin Qingyue picked a few sets in different sizes, 'Certainly, certainly. They grow up so quickly, so there's no need for excess. A modest assortment will do for now. Let's start with these.' Chapter 1317: Only You (15) After a while, Jin Qingyue selected eight sets, but An Xiaoning felt it wasn't enough and picked out five more. They also chose other infant necessities like diapers and bottles, deciding to buy baby formula later as needed. Once they finished, An Xiaoning told the sales clerk, 'You can take the rest back; we have enough here.' Upon hearing this, the manager, who had been smiling just a moment ago, suddenly turned cold. He sneered, 'Some people pretend to be wealthy, demanding the most expensive and best items, only to buy half in the end.' An Xiaoning explained, 'A dozen sets of baby clothes are ample for now; we can always buy more if needed. Surely A City won't run out of these essentials.' The sales clerk, a mother herself, interjected, 'Manager, we can't force customers to buy; what they've selected is quite sufficient.' Instead of calming the manager, her words only aggravated him further. 'Are you here to teach me how to do my job? Who is the manager here, you or me?' The clerk, intimidated, recoiled, 'You are, of course, the manager.' Jin Qingyue retorted, 'It seems your sales clerk understands better than you do. Maybe you two should switch roles. Manager, why don't you try being a sales clerk? Or better yet, consider resigning.' The manager's anger intensified upon hearing this, but he remembered they were customers and somewhat restrained his temper. 'These matters are internal. Only those capable can be managers, and those who aren't, can only be clerks.' Jin Qingyue, unimpressed by the manager's arrogance, decided to leave the items and said, 'Forget it, we don't want these after all. There are other counters. Sister-in-law, let's look elsewhere.' Seeing that they were not going to purchase anything, the manager became less willing, 'If you want to leave, you need to pay for these items first.' Wu Lianzhi watched with detached interest, 'Isn't this forced selling?' 'If you didn't want them, why did you ask for so many? Are you just playing games with us? Everything's already bagged,' the manager said, gesturing dramatically and summoning several security guards. The implication was clear. At that moment, Jin Qingyue's phone rang. As she reached for it, the manager, mistaking her intent to call for help, snatched the phone away. 'Pay up now, and I'll let you leave,' he demanded. An Xiaoning had reached her limit, 'Who gave you the audacity to bully customers? You can simply unbag the items and put them back. Now, return the phone.' She had hoped to resolve the issue quietly, considering the store was part of the Jin family's business, and a commotion would be unseemly. But the manager, failing to see her intention, refused to give back the phone. With no other choice, An Xiaoning removed her hat and mask. The manager and the sales clerk were shocked into silence upon seeing her face. She approached the manager, reclaimed her phone, and left him with a parting shot, 'You indeed have quite the nerve.' The manager's face turned pale, his earlier assertiveness gone, replaced by spinelessness that left him speechless. 'Miss An... I apologize. I didn't realize who you were. Please accept my apologies,' he fumbled. 'No need for apologies; they're not sincere. It makes no difference whether you offer them or not. Now, call your general manager over,' An Xiaoning demanded. The manager, realizing the gravity of the situation, remained motionless. 'Go,' An Xiaoning ordered the sales clerk, 'and bring your general manager here.' 'Right away.' Moments later, the general manager arrived out of breath, followed by several others. After being briefed by the sales clerk on the way, he addressed An Xiaoning, 'Madam, this is a case where one bad apple spoils the barrel. Our staff would never dare treat customers this way; it's my oversight. Rest assured, I will address this lapse in attitude. This manager will be dismissed immediately.' 'That's reassuring. I wouldn't want to see such an incident happen here again. Understand?' 'Yes, Madam, there won't be a second time,' the general manager assured her, then ordered the sales clerk to bring the items Jin Qingyue had chosen. 'Are you still interested in these items?' An Xiaoning asked her brother's wife, Jin Qingyue. The general manager, realizing only now that the pregnant woman was the sister of their chairman, wished he could disappear. 'Forget it, we've made our choices, and I can't be bothered to look elsewhere. Let's settle the bill; I'll pay by card,' Jin Qingyue decided. She had insisted on not accepting any gifts or having An Xiaoning pay for her, so An Xiaoning didn't stop her from paying. As they were about to head home, a luxury car sped past them. The man behind the wheel, wearing dark sunglasses, drove away with flair. All three were momentarily stunned by the car's showiness, and especially because it looked just like Jin Qingyan's Mercedes, but it had sped by too quickly for An Xiaoning to get a clear look. Wu Lianzhi, watching the car zoom past, was visibly shaken, her hands trembling on the steering wheel, 'That driver is insanely reckless, driving so fast, as if they have a death wish.' As they continued to drive, they noticed that the car had stopped ahead. 'Why has it stopped?' Wu Lianzhi wondered. An Xiaoning squinted ahead, and upon recognizing the license plate, she sighed, turning to Jin Qingyue, 'That's your brother's sports car.' 'Is it?' Jin Qingyue responded, puzzled. 'Why would my brother be driving so recklessly?' 'Who knows?' As their vehicle was about to overtake the sports car, it suddenly took off again. 'Lianzhi, follow him,' An Xiaoning instructed. 'Alright.' Wu Lianzhi narrowed her eyes, focusing on the fast-moving car ahead, her foot firmly on the accelerator, driving both swiftly and smoothly. They followed the car all the way to a restaurant entrance. An Xiaoning, spotting Henry getting out of the car with Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai, understood immediately that he had been followed. She got out of the car, telling Wu Lianzhi to take Jin Qingyue home first, considering her condition. An Xiaoning then quickly made her way to the restaurant entrance. Henry was seated at a table by the window, with his companions sitting separately. 'What were you thinking driving like that?' An Xiaoning confronted Henry, sitting across from him. 'Why so reckless? Are you tired of living?' Henry looked at her dismissively, 'Why didn’t those with you come in?' 'They've gone home.' He had seen this but had asked deliberately. Chapter 1318: Only You (16) "Why didn't you go back with the others?" "Didn't I see you come in?" An Xiaoning responded tersely, "Or did you come to the restaurant because the food at home was too hard to swallow?!!" "Is it not permissible to dine out once in a while?" "Certainly, but it's only ten o'clock. Are you hungry already?" "Does hunger adhere to a schedule?" Sensing that he was deliberately provoking her, An Xiaoning offered, "What do you feel like eating? Let's order." "The person I'm expecting hasn't arrived. We'll order after they're here." "You're expecting someone?" An Xiaoning asked, "Who might that be?" "What concern is it of yours?" "......" An Xiaoning felt a thick tension in the air. What had she done to irritate him? So temperamental. Silence ensued. An Xiaoning leaned her chin on her crossed hands, fixing her gaze on him. He shifted uncomfortably under her scrutiny, turning his gaze outside the window. After ten minutes, Li Baozhen arrived, rushing. Recognizing her, An Xiaoning instantly grasped the situation, "Miss Li, please have a seat." Li Baozhen had not anticipated An Xiaoning's presence, smiling lightly, "Thank you. Receiving a dinner invitation from Qingyan-ge out of the blue today, especially on my day off, was quite the surprise." "Ah, I see. Qingyan-ge said he's been unable to make time for you lately, so he wanted to invite you out to see how you've been, given that you've been his savior. He's always kept you in his thoughts." Li Baozhen smiled faintly, "I'm quite content. At the company, I follow the daily grind—work, meals, and I stay put at home after hours, only venturing out for occasional strolls." Henry passed her the menu, "Order whatever your heart desires." "Alright." Li Baozhen chose several dishes, then handed the menu to An Xiaoning, who didn’t order as she wasn't feeling peckish. The atmosphere grew tense, likely from a shortage of shared topics. In this stalemate, An Xiaoning blurted out to Henry, "I'm considering a second child." !!!!!!!! The four people present abruptly cast their eyes on her. Xiao Bai and Xiao Huang suppressed their laughter, and Li Baozhen seemed more embarrassed. Henry was momentarily lost for words. Were they alone, he might have dismissively retorted, "Have it on your own." However, in this company, he managed, "Indeed, it's something we should seriously discuss at home." Unintentionally, the three single dogs at the table had just been served an ample helping of PDA. An Xiaoning knew too well that he was oblivious to her past because he wasn't burdened with the memories she shared with Jin Qingyan; he hadn't lived through her past, nor her difficulties with fertility. Under the table, she slyly extended her foot, lightly entangling it with his. Henry stiffened, his dark eyes locking with hers, knowing immediately whose foot it was, as Li Baozhen was seated right beside him. When the meal arrived, An Xiaoning only nibbled a bit before ceasing. While wiping her mouth with a napkin, it fell, and as she bent to retrieve it, she seized the chance to stealthily graze Henry's leg. Henry was internally raging. She had the audacity to covertly tease him in such a public setting. And when she picked up the napkin, her expression unruffled, and swiftly winked at him, he had to sit upright and composed, as if utterly unaffected. The dining experience was anything but enjoyable, particularly in terms of the atmosphere. Hence, once they finished eating, he said to her, "You, along with Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai, go to the car. I'd like to have a word with Baozhen in private." An Xiaoning complied with ease, preserving his dignity, "Alright." They quickly made their exit. After watching them climb into the car, he turned to Li Baozhen, saying, "Stay dedicated at work, and whenever free, make time to visit your parents. If you ever need assistance at the company, reach out to Xiaoning or Captain Fan, okay?" "Qingyan-ge, you gave me this advice when I started at the company, and now you're reiterating it. Are you about to leave on another business trip?" Henry confirmed, "Indeed, I am often away on business and seldom in A City." "Qingyan-ge," Li Baozhen regarded him, "I can't shake the feeling that you're talking as if you're leaving for a faraway place and won't return." He chose not to elaborate, "Let's leave. Xiaoning and the rest are waiting. I'll drive you back to work." "Okay." After escorting Li Baozhen back to the company, the car retraced its route to the Winnie Community, but... Inside the garage, silence prevailed. Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai alighted first, followed by the pair. Only when they ascended to the second floor did they speak. An Xiaoning broached the topic, "What did you speak of with her back in the car?" "I discussed matters not meant for others' ears." "......" An Xiaoning could tell something was amiss, "What's bothering you?" "Nothing." He slid under the covers and closed his eyes, signaling his wish to be left alone. An Xiaoning edged closer, casting her shoes aside and kneeling on the bed, "Henry, you did agree to have another child with me at dinner." "Don't you realize I was merely trying to prevent your embarrassment?" "You've changed." An Xiaoning peered at him, "You’re not the Henry who once loathed me. If you were, would you have cared whether I faced humiliation?" He peered back at her, squinting, "An Xiaoning, I need you to agree to something." "Is it that if I say yes, you'll think about having another child with me?" "......" "Alright, what is it?" "When I'm not here, and he encounters Baozhen, I hope he'll acknowledge her, and perhaps visit her parents now and then, maybe once annually." "What if he refuses?" An Xiaoning probed. "No, he will do it. He heeds your words." Driven nearly to distraction by his entrancing gaze, An Xiaoning yearned to devour him whole. "I know you don't wish to touch me, but at moments like this, I can't resist the urge. Allow me a single kiss, and I'll consent to your request." "......" "If not, it's fine." As she was about to cross over him to the other side of the bed, he uttered, "One kiss only." Therefore, she straddled him and descended for the kiss. Henry had a fleeting impulse to retract, but it was already too late; her kiss was far from fleeting. She kissed him until he responded with evident arousal. Releasing him, Henry lay there, gazing at her, seemingly immobilized by the encounter. Chapter 1319: Only You (17) An Xiaoning watched him with satisfaction, and whispered affectionately, 'Oppa, saranghae (Brother, I love you).' Henry felt an unexpected surge in his heart, leaving him speechless. Lying beside him, An Xiaoning wrapped her arms around his neck and said, 'Today, Lianzhi and I went shopping for baby items. Seeing all those baby products made me long to have another child. Imagine having three little ones at home—wouldn't that be wonderful?' He moved his lips, attempting to speak, but no words came out. After a while, she thought he had fallen asleep. When she glanced at him, she found his eyes wide open, deep in thought. 'You seem preoccupied with something.' 'No.' 'Henry, let's go to sleep.' 'Okay, let's sleep.' She repeated, emphasizing the words more strongly, 'OK?' 'OK.' Surprised, An Xiaoning sat up to look at him closely, 'Qingyan?' 'I am Henry.' '!!!' An Xiaoning moved closer, 'If something's troubling you, just talk to me. Don't keep it bottled up.' 'An Xiaoning.' 'Yes?' 'Would you really hate me if I never disappeared?' She avoided answering, 'I don't want to address that.' He nodded, as if understanding something. 'What are you doing?!' 'Henry, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you all of a sudden?' 'Let go, I'm telling you to let go! Are you out of your mind? Let go!' '...' Thanks to the room's excellent soundproofing, none of the noise inside could be heard from outside. At three o'clock in the afternoon, Auntie Chen knocked again, 'Young Madam, Young Master, it's time for lunch; it's already three.' A soft, muffled voice answered from within, 'Understood, Auntie Chen. We'll be right down.' With that assurance, Auntie Chen hastened downstairs to finish preparing. An Xiaoning slowly opened her eyes, gazing vacantly for a moment before focusing on the man beside her. She had never imagined he would take such initiative in a scene so untamed and unrestrained. Normally, he wouldn't even let her touch his finger, proving the saying true—what's least expected often happens. Propping herself up, An Xiaoning noticed a note on the nightstand with a pen beside it. Out of curiosity, she picked it up and read the words written on it. [I've lost our bet and, as promised, I will fade away. Today... has been the happiest day of my life, a happiness given to me by you, the person I once detested the most. Thank you. —Henry] Her hand shook slightly as she read. Today had been full of surprises. She had no clue when she had made him fall for her. His disappearance would have been the best outcome for her. Yet his silent farewell caused her an unexpected twinge of melancholy. She sat there, stunned for quite some time before lying back down and hugging the man beside her. The man she embraced instinctively held her back and softly called out, 'Xiaoning...' 'Yes?' He opened his eyes, saw her so close, and suddenly realized the situation. They were naked in each other's embrace. Memories of their passionate encounter overwhelmed Jin Qingyan's mind. Then, a torrent of memories began to emerge, prompting him to sit up quickly. 'Qingyan, what's wrong?' He embraced her tightly, 'Xiaoning.' 'What's the matter?' 'How come I suddenly have Henry's memories?' An Xiaoning had an inkling of what had happened. If their memories had been separate before, they were now merged, at the cost of Henry's true disappearance. 'He honored our agreement and disappeared on his own. Essentially, your past unhappiness and negativity have been exposed. You're still you, whether as Henry or Jin Qingyan. You've set a precedent. Dual personalities are deemed incurable in current medical science, yet you've healed. Isn't that extraordinary?' 'Did he fall in love with you?' Although Jin Qingyan had anticipated this, it felt surreal, 'Sooner than I expected. I thought it would take several more encounters alone with you.' 'It feels abrupt to me as well. On reflection, he probably realized today that his feelings for me have changed from aversion to affection. His behavior was very unusual today, even going so far as to frantically pin me down on the bed, hm.' Jin Qingyan arched an eyebrow, his tone filled with implication, 'So...' 'No 'so.' I'm getting up. It's already the afternoon, and I'm hungry. Since Henry's memories have merged with yours, there's no need to discuss certain things separately, especially regarding Li Baozhen. Henry believed we should visit her parents at least once a year and be kind to her, which I support. She saved your life, and we owe her gratitude, right?' 'Certainly. But say it one more time.' 'Say what again?' 'Say 'Oppa, saranghae.'' '...' An Xiaoning complied and softly said, 'Oppa, saranghae, brother, I love you.' He felt elated as he held her in his embrace. — On the sixteenth day of the tenth lunar month, Jin Qingyan's birthday arrived. For him, the ultimate gift was the end of the curse. They had no concerns about Wu Haigang's deceit; he was well aware that his end was in their hands, while his descendants still had lives to lead. At that moment, he had no other choice. On his birthday, he lifted their curse, and with its release, his own life ended. The Wu family's Witchcraft Cauldron Technique came to an end. For the Donggong Clan of Country R, An Xiaoning reflected, their desire for her demise had resulted in Wu Haigang's death at their own hands. Nothing else held significance. Once the curse was broken, Wu Haigang was secretly executed. An Xiaoning finally felt the weight lift from her heart, entering the most relaxed and content phase of her life. Wu Lianzhi's household registration had been approved. 'Now that you have permanent residency, I've arranged a job for you as a university counselor. While the school prohibits faculty-student romance, it's where you'll meet the most women. If you find mutual attraction with someone, you could opt for another job or even a secret romance. What do you think?' Chapter 1320: Only You (18) 'It aligns perfectly with my wishes, yet I harbor a concern.' 'And what might that be?' 'That the Donggong Clan will persist in seeking vengeance against me.' 'Do they still dare?' An Xiaoning queried further, 'Here's what I propose: I shall issue a declaration to them, making it known that you are under my protection. Should they dare to meddle with you again, they shall face my wrath. Does this put your mind at ease?' 'Xiaoning, your valor knows no bounds.' With a chuckle, An Xiaoning remarked, 'Is that not the essence of camaraderie? Thanks to your aid, the curse has been lifted. It is only right that I safeguard you in return. Pursue boldly the tranquility you seek, and the affection of the girl who has captured your heart.' 'Understood. I shall strive with all my might.' ... Throughout the day, the servants were busy with preparations for the birthday celebration at the manor. Although Jin Qingyan had already received the finest of birthday tributes, it did not negate the need for a celebratory soirée. As evening approached, his most intimate friends would convene for a modest celebration to honor his natal day. Just past five o'clock, An Xiaoning, freshly bathed, was playfully commandeered to the bed by Jin Qingyan, who demanded with an air of authority, 'A birthday serenade, if you please, before anything else.' 'A proper serenade shall be rendered when the festivity commences.' 'I insist on a prelude.' With an eye roll, An Xiaoning acquiesced, 'Ever the child at heart, Jin Sansui. Very well, on this day of your birth, your wish is my command. Let me now sing a ditty for our beloved Oppa.' He clapped with fervor, prompting An Xiaoning to suppress a giggle. Happy Birthday to you... Happy Birthday to you... 'What a delightful melody.' No sooner had he lavished praise than he pinned her beneath him, engaging in a playful tussle that left them both breathless with laughter on the bed. Their merriment would have continued unabated had not a knock at the door beckoned their attention. It was Captain Fan Shixin delivering the attire and accessories for the night's celebration. A gown and footwear, bespoke for her. Upon inspection, An Xiaoning was instantly smitten with the ensemble — a pristine white cocktail dress paired with equally lustrous heels, encrusted with diamonds. These heels, a testament to meticulous craftsmanship, were tailored for An Xiaoning's usual aversion to such footwear, offering both a commanding height and an unwavering balance, rendering her stride as elegant as it was assured. Once they had both dressed in their finest, their descent down the staircase coincided with the arrival of a modest throng of guests. Ling Ciyi and Jin Qingyue were ensconced on the settee, while Long Tianze, who initially occupied a seat beside Ling Ciyi, opted for a more languid posture, draping himself over Ling Ciyi's legs instead. Were they not bound by the ties of brotherhood, Ling Ciyi might well have catapulted him straight to Wazhao Country. 'Ah, behold the radiance of our sister-in-law, a vision of splendor,' Long Tianze extolled with a whistle, 'Gorgeous, truly gorgeous.' 'Indeed, sister-in-law, you are a sight to behold in such attire,' concurred Jin Qingyue with an approving nod, 'A paragon of beauty.' 'Money well invested,' An Xiaoning quipped with a smile, 'Where is Yangyang at this hour?' 'He has gone to fetch the children. What kind of celebration would this be without the little ones in attendance?' As the children arrived, the assembly was nearly complete. This was an intimate affair, devoid of strangers. Thus, by the time the clock signaled an hour past six, the birthday celebration ceremoniously commenced. Captain Fan, acting as the emcee, initiated the proceedings. Following his introductory remarks, he invited Jin Qingyan to make a wish and cut the cake. Jin Qingyan approached the cake as the birthday anthem filled the air. Clasping his hands and closing his eyes, he soon extinguished the candle's flame with a gentle puff. A rousing chorus of applause ensued. 'My wish...' Jin Qingyan began, pausing to bestow a tender gaze upon An Xiaoning in the crowd, '...is to hasten the day when Xiaoning shall once again be my wife.' 'Bravo!' Long Tianze led the chorus of acclamation, his applause spirited. The sentiment was echoed by the others, their cheers resounding. An Xiaoning, however, remained poised, her gaze fixed on Jin Qingyan as a soft smile played upon her lips, her heart fluttering with a mixture of joy and anticipation. When it came time to divide the cake, An Xiaoning joined him in the act, and as the cake was shared, the revelry began in earnest. They feasted, drank, and reveled, their dance a celebration of high spirits. The children were beside themselves with joy, sneaking off to a room with wine in tow, only to succumb to their indulgence, leaving them in a drunken slumber. An Xiaoning could not have foreseen the arrival of Wang Jinsheng at her doorstep. She consented to an audience with him, albeit reluctantly. 'Miss An...' 'If you've come hoping that I might intercede on your behalf once more, I must dissuade you from voicing such a plea, for it will be to no avail.' Wang Jinsheng, taken aback by her foreknowledge, stammered, 'Miss An, when did you... become aware?' 'I was apprised of the situation prior to the morning news broadcast, but my awareness predates even that.' With a wry smile, An Xiaoning probed, 'Was it not you who implicated me to He Yi regarding the Shenjia Lake incident? Are not your dealings with He Yi alarmingly frequent for an archaeologist? Your association with those engaged in tomb raiding — what were you thinking? Furthermore... to involve yourself in such unlawful activities. Given that you have dared to show your face here, I surmise that the authorities are en route to apprehend you as we speak, are they not?' Wang Jinsheng, drenched in a cold sweat, beseeched her, 'Miss An, I implore you, grant me clemency this once, and I vow never to err again.' 'Madam An, have my words not resonated with clarity?' An Xiaoning rose to her feet, 'One must bear the consequences of their misdeeds.' 'Madam An, officers from the Criminal Police Squad are here to escort Captain Wang Jinsheng away.' 'Is he not present among us?' An Xiaoning retorted. Captain Fan signaled the officers waiting outside. They entered and took custody of Wang Jinsheng. An Xiaoning exhaled deeply and inquired, 'Shixin, whatever could have possessed Captain Wang to act so recklessly?' 'I am as perplexed as you are,' Captain Fan confessed. 'Perhaps he was oblivious to your knowledge of the matter and wished to try his luck.' 'Indeed, he has been the architect of his own downfall, and none can spare him from the consequences of his folly.' ... After lunch, An Xiaoning received a call from Pan Zhenghui, instructing her to report to the precinct. Upon her arrival, Pan Zhenghui discussed two matters: the case of Wang Jinsheng and He Yi, and a new assignment for her. Regarding Wang Jinsheng's debacle, Pan Zhenghui could only shake his head in dismay, 'The man is a lamentable case. After years of dedicated service in the Archaeological Team, holding the rank of captain, how could he succumb to such indiscretion? His captaincy forfeited, his livelihood in jeopardy, and incarceration imminent. As for He Yi, per your directive to monitor his activities, he has proven to be a recalcitrant problem. The authorities in Country Y are fervently pursuing him, seeking our collaboration in their manhunt.' Chapter 1321: Only You (19) An Xiaoning inquired, "Have they been caught?" "Could there have been any escape? You had already advised me to keep an eye on him, and my people have been closely watching him. It was easy to capture him, and he has been taken away by international law enforcement, his guilt surpassing even that of Wang Jinsheng." "What kind of sentence do you think he'll receive?" "Conservatively speaking, at least ten years. He's in for a tough time." An Xiaoning didn't say much more, knowing that everyone has their own life path and must take responsibility for their actions. "Let's talk about the case." "All right." Pan Zhenghui handed her several case file boxes. "These contain two notorious cold cases. Take a look and decide which one to start with; they've been unsolved for many years. Although one case has plenty of evidence, it still seems challenging. Take these and discuss with the special team's members." An Xiaoning took the files, "Understood." As she left the office, she started to open the file boxes, their yellowed pages indicating their age. Upon entering the office, everyone turned their attention to her. Ma Jianguo rubbed his hands together and chuckled, "Xiaoning, you're here at last. We've been waiting for you. Our current cases have been wrapped up, and the chief said we should start on the major cases with you." An Xiaoning sat down and seriously addressed them, "I currently have two famous cold cases. At a glance, one is twenty-two years old, the other fourteen. It's not always the most meticulous or skilled in evasion who commit these crimes. Consider the time they were committed—no surveillance, no fingerprints, solving these would indeed be difficult. Review these cases briefly; then I'll take a closer look." She passed the file folders to each person for a quick review. After about fifteen minutes, they had skimmed the key points and handed the files back to her. "Having looked them over, which case do you think we should tackle first?" Ma Jianguo suggested, "I think we should start with the Widows' Village case. It's the oldest and, though it has sparked much online debate, it lacks the solid evidence of the other case. I believe we should begin with the more difficult case due to the lack of evidence." Gong Le agreed, "I also agree with Old Ma. I've been following discussions about Widows' Village online, and it seems the culprit is still living worry-free. This is the most unsettling for the deceased. Investigating this case will be the toughest, so I agree to start here." An Xiaoning nodded, "Then we'll start with this one. But do you really think the second case with solid evidence will be easy to solve? If it were so simple, why wasn't it closed despite the evidence, and why was the investigation halted?" Ma Jianguo replied in a low voice, "Isn't it because of the perpetrator's powerful family connections? With someone to cover for them, of course. But compared to your status, Xiaoning, theirs is nothing. There's always a bigger fish. I bet they don't know that you're personally investigating this case. Would they be scared if they knew?" "Keep your mouths shut about the second case. We haven't started it, and I want complete silence on the matter, or you'll face the consequences." "Xiaoning, don't worry. What are we? We're police officers. Trust in your subordinates, OK?" An Xiaoning acknowledged with a hum, "I'll take the second case file home for a thorough review. We'll discuss it together once we start. For now, focus all attention on the first case. I want to use a subtle approach to investigation, digging into the details slowly. This case has probably become taboo in the village. Also, I want to confirm that before the incident, the gender ratio in the village was normal, right?" "Correct, before the case, the male-to-female ratio in the village was standard. After the deaths began, many men were afraid to stay at home and moved away. Now the village is mainly inhabited by economically disadvantaged elderly people, middle-aged widows, and children, with many of the elderly also being widows. Initially, people suspected the water supply, but that was not the case, as both men and women drank from the well, yet only the men died. Eventually, the village was renamed Widows' Village." Ma Jianguo recalled, "Twenty years ago, there were many superstitions, suggesting the deceased were seeking revenge on the village, which is why the village's tragedy has been linked with these victims." "It seems that to truly understand Widows' Village, I need to visit personally, which I had already planned to do." Zu Dong asked, "Team leader, are we going with you, or do you have other plans?" "We can't all go; that would raise suspicion. I'll assign tasks." She detailed their assignments, "Zu Dong, come with me. Gong Le and Ding Liang, being young, conduct field reconnaissance around Widows' Village without arousing local suspicion. Ma Jianguo, you're the most experienced, so stay at the station on standby." Ma Jianguo protested, "Xiaoning, isn't this ageism? I don't want to stay at the station. I'll go with them. I have extensive experience as a seasoned officer and understand more than they do." "Fine. That's settled. I'll take the case file home to review in detail. You three go ahead with the reconnaissance. Zu Dong and I will head back to Winnie Community." "Agreed." After driving Zu Dong home, An Xiaoning found Jin Qingyan still at home, not at the company. "Why aren't you at the company?" "I'll go in a bit." Jin Qingyan noticed Zu Dong's arrival and asked, "You've really taken on a case?" "Yes, this afternoon, Zu Dong and I will head to Widows' Village, and I won't be back for some time." Jin Qingyan disliked hearing this; her absence meant he'd have to sleep alone and wouldn't see her for a while. "Do you plan to stay there?" "Of course." After thinking it over, An Xiaoning added, "Zu Dong and I will pretend to be a married couple to rent a house." It was better to tell him early to prevent unnecessary jealousy. '...' Jin Qingyan objected, "Send Fan Shixin with you instead." Chapter 1322: Only You (20) "Why? Shixin is your assistant, and I am off to work on a case; wouldn't it be more appropriate to go with our police unit's officers?" An Xiaoning suspected something was off, "When we were in Country V, I posed as Shixin's wife, remember? Don't be so possessive." "I'm not possessive. Am I the type to be petty? I'm mainly concerned about your safety, which is why I feel more at ease with Shixin accompanying you." "..." She noticed his illogical reasoning; it was apparent he didn't want anyone else pretending to be her husband. That's why... "When you're dictating Shixin's actions, have you considered how his girlfriend feels?" An Xiaoning signaled for Zu Dong to wait outside, making him awkwardly comply. "Either you don't go, or Shixin accompanies you; choose." "Jin Qingyan." "I didn't catch that." "Brother." "Calling me 'grandpa' won't help." An Xiaoning drew closer and sat beside him, "You're an adult, thirty-four, not three or four. I'm going on official duty with the officers, not on some frivolous outing. Is this really necessary?" "I just prefer to have someone I trust with you. If I could, I'd go myself, but I have to oversee the company. I trust Shixin to play your husband since you both have prior experience." "..." "Are you even listening?" "Fine, Shixin can come too. It seems you only trust your own people." An Xiaoning glared at him, "Are you satisfied now?" "Yes, quite satisfied." He dialed Shixin's number and hung up swiftly. Shortly after, Shixin arrived. "Master Jin." "Go on a rural retreat with your Madam." Shixin was confused; such arrangements typically included him, so why was it his turn now? "Master Jin, a retreat to the countryside?" "Yes, as a reward for your dedication to the company lately, I've arranged this special treat." "Despite what you say, Master Jin, I sense there's a catch." "Don't mind your Master's prattle. There's no retreat. I'm headed to a village for a case investigation. I was supposed to go with one of our male officers, acting as a married couple... um..." Before she could finish, her mouth was forcefully covered. Shixin grasped the gist and added An Xiaoning's unspoken words, "The officer at the door, right? Master Jin doesn't want you two acting as a married couple, so he's put me in charge. To be exact, Master Jin doesn't like the idea of you pretending with someone he distrusts, even if he knows it's a farce, even if he's sure nothing will happen. He's just cautious, and he doesn't like it." "That's correct!" An Xiaoning pried Jin Qingyan's hand away, "Did you hear that? Shixin's explanation is spot-on. Jin Qingyan, you're beyond help." "I'm beyond help then, so be it. Money can't buy my peace of mind, and I like to have things my way. If you object, you don't have to go." Exasperated, An Xiaoning pointed her index finger at his forehead, "Alright, alright, we'll do it your way. Shixin and I will go together." Due to her sudden change of plans, Zu Dong had no choice but to join Ma Jianguo and the others. She and Shixin quickly packed their luggage and loaded it into the car. The car departed the city at one-thirty in the afternoon and arrived at five-thirty, a four-hour drive. As they neared Widows' Village, the sky turned a somber grey, foretelling rain. An Xiaoning had Shixin park in a lot, and then they, masked, rode a trike with their luggage towards their destination. The trike driver, a man, was taken aback upon learning where they were headed. "Are you two going back to see your parents?" he inquired. "No, we're visiting relatives." "Don't overstay in that place. The village has an eerie reputation; it's mostly women, with scarcely any men left. Usually, no men visit, so you and your husband should make it a brief visit. Look, nightfall is soon." An Xiaoning asked, "Brother, is it truly as eerie as they say? You're making me somewhat scared." "It's as eerie as they say. The village men all fell to misfortune in quick succession; almost all of them perished. Everyone around here knows. Judging by your accents, this is your first visit, right?" "Yes, our first time," An Xiaoning confirmed. "Well, take my advice seriously; you'll be alright." "Thank you, brother." After a seven or eight-minute ride, they reached the outskirts of Widows' Village. The driver, fearing bad luck, refused to go further, "There it is, right up ahead." An Xiaoning paid the fare, and they walked on with Shixin. "Shixin, recall our mission to Country V with Xiao Bai? We pretended to be a couple then, and we'll have to do the same now. Just call me Mu Ning." "Understood, I'm on it. Don't worry, my acting is quite convincing." An Xiaoning gave a small smile, "Indeed, your acting is commendable. It's just that Master Jin sometimes has unnecessary concerns." "He's deeply concerned about you; that's why he acts this way." "There are people ahead by the village entrance; let's pick up the pace and ask around." They quickened their pace, and An Xiaoning greeted them cheerfully, "Good day, could you tell us if there are any houses for rent in the village? My husband and I run a small business in the market town, but the accommodations there are too pricey. This place is conveniently close to the town, so we're looking to rent somewhere nearby. We've inquired in other villages, but to no avail." "There are places to rent," a middle-aged woman replied enthusiastically, standing up, "I have a couple of spare rooms in my annex, but..." The woman's voice waned, tinged with hesitation, "If you're not put off by our village's unsettling reputation, I'd be willing to rent to you." "That's not an issue. My husband plans to sleep at the shop front, so he won't be staying here often. It's mainly for cooking and my stay here." Encouraged by her response, the woman readily agreed, "Then it's decided. I'll rent to you." An Xiaoning's face brightened with a smile, "Wonderful, could you please show us the house? If it's satisfactory, we'll settle in." "Of course, follow me." They followed the middle-aged woman into the village, stopping before an iron gate. She retrieved her keys and unlocked it, "My surname is Wang. With the children at school and my husband working out of town for years without coming back, I've been left alone. It gets lonely without someone to talk to. The annex was my daughter's space; it's quite clean, although she only returns during school breaks, so it's empty most of the year." "Mrs. Wang, how many people live in the village?"
