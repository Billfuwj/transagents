Prologue: The Curtain Falls on a Legend Dark clouds enshrouded the sky above the Dragon Soul Continent, casting the battlefield below into a chaotic wasteland devoid of light. The spiraling staircase, flanked by bloodstained corpses, discarded armor, and weapons, bore silent witness to the desolation, the scent of death and danger hanging heavy in the air. Rhode Alante drew a sharp breath, though the bone-chilling cold and the copper tang of blood were absent; this was, after all, a virtual game. A wry smile crossed his face as he surveyed his comrades. They sat in meditative silence, gathering their strength and repairing their gear. To the untrained eye, it might seem like any other day, but Rhode knew this battle was unlike any they had faced before. "How many remain?" he asked, his voice carrying the weight of command. Muted exchanges passed among the group until a gaunt mage stood. "Ninety-six, Commander. The Void Dragon's lair has proven more perilous than we anticipated. Many have fallen to its cunning traps. Nevertheless, our core group remains intact, with a balance of essential classes." "That's good to hear." Rhode nodded, his stoic face betraying none of the concern he felt as silence reclaimed the group. In any ordinary team, panic would have already set in—they were about to face the most formidable, the most feared boss to date: the Void Dragon, the apex predator of 'Dragon Soul Continent's' third chapter, a being of unparalleled dread. Against such a foe, conventional guilds would marshal tenfold their number before daring an attempt. But Rhode's contingent numbered only ninety-six—a figure shy of a full brigade. And yet, in their eyes was no trace of panic, only unwavering calm, steely confidence, and deep-seated trust borne of countless battles. The man they trusted with their lives stood just ahead, his gaze piercing through the tempest above, his visage a mask of determination. A stark scar bisected his brow, a symbol of battles fought and won. The armor he donned, aglow with powerful enchantments, seemed to fortify his presence like an impregnable bastion. Their faith was not in his imposing appearance—that was but a facade, a character design within the game. That scar bore no true tale of suffering; it was nothing more than a cosmetic option during character creation. What truly commanded respect was the litany of accolades and triumphs that followed in his wake: The first to reach the zenith of his profession. The first to master the complex role of Summoner Swordsman and forge a path to glory. From the moment the 'Descent of Darkness' began to unfurl across the 'Dragon Soul Continent', he had led with a level of skill and strategic acumen that was nothing short of legendary. He had dominated three content seasons, seizing every first kill, every accolade within reach. He was the vanguard, the exemplar—Rhode Alante, the guild leader who set the benchmark for all players in 'Dragon Soul Continent', whose battle strategies were studied and emulated by countless others. He had vanquished the 'Descent of Darkness', weathered the 'Era of Turbulence', and now stood poised on the precipice of 'Void Judgment'. Now, he was ready to draw the curtain on 'Void Judgment', though the dawn of the next era would unfold without his guiding hand. How many years had it been? Rhode's gaze drifted from the distant maelstrom of Thunder Serpents back to the present. Seven years had passed since he had first set foot in the 'Dragon Soul Continent', seeking solace from the anguish of his sister's passing. In those years, he had set himself relentless challenges to escape the torment of memory, finding solace in victory and the glory it brought, each success dulling the persistent ache of loss. But now, an end was in sight. A month prior, another tragedy had struck—his parents, claimed by a hurricane while abroad. The news had left him reeling, but now, resolution had taken root. He would depart from this digital realm and reclaim the life that awaited beyond its borders. This departure was not solely for his parents; Rhode also recognized the need for change. "Guild Leader?" A hesitant voice broke his reverie, drawing his attention to a mage with her hand raised, her eyes wide and filled with concern. "Are you truly leaving us?" "Yes," Rhode confirmed, then composed the tumult of his emotions, meeting the eyes of those who had stood beside him through countless battles. These were the bonds forged over seven arduous years: the camaraderie, the shared trials, the collective victories. Yet now, he was poised to leave them behind. In the game, the merest gesture was enough to convey volumes, but once the virtual reality headset came off, they would be strangers. "I sent out my resume yesterday; I hope it finds its way to a company that will welcome me." "If your resume came across my desk, I'd appoint you to a managerial position on the spot—rest assured!" a knight declared, raising his great sword, his words breaking the gravity of the moment and drawing a collective chuckle from the group. "I appreciate the offer, but I left out such details on purpose. Our guild has made its fair share of enemies—if it fell into the wrong hands, I'd find myself in a difficult position," Rhode replied with a smile, then his expression turned serious once more. "I trust you all remember how we got here." His words hushed the group, every eye now fixed upon him. "The forums, the internet—they're filled with accusations. We're blamed for disrupting the game's balance, for hoarding first kills, for making competition meaningless... And there's truth to that. However..." Rhode's fist clenched, his voice rising with fervor. "But what does that matter to us! We are the paramount guild, the preeminent force! Our strength is our right to claim victory! If other guilds fall short, that's on them. If they were stronger, they might challenge our dominance. Our dominance over first kills wasn't due to rules, status, or flattery—it was earned by our strength, our never-say-die spirit, our unyielding drive. And so we hold our accolades, our triumphs—they are ours by right, plain and simple." Rhode paused, letting his gaze sweep across the faces of his guildmates, before continuing. "I love this guild, and I cherish the seven years we've shared. But all feasts must end, and it's time I sought the life that's calling me beyond these digital horizons. Yet, I will always carry with me the memories of every trial, every joy we've experienced. They will live on, here." He tapped his temple. "Some say the guild will crumble without me. No doubt, our rivals are sharpening their knives, waiting for my departure, eager to dethrone us, to wipe our records clean. But they underestimate us. 'Dragon Soul' isn't just my story. I couldn't have built this guild alone, commanded these forces alone, vanquished these bosses alone. So, when I'm gone, show them the might that is Starlight Guild. Show them why we stand unbeaten at the pinnacle of 'Dragon Soul Continent'!" "Yes!" "We will not falter, Leader!" "The mantle is ours; we'll give those pretenders a response they'll never forget!" "Very well." Rhode surveyed the group, then turned his attention to a figure on the right. "Old Liu." The slender mage stepped forward, coming to stand by Rhode's side. They exchanged a look of mutual respect before Rhode solemnly handed over the guild badge he'd removed from his chest. "The next era belongs to you." He relinquished his hold, his voice unwavering, a testament to the resolve within. "Therefore, I pass the mantle of command for this battle to you." "Understood, Rhode," the mage nodded, then with firm resolve, he added, "And as the guild leader, as the commander, I order you to lead us." "Old Liu?" Rhode's brow furrowed in a mixture of surprise and contemplation. The mage offered a faint smile, clapping Rhode on the shoulder. "You opened this era; it's only fitting you bring it to its rightful close. This is the final chapter of your saga." ".................." At those words, Rhode fell silent. He lifted his gaze to his comrades, now arrayed before him, their readiness palpable, their eyes fixed upon him in unwavering expectation. He gripped his sword with renewed purpose, turning to face the looming platform ahead, where the tempest of lightning raged, casting the world in stark relief. Then, Rhode raised his blade, its point directed at the heart of the storm. His journey had begun in the most unassuming of ways; let it also end with quiet resolve. "Initiate the boss encounter!" The might of the Void Dragon was as formidable as the tales foretold. Rhode had clashed with the most formidable bosses within 'Dragon Soul Continent', including those storied beings beyond official chronicles, but none presented the challenge that the Void Dragon now posed. Its attack patterns were intricate, inscrutable, its damage far exceeding that of any standard adversary. Speed, reflexes, defense—all were of a caliber beyond compare. Indeed, this was an adversary beyond conquest. Rhode wielded his longsword with fierce determination, his teeth gritted against the enormity of the beast before him. The battle had reached its climax, and he alone remained to confront the colossus. His health dwindled to a mere sliver, the glaring red warnings signaling that the end was near. Yet, had the Void Dragon not also been pushed to its breaking point? Gazing into the dragon's baleful, crimson eyes, Rhode experienced an uncanny sense of kinship. He could almost sense the Void Dragon's outrage—as the most indomitable boss within the game, never before bested, now teetering on the brink of defeat. It must find the prospect intolerable. If this was to be its end, then let them end it together. With that, Rhode lifted his left hand. With a clarion call, he summoned the Blazing Phoenix, and flames erupted along his blade, coalescing into the form of the fiery avian that soared skyward. The Phoenix charged at the Void Dragon, which, in response, unleashed a roar and lashed out with its claw in a defiant strike. "!!!" A tremor coursed through Rhode's frame as an opposing force met his own. The Blazing Phoenix was snuffed out in a wail of despair, yet in its final moment, it forced the Void Dragon's claw to falter, its attack diverted. An opening was revealed. Rhode bit back the pain, the world around him bathed in an ever-deepening crimson, signaling injuries of a critical nature. Yet, in this moment, such concerns were cast aside—it was the moment of truth, victory or annihilation. He thrust his longsword with all the strength his fading vitality could muster. The Void Dragon, having weathered the fiery onslaught, bellowed in defiance and struck once more with its claw. But as its talons descended, Rhode let go of his sword. Thunderstrike was unleashed. The blade became a beacon of light, slicing through the storm, finding the narrow gap between the dragon's claws and tearing through its armored hide. "———!!!" The dragon's roar shattered the heavens, its claw descending upon Rhode with the weight of finality. The world was engulfed in red, blurring into oblivion. Yet, on the periphery, the system's prompt emerged, its message clear and unyielding. The end had come. As the message etched itself into his vision, a contented smile graced Rhode's lips. In that instant, a brilliant column of light descended from above, enveloping the platform in its radiance. The pure light dispelled the darkness, scattering the oppressive clouds. And there, as others hastened from the graveyard toward the platform, they halted in their tracks, the world channel that had buzzed with news of the Starlight Guild's latest victory falling silent. A solitary message lingered, a system announcement for all to witness. The legend of Rhode Alante, who had reigned over three eras of Dragon Soul Continent, had reached its epic conclusion. Chapter One: A New Journey Gusts of wind carved through the canyon, stirring the grassland into undulating waves. Grazing bison lifted their heads, their attention drawn skyward by a marvel of human ingenuity: a wooden merchant ship, hovering in midair, its sails billowing as the Wind Tide propelled it forward with deliberate grace. 'The Wind Tide never fails to inspire awe, no matter how often one beholds it,' remarked a middle-aged man clad in leather armor, standing at the deck's edge, his gaze sweeping over the vast prairie below. 'It's more than a spectacle—it represents a golden opportunity for traders like us.' Next to him stood a portly merchant with an unusual tuft of curly hair, robed in a manner befitting his profession. His small eyes narrowed, surveying the landscape as though he could gauge its value in coin. 'Without this phenomenon, our goods would never reach the central regions so swiftly.' 'Indeed, I faced opposition when I initially planned to explore this market. But now, it's clear my decision was wise.' The merchant's tone shifted as he added, 'However, pardon my frankness, by steering clear of the major trade routes and opting for this shortcut, we're also upping the ante. There have been troubling reports from the other side. And, as the captain mentioned, Wind Serpents have been sighted nearby. Should misfortune strike...' His voice trailed off as he glanced at the mountain range, their peaks acting as sentinels, obscuring what lay beyond. A tinge of darkness marred the distant sky—a realm forbidden to them. 'Do not fret,' the merchant reassured, 'fortune favors the brave, and I've invested heavily in your expertise. A few serpents are nothing to worry over.' He patted the man's shoulder, asking, 'How is the young man we rescued faring?' 'He's alive, if that's what concerns you. Lijie Noelle has seen to his wounds. He's unconscious at the moment but largely out of danger.' The merchant nodded, content, although soon after, his forehead furrowed with thought. 'The nature of his injuries is baffling. They resemble the work of a large reptile—yet do such beasts roam the northern expanses of Pafield?' 'I cannot say, sir. But the creature that inflicted such wounds must be formidable. Let us hope our paths do not cross.' The man cast a cautious glance toward the cabin entrance before allowing his gaze to return to the horizon. Rhode Alante's eyes flickered open. What had occurred? His mind was foggy as he stared at the ceiling. He recalled leading his team on the Ruins Plateau, locked in combat with the formidable Void Dragon—one of the most fearsome bosses in the Dragon Soul Continent—and achieving the first kill. He remembered the system notification, the dragon's final assault... and then, blackness. Wasn't he supposed to resurrect at the graveyard and log off according to plan? Yet, when the Void Dragon's claws brought death, the world went dark, severed from reality, and consciousness eluded him. Could there have been a glitch in the game? Struggling to orient himself, Rhode caught sight of the blue sky and white clouds through the window. Where was he? What was this place? What had transpired? Could this still be a dream, or was he somehow entrapped within the game? This certainly wasn't his cramped rental apartment; he was sure of that much. Confusion swelled within him. Attempting to sit up, he was met with excruciating pain that lanced through his chest, ceasing his movements. It was then that he noticed his left shoulder and chest, ensconced in bandages. Although unsure of the events that led to this state, the blood seeping through suggested his injuries were far from minor. This was no game—of that, Rhode was certain. Dragon Soul Continent, the first immersive online game, was founded on cutting-edge technology, yet pain was intentionally omitted from its design. To distinguish reality from the virtual and to lower the entry barrier for players, sensations of pain were replaced with indicators such as reduced movement speed and a red haze over the player's vision to signal danger. The controversy over such sensory simulations had been intense when holographic technology first surfaced. The developers of Dragon Soul Continent could not have been oblivious to it. Rhode glanced at his right hand—not the muscular, savage physique he had crafted in-game, but a slender, frail arm, its pallor revealing a lack of sunlight. This was undoubtedly his real body. How had he come to be injured? And this place bore no resemblance to a hospital. His surroundings were that of a cabin, spare in furnishing and devoid of modern amenities—a wooden table, two chairs, and a cupboard affixed to the wall constituted the room's entirety. It felt oddly familiar, as though he had seen this setting before. While Rhode was absorbing his surroundings, the door swung open, and a blonde-haired young woman in a white robe stepped inside. She seemed surprised to see Rhode propped up. 'You're awake? How marvelous!' she exclaimed. She spoke neither Chinese nor English, yet Rhode understood her effortlessly. This language was Nim, one of the official languages of Dragon Soul Continent. 'How do you feel? Are you well?' she inquired, her voice laden with concern as she checked his bandages. 'Your injuries were severe. I feared you might not pull through...' Rhode, puzzled, glanced at the mirror on the wall, his reflection staring back. His face was familiar, yet it felt out of place here. 'Have you forgotten?' the young woman asked, her azure eyes mirroring her bewilderment. 'Two days ago, you were discovered in the Pafield Highlands, grievously wounded. If not for the Silver Libra merchant ship passing by, your situation would have been dire. The injuries to your left side were significant—it was a narrow escape.' The mention of his 'left side' sparked a memory—hadn't his character been struck there by the Void Dragon's final blow? But now, it was he who bore the injury. The enigma of his current predicament was confounding, yet Rhode's instincts for survival, refined through years as a top player and guild leader, prevailed. From the young woman, he gleaned that he had been found injured on the plains of Pafield and rescued by the Silver Libra skyship. Despite a grim initial outlook, his recuperation was on the right track. 'I am Lijie Noelle, a Spirit Master of the Star Moon Mercenary Corps. You can call me Lijie,' she introduced herself cheerfully. 'I'm Rhode Alante,' he replied after a brief pause, using the name and identity he knew from the game. 'An adventurer hailing from the Eastern Highlands.' Lijie accepted his explanation without question; it was not uncommon for adventurers on the continent to explore alone, making Rhode's claimed identity plausible. 'What were you battling? What inflicted such severe wounds upon you? This plain is not known for dangerous creatures.' Rhode offered a wry smile in response to her questions. Could he truly tell her that he had been engaged in combat with the Void Dragon, one of the genesis creators of this realm? 'I was assaulted in the darkness of night and could not discern my attackers. They were legion, swift. Perhaps they emerged from 'that place',' he said ambiguously. Lijie nodded, indicating her understanding, though much remained unsaid. After ensuring his wounds were tended to, she rose to her feet. 'After two days without nourishment, you must be ravenous. Please await here; I will fetch you something to eat,' she said, heading toward the door. 'Oh, and I must inform the Leader of your awakening. He is likely to come by to see you shortly.' With a polite nod, she exited the room, leaving Rhode alone with his thoughts and the deepening enigma that surrounded him. Chapter Two: The Holy Sword Deck *Sigh...* Rhode finally exhaled a long sigh and laid back down. After his conversation with the young girl, Rhode had his suspicions confirmed: this was indeed the world of the Dragon Soul Continent. Furthermore, it was not the era he had previously known but a much more ancient time—the Twilight Years, which in the game's timeline, corresponded to the nascent public testing phase of the Dragon Soul Continent game. How did I come to be here? Rhode sighed and decided to put aside these perplexing and mysterious thoughts. The fact was that he had arrived here, and that was the reality he had to accept. Now, what should be his next move? First, Rhode resolved to figure out what he was currently capable of doing. With just a thought, a familiar system prompt appeared before his eyes, displaying his current status and attributes: Rhode Level 1 Race: Half-blood (??) Talent: Unsealed Racial Bonus: Unsealed Racial Traits: Unsealed++ Profession: Summoner Swordsman (Heroic Profession) Professional Skills: Spirit Summoning Art (Proficiency Rank E) Owned Swordsmanship: Moonshadow Swordsmanship (Proficiency Rank E) (Usable Skill—Shattered Blade) Secondary Profession: Alchemist (Arcane Crafting Expertise) Owned Skills: Focused Shaping (Proficiency Rank E) This character sheet seemed both normal and unusual at the same time. Rhode almost let out a cry of surprise at the term 'Half-blood'. On the Dragon Soul Continent, 'half-blood' didn't imply human racial intermarriage but referred to the offspring of unions between humans and other races. Rhode knew he was human, and even as a player, he had not chosen any race other than human. So why did his character sheet now describe him as a 'half-blood'? The question marks indicated a bloodline that hadn't fully awakened, thus sealing the racial bonuses and traits. This meant Rhode had to uncover the secrets of his own bloodline and awaken the dormant powers within to access these bonuses and traits. This was a challenge because racial bonuses are typically provided at character creation. For instance, humans receive bonuses like reduced skill learning time, with additional benefits such as poison resistance or reputation enhancements based on their subtype. Now, these bonuses and traits were tantalizingly out of reach for Rhode. However, not all hope was lost. In the sections for swordsmanship and alchemy, Rhode noticed that in addition to his Level 1 skills, the numerous swordsmanship and alchemy skills he had learned as a player remained listed, albeit dimmed. This indicated his current abilities and level were insufficient to use them. Rhode wasn't overly concerned; it was the origin of the skills, not the proficiency levels, that mattered to him. Many sword techniques were notoriously difficult to master, requiring not just higher levels or specific attributes, but also the completion of challenging quests, reputation enhancements, or even the chance discovery of hidden relics. Acquiring such skills required significant investments of money, time, and sometimes, a stroke of luck. In the game, Rhode had fully perfected his character only in the last year of his journey on the Dragon Soul Continent, which had given him the confidence to challenge the Void Dragon. Unfortunately, while the swordsmanship issue had been addressed, Rhode soon realized that more than just his experience and proficiency levels had reset to zero. The essence of a Summoner Swordsman—the summoned spirits—had also vanished. In the game world of Dragon Soul Continent, the Summoner Swordsman was a profession steeped in controversy. Initially touted as an official profession exclusive to players, it garnered widespread attention. However, it was later criticized for its blend of magic and martial arts, the necessity of spirit summons for attacks, and the disproportionate consumption of experience points for leveling, earning it a reputation as one of the most vexing professions. At first glance, a Summoner Swordsman's Spirit Summoning Art seemed no different from a mage's summoning. However, they were fundamentally distinct. Mages summoned creatures from subspace dimensions by tearing through the fabric of reality, binding them with magical force to serve. Summoner Swordsmen, on the other hand, lacked the power to rend planar space. Their summons originated from the present world, enabled by the unique 'Spirit Summoning Art' of the Summoner Swordsman, which could awaken the souls of ancient, mystical relics imbued with historical and spiritual essence. These souls were then resealed through contracts for use. The concept was intriguing, but the reality was rife with complications. Many players had been lured by the skill and chose the Summoner Swordsman, hoping to procure ancient relics from ruins or merchants, awaken the spirits of the weapons, and effortlessly acquire a divine weapon. The dream was enchanting, but reality was unforgiving. Not to mention that awakening the dormant souls of ancient weapons required a high-level Spirit Summoning Art, and since they had lost their physical form, their power was significantly diminished. Consider the semi-divine weapon 'Dragon King's Fury' that Rhode had wielded in the game. He could only extract its soul after reaching the highest levels. Yet, even then, the strength of the weapon was not superior to that of a similar tier crafted by a master blacksmith. It had taken Rhode another two years of perilous adventures across the Dragon Soul Continent to reactivate the fragmented souls of the weapon and restore it to its former state. The sheer danger of the quest was enough to deter many from attempting such feats. Furthermore, spirit weapons required soul power to maintain, and the summoned spirits required soul power for sustenance. Given that Summoner Swordsmen's innate soul power was significantly less than that of mages, many preferred to wield ordinary weapons over aesthetically pleasing but impractical spirit weapons. Beyond this, there were three additional methods for a Summoner Swordsman to obtain spirits. One could awaken the soul core that formed after the death of a magical creature, turning it into a summoned spirit. However, the outcome could be influenced by the holder's attributes, the environment, and other factors. For instance, if a Summoner Swordsman acquired a soul core from a Blazing Phoenix but awakened it in an icy environment or while wearing dark-attribute gear, the resulting creature could be entirely unpredictable. If it turned out to be a nine-headed serpent with dark power, that would be manageable. However, if it was a common demon weakened by conflicting attributes, then all hope was lost. Another method to acquire summoned spirits involved defeating non-human entities. Upon meeting specific conditions, one could forge contracts with these beings, sealing them as personal summoned spirits. This approach was popular among Summoner Swordsmen but had the drawback of the summoned being's strong autonomy. In the game, this autonomy could lead to the being acting against their summoner's commands based on their judgment. Understandably, such unpredictability was unwelcome. No one wanted an ally that caused more trouble than assistance. The final technique, unlocked after reaching level 10, was the Attribute Adjustment Talent. By fusing several summoned spirits, one could create a higher-order spirit. This method offered some control over the unpredictability of summoned spirits. If one understood the characteristics, races, and attributes of the spirits, they could predict what the fusion would result in. Yet, this method had its own vexing flaw—the uncertain level of the new spirit. It was possible to merge two high-level summoned spirits only to create a level 1 newcomer, or conversely, a spirit of such a high level that it surpassed the summoner's own, making it unusable. If it were the latter, it was simply a matter of leveling up. But if it were the former, account deletion might be the only recourse. The experience of summoned spirits was deducted from the holder's own pool, explaining why Summoner Swordsmen leveled up slower than other professions. They had to divide their experience between themselves and their summoned spirits, a difficult balance to master. Allocating experience to summoned spirits could ensure their advancement in levels and evolution upon reaching certain stages. However, as previously mentioned, the evolution could be influenced by the factors present at the time, resulting in evolved spirits that may not match the summoner's intentions. These 'vexing' traits led to Summoner Swordsmen being 'unanimously' crowned as the 'Top Vexing Profession' on the official forums of the Dragon Soul Continent. The community vividly described those who chose Summoner Swordsmen: they were either novices misled by introductions and CG promotions, casual players without aspirations, gamblers eager to take a chance, or... Rhode. From a simple name to a symbol of a gaming phenomenon, Rhode's game ID reflected the thoughts of players when he achieved unparalleled success with the Summoner Swordsman, a profession recognized worldwide for its challenges. He attained numerous server-firsts and even conquered three new eras. Typically, players disliked randomness as it gave them a sense of losing control. But Rhode thrived on it. The allure of the unknown offered a challenge, which is precisely why he had chosen the Summoner Swordsman profession. Throughout his extensive gaming career, he had encountered almost every 'vexing' aspect of Summoner Swordsmen, yet he remained undaunted, for conquering such adversities brought him immense satisfaction. But now, after seven years of nurturing an array of top-tier summoned spirits, they had all been erased. The mysterious summoning circle on the back of his right hand remained, but within it, Rhode could no longer sense any spirits. It was not a surprising realization. After all, this body was not the same as his in-game avatar, and it was unreasonable to expect too much. But... With this thought, a spark of curiosity ignited within Rhode. He reached into his chest pocket, and his fingers soon brushed against a card. It was a card with a pristine white background, bearing the image of a sword entwined with thorns, its surface unblemished and resplendent. Intricate inscriptions adorned the blade, while the crossguard featured a pair of exquisitely converging wings that delighted the eye. Distinct markings graced each corner of the card; in the upper right, a white semicircle, and in the upper left, a small 'X'. In the lower corners lay two modest numbers—'3'. Flipping the card over, mysterious and elegant script began to emerge against the backdrop. [Eternal Holy Sword No.10: Star Scar, Attribute-less, Fusion Compatible—Even the dust of history cannot obscure its dazzling brilliance.] Still here? Holding the card, Rhode experienced a surge of surprise. This was the emblem of a Summoner Swordsman, a summoning card. And this one was particularly familiar—it was the rare card memento presented by the game's officials during an event. In recognition of his guild's consecutive championship victories across two quarters, the game company had crafted this unique card to honor the formidable player. Though similar collectible cards were abundant, Rhode had never been one to waste money on items that were merely ornamental and served no actual purpose. Therefore, he only kept this award card, regarding it as a talisman since it hardly took up any space at all. Originally, it was nothing more than an ordinary commemorative card, unique only by being the sole one of its kind in the world. But now, Rhode watched as it emitted a faint glow, shimmering in his hand. Should I give it a try? Rhode hesitated for only a second before tightly gripping the card. The arcane circle on the back of his right hand suddenly came to life, and lines of deep azure magic spread outward, reaching every fingertip. The white card burst into dazzling light and then disintegrated into sparkling motes, vanishing into thin air. At that moment, a system prompt appeared before Rhode. [You have obtained 1/10 of the Eternal Deck, Eternal Holy Sword No.10—Star Scar] *Sigh...* Staring at the system prompt, Rhode exhaled, a tumult of emotions roiling within him as he grappled with the surreal reality he faced. Is this a game? Or is it reality? If this is reality, then what path should I take? *Knock, knock.* As these thoughts swirled in his mind, a knock sounded at the door. Rhode looked up to see a middle-aged man entering. The man was dressed in the leather armor typical of adventurers, his fiery red hair casually swept back. Spotting Rhode, the man offered a modest smile. "Hello, sir. I am Carter, the leader of the Star Moon Mercenary Corps." Chapter 3: Ambushed 'Hello, Mr. Carter,' Rhode raised his head, greeting the man before him with a polite nod and a smile of appreciation. 'Thank you for your assistance.' 'Don't mention it. It was nothing.' The man's robust build and towering presence, set against the backdrop of untamed, crimson locks, marked his heritage from the sandy expanses of the northwest, the land of the Laikate People. Two swords, one distinctly longer than the other, hung silently by his side. His sharp, well-defined features conveyed a sense of determination and scrutiny, clear indicators of a man far from ordinary. While Rhode observed him, Carter was also quietly sizing up the man in his presence. At first glance, one might easily mistake Rhode for some effete, indolent noble's progeny. His lithe build, pallid complexion, and almost feminine visage, coupled with his attire, hardly painted the picture of a seasoned adventurer. Instead, he looked more like a thrill-seeking scion, out for a lark rather than braving the unknown. However, Carter intuited that there was more to this young man, especially given the arcane sigil etched upon his right hand. Lijie, with her attunement as a Spirit Master, could sense the magic emanating from it, suggesting its authenticity. Carter, with his years of experience, rarely came across someone who wore such a mark so openly. This hinted at an unusual and complex identity. From their brief conversation, Carter noted Rhode's demeanor—calm and measured, without a hint of arrogance or subservience. Even after awakening from unconsciousness just minutes ago, he maintained a remarkable level of composure, far exceeding the often haughty ignorance of the bluebloods. 'I understand you're from the Eastern Highlands?' 'Yes, that's correct.' Rhode responded with a slight nod. 'So, where are you headed?' 'Nowhere in particular. I'm just traveling.' Rhode's shoulders lifted in a nonchalant shrug. 'I'm an adventurer. To roam freely and explore is my way of life. Rest assured, I won't cause any trouble for you and your company.' 'Good to hear.' With Rhode being so cooperative, there was little more for Carter to question. They were in the midst of a mission and did not welcome distractions. After a few more exchanges and assurances that Rhode would take care of his injuries, Carter excused himself. As the leader of a mercenary band, he had many responsibilities and could not afford to stay any longer than necessary. For Rhode, the following hours were uneventful, though the simple fare of coarse bread and dried meat Lijie provided did catch his interest. The items he had consumed countless times within the game, designed only to replenish health and mana, offered no real flavor or sustenance. Now, he had the opportunity to truly experience the taste described in the game's flavor text, a novelty for sure. But, in reality, the actual taste fell short of the tantalizing descriptions he remembered. 'How are you feeling? Is the wound still painful?' Lijie, with her golden hair and an air of concern, sat close to Rhode, her attention fixed on him. Her gaze, softened by a touch of sorrow, lingered on his shoulder, reflecting a quiet empathy. 'I feel much better now.' Rhode replied while flexing his hand. The sharp pain in his sternum had subsided, a testament to his character's rapid health regeneration. 'That's good to hear.' Relief lightened Lijie's previously anxious expression as she listened to Rhode. 'Still, you should rest more. When we reach Deepstone City, we'll have better facilities. Perhaps your wounds will heal quicker there.' Her tone was earnest, showing genuine concern for someone she had only just met. 'Thank you.' 'You're welcome. It's my duty to help.' Lijie then stood up, her ponytail bouncing with her movements, giving her a lively and spirited aura. 'Well then...' Her words were interrupted by a sudden lurch of the ship, sending a tremor through the cabin. The jolt nearly caused her to fall onto the bed, but she managed to stabilize herself using the bedpost just in time. The two exchanged a look, each recognizing the same uncertainty in the other's eyes. Though skyships sailed on the powerful winds of the Wind Tide and the sky held no perilous reefs or whirlpools, dangers still lurked. The current situation was clearly abnormal. 'I'll go check it out. You stay here and rest easy, alright?' Lijie whispered, then quickly turned and left the room, closing the door behind her. Watching her departure, Rhode offered a faint, wry smile. Was it truly necessary for her to speak to him as if he were a child? But then, the silhouette of a creature passing by the window caught his attention, and his expression turned serious. He shifted his gaze slightly, peering intently through the window. Moments later, more green shapes zipped past, followed by a sequence of low, sinister hisses. 'Sssss—' The sound sent a chill through Rhode. They were in grave danger! On the deck, chaos had erupted. 'I never imagined we'd run into these damned creatures.' The red-haired mercenary captain, with swords in hand, stood steadfast at the forefront, his gaze locked on the green figures circling the skyship. They looked like serpents with bat wings, each about a meter long. Despite their fragile appearance, the sharp fangs visible within their open jaws suggested a deadly nature. Wind Serpents, a notorious airborne predator known for their territorial aggression in the Dragon Soul Continent game. 'It seems we've stumbled into Wind Serpent territory.' The portly merchant, huddled next to the mercenary captain, was pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from his brow with a kerchief. 'Blast it, that treacherous Bick. I should've known it was a setup when he offered such a route for so little coin! This is murder, plain and simple! When I get back, he'll pay dearly for this!' 'Let's focus on getting out of this mess first!' Carter interjected, cutting off the merchant's frenzied tirade. Surrounded by hundreds of Wind Serpents, they were in a dire predicament. At first, he had ordered his men to use crossbow bolts to deter the creatures, hoping to drive them off. But the Wind Serpents' reckless abandon had taken them by surprise. Far from retreating, their comrades' deaths only seemed to embolden them. Now, they had seized the perimeter of the deck, ready to strike from all sides. The mercenaries had discarded their ranged weapons for blades, engaging the serpents in dire close-quarters combat. 'Take cover inside, and tell the Captain we need to leave immediately!' Carter shoved the merchant towards the safety of the Captain's Quarters, then stepped forward, his swords flashing like rays of sunlight breaking through storm clouds as they sliced through an attacking Wind Serpent. The creature fell to the deck with a thud, but another quickly took its place. They were outnumbered and outmatched. Carter frowned, concern etched on his face as he surveyed the deck. He had taken only a handful of men on this mission, and they were all that remained. The merchant ship's guards, though present, lacked combat experience, which was evident. A third had fallen in the initial assault, and only half remained, their panicked actions signaling they couldn't hold out much longer. Facing the menacing serpents, Carter's demeanor became grave. He had faced Wind Serpents before but never in such staggering numbers. The unprecedented scale of this encounter sent a surge of anxiety through him. He stepped forward, his body moving with practiced grace as he spun, his swords tracing deadly arcs through the air and striking a Wind Serpent mid-flight. The creature plummeted to the deck, its lifeblood spilling out, and after a few defiant hisses, it lay motionless. Carter looked up, scanning the tumultuous scene, when his heart skipped a beat. 'Lijie! Watch out!' The girl was slow to react. She had just finished healing a mercenary's poison wound and was still reeling from the exertion. Though she had been on deck for only a short time, the injured were numerous, and as the only one with healing powers, Lijie had selflessly taken on the responsibility. At Carter's warning, she turned around, only to be met with the gaping maw of a Wind Serpent, its fangs poised to strike. In that moment, time seemed to stand still for Lijie. She stared into the face of danger, her mind blank, unable to move or react. She could see every horrific detail—the fangs' lethal glint, the maw's grotesque pink flesh, even the fetid stench that assaulted her senses. Just as fear overwhelmed her, a hand reached out from behind, gripping her collar and pulling her back just in time to avoid the serpent's deadly bite. Chapter Four: The Heat of Battle The Wind Serpent snapped at empty air, almost securing its prey if not for Mr. Rhode's timely intervention from behind. 'Mr. Rhode?' Lijie, who had narrowly escaped death, looked up to find Mr. Rhode standing protectively behind her, her body limp and powerless from the shock. She tried to stand but collapsed back to the ground as her knees gave way. 'Lijie!' Carter sighed in relief at her narrow escape but quickly tensed as the Wind Serpent, having missed, prepared to strike again. Cursing, he held his twin swords and sprinted toward them, though it seemed he would be too late. As the Wind Serpent reared again, Lijie, unsure of what to do, held her breath. As a Spirit Master, reliant on her spiritual arts, she carried no weapon. What was she to do? 'Leave it to me.' Amidst her panic, Mr. Rhode's calm voice reached Lijie's ears. He stepped forward, shielding her with his presence. Would he really face the Wind Serpent unarmed? While Lijie was still trying to grasp the situation, she noticed Mr. Rhode raising his right hand. An intricate, luminous magic circle formed on the back of his hand, radiating lines that extended to each fingertip. From his palm's center, a translucent, card-like object emerged. Mr. Rhode gripped it, and a blinding white light erupted. The seal of unseen magic was lifted, releasing a tangible shockwave that buffeted the Wind Serpent, struggling to maintain its balance. Before it could strike again, a burst of radiance cleaved through the air, striking the serpent and sending it tumbling away. Mr. Rhode exhaled softly as the glow faded, revealing an immaculate white longsword, the Stardust Sword, materialized in his hand. He swung the Stardust Sword, and light motes drifted down from the blade, creating an enchanting scene. He was oblivious to the others, who were rendered speechless by the sight. Lijie sat on the ground, stunned, while Carter slowed his approach, his eyes filled with disbelief and awe. Though he had surmised that Mr. Rhode was no ordinary man, he had not imagined the extent of his 'uncommonness.' Even as she sat immobilized, Lijie couldn't help but admire the sword's pristine blade, ancient patterns softly glowed, and light dust around it was visibly magical. The wings on the hilt were so finely detailed that each feather was discernible. While women often showed little interest in weapons, this sword transcended its function, nearing artistry. Lijie admired it purely, but Carter's gaze held a different weight. As a seasoned adventurer, Carter had never encountered such a phenomenon. He had seen mages summon with crystals, chanting cryptic incantations to summon grotesque creatures—a common sight. But a summoned weapon? This was a spectacle he had never witnessed. While the true nature of the object in Mr. Rhode's hand was a mystery, Carter knew that such magical weapons were not common. Only those of noble standing or special heritage were entitled to wield such arms. Observing the lifelike wings on the sword's hilt, Carter furrowed his brow. He was well aware that angels on this continent were revered, often pivotal figures in powerful organizations or factions. Like the recently ascended ruler of the Moon Kingdom, Leticia Pafield Mila Franrika—an angel. Even though Mr. Rhode's true identity was still a mystery, the sword alone linked him to that distinguished lineage. This realization passed through Carter's mind as he reached the pair. 'Are you alright?' 'I—I'm okay.' Lijie's face was pale, not from cowardice but from the ordeal of nearly being claimed by death—a sensation unfamiliar to the uninitiated. After confirming Lijie's safety, Carter's attention shifted to Mr. Rhode. 'Mr. Rhode, are you unharmed?' Mr. Rhode shook his head, indicating he was fine. Despite the throbbing in his left side, it had little impact on his combat readiness. Instead of his well-being, his focus was on the next move. 'What's your plan?' The number of Wind Serpents was growing. The skyship's full speed was failing to shake off the serpents' relentless chase. Their situation was worsening. 'We're trying to push beyond their territory. Until then, we have no choice but to endure.' On the ground, Carter might have had other strategies, but in the sky, this was all he could propose. Yet as he spoke, Mr. Rhode's expression conveyed doubt. 'We won't make it in time, Mr. Carter.' 'Oh?' 'The Wind Serpents hold the advantage on these plains. Even at full speed, we can't escape before the skyship falls apart.' 'Really?' Carter was quick-witted. Unfamiliar with the terrain, he had made his decision. Grasping the gravity of Mr. Rhode's words, he understood the urgency of their situation. 'So, what should we do?' 'We descend immediately.' Without hesitation, Mr. Rhode responded, pointing to a nearby location. 'Then we head there.' Carter looked where Mr. Rhode pointed, his eyes widening at the realization. 'You're suggesting we plunge into the Twilight Forest?' 'To escape the Wind Serpents' harassment, it's our only option. Besides...' Mr. Rhode glanced around. 'Our time is running short.' The situation indeed grew dire. The Wind Serpents' threat was not limited to their fangs—their venom was equally lethal. Agile and slender, they switched targets swiftly if a frontal assault failed. Several had already shattered the glass and infiltrated the cabin; there seemed no stopping them. The confined space of the cabin hindered the serpents, yet their danger persisted. Thus, the cabin was in disarray, and the plumes of smoke wafting from the breaches signaled the dire state of affairs. Carter no longer hesitated, turning to leave at once. Mr. Rhode, with Star Scar in hand, defended the gap. 'Hiss!' A Wind Serpent swooped from the right, its maw wide open in attack. As it dove, Mr. Rhode dodged deftly to the left, his white sword flicking upward to strike the serpent's chin, repelling the venom sprayed in haste. He spun around, his silver-white blade drawing a luminous arc in the air, finding its mark in another serpent attempting a stealth attack from behind. With its balance lost and a swift follow-up strike, Mr. Rhode ended its life. The Wind Serpents' offensive did not cease. The scent of carnage drove them into a frenzy. As Mr. Rhode drew his sword from the now lifeless serpent, a multitude descended upon him. They resembled a green cloud, a monstrous maw, ready to devour its prey in a single gulp. 'Mr. Rhode!' Lijie, having just rid another mercenary of poison, turned to witness the scene, her cry escaping involuntarily. Jets of corrosive venom shot forth, aiming a deluge at Mr. Rhode. Should it make contact, it would maim, if not kill. But at that critical moment, Mr. Rhode swiftly retreated. The venom, reeking of decay, missed him by a hair's breadth, eating away at the deck as it landed. Almost at the same time, the Wind Serpent horde closed in on Mr. Rhode, poised to tear apart the troublesome human before them. To ordinary foes, such a sight would likely induce paralysis. But Mr. Rhode remained composed, confronting the swarm intent on rending him to pieces. His only action was to lift his sword and thrust forward. Shattered Blade technique, activate. The white blade's energy erupted amidst the serpents, splitting and multiplying. Blades flew, piercing through serpent after serpent, a powerful gust pulling those fortunate enough to escape, mercilessly shredding their forms. In an instant, the green cloud was dispersed by the blinding light, leaving only remnants of flesh. Every onlooker held their breath in that fleeting moment of awe. Chapter Five: Critical Emergency The relentless assault of the Wind Serpent Swarm momentarily subsided, and an eerie silence fell upon the deck, a stark contrast to the previous cacophony of battle cries and screams. All eyes were transfixed on the young swordsman, their faces a tapestry of disbelief and silence. Just moments prior, they had all but resigned themselves to his inevitable demise, for none had ever seen someone withstand such an aggressive onslaught of numerous Wind Serpents. Perhaps a high-level warrior encased in full armor could withstand such an attack. Yet here stood a youth, his sole defense the white sword he brandished—his body unadorned with armor. And yet, he stood triumphant. Both mercenaries and comrades, including Lijie and Carter, were rendered speechless, their minds abuzz with questions. Who could this mysterious warrior be? The Wind Serpents, perhaps daunted by Rhode's valor, had withdrawn, leaving a silence so profound that only the wind's lament could be discerned. While the mercenaries were astounded by Rhode's feat, he paid little mind to their accolades. His attention was solely on the corpses at his feet and the close call he had just survived. Wind Serpents, while not the most formidable monsters, found their strength in numbers. Rhode, a Summoner Swordsman, excelled in individual combat. Large-scale battles, however, were not where he shined. It was the '+3 initial' attribute of his 'Star Scar' blade that tipped the scales, elevating his attributes by three points and reducing a monster's threat level from red to green—a factor that made the Wind Serpent Swarm's defeat less remarkable for Rhode. Yet, when taking into account his human attributes, not even the 'Star Scar' should have granted such a sweeping triumph. Rhode had braced himself for the likelihood of merely leaving the Wind Serpents grievously wounded, ready to deliver the coup de grâce. However, to his bewilderment, his Shattered Blade had far exceeded his expectations, felling the Wind Serpents in a single blow. Could it be that his attributes did not align with those of a human? Compelled by this thought, Rhode tried to access his attribute panel, but to his frustration, his attributes remained veiled until his race could be ascertained. Nonetheless, the battle had yielded him an unexpected windfall of 1900 experience points. These reflections occupied but a brief moment for Rhode. To the bystanders, he seemed to contemplate the fallen only momentarily before raising his gaze once more. It was at this juncture that Rhode became cognizant of the foreboding quiet. It wasn't the astonishment of his allies that stilled the deck, but the imminent threat of a far more lethal nature. What had become of the Wind Serpent Swarm? A flicker of concern crossed Rhode's mind. Then, as if connecting the dots, he spun around and bellowed a warning. 'Everyone, brace yourselves...!' Without warning, the Skyship lurched violently. The sudden upheaval hurled the crew to the timeworn deck planks, and two unfortunate souls, unable to steady themselves, fell into the abyss below. Concurrently, a sharp crack echoed from the foredeck, and from the splintered timbers, an immense serpent's head thrust forth. 'To arms! It's the Wind Serpent Sovereign!' Carter's voice finally broke through the chaos, his directive clear as he drew his twin swords and raced toward the gargantuan Wind Serpent. The mercenaries, though wounded, rose quickly. Clenching their teeth against their injuries, they rallied behind their Leader, preparing to engage the colossal adversary. But Rhode was faster. He crouched, witnessing a stream of system prompts before his eyes. [Experience Points 1900/200, Level Up, gain 1 Skill Point, Level 2] [Experience Points 1700/400, Level Up, gain 2 Skill Points, Level 3] [Experience Points 1300/600, gain 3 Skill Points, Level 4] [Experience Points 800/1000, gain 4 Skill Points, Level 5] [Use 1 Skill Point to raise Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 1/3, Proficiency E] [Use 1 Skill Point to raise Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 2/3, Proficiency E] [Use 1 Skill Point to raise Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 3/3, Proficiency E] [Use 1 Skill Point to raise Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 1/4, Proficiency D—Unlocked Shadow Flash] Activation underway. Rhode surged upwards. To the onlookers, he was a fleeting shadow, a spectral figure that cleaved through the air directly toward the Wind Serpent Sovereign, taking the colossal beast by surprise. As Rhode ascended to its eye level, the beast's bewildered gaze was evident—it had never before seen prey leap willingly into its clutches. Rhode readied his sword, the radiance of Stardust coalescing on the blade as if drawn by an unseen magnetism. He targeted the Wind Serpent Sovereign's massive eyes and thrust downward with lethal precision. 'Shattered Blade!' The Wind Serpent Sovereign, confronted with the barrage of gleaming sword light, instinctively tried to evade. Rhode's mastery of Moonshadow Swordsmanship had exponentially increased the power of Shattered Blade, unleashing a volley of silvery blades that spun and surged forward. One after another, initially, the Wind Serpent Sovereign's armored scales resisted the sword beams. But by the twentieth, its defenses crumbled. The subsequent blades cut through with ease, impaling the creature. Despite the Wind Serpent Sovereign's daunting size, Rhode astutely focused on a single point of attack. Under his command, the blades converged and targeted the beast's neck, breaching its defenses. With a piercing shriek, the Wind Serpent Sovereign plummeted, undeterred in its agony. Despite the disfigurement of its neck, the Wind Serpent Sovereign lifted its head with a deathly resolve, fixing its gaze on Rhode before its jaws gaped wide. Rhode's form flickered, retreating into a wraith-like silhouette just in time to dodge a spurt of toxic venom. The poisonous spray narrowly missed his afterimage, drenching the mast behind him. Within moments, the venom devoured the mast, which then collapsed with a resounding crash. A BOSS is a BOSS for good reason. Drawing from his in-game experience, Rhode knew Wind Serpents typically averaged level three, with their leaders around ten. This BOSS was expected not to exceed that level. Though a formidable level, with the support of Carter and the mercenaries, defeating this BOSS wasn't the primary challenge. It was the realization that this was no ordinary Lord-level monster, but an Elite. An ordinary Lord would have succumbed to Rhode's initial assault, its wings severed. The mere fact that the strike had left a bone-exposing gash was evidence of its Elite status. 'Strike its wings, avoid its maw! Attack from its flank!' Rhode directed Carter and the others, all the while entangled with the Wind Serpent Sovereign. As a Summoner Swordsman, he wasn't the main tank, but it seemed none of the others had previous experience battling the Wind Serpent Sovereign. In the game, a team wipe meant a reset, but here, Rhode wasn't willing to take that gamble. The wound on his left chest, which had been healing, was now ablaze with pain as if torn anew. To perish here would be a lamentable tale without tears. Moreover, at level 5, and bereft of any gear, Rhode felt confident confronting an adversary not more than 15 levels his senior. In the Dragon Soul Continent, three classes were celebrated for their prowess against higher-level monsters: Mage, Ranger, and Summoner Swordsman. Mages commanded arcane spells, Rangers were adept in long-range 'kiting,' and Summoner Swordsmen excelled in outnumbering their foes. For these classes, overcoming a five-level differential was trivial, effortlessly taking down non-Elite BOSSes up to ten levels their superior with deft ease. Yet, each class had its pitfalls—Mages were powerless without mana, easy prey for even the weakest of sprites; Rangers were doomed if cornered; Summoner Swordsmen's gameplay was randomized and complex, lacking a straightforward strategy. This explained why these classes hadn't dominated the game. It also mirrored the reality of the Dragon Soul Continent—choosing the unconventional path or the steady, cautious advance. Players had the liberty to carve out their destiny and future. Now, facing the Raven Night Sovereign, a level 10 Elite BOSS, Rhode discerned the true challenge. With 'Star Scar' enhancing his might, the creature's defense seemed no stronger than that of a level six or seven opponent. Rhode's concern wasn't about the effectiveness of his blows but the strategy of his offense... 'Whoosh!' A fierce gust of wind burst forth. Rhode danced away swiftly, his figure blurring into a ghostly streak, evading the sweeping attack from the beast's wing. The wing, missing its target, struck the deck with tremendous force, leaving behind a gaping chasm. The strength of a level 10 Elite was unmistakable. Rhode wiped the sweat from his brow. At his current level, without any protective gear, a blow like that would have been a fatal blow, beyond any hope of recovery. While he was concerned for Carter and the others, it was fortunate that the Wind Serpent Sovereign seemed to have directed all its enmity towards him due to the damage he had caused. The unfortunate reality of being targeted by a BOSS with such ruinous power was a significant burden for those not suited for the tank role... His soul power had dwindled to a mere third, and Rhode could feel the fatigue setting in. He had anticipated a tough battle upon encountering the Wind Serpent Sovereign, but the pressure now was insurmountable. He relied on Shadow Flash to dodge the relentless onslaught, as evading the Wind Serpent Sovereign's attacks at his current speed was virtually impossible. On the other hand, he also relied on Shattered Blade to deal damage, aiming to bring down this formidable foe as swiftly as possible. But it was proving to be a daunting task. The Skyship, though descending, was being battered by the Wind Serpent Sovereign's attacks, swaying like a fragile vessel amidst a tempest, causing hearts to race with apprehension. Two mercenaries had already been cast overboard, their fates sealed. Carter continued his valiant efforts to fend off the Wind Serpent Sovereign. His twin swords danced before him, striking at the creature's flank, but to little effect. If not for Lijie's timely cast of Healing Light, sustaining the mercenaries, they might not have held out this long. An immediate solution was necessary; otherwise, the Skyship would be torn apart by the cursed serpent before it could make landfall. With resolve, Rhode bit his lip. The Wind Serpent Sovereign's assault showed no signs of abating. Its wings outstretched, its talons clung to the bow's edge. Despite the substantial damage Rhode had inflicted, the Lord-level monster was not inclined to retreat. Instead, the cunning Wind Serpent Sovereign seemed to realize its adversaries' vulnerability. Its talons gripped the Skyship's outer wall, shaking and tugging at its quarry with unrestrained vigor. The hull of the Skyship, though sturdy, had been battered in the skirmish with the Wind Serpent Swarm. Now, the howling gales buffeted the ship, causing it to twist and warp. Cracks spread across the deck, emitting harrowing sounds of splintering. 'My God! My God!' In the Captain's Cabin, the portly merchant trembled as he watched the dreadful Wind Serpent Sovereign outside. His voice quivered with fear and anger. 'That damnable Richard! If I ever lay hands on him, his life will be forfeit! To send me down such a perilous path—it's murder!' He shuddered, then turned his ire to the Captain beside him. 'And you! With such a monstrous creature at our helm, why didn't you warn me sooner?' The Captain ignored the merchant's tirade. His hands were steadfast on the helm, his focus unyielding. Internally, he cursed the fool. He had warned the merchant that this season's route might attract the Wind Serpent Swarm, but the man had scoffed at the warning. Now, with doom at hand, the gall to cast blame! Had he known it would come to this, he would have never embarked on this ill-fated voyage! Chapter Six: The Fall The situation was dire. Both Rhode and Carter, amid the tumult of battle, understood the formidable challenge presented by the Wind Serpent Lord. As the skyship plummeted, the forest canopy below came sharply into focus. However, at this rate, the vessel would likely disintegrate in the sky before ever reaching the ground. 'Haah!' Carter lunged forward, his twin swords drawing chilling arcs of light through the air, aiming for the colossal claws of the Wind Serpent Lord. But just as victory seemed within reach, an unexpected snarl and a gust of foul breath forced Carter to evade the serpent's lethal jaws, marking his attack a failure. Taken by surprise when the serpent suddenly released the ship, Carter was momentarily disoriented. Instinctively raising his swords in defense, he was still flung aside. Skidding across the deck, he finally came to a painful halt against the mast. This could not continue. Rhode's brow furrowed, as he turned his attention to the girl behind him, whose face was etched with anxiety. 'Lijie, I need your help!' 'Eh?' 'I'll distract it. When it attacks, cast a Guardian Shield for me!' 'Understood!' Lijie nodded without hesitation. Her hands tightly clasped, she summoned a serene, glowing light around her. Seeing this, Rhode wasted no further words. He turned, his sword at the ready, and charged with renewed vigor. Shattered Blade. The gleaming Blade of Light once again cut through the air, striking the Wind Serpent Lord with unyielding force. Though Rhode had not focused the Blade of Light as before, allowing its power to disperse, its might was still formidable. Unable to pierce the serpent's scales, it nonetheless ripped several distinct, bloody gashes in the creature's wing membranes, eliciting an agonized howl from the beast, 'Sss!' The Wind Serpent Lord's advance stalled as it jerked its head back, its baleful, crimson eyes aflame with rage, fixed on the defiant young human on the deck. Then, with its gaping maw wide open, it dove at Rhode once more. The serpent's speed was undeniable; in the blink of an eye, Rhode saw its gaping, blood-red jaws above him, bracing for the crucial moment. He deliberately refrained from using Shadow Flash, opting instead for a slower advance to entice the serpent into making a move. Though the risk was high, it was precisely when an adversary launched a full-on assault that its weaknesses were most exposed—and that was the opportunity Rhode was waiting for. As the jaws of the Wind Serpent Lord loomed, mere seconds from potentially sealing his fate, it still couldn't claim its prey. At that critical moment, a subtle, white, egg-shaped barrier materialized around Rhode, repelling the serpent's razor-sharp teeth. Though the barrier was shattered by the next blow, the serpent caught nothing but air. For as the Guardian Shield enveloped him, Rhode had already activated Shadow Flash. He glided past the serpent's bite like a wraith, his pristine white sword raised high, delivering a devastating strike to its unprotected throat. This was the Wind Serpent Lord's most critical weakness, previously guarded by caution. Now, driven to recklessness by Rhode's provocation, it had no time to shield its most vulnerable point. '———!!!' A shrill cry of agony pierced the air as the serpent recoiled, dark blood spurting from its throat and drenching the deck. Its massive body then slumped onto the deck, lifeless. At that moment, Rhode's vision was filled with a deep green expanse. 'Boom!' The ship jolted violently, his body cast into a moment of weightlessness. Then darkness enveloped Rhode's vision, and consciousness slipped from his grasp. As he came to, the chill of the twilight forest was the first sensation to greet him. 'Where am I...?' Opening his eyes, the first sight to grace him was a night sky alight with unnatural brilliance. This night was different, with gentle moonbeams casting precise shadows of each leaf upon the earth. Above, not only did stars twinkle, but bands of light intertwined, forming a web of luminescence that stretched in all directions. This was a hallmark of the Dragon Soul Continent—according to ancient lore, this was once an expanse riddled with chaos and danger. Then came five dragons, who sculpted the world and all life within this void from their own bodies. To quell the malevolent chaos, after shaping the world, they infused their souls into it to restrain the forces of darkness and maintain the world's order. Each dragon soul manifested uniquely, as seen in the sky above Rhode now. It signified the protective presence of the Light Dragon Soul. Its trait was to ensure that even in night's darkness, light would still shine. Contrasting this was the realm of the Dark Dragon Soul, where even at noon, darkness prevailed, devoid of light's touch. Consequently, the distribution of life on the continent followed this dichotomy. Verdant flora flourished under the watchful gaze of the Light Dragon Soul. But in the Dark Dragon Soul's domain, only bioluminescent plants could be seen. There were no gods over this land, only the five primordial dragons worshipped as creators. And the bearers of their souls. Every soul has its core, and for the world-shaping dragons, these cores resided within chosen individuals. These bearers could wield this power to adjust the dragon souls' guardianship over the land. To liken chaos to a virus and the dragon soul's power to a firewall, then the keeper of the soul core would be the CPU. As long as the CPU operates, the firewall remains robust, repelling all chaotic forces from the world. These soul core custodians were revered as the true heirs to the dragon souls. But for Rhode at the moment, such lore held little relevance. He rose, his body wracked by intense pain, particularly from the severe wound on his left chest. Previously, he could barely move his left hand, but now even the slightest movement brought searing pain, as if his entire arm was submerged in flames. Yet this pain confirmed that his arm was still attached—for numbness would signal a far more serious issue. Looking up, the moonlight revealed the skyship's wreckage among the towering trees of Silvermoon Forest, bathed in the forest's ethereal glow. With that, the sequence of events became clear. Though Rhode had slain the Wind Serpent Lord, the skyship, already teetering on the brink of collapse, had succumbed to the violent impact of its descent, now shattered amidst the trees. The forest was eerily silent, devoid of even the softest insect chirp. Rhode's gaze swept over the surroundings, noting the bloodstains and bodies scattered across the ground, vestiges of both Wind Serpents and humans. A short distance away, a small figure lay motionless. 'Lijie!' Rhode rushed to the girl's side, leaning down to check her condition. Fortunately, though she appeared pallid and held her hands tightly, her breathing was steady. Moments after Rhode's call, her eyes fluttered open. 'I... What has happened to me...?' Lijie's eyes opened, unfocused at first, then settled on the man before her. After a moment, she began to regain her composure, a testament to the brutality of their crash. 'I'm still alive?' 'Yes.' Relieved by Lijie's response, Rhode watched as she slowly stood, shaking her head and biting her lip, her full recovery yet to come. Yet, there were more pressing concerns for her now. 'Where are the others? What of the leader? How do they fare?' '...............' Rhode offered no response, for Lijie required none—the scene around them spoke volumes. The young girl's already pale face tightened with shock. 'How could this be... Crite! Xar! Leader!' She dashed to the mercenaries' bodies, desperately calling out their names, but there was no reply. Lijie did not abandon hope; she knelt, meticulously checking each mercenary. After confirming his death, she did not succumb to tears but clenched her teeth and moved to the next. Her efforts, however, bore no fruit. Before those lifeless forms, cold and rigid, she was powerless. Though Lijie persisted, when she came upon Carter's body, her legs gave way, and she collapsed to the ground. The mercenary leader, once brimming with vitality, was now just a lifeless husk. Half of his body was wedged into a crevice on the deck, his abdomen impaled by a broken wooden stake. 'Lea... Leader...' As Lijie processed this, she sat on the damp earth, stunned, the flame of hope now extinguished from her eyes, leaving only the cold ashes of despair behind. Eventually, the girl bowed her head, her quiet sobs reaching Rhode's ears as they were carried by the night breeze. Observing the girl's trembling shoulders, Rhode could only stand in silence behind her, at a loss for words. In the heat of battle, the immediacy of life and death had overshadowed everything else. But now, with the conflict concluded and surrounded by the fallen, Rhode's feelings were a jumble. He had seen death before, but those had been simulations within the realm of a game. In the game, the dead could be revived with spells, or their souls could make their way back to life at a graveyard. But this was not a game. Here, there was no return for the departed. Death was final. In that moment, Rhode's mind drifted back to that night seven years ago when he could only watch helplessly—death passed by unwaveringly, and he was powerless to intervene. As he contemplated words of comfort for the girl before him, a faint plea for help broke the silence. 'Hey... Is there anyone? Help...' Chapter Seven: After the Catastrophe Meis sat by the campfire, his plump face a canvas of resignation and frustration. He was eager to vent his anger but found no suitable target for his vexation. Across the campfire, Rhode leaned against a tree trunk, eyes closed in repose. Lijie quietly prepared their meal, her calm exterior barely concealing the swollen eyes that spoke volumes of her silent sorrow. Fate had it that the portly merchant was the only other survivor apart from Rhode and Lijie. As a seasoned trader, Meis had accumulated various magical artifacts for protection. When the skyship took its fatal dive, his guardian amulet showcased its value, shielding him from the gravest injuries— Rhode, who had been tending to earlier wounds, found his condition worsen after the intense combat and subsequent crash. Lijie's situation was scarcely better. Initially, adrenaline masked her injuries, but as calm returned, the truth of her dislocated right arm and wounded foot became undeniable. Aside from superficial cuts and a throbbing headache from the impact, Meis was relatively unharmed. Normally, such injuries would have bedridden a person for months, but they were fortunate. Lijie, a bona fide Spirit Master, possessed healing magic. Through her intervention, they saw improvements in their condition, though Rhode required more time for full recuperation. Considering the battle's ferocity and his severe injuries, Rhode's near-miraculous state could have left him dead or permanently disabled. Yet, he stood with all limbs intact, his mobility only mildly impeded by his wounds—nearly as good as new. This astonished even Lijie, who had cared for him since his rescue and was well aware of the extent of his injuries. She had not foreseen such remarkable resilience in Rhode's physique. Rhode himself was inwardly amazed. In the heat of battle, he recognized that his body was not constrained by human limits, yet he hadn't anticipated such an extraordinary level of endurance—to remain mobile after severe trauma and a violent crash. Could his mixed heritage be a factor? But Rhode harbored another secret. He was keenly aware of his body's supernatural attributes, even if the specifics remained a mystery. Clearly, he was not merely human. The survival of the golden-haired girl, Lijie, was even more baffling. As a fragile Spirit Master, she should have had minimal odds of survival. Rhode's resilience was due to his non-human traits, but what about hers? It surely couldn't be just luck. The puzzle persisted until Rhode noticed a hint of gold in Lijie's deep azure eyes. Suddenly, it made sense—her survival was not just a stroke of luck. 'Mr. Rhode?' Meis inquired tentatively, an ingratiating smile forming on his chubby face. 'What should our next move be?' After rescuing Meis, the trio revisited the skyship's debris, confirming there were no other survivors. To prevent their fallen comrades from becoming forest predators' prey, Lijie proposed cremation. Meis, hesitant to watch his valuable goods consumed by fire, was persuaded by Lijie's somber expression and Rhode's indifference. Wincing, he watched the skyship burn— He looked as though he had suffered the most grievous injury. The amulet, costly as it was, had indeed saved his life. Now shattered, having absorbed the impact's brunt, it was reduced to scrap. Meis's loss was significant. They took a day to rest in the forest. Although no further troubles arose, the merchant, still shaken by the Wind Serpent assault, had become exceedingly cautious. He had previously dismissed Wind Serpent encounters as too improbable to worry about. Now, his stance was completely reversed; the once distant rumors now felt all too real— 'They said this route might be home to Wind Serpents, and indeed, we encountered them! I've also heard stories of man-eating wolves and formidable birds within Silvermoon Forest. We're not going to encounter them too, are we?' Once bitten, twice shy, as the saying goes. Meis was tormented by such thoughts, his forehead slick with sweat. Despite his experience as a merchant, he lacked genuine adventuring knowledge. The dense underbrush and towering trees made his legs quiver. Idle talk of venomous snakes and wolves from his guards now haunted him, rendering him nearly paranoid with fear. With his sole protective artifact now useless, Meis had no choice but to rely on others for safety. He did not consider Lijie as a viable option. Having met her during the hiring process, he noticed her obedience and pleasant nature but also her lack of decisiveness. And as a non-combatant, she would likely be of little help in a real emergency. Thus, Meis's dependence fell on Rhode. Though no warrior himself, Rhode had previously demonstrated significant capabilities, suggesting his strength was more than adequate. While Meis could not compare Rhode's adventuring experience to that of seasoned mercenaries, he assumed the gap was not profound. As for Lijie, she seemed still enveloped in her sorrow over her companions' loss, disinterested in such practical matters. 'Do not worry, Mr. Meis,' Rhode reassured, observing the merchant's anxious demeanor. Though the man was somewhat unrefined, Rhode bore him no resentment. If not for Meis's command to halt the ship, Rhode may not have been rescued. He felt goodwill toward the merchant. 'I am intimately familiar with Silvermoon Forest. Given our current location, it is unlikely we will encounter any serious threats. Rest assured.' Rhode's assurance was grounded in experience. In the game, the northern plains of Pafield were a novice player's sanctuary, and he knew the local monster distributions well. On the plains, the Wind Serpent swarm posed a significant threat, especially to melee-oriented classes and solo adventurers. In Silvermoon Forest, the primary hazard came from Silver Wolves. Unlike the serpents that relied on numbers, wolves typically hunted alone, making them easier to handle. Moreover, after defeating the Wind Serpent Lord, Rhode had gained 3000 experience points, reaching level eight. With the novice zone capped at level ten, Rhode felt confident of his ability to navigate the area. Unless he, like some inexperienced player, neglected the map and stumbled into a deadly lair—a scenario virtually impossible for the 'Walking Library.' 'That is indeed comforting to hear,' Meis responded, visibly relieved as he wiped the sweat from his brow. Exhausted from the day's stress and lack of sleep, even the slightest rustling had sounded like wolf howls to him. Now, with his nerves finally easing, he curled up contentedly by the fire, closed his eyes, and quickly succumbed to deep slumber. Assured that Meis was deep in sleep, Rhode, who had been sitting silently by the fire, rose. Turning away from the campsite, he ventured deeper into the forest. Chapter 8: The Ten Great Primordials, Card of Wind Rhode Alante certainly had no intention of abandoning the portly merchant. His departure was solely to inspect the loot he had acquired. Throughout the recent battle, Rhode had amassed an impressive amount of experience, though tangible rewards were scarce. For players, the crashed skyship was a treasure trove, and the numerous deceased aboard were likely to have considerable wealth. Nonetheless, Rhode ultimately decided against salvaging. It would be distasteful to plunder the belongings of those who had saved his life after their demise. While experience points were invaluable, Rhode felt that a more significant gain was the black original stone in his hand. According to the lore of Dragon Soul Continent, such a stone is the crystallized soul core of a powerful magical creature at death. Its uses varied: it could be set as a jewel in weapons, melted to forge soul weapons, or used by spellcasters as an excellent material for crafting magical tools. Due to the rarity of soul cores, their price was exorbitantly high in the continent's world. To a Summoner Swordsman, their value was unparalleled, as they were essential for awakening summoned spirits. Now, Rhode stood in the quiet embrace of the forest, his right hand revealing the soul core. It lay tranquil in his palm, dark as the void, the size of a nucleus. Surrounded by silence, the gentle forest bathed in soft moonlight that filtered through the leaves, dappling the ground and underbrush with specks of light. The summoning circle on the back of Rhode's hand glowed anew, its serpentine magical light swiftly expanding. A system prompt materialized before Rhode: [Contaminated Soul Core detected. Would you like to purify it?] "Purify." Instantly, the summoning circle on Rhode's right hand erupted with pristine radiance, flowing like water down his fingers, encircling the soul core in his palm. As the divine power infiltrated, the black miasma entwining the soul core vanished as swiftly as snow under sunlight, leaving no trace. With the dark fog cleared, the soul core finally revealed its true form—a transparent gem, trembling gently, radiating an azure glow as if an imprisoned soul yearned for release. [Soul Core purification complete. Would you like to proceed with awakening?] "Awaken." Upon Rhode's command, the azure gem's trembling intensified. Then, with a soft 'pop', the gem shattered, and streams of blue, water-like energy burst forth. They spiraled and intertwined, eventually forming a card, which then came to rest quietly in Rhode's hand. A refreshing coolness spread through him, prompting an involuntary shiver of comfort. At that moment, Rhode understood the entity with which he had forged a contract. He examined the card; its face depicted a verdant spirit bird soaring across the sky, with a teal half-moon in the upper-right corner indicating the card's Wind Elemental attribute, and a 'V' in the top-left. Two small numbers—2—were displayed at the card's bottom corners. Flipping the card over, the back revealed text shimmering with arcane light: [Soaring Spirit Bird (Wind Elemental Attribute): A flight-capable, fusion-compatible spirit. Attacks have a 10% chance of inflicting paralysis and piercing effects, bypassing magical defenses— Innate Skill: Spectral Wind Mirage (Children of the wind soaring the heavens, a wide-range skill.)] [You have obtained 1/10 of the Sky Deck, the Soaring Spirit Bird] Rhode couldn't suppress a grin. Aerial spirits were essential for early-stage Summoner Swordsmen, and the Wind Elemental Attribute allowed it to pass effortlessly through barriers without magical properties, making ordinary defenses futile. Coupled with a 30-meter effective range and special effects, Rhode felt assured of his safety from most dangers. Should he encounter a mutated Boss, he was confident in his capacity to contend. Yet, Rhode's vexation stemmed from the enigma of his attributes. To date, his strength, constitution, agility, and willpower remained obscured, a fact that left him with an unsettling sense of unease. Though in his own body, its current capabilities far exceeded the potential he should possess as a regular human. He was certain his attributes surpassed those of a human, but the inability to grasp the specifics of his condition was disconcerting. Believing you would die and then surviving is a fortunate mistake. However, assuming you would live, only to die, is a nightmarish reality. With his attributes concealed, Rhode could only speculate based on his accumulated experiences. His battle with the Wind Serpent Lord had provided him with some clues. An adversary he had once meticulously researched as a Boss. Given his performance in that battle, his strength appeared on par with that of a standard swordsman, while his constitution was notably formidable. Since his arrival in this world, despite numerous perils, Rhode's body seemed to have withstood the trials, never once reaching a critical condition, only ever alert. His speed appeared no different from that of an average human. As for willpower, Rhode found himself without a means to gauge it—he certainly couldn't solicit a mage to cast mental spells on him to test his resistance. At that moment, a subtle rustling came from the underbrush. Rhode arched an eyebrow, and the radiance of the summoning circle on the back of his hand dimmed in an instant, while the card turned into motes of magical dust, vanishing from sight. Once sealed as a card and bound to a holder, sealed cards no longer manifested physically. They would slumber quietly within the 'Ten Great Primordials,' the summoning circle on the Summoner Swordsman's hand, awaiting their master's call to action. Only two cards currently resided within—the attribute-less 'Star Scar' and the Wind Elemental 'Spirit Bird,' both nestled in the 'Kingdom' ring of the Outer Six Rings. Rhode had no desire to reveal his capabilities overly in the presence of others. The game's lore might introduce Summoner Swordsmen as a player-exclusive class from the continent's ancient past, with players as the lone inheritors on a quest to rediscover and relive the glory of this heroic class. But these were mere pleasantries from the game's introduction. Judging by the expressions of Lijie and Meis, Rhode surmised that these people were likely wholly unaware of such a profession. It was therefore imprudent for him to divulge more. Moreover, maintaining an aura of mystery bore its own advantages. As Rhode turned, he spotted Lijie emerging from the woods. "Lijie? What brings you here?" "Ah... No, it's nothing, Mr. Rhode." Lijie shook her head, her countenance reflecting a trace of disquiet. "I just wanted to check on your wounds, see if there's anything I can do..." Her voice tapered off, her fingers tightly clutching the hem of her robe, betraying a fragile visage. Rhode had taken note of Lijie's abnormal behavior. Meis's ability to discern her traits was borne of his experience as a merchant traversing the continent, necessitating a sharp eye to avoid misfortune. Rhode's insight into her character, however, stemmed from his tenure as the leader of Dragon Soul Continent's preeminent guild. Hidden behind their avatars, players often masked their true selves more readily online than in reality. In such a digital realm, coalescing the strength of a collective was vital—most players sought pleasure, not labor, in the game. Compelling them to adhere to schedules, participate in raids, and chase records and achievements demanded a delicate balance and keen oversight. Therefore, discerning the mood and inner thoughts of his companions was of paramount importance for a guild leader like Rhode. Now, Lijie's demeanor unequivocally signaled a dire need for support, casting her into a profound state of unease. Rhode could see that the loss of her companions had dealt her a severe blow, not merely from the departure of familiar faces but from the trepidation and uncertainty about the future. Rhode had observed the girl amidst the tumult of battle. Back then, she had performed admirably, casting healing spells on her comrades with alacrity, swiftly dispelling toxins, and the protective shield she conjured for Rhode was a feat of precision timing—an impressive display for a support role. She had been full of confidence then, decisive and undaunted in the face of peril. Now, the quivering girl before him bore no trace of that earlier assurance. There was but one explanation. Chapter Nine: Departure Rhode Alante cast a contemplative glance at the young woman before him and sighed softly. "Lijie Noelle, you are the one who should be burdened with worry. Since the ordeal of last night, you've scarcely had a moment's repose," he remarked with concern. The words 'last night' sent a shiver through Lijie, as if the shadows of past events were once again enveloping her. Despite this, she stubbornly bit her lip and shook her head. "No... I..." 'Slap!' Her protest was cut off when Rhode delivered a swift, disciplinary slap to her cheek. What was the meaning of this? Holding her reddened cheek, Lijie's eyes were wide with disbelief. She stared at the enigmatic Rhode, who simply returned her gaze with a quiet intensity before speaking up. "I understand what you're feeling right now." His voice was calm, almost devoid of emotion, igniting a flicker of anger within Lijie. She lowered her hand, fists clenched as though she was about to refute Rhode's presumptuous words, yet his next sentence drained her of any strength to argue. "Feeling guilty for surviving merely because you're different is not fitting for a half-blood," he said. '!!' At those words, Lijie recoiled in shock, instinctively crossing her arms and retreating until her back met a tree. Despite this, her focus remained fixed on the man before her, mouth agape, unable to utter a word. How did he know? That was impossible. She hadn't told him, and within the Star Moon Mercenary Corps, only a select few were privy to her secret. "How did you..." "Your eyes," Rhode interjected. "Under the light, they reflect a golden sheen, the hallmark of the 'Light Guardians'—the angels. Unlike those of purebloods, the luster in your eyes is subdued, a veil cast by your human lineage—is that not so?" She remained silent. Though she did not confirm, Rhode's assessment proved accurate. The girl before him was indeed a half-blood. He had been observing Lijie for some time, and as a top player, he was accustomed to discerning attributes through equipment and traits—a skill critical in both boss battles and PvP confrontations, a finesse mastered by veteran players. After their rescue, Rhode had watched the girl intentionally, quickly deducing her true nature. Her mixed heritage did not diminish the potent healing and damage resistance of angels, the likely reason why Lijie survived the skyship's demise. She must have been acutely aware of this—hence her despondency. "So I said I can understand your thoughts," Rhode continued, his shoulders lifting in a slight shrug. "You know why you lived, but it's not luck—it's the result of differences that set you apart from others. And you can't accept that... If possible, you'd rather be an ordinary human, facing death with your comrades, not surviving by chance." '.....................' Her head bowed, Lijie's hands clutched her skirt tightly. "But it's not for you to decide." As he watched Lijie's tremulous shoulders, Rhode's tone grew tender. "You cannot choose your birth nor stop what comes to pass. These are matters beyond your reach; never regret what you cannot control." "Then... what should I do?" Lijie finally ventured, her voice faint. "That path is yours to choose," Rhode advised. After a moment of silence, Lijie lifted her head, a look of clarity in her eyes. "I understand now. Thank you, Mr. Rhode Alante." "No need for thanks." '...... However, that slap really did sting...' Though the method may have been brusque, Lijie had stepped out from the shadow of grief and self-reproach. By the next day's sunrise, her golden locks shone without a trace of previous sorrow, replaced by her familiar, gentle smile. This unexpected transformation left Meis, who had awoken completely unaware of the night's events, quite perplexed. He cast curious glances between the two, eventually directing a meaningful smirk at Rhode— The meaning behind it, known only to him. Before the merchant could satisfy his curiosity, Rhode's statement plunged him into contemplation. "It is time we set forth." Set forth? The word sent a jolt through the merchant, who had just enjoyed a filling breakfast. He suddenly remembered they were not nestled in his cozy room, but rather in the vast, perilous expanse of the Silvermoon Forest... They weren't here for leisure; that cursed Wind Serpent, the damnable captain... Enough of that, such memories were pointless now. The pressing concern was—how would they escape this forest of death? At this thought, Meis looked eagerly at Rhode. If the young man claimed to have a plan, surely it must be a well-devised one. They were in the wilderness, where one wrong step could mean death, not to mention the predators lurking within—these were essential survival skills. He had to pay close attention, lest a moment's oversight lead to a fatal end here. With that thought, Meis patted his cheeks, dispelling the last vestiges of sleep. He watched intently as Rhode stood up, dusting the earth from his legs, flexing his wrists, and finally stated, "Let us proceed." ....................................... '...... Wait, hold on, Mr. Rhode Alante!' The merchant, as rotund as he was, sprang up as if seated on a chair studded with nails. "To where do we head?" "To the northeast, there is a town. Once we reach it, the road ahead will be much easier." "Is there nothing we should be wary of?" "Nothing in particular." Rhode's response was expected; the Pafield region, being the novice area for Dragon Soul Continent, had been thoroughly explored by players, particularly those influenced by fantasy novels. In the early days of the game, many players ventured into uncharted and perilous territories in search of legendary artifacts that could grant them dominion over the game world. They dreamed of wielding divine weapons, conquering foes, and establishing mighty empires to rule the continent... But reality is often cruel. Despite players' relentless efforts, while they did find some rare and powerful equipment, none met the dream of holding an artifact that would proclaim 'with this, the world is mine.' The expectations were simply too high. For Meis, the region was fraught with danger, each step potentially his last. But for Rhode, it was as familiar as his own backyard. In the game, as a guild leader, he had often led novices here to level up. He knew every monster-infested spot, the optimal quests for each class, the best training locations—Rhode could navigate this terrain blindfolded. So, to him, there was nothing particularly worth mentioning. Meis? The task of escorting merchants was routine for Rhode, undertaken countless times within the game; how could it possibly concern him? Upon hearing Rhode's answer, Meis's face drooped, resembling a wilted flower. He couldn't fathom Rhode's thoughts, but the dismissal seemed quite negligent. Reflecting on this, the merchant began to second-guess his decision. The young man had been severely injured in the mountains. If he had been unharmed, such casualness might be excusable. But now, with injuries, this nonchalance... Was it not akin to seeking death? Though regret was beginning to gnaw at him, Meis had no choice but to proceed. Resigned, he clenched his teeth and followed the pair deeper into the woods. Bathed in the bright sunlight, Silvermoon Forest seemed calm, the sun's rays filtering through the leafy canopy to dance upon the forest floor. Birdsong rang out crisply, and even a wild rabbit could be seen darting through the underbrush. The scene was so peaceful that the once-anxious merchant began to relax. No longer suspicious, he settled into the surroundings. Rhode was trailblazing, his agile figure weaving deftly through the forest's natural labyrinth. Vines and thorny underbrush proved no obstacle to his passage. Observing his nimble movements, it was hard to believe he had recently suffered grave injuries. Lijie, following close behind, kept pace with practiced ease. Clearly accustomed to the challenges of the wilderness, she navigated the terrain with assured grace despite her cumbersome robe, occasionally cautioning Meis to watch his step. The deeper they ventured, the more astonished Lijie became. To an observer, Rhode's chosen path might seem random; he did not travel in a straight line, often veering left or right, sometimes circling back. It would be easy to assume he roamed without purpose. Yet, few could perceive that under Rhode's guidance, a smooth trail revealed itself amidst the dense woodland, as if it had always existed, waiting to be discovered. Lijie had heard her leader mention such high-level skills. It was challenging for ordinary people to navigate forests; only elves, in harmony with nature, and rangers, steeped in the wilds, possessed this expertise. She had witnessed it once. Her team, lost in the woods, had been rescued by an elf who chose a direction opposite to established paths. At the time, Lijie was apprehensive, but they left the forest with ease. It was then that she learned of the technique from her leader. But... Watching Rhode's back, Lijie's head tilted in curiosity. According to her leader, only experienced elves and rangers could master such skill. Ordinary elves had the gift of communing with nature but could not achieve this level of navigation. But Rhode—so at ease, never once pausing to commune with the flora—was clearly not an elf, nor... Did he resemble a ranger? Though Lijie had limited interaction with rangers, she knew their primary weapon was the bow. Yet, Rhode had not once used a bow since they met... Who was he, really? With each passing moment, Lijie's curiosity deepened. Rhode halted his stride. Through the underbrush, he could see the clear waters of a lake, the very heart of Silvermoon Forest—Moonlight Lake. In the game, this was a respite for players, a haven for rest amid their journey. "How marvelous!" Admiring the clear waters, Meis subconsciously licked his dry lips. Though their journey had been brief, for a merchant accustomed to comfort, it felt like an eternity. Seeing such a tranquil spot ahead, the merchant quickened his steps toward the lake, eager for a moment of rest. But as he began to move, Rhode's hand pressed against his shoulder. The merchant looked at the young man in confusion, but Rhode remained silent, simply gesturing for silence with a finger to his lips before pointing ahead. Meis followed Rhode's indication to the lakeside, and his face turned ashen. In the shadows by the lake, a majestic white giant wolf lay in repose, its eyes closed as if in peaceful slumber. Chapter 10: Forest Pathfinding As a seasoned merchant, Meis had encountered his share of wolves. Yet, he could swear he had never seen one so immense. The beast before them, towering as tall as a man, was cloaked in a lustrous, thick fur, leisurely basking in the afternoon sun, its powerful tail swaying with deceptive ease. Lijie, too, had fallen silent; she trod cautiously behind Rhode, her breath held in suspense. As a mercenary, she was well aware of the dangers these formidable creatures posed. While not as visibly tense as Meis—who seemed to be holding his breath in dread—she, too, looked to Rhode, awaiting his directive with bated breath. Rhode was contemplating their predicament. Before them stood 'Moon Soul,' a Silver Wolf of level 10, an elite creature. Not a boss, but a far cry from a benign adversary. On the Dragon Soul Continent, creatures were sorted into beasts, giant beasts, and demonic beasts—the latter two representing the most formidable of adversaries. Beasts were the common denizens of the wilderness, while giant beasts had grown massive and ferocious through longevity or external stimuli. Upon awakening their soul power, they evolved into demonic beasts—far more cunning and formidable in combat. Although 'Moon Soul' wasn't as menacing as the Wind Serpent Lord they had previously encountered, Rhode recognized it as a significant challenge. Nonetheless, he remained composed. A cursory glance at their surroundings sufficed. In the game world, Rhode would have slain the wolf without a second thought for experience and loot. But this was not a game, and their party was small. Lijie, a Spirit Master, lacked self-defense capabilities, and Meis... Meis was not a combatant. In such circumstances, discretion was indeed the better part of valor. With a subtle hand gesture, Rhode signaled a tactical withdrawal, selecting an alternate route to avoid the Silver Wolf. Given the vastness of Moonlight Lake, a confrontation was unnecessary. Lijie and Meis exchanged a glance of mutual understanding and quickly followed Rhode's lead, eager to distance themselves from the impending danger. But, as fate would have it... 'Crack.' Meis's footing betrayed him, and he stumbled to the ground, the sound of a snapping twig shattering the forest's stillness. Rhode, leading the way, spun around swiftly, his right hand poised for action. With a crisp birdcall, a burst of verdant energy launched from his palm toward the looming threat. 'Boom!' The sound of impact reverberated through the woods, followed by a low, pained howl. Lijie and Meis turned just in time to see the black giant wolf, which had approached undetected, now sprawled on the ground, struck down by some invisible force. A shadow flitted past. Upon Meis's stumble, Rhode had sensed imminent danger. The giant wolves of Silvermoon Forest, known for their keen senses, were among the top predators of the realm. Fortunately, Rhode's experiences with similar situations in the game now served him well. Though his current senses weren't sharp enough to pinpoint the beasts, his familiarity with their behavior prompted swift action. The resting 'Moon Soul' might not launch an immediate attack, but it was certainly aware of their presence. This predator would likely stalk them silently, waiting until nightfall to strike. They could afford to wait; Rhode could not. To confront the beast now, to take control of the situation, was far more advantageous than to risk an ambush later. Rhode's judgment was swift and precise. The 'Moon Soul' had not anticipated such a prompt counterassault. It instinctively reacted, but a fraction too late. The spectral bird struck its target with unerring precision, the concussive force sending the giant wolf tumbling. As the beast lay dazed on the forest floor, Rhode, bolstered by 'Shadow Flash,' was already by its side. His focus was unwavering, his hand outstretched. 'Cage!' (Elven Tongue: Bind) The spectral bird returned to his hand, transforming back into its card form, its color shifting from green to white in an instant. Without a second glance, Rhode grasped the card tightly, then thrust it at the 'Moon Soul's hind leg with precision. A radiant beam of white light burst forth, piercing the wolf's limb and pinning it to the ground. In Rhode's grasp, the sword known as 'Star Scar' materialized. The Silver Wolf howled in torment, its eyes wide with a mix of fury and pain as it glared at its human adversary. It attempted to rise, only to falter again, its injury grievous. Rhode did not hesitate. With the wolf's every movement under his vigilant watch, he maintained his advantage. Creatures like 'Moon Soul' were renowned for their swiftness, and had he not swiftly neutralized that trait, the battle would have been arduous. Now, with its agility impaired, the Silver Wolf could no longer rely on speed for defense. What followed would be far less challenging. Despite its grave injury, the Silver Wolf did not descend into panic. It met Rhode's gaze, and as his blade descended, it raised its paw in defense. But Rhode had anticipated the counterstrike. His blade, a blazing arc of white, swept beneath the wolf's descending paw, drawing a stream of crimson. As the wolf recoiled in pain, all it could see was the blade's glare, outshining even the sun. Vital Strike! The 'Dancing Shattered Blade' cut through the wolf's massive frame with ease, its edge slicing through the tough hide as if it were mere parchment. With a cry of distress, the black giant wolf was hurled into the air, crashing against a sapling before tumbling to the earth. A gruesome wound gaped along its side, exposing stark white bone and the slow seep of its innards—a sight of visceral horror. Even Rhode, who had witnessed such scenes in his confrontations with the Wind Serpents, couldn't help but grimace. In the game, vital strikes were mere numbers, not the stark and visceral reality before him. The impact from the spectral bird, combined with Rhode's targeted assault, had pushed the giant wolf to its breaking point. Its once formidable growls now reduced to pitiful whimpers. It struggled to stand, to persist. But Rhode was resolute. With a swift motion, he drove 'Star Scar' into the wolf's skull, decisively ending its life. What seemed an extended encounter had, in truth, spanned only a few brief moments. To Lijie and Meis, it appeared Rhode had dispatched 'Moon Soul' with remarkable precision, felling it with a series of swift, accurate strikes. They stood in awe at the ease with which Rhode had vanquished such a formidable foe. It was a feat beyond their grasp; even a fully assembled mercenary corps would have found it challenging to defeat a giant wolf with such finesse. For Meis, the mix of awe and guilt was overwhelming. At the moment of his fall, his heart had plunged into cold dread, fearful of the wolf's detection. He had anticipated the process but not the outcome. The Silver Wolf had indeed noticed them, but before it could act on its predatory instincts, it had become a lifeless carcass... Though the immediate threat was neutralized, Meis remained disturbed, his gaze fixed on the young man who had saved them from peril. He knew his blunder was significant and the fear of being abandoned by Rhode loomed large. Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't have troubled him, as he would be surrounded by hired guards who would overlook minor missteps. But this was not the norm. Rhode was not a guard or a mercenary; he was an equal. If displeased, Rhode could easily abandon him to his fate. 'This... I... I didn't mean to...' Meis, grappling with his thoughts, felt a cold sweat bead his back. He licked his parched lips, at a loss for words. Then, Rhode stood. He turned, his expression composed, his eyes meeting Meis's anxious ones. 'Be more cautious in your steps.' In that moment, Meis realized that nodding was the only response left to him... Chapter Eleven: Lingering Shadows Rhode had initially intended to rest near Moonlight Lake for a while before resuming their journey. However, the encounter with the giant wolf made him reconsider. Fearing the scent of blood from the carcasses might attract unwanted trouble, he chose a relatively flat high ground upstream of Moonlight Lake to camp as the sun went down. After their meal, Rhode resumed his role as sentry, despite the strain on his body. Given his familiarity with the Silvermoon Forest and being the only one capable of combat, it was a necessary burden. The portly merchant Meis had offered to assist, but Rhode and Lijie’s expressions made their doubts clear without words. Therefore, Meis, with a sense of defeat, could do little but sit idly by the fire, sorting through their salvaged belongings from the skyship wreckage. Lijie, too, was not idle. At that moment, she knelt by Rhode's side, placing her hands upon his left shoulder. "AliyMia." (Dragon Language: Healing) Along with the girl’s clear chant, a gentle white glow rose from her palms, enveloping Rhode's form. In the Dragon Soul Continent, casters typically use Dragon Language to cast spells, as since the Genesis Era, nearly seventy percent of magic has been transmitted in this form, widely adopted by humans during the Great Magic Era. The remaining magics are composed of Angelic Tongue, Elven Language, Demonic Tongue, and Necrotic Tongue. As races originally created and guarded by the Progenitor Dragon, they inherited the magical talents and longevity of dragons. This has also become the division between the various strata on the continent. In the Kingdom of Night, the Kingdom of Light, and the Kingdom of Law, regardless of their political systems, the highest ranks are invariably those with the souls of the Five Great Dragons. Following them are non-humans like angels, elves, demons, and undead, with humans below. Each country's hierarchy varies due to differing political systems. The Kingdom of Night, ruled by Monarchic Rule, has a strict class system with no humans among its leaders. The Kingdom of Light, which practices Parliamentary Democracy, includes humans in half of its high council. In the Kingdom of Law, where Theocratic Centralism prevails, angels, elves, and humans are evenly distributed, each holding a third of the power, as they believe in the Path of Balance. Rhode was well-versed in the continent's affairs and what was to come. As a player in the game, one could simply quit. But now, as part of this world, he pondered his next move against the looming catastrophes. "Mr. Rhode... Mr. Rhode?" Lijie's voice pulled Rhode from his reverie. He looked up at the girl before him, who had regained her usual demeanor. Although worry occasionally crossed her brows, she seemed vastly better than the gloomy, near-suicidal look previously. "I felt something during the battle with the Wind Serpent Lord," she said cautiously, glancing at Meis, who sat nearby with a pained expression. "Oh?" Rhode raised an eyebrow. "A dark aura. Not strong, unlike what you'd expect from a creature of darkness... Mr. Rhode, Wind Serpents aren't creatures of darkness, are they?" Of course not, Wind Serpents are creatures of Wind Elementals, distant from Dark Elements. But... "Are you certain?" "Yes, absolutely." Rhode mulled over her confident reply. He knew of the Wind Serpent Swarm's persistent attacks on Wind Tide Trade Route ships, causing significant losses. The Kingdom of Light claimed nomadic tribes from Pafield’s southern disputed region, under the Kingdom of Darkness’s control, were responsible. Later, the Kingdom of Light attacked, expelling and massacring the inhabitants. Then the Kingdom of Night retaliated, reclaiming their claimed land and initiating a full-scale invasion of the Kingdom of Light. This history unfolded during the public beta, where Rhode and other players were occupied with new systems and leveling, paying little attention to the backstory. By the time the game officially launched, war had already broken out. Players speculated differently about the cause. Some saw it as the Kingdom of Light’s failure to reclaim territory, while others suggested deliberate provocation by the Kingdom of Night. Many believed the Kingdom of Night had long coveted the Kingdom of Light, exploiting mismanagement to initiate war. Rhode saw truth in each theory. The disputed lands were rich in Crystal Mines, valuable to any nation, and the Kingdom of Light had no reason to relent. The current Night Dragon Eon, a formidable ruler, proved difficult for even the craftiest players. There were even rumors he was not an NPC, but a game company employee in disguise. Given the Kingdom of Light's parliamentary performance during the war, many players, frustrated with absurd orders, defected to fight against them, highlighting the tragic circumstances. Now it seemed the conspiracy theorists were closer to the truth. Lijie’s senses were unlikely to be wrong. As creatures of the Light Element, angels are sensitive to Dark Elements, and her half-blood heritage should align. Could the Wind Serpent Swarm’s attacks on the Wind Tide Trade Route be a premeditated move by the Kingdom of Night, foreshadowing a full-scale assault on the Kingdom of Light? The situation was more complex than it appeared. "Lijie, mention this to no one." "Understood, Mr. Rhode." She nodded, retracting her hands after another careful check of his wounds, smiling faintly. "Your wounds have healed significantly. Another five or six days should see full recovery." "Thank you." Rhode nodded his gratitude, then focused on the system information before him. His health was visibly improving. Soon, he would regain full mobility. Now, a long list of tasks awaited him. Rhode furrowed his brow, pondering his next move... Meanwhile, at the skyship crash site, two figures emerged from the forest. "Is this the vessel you spoke of?" The lead man asked coldly, his white, streamlined armor marked with glowing golden insignia, identifying him as an officer of the Kingdom of Light’s Frontier Defense. His companion, wrapped in a black cloak obscuring his face, nodded in confirmation. "They killed my envoy." The hoarse voice felt chilling under the night sky. "To think such a filthy, incompetent band of mercenaries could slay it. Your pet was truly ineffectual." "That's your fault, too!" The cloaked figure's voice spiked with anger. "Had you provided a higher-level creature... Dominion Tier, no, Mastery Tier Overlord, I wouldn't have had to use such an inferior being!" "Dominion Tier?" The man scoffed. "What do you believe we are? We supply resources, not handle your tasks. If we could do everything, what need would we have for you?" After a pause, he softened slightly. "How long until you can act again?" "At least half a month. It's not easy to find a malleable Wind Serpent Swarm." "You have ten days. The reward will be doubled." Annoyed by the grumbles, the man's face darkened. He drew a purse from within his armor and tossed it over. "In ten days, you will act again." The purse thudded on the ground, its sound heavy with coin. The figure in the cloak picked it up, peeked inside, then snapped it shut. "Fine, ten days. I will honor the agreement." "Remember, no third party shall know of this." "I understand... By the way, some rats seem to have escaped from the vessel. Shall I deal with them?" "No need." The man waved dismissively. "I have my own methods." At his response, the cloaked figure laughed coldly. "I look forward to seeing your methods." Shadows coalesced and enveloped the figure, who then disappeared. Watching the vanishing point, the man's face showed clear distaste. "Avaricious undead. One day, even your bones will be ash!" With a huff, he turned, his gaze sweeping through the forest. He placed a hand on his sword hilt and whistled sharply. A griffin descended, circling to land before him. Simultaneously, three figures emerged silently from the woods. "Find those rats, deal with them," he ordered coldly as he mounted the griffin. Chapter 12: Ring of Will Stealthy silhouettes darted between the dense trees, parting ways only to reunite with practiced precision. "Discovered anything?" "Eastward, residual traces point to our target, seemingly a day old at most." "Their pace is notable. We must proceed with care; we're trailing the one who vanquished the Wind Serpent Sovereign. Underestimation is not an option." "Acknowledged!" With their exchange complete, the trio of shadows dissolved back into the forest's depth, leaving no trace, not even disturbing the slumbering birds above. As the shadows receded, a serene azure Soul Bird perched silently on a branch took flight, ascending to the heavens. "Are we being shadowed?" Rhode's visage grew somber as the Soul Bird relayed its surveillance. Resting on his shoulder, the translucent azure Soul Bird appeared deceptively similar to an ordinary bird, occasionally tilting its head and fluttering its wings. Its spectral form and the elemental light that enveloped it were the only signs of its true, ethereal nature. Rhode had summoned the Soul Bird for reconnaissance, an ingenious solution forged out of necessity. In the absence of scouts or rangers, he relied on his summoned spirits for guidance. The Soul Bird's elevated vantage and innate soul-sensing abilities afforded Rhode a semblance of security. Initially, Rhode had sent the Soul Bird to monitor their trail for dangers following their battle with a formidable level-ten Moon Soul wolf. However, it inadvertently uncovered a more pressing threat. Although soul sensing offered no visual detail, only gauging presence through the intensity of aura glows, the entities' swift, orderly movements through the forest were indicative of no mere wanderers—likely rangers or spies, professions that thrived in secrecy. Was this a chance encounter? Or were they the quarry of a deliberate hunt? Rhode could not afford to speculate. An open clash was one thing, but adversaries who thrived in the shadows posed a far more insidious challenge. Coupled with Lijie Noelle's prior warnings, Rhode sensed an undercurrent of intrigue. If these mysterious pursuers harbored hostility, the ramifications could be severe. However, upon observing Lijie, a spark of strategy ignited within Rhode. "Mr. Rhode, what shall we do next?" Lijie offered the canteen to the fat merchant beside her, his complexion flushed and sweat-drenched from the exertion. While Rhode had kept his plans close to his chest, Lijie had assumed the role of the merchant's caretaker. As she explained, the Star Moon Mercenary Corps had undertaken the task of safeguarding this man, and she was intent on fulfilling that duty to the end, even as the last member standing. Meis, the merchant, was endlessly grateful, but his labored breathing hinted that his endurance might soon falter on their journey. "Mr. Rhode... I'm exhausted... May we... rest for a moment?" As Rhode paused, the merchant had already collapsed to the ground, clutching his bag as though it were a treasure beyond measure. He fetched a handkerchief, mopping the sweat from his luminous face, which under the sun's glare, shone as brightly as a beacon. "By the grace of the Spirit, it's been... years since I've... embarked on... such a journey... cough, cough...!!" His breath hitched, erupting into a violent cough, his cheeks quivering with each bout. After a moment, he regained composure and bemoaned. "I feel... as though death's doorstep is nigh!" "Five minutes to rest." Rhode scanned the sky, swiftly calculating the time and distance that lay ahead, and then decreed a brief respite. At his word, the merchant on the ground let out a wail and fully relinquished himself to the earth's embrace. Lijie breathed out gently and settled onto a stone nearby. No further dangers had assailed them since that encounter. With the Soul Bird leading, Rhode had adeptly navigated them away from many perils. This cautious approach meant forgoing the chance of uncovering rare equipment, but Rhode harbored no regrets. In this world, lacking the teeming multitudes of players found in games, and where ordinary adventurers seldom tread, those treasures would remain untouched until his return. Yet... Rhode's eyes lifted to the mountain range before him, and he stood with resolve. "Lijie." "Yes, Mr. Rhode, what are your orders?" "I'll head forward to scout. After your break, lead Mr. Meis up to that white stone. There, amidst the shadows, you will find a hidden path. Wait for me there; I will follow shortly." Lijie's gaze followed the direction of Rhode's finger, her eyes settling on the white stone upon the mountainside. Her expression, a blend of bewilderment and reliance, turned to Rhode. Without voicing her questions, she nodded, her trust in him having solidified over their shared journey, and she watched as he set off. Rhode had his purpose. The stone marked the gateway to the Zenar Mountain Path, once a thriving trade conduit carved by the hands of northern ancestors. It was a path that had once glimmered with the promise of prosperity. But as the Wind Tide offered a safer passage, the skies clear and unobstructed compared to the treacherous forests, the ancient route fell into disuse. Those who had once depended upon it had long departed in search of better prospects, leaving their homeland to the embrace of the wilderness. The relentless march of civilization often rendered yesterday's miracles obsolete, a universal truth across all worlds. However, Rhode was not there to dwell on history or to ponder philosophical musings. He halted before a scene of desolation and death. Bleached skeletons, half-buried in dust, lay amid decayed leathers and rusted weapons—the last vestiges of the mercenary band "Tiger Fang," caught in an ambush by bandits, their mutual destruction their final legacy. In the game, Rhode would've embarked on a quest from the Mercenary Guild, followed a trail of clues to their last contract, and discovered this grave site before returning with their insignia and treasures to claim his reward. But this was no longer a game, and rigid adherence to such procedures was no longer required. Many seasoned players would circumvent the formalities, simply taking the insignia and reporting directly back to the guild. It was a shortcut that saved time and avoided unnecessary steps. Why not adopt the same approach when the opportunity arose? Yet Rhode's presence here was not driven by a desire to skip a few steps. He moved to stand before the captain's skeletal remains, garbed in tattered steel, lying beside a blackened, rust-streaked sword. That was Rhode's objective—the fallen leader of Tiger Fang. Bending down before the skeleton, Rhode cast a glance at it, then reached out, retrieving a mercenary badge from the bones—a token of "Tiger Fang," and a crucial item for completing their mission. He carefully secured the badge in his pocket, then his eyes narrowed, focusing on his true target. A ring, tarnished and unremarkable, clung to a skeletal finger. Rhode removed the ring with care, which to any casual observer would appear as nothing more than a trinket amidst refuse. The system prompt that emerged, however, revealed a different tale. [Black Iron Ring, Unidentified, Magical Fluctuations Detected] "Resonance." Rhode closed his eyes, gripping the ring in his right hand, and softly commanded. He infused the ring with his soul power, and it began to tremble, awakening its once-dormant magic. As he reopened his eyes, the object in his grasp had undergone a transformation. A black ring, its surface inscribed with archaic patterns, rested quietly in his palm. [Ring of Will, Identified, Activates Mental Barrier, Five Minutes of Immunity to Mental Attacks, Recharge Time—Three Days] The deed was done. Rhode placed the ring upon his finger and released a breath of relief, his eyes scanning the surroundings to ensure nothing of value was overlooked. He then returned to the mountainside. There, he could see Lijie and Meis toiling toward the white stone. The merchant, entirely unversed in the art of climbing, followed Lijie with evident discomfort. His behavior suggested that if not for societal norms, he might have already pleaded for Lijie to bear his weight up the incline. An utter waste. With a dismissive shake of his head, Rhode steeled himself to descend and regroup with them. Yet at that moment, an urgent warning from the Soul Bird echoed within him. "———!" Rhode's pulse quickened as he gazed toward the forest. It wasn't long before he spotted three figures darting out from between the trees. Imminent danger was upon them! Chapter Thirteen: Mist Ruins Three silhouettes ceased their search as two figures perched conspicuously halfway up the mountainside. With unspoken consensus, they charged toward the oblivious duo. Rhode reacted with equal haste. He descended the slope in a swift glide, his sharp whistle summoning the circling Summoned Spirit in the sky. The Spirit Bird plummeted toward the veiled assailants with the ferocity of a released arrow. “—!” The shrouded figures, unshaken by the Spirit Bird’s sudden onslaught, quickly arranged themselves into a defensive formation. One brandished twin swords and surged forward, while the remaining two, undeterred, continued their pursuit of Lijie and Meis. Their precision and clarity of purpose were unmistakable; mere distractions, even those as extraordinary as a Spirit Bird, would not divert them from their target. As the swords clashed with the ethereal bird, a fleeting gleam of triumph illuminated their eyes, only to be replaced by sheer terror—the bird phased right through the blades, its relentless attack unabated! An elemental creature! Caught off guard, one of the figures in black contorted his body in a desperate attempt to evade, narrowly missing the bird’s chilling caress. It grazed his shoulder, sending a numbing cold coursing through him. Balance forsaken, he plummeted to the rocky terrain below, his sword cast aside. The other two fared no better. Their neglect to acknowledge the Spirit Bird’s passage sealed their fate. An icy gale trailed in its wake, rendering their limbs numb and rigid, compelling them to a standstill. Although the numbing chill swiftly faded, the momentary delay was sufficient. Lijie and Meis had reached the sanctuary of the white stone. The lead figure’s frown deepened, and with a strategic hand gesture, he retrieved a crossbow from his belt. “What calamity befalls us?!” The breathless merchant, having labored to reach the midpoint of the ascent, clambered to the white stone at Lijie's behest. Panting heavily, he barely caught his breath before shadows flitted by, crossbow bolts embedding into the stone wall beside him. “Ah!” Meis instinctively ducked, clutching his head, while Lijie, quick to act, reeled the merchant into the shadows, narrowly evading further assault. “We must hasten.” Rhode, who had closely followed, spared a glance at the shadows down below, his tone urgent and commanding. “Who are they, and what has transpired? Why do they assail us?” The merchant's mix of bewilderment and dread filled the air. “Likely spies.” Rhode’s gaze sharpened, recognizing the attire characteristic of spies under the mandate of the Guardian of the Light Dragon Soul's Bearer. Their national allegiance would be unveiled only upon their defeat. Yet, at this moment, Rhode was at a disadvantage. The Spirit Bird’s ephemeral stalling of the foes was testament to his own constraints. Their resistance to elemental strikes was not the issue; rather, it was his insufficient level that muted his offensive efficacy. Delay would serve them no benefit. “As for why they attack us, perhaps you might inquire directly—should they be inclined to enlighten a man in his final moments.” Rhode’s attempt at levity did little to allay the merchant's burgeoning panic, well aware of the spies’ infamous brutality. The mere thought of their merciless reputation spurred him onward, fatigue ignored, as he rose and followed Rhode toward the obscured path behind the white stone. Zenar Mountain Path, once a glorious trade route wide enough for two carriages to proceed side by side, now lay forsaken. Rockfall from the surrounding cliffs littered the path, transforming its once grand expanse into a treacherous maze. The trio navigated forward, stumbling yet undeterred. Rhode glanced back intermittently, their situation growing more dire by the moment—the echo of their pursuers’ footsteps growing ever more distinct. If not for the natural defenses of the terrain, they would have been surrounded long ago. “Mr. Rhode, there is no path ahead!” Lijie’s alarmed shout drew Rhode’s attention to a daunting blockade—a landslide had made the path ahead impassable. Predictable, indeed. Rhode shook his head, his earlier belief that such obstacles in the game were meant to funnel players along a pre-set path now challenged by the harsh reality before him— But such thoughts would have to wait. “Take the path to the right.” “Right?” Both Lijie and Meis cast doubtful glances toward the direction Rhode indicated, their steps momentarily hesitant. Though the main route was blocked, a narrow path shrouded in dense mist beckoned them. Despite the clarity of the skies above, this path was enshrouded in an otherworldly fog, creating an atmosphere of eerie foreboding. The sight alone was enough to suggest hidden dangers, and yet, it was into this unknown that Rhode now directed them. “Quickly, time is short.” His tone, brooking no opposition, spurred them into the mist, their figures soon swallowed by its opaque embrace. Once the two were veiled within, Rhode breathed a sigh of relief before confronting the imminent threat. Extending his hand, he summoned his arcane power. “Cage!” From his palm emerged the card, transitioning from green to white, and with it, the Stardust Sword materialized. Firmly grasping the weapon, he flung it towards the cliff face. The Blade of Radiance, unleashed from the sword, collided with a precarious boulder above. A thunderous rumble followed as fractured stones cascaded downwards in a tumultuous avalanche. By the time the black-clad figures caught up, Rhode had already disappeared into the fog’s enigmatic depths. “Cursed be the Dragon Soul!” One spat out, eyeing the devastated path ahead. Their route was thoroughly obstructed, utterly impassable. Rhode’s strike had triggered a chain reaction; the cliffs quivered ominously on either side—pressing forward now bordered on recklessness. “What is our next course?” “There is none to take.” Another figure in black fixated on the sealed path with a grim acceptance. “We must report back to the leader and keep watch over all nearby villages. They seek to slip away unnoticed, yet these cunning adversaries have outwitted us.” “An elemental creature? Could there be a mage in their midst?” “Should there be a mage, it would be less baffling, yet our observations suggest none such.” As the two exchanged conjectures, a third, until now silent, gazed intently upon the cliffside markings and declared, “Among them is a swordsman of considerable prowess.” With determination, he turned to leave. “Let us hasten. Our quarry is formidable, and the hunt is far from concluded. Send the orders to monitor the adjacent villages—they cannot remain concealed within these mountains indefinitely.” For Rhode and his companions, the perils had not subsided. “What place is this?” The merchant's voice, laden with awe and bewilderment, underscored the breadth of his ignorance. His travels had shown him much, but nothing had prepared him for the vast unknown now revealed. Beyond the mist lay a deserted town, its desolation enshrouded by a dense fog that blurred all lines of sight. The gray veil aloft had erased the clarity of the sky, as if they had stepped into a wholly different plane. “This is the Mist Ruins.” Rhode's explanation was succinct. “By traversing this place, we will reach the Alagak Mountain Pass, and thereafter, we can depart from this forlorn land.” “Is there peril here?” The merchant's inquiry, tinged with trepidation, was inevitable. “Danger is ever-present.” Rhode acknowledged bluntly. Within the game, the Mist Ruins were the inaugural ten-level instance for parties of five—an initial challenge for many. Not insurmountable, yet by no means trivial. For their group of three, the challenge was formidable. With Rhode at level eight, Lijie at merely level six, and the merchant's negligible combat prowess, they were effectively a level eight Summoner Swordsman and a support character embarking on a solo venture through a ten-level instance—an endeavor that, in the confines of the game, would be regarded as folly. Rhode was no simpleton; this strategy was spawned from necessity. Without Lijie's capabilities, he would not have chosen this route—now, it represented their safest avenue amidst the looming threats. “Nevertheless, if you comply with my directives, we can mitigate the risks. Therefore...” He paused, his gaze shifting to the golden-haired girl at his side. “Lijie, the onus falls upon you now.” Chapter Fourteen: Strategy for Two 'Me?' Lijie's eyes widened in surprise at Rhode's words, and even Mr. Meis gaped in astonishment beside her. It was common knowledge that on the Dragon Soul Continent, Spirit Masters were akin to pharmacists, doctors, and nurses, primarily serving in supportive roles within a team—healing wounds, casting protective spells, and dispelling toxins were their usual tasks. Taking to the front lines for combat? Such a notion was practically unheard of. 'Exactly,' Rhode nodded with affirmation, feeling once again like the seasoned commander who had led teams through dungeon raids. 'You will follow my commands shortly. It doesn't require complex techniques, but it does demand quick reflexes and awareness. It might take some getting used to, but I believe you'll manage... How well can you control energy? And how often are you able to use Sacred Radiance?' Rhode had a rough estimate of Lijie's level based on her previous healing spells but wanted to be certain. 'I am a qualified Spirit Master of the Seventh Outer Ring. As for Sacred Radiance... It can be cast once per day, and its effect lasts for a full day, provided my soul power isn't overly drained.' Unlike combat professionals, casters were classified by their mastery over soul power, segmented into the Outer, Middle, and Inner Rings, each with ten, seven, and three levels, respectively. Casters believed their strength stemmed from deep within their souls, imagined as three interlocking rings. The deeper a caster probed into their soul, the more potent their power became. Lijie's current level at the Seventh Outer Ring suggested she might soon break through the upper limit of Outer Ring casters and ascend to the Middle Rings—an impressive prospect for a sixth-tier Spirit Master. This insight gave Rhode further confidence. 'Good. Remember, don't cast Healing Light on me from now on, even if I get injured. Pay more attention to Mr. Meis and shield him if he's in danger... Understood?' 'That... Yes, Mr. Rhode.' Despite some of Rhode's phrases puzzling Lijie, she grasped his intent, nodding subtly to indicate her understanding. 'Mr. Meis, how long will our supplies last?' 'Three to four days at most,' Mr. Meis pondered, clutching his travel bag, then answered with a touch of stoicism. 'If we ration our food...' 'This could be a good opportunity to diet.' If Rhode had spoken with a trace of humor, Mr. Meis might have taken it as a joke. However, Rhode's expression was solemn, stirring further concern in Mr. Meis. As he held onto his bag, about to raise more issues, Rhode had already turned to issue Lijie her command. 'Cast Sacred Radiance.' 'Understood.' Following Mr. Rhode's order, Lijie nodded slightly, extended her hands, and closed her eyes. A gentle light began to emanate from the center of her palms, spreading a warm, white glow all around. Mr. Meis noticed the encroaching fog retreating before the light. After a double-take, the previously obscured surroundings had become much clearer. Ruins that were once shadowy outlines now revealed their fractured walls and structures. The newfound visibility was a welcome relief; visibility was, after all, a potential lifesaver. 'I'll take the lead, Lijie, follow me. Mr. Meis, stay in the rear but keep close. No matter what happens, don't act alone.' Silence enveloped the ruins as they progressed under Rhode's lead, pausing regularly to survey their surroundings before proceeding. It wasn't long before Rhode gestured for a halt. If his memory was correct, they were nearing the first wave of lesser creature spawns. As expected, a cluster of dim lights began to twinkle through the fog ahead, resembling eyes in the darkness. 'What are those?' Mr. Meis grew tense at the sight. 'Wraiths,' Rhode stated calmly as Star Scar materialized in his hand. 'Be vigilant—they tend to maintain their distance.' No sooner had he spoken than the fog surged, revealing three ethereal forms. They had human-like shapes but were entirely shrouded in a dense mist. Clustered together, their boundaries were indistinct; only their glowing eyes made it clear that these were more than mere mists—perhaps even more ominous. 'Lijie, cast Healing Light on the first one.' Healing Light? The command left Lijie briefly perplexed; it was a restorative spell, so why use it against such beings? However, her confusion was fleeting, and she raised her hand, casting the spell on the creature before her. As a Spirit Master, her skill was unquestionable. Healing Light was a mid-range healing spell, simple to cast with a clear target. For Lijie, it was particularly effortless, despite hesitating because her target was not an ally but a creature. Yet, she completed the spell swiftly. A stream of pure white light cascaded from above, enveloping the wraith. Normally, this light would heal wounds and revive spirits—a fundamental ability in a Spirit Master's skill set. But the wraith's reaction was entirely unexpected. As the white light shrouded it, the wraith let out a piercing cry that even Lijie could clearly hear. Its previously erect form bent over, wracked with convulsions. The mist that had cloaked its body began to disintegrate instantly, dissipating as ice does under the sun's rays. Lijie was taken aback, glancing at her hands in disbelief, unable to fathom how she had released such a destructive force. However, Rhode was unperturbed. Healing Light's inherent positive energy was the bane of negative energy entities like wraiths. Moreover, Lijie's angelic heritage amplified this effect—the positive energy she produced was naturally of a higher caliber than that of an average human. To a wraith, an ordinary person's positive energy was like boiling water, whereas Lijie's was akin to concentrated sulfuric acid. Fortunately for the wraiths, Lijie was only a half-angel. If she had been a pure angel, the wraith would have been extinguished instantly. Lijie didn't understand why a healing spell could have such an effect, but the players of the Dragon Soul Continent knew all too well. Healing Light, in essence, was a conduit of positive energy, thus named because it healed the living. But this did not mean it was restricted to mending wounds. In the game's early days, a Necromancer's tragic fate became a running joke among players: the misfortune of encountering an undead horde—since their spells of negative energy, when cast upon undead of similar composition, would heal rather than harm. This led many a Necromancer, who had once dreamt of dominating with an army of the dead, to begrudgingly learn elemental spells to maintain their advantage against undead foes. Sometimes, they even had to take on the role of healers. In truth, Necromancers and Spirit Masters weren't so different. They each thrived in environments where their powers were ineffective against their own kind, only coming into their element against opposing attributes. For Necromancers, encounters with the living were more common, while for Spirit Masters, such interactions were rare until the midpoint of the Dark Descent War when the undead became rampant, propelling them to the forefront as valiant fighters. Before then, the likelihood of a Spirit Master encountering an undead was minimal, and it was unsurprising that NPCs, unlike players, lacked such extensive knowledge and adhered to tradition. But now was not the time for tradition. 'Attack the remaining two!' Rhode, empowered by Shadow Flash, charged towards the nearest wraith while directing Lijie. 'Yes!' Perhaps inspired by the unfolding scene, Lijie's response was filled with newfound determination. Two more surges of abundant positive energy descended, each striking a different wraith. The gentle light halted their advance, and seizing the moment, Rhode—enhanced by Shadow Flash—faced the lead wraith. '———!' In torment from the radiant energy, the wraith shrieked in fury, marking Rhode as its foe. It lunged, ghostly claws swiping swiftly at him. Lijie's spell had weakened their defenses, yet their offensive capabilities had correspondingly increased. Any lapse in judgment could lead to a dire outcome. But Rhode would not allow such a misfortune to occur. He gracefully dodged the spectral claws, missing by mere inches, and his sword, aglow with purity, pivoted and thrust forward, landing a precise blow. Vital Strike! Star Scar accurately impaled the wraith's core, its semi-tangible Soul Condensate. Suffering under the celestial energy's assault, the wraith lifted its claws in one final act of defiance before its form, already on the edge of disintegration, collapsed entirely into a cloud of dissipating dust. At that moment, the other two wraiths launched their attack. Chapter Fififteen: Deep into the Ruins *Sigh...* Rhode surveyed the expanse of Ling Chen (spirit dust) at his feet and wiped the sweat from his brow, feeling the onset of fatigue. Their journey had been fraught with spectral confrontations—no fewer than fifteen wraiths had accosted them. Such numbers would be a trifle for a well-rounded party of five, but Rhode’s forces were scant, devoid of a tank to draw fire, leaving the tactic of a full-frontal assault, typical in dungeon crawls, out of the question. Instead, Rhode had to carefully lure each adversary, allowing Lijie Noelle to weaken the undead with her Healing Light so he could dispatch them with swift, precise strikes. Since wraiths were at the very least level ten elites, even those with reduced defenses posed a significant challenge. To maximize his damage output, Rhode not only took advantage of his Star Scar sword's attribute bonuses but also endeavored to target each enemy's vulnerabilities with every thrust and slash. Humans are not machines, immune to fatigue. Even in the realm of a game, such demanding combat could drain one's energy, and now Rhode was exerting his very flesh and blood. In the virtual world, one could simply respawn and retry, but here, failure could mean an inexorable fall into the maw of death. The gravity of his situation was nearly too much for Rhode to shoulder. He lifted his eyes to the mist-enshrouded ruins around him and, only after ensuring no further threats lingered, allowed himself a brief respite. "Mr. Rhode, should we rest for a moment?" The girl following him looked on with concern. As a Spirit Master, she might not understand the significance behind each of Rhode's actions, but she could sense the pressure mounting on him. "No... Not yet..." Rhode shook his head, dismissing the thought. They had cleared the area of lesser foes, yet a subtle sense of danger persisted. He scanned the ruins, shrouded in fog, but the source of this faint dread eluded him. By their current location, they should not have been near the boss's domain and thus not at immediate risk. Furthermore, Rhode was well-versed in the undead distribution of this area, which should have been cleared already. Whence, then, did this ominous feeling stem? Once more, Rhode's gaze swept the surroundings, finding nothing. It was then that the corpulent merchant beside them suddenly cried out. "Ah!" "What's wrong?" Rhode and Lijie Noelle turned swiftly, only to see Meis, ashen-faced, clutching his travel bag and pointing a trembling hand into the fog behind them. "There, a shadow... just now..." "A shadow?" Lijie Noelle's gaze followed Meis's direction, but within the mist, she could discern nothing beyond the dim sunlight. "I see nothing..." "Get down!" In that moment, Rhode's mind lit up with realization, and he finally understood the nature of the lurking danger. He shouted a warning while forcing Lijie Noelle's head down in one swift motion. *Whoosh!* Almost instantly, a dark silhouette streaked overhead. Rhode could feel the icy brush of the gargoyle's talons grazing his scalp, even causing a sharp sting. Cursed be the fates! In that moment, Rhode's heart sank; he recognized the harbinger of danger—a gargoyle! According to local lore, the Mist Ruins had once been a bustling settlement that fell into desolation with the decline of its trade routes. Later, a mage seeking to revive his beloved ventured into the forbidden necromantic arts within the now-abandoned town. The mage's experiments ended in tragedy, and with his death, the town succumbed to a miasma of death magic that spawned the thick mists and the legion of undead. Of all the creatures in the dungeon, the most perilous were the gargoyles left behind as guardians of the mage's relics—a rare elite of level fifteen! In the game world, Rhode would have welcomed such a rare encounter—a coveted prize often eluding even the most persistent parties through numerous dungeon attempts. But in this harsh reality, a chill clutched at Rhode's heart. Here was a level fifteen rare elite, and worse, a creature of flight. Its agility was daunting enough, but the gargoyle bore little resemblance to the intangible wraiths formed from negative energy. Lijie Noelle's holy magics would find no purchase against it. And with an obsidian shell nearly impenetrable, most physical attacks would barely scratch it. They were headed for a grueling battle! Rhode had navigated the Mist Ruins over thirty times in-game without ever crossing paths with a gargoyle. The possibility had slipped from his mind, but now, on his first venture into this world, fate had cruelly thrown such an adversary in his path—was this a stroke of luck or a twisted jest? The matter was of little consequence now. The shadow of death was upon them. A direct confrontation was out of the question. Not yet at level ten, Rhode was ill-prepared to face a level fifteen colossus. Even with Star Scar's enhancements, his attack power was limited. "Make haste!" Without a moment's hesitation, Rhode issued the command. Seizing Lijie Noelle's hand, he instructed, "Follow my lead, keep low, and do not look up!" Retreat was no longer an option. Their sole recourse was to locate the gargoyle's control core and destroy it. Though fleeing its attack radius was an alternative, a quick assessment of his current allies afforded little confidence in their ability to distract the fiend—a ranger or rogue would have been invaluable now. But there was no time for regrets. Under Rhode's guidance, Lijie Noelle and Meis pressed on, heads down, as the surrounding fog churned anew. Their movements had attracted notice; four or five wraiths emerged from the mist, converging on their position. "Lijie Noelle, cast your spells! Don't relent!" "Yes, sir!" Despite the challenge of spellcasting while in motion, Lijie Noelle persevered, extending her hand as successive bursts of purifying light descended upon the wraiths. Rhode then unsheathed his blade, its dance through the air silencing the advancing wraiths, reducing the obstructing specters to ash. Amid the tumult, a system alert flickered before Rhode's eyes. [Experience Points 1900/1800, Level Up Available, Level 8] Yet such trivialities were of no concern to Rhode now. The number of wraiths was multiplying, and though the sacred radiance slowed their advance, their sheer volume was overwhelming. In stark contrast to these sluggish phantoms, the gargoyle was utterly impervious to the divine light. A manifestation of negative energy it may be, but as the mage's sentinel, the gargoyle's obsidian shell was a bastion against the holy. Having missed its initial strike, the gargoyle marked the party as its quarry, shadowing their every move, biding its time to strike—a testament to the peril of foes endowed with a semblance of battle acumen. "Agh!" Amidst the chaos, Meis faltered, tumbling to the ground. The ever-vigilant gargoyle seized the moment, its talons descending like a bolt from the blue upon the prone merchant. As Meis turned, facing his end, all he saw was the looming shadow about to engulf him. "My God..." Swift though the gargoyle's assault was, and though Meis had resignedly shut his eyes to embrace the end, its attack was thwarted—a diaphanous shield aglow with golden light materialized, thwarting the gargoyle's talons. Then, a volley of luminous blades rained from the heavens, striking the gargoyle with force. Resounding 'smack' sounds echoed as the creature, caught off-guard, was flung backward into the throng of wraiths. In that moment, Lijie Noelle, with a blend of support and urgency, hoisted the merchant—who had nearly resigned to meet his kin in the afterlife—back to his feet, and together, they hastened onward. "This way!" Amid the wraiths' encirclement, Rhode at length outmaneuvered the majority of the undead. Raising his gaze, he quickly identified his target—a forsaken chapel, the mage's former sanctum, and, as Rhode recalled, the locus of the gargoyle's control core. But such a sanctum was not to be breached lightly. As Rhode neared the chapel's threshold, a shadow fell across his vision. On reflex, he invoked Shadow Flash, recoiling just as a gargoyle landed where he had stood mere moments prior, its talon smashing the flagstones to rubble. "To think it's come to this..." An inward curse escaped Rhode as he swiftly surveyed the scene only to confirm his suspicion: the statues that once graced the chapel's facade were now conspicuously absent. Their current whereabouts? Quite apparent. To have encountered not one, but two such guardians—fortune indeed had a twisted sense of humor. Perhaps he would find luck in the lottery, should he live to see another day. "Inside, find the control device!" Rhode's voice rang with command as he held the gargoyle's gaze. "The wraiths likely won't pursue you within. I'll handle these two; seize the chance to infiltrate and locate the control core. Destroy it, and be wary of traps." "But... Mr. Rhode..." "That's an order." Rhode's tone brooked no argument. Clutching Star Scar, he thrust forward, unleashing a blinding arc of light. The gargoyle screeched, taking to the air to evade his strike, inadvertently clearing the path to the chapel. "Now, go!" Chapter 16: Awakening the Talent Tree Shadows danced in the air, black and white intertwining, igniting brilliant sparks. "Whoa!" Rhode hastily retreated, his blade a quivering streak of white, as the force of the blow reverberated through it, leaving his upper body tingling with pain. True to Rhode's recollection, the level fifteen Gargoyles were formidable adversaries, more so when there were two. Their semblance of battle wisdom was a double-edged sword; it made them cautious but less of a threat, especially since the one that had tasted the sting of the Shattered Blade recoiled at the mere sight of the white glow on Rhode's sword. Its companion, unscathed but wary, mirrored the retreat, granting Rhode a precious moment to breathe. But this reprieve was fleeting. Gripping the Star Scar, Rhode braced himself, his gaze fixed on the Gargoyles circling above. They hesitated to engage directly, wary of his Shattered Blade, but Rhode knew they wouldn't relent easily. This standoff wouldn't last; it was a matter of when, not if, their assaults would resume. At level eight, Rhode had maxed out his Moonshadow Swordsmanship proficiency, and while the Shattered Blade now consumed less soul power, frequent use still risked depletion. He had to conserve energy, anticipating further unexpected trials ahead. He was the trio's sole combatant—if his strength waned here, dire straits would follow. The Gargoyles didn't just loom ominously; they dove and clawed, swiftly retreating before Rhode could counter. This relentless hit-and-run was a true test of endurance, trivial for magic-driven constructs but grueling for Rhode. Sweat trickled down his brow; fatigue crept in with each parry and dodge. Rhode couldn't afford to fall back. Tackling two Gargoyles alone was a fool's errand; his hopes lay with Lijie. After all, the church held no significant peril—or so he had assumed. Had he neglected to warn them about the protective magic circles? Shrugging off the thought, Rhode refocused on the imminent threat of the Gargoyles. Nobody would die, after all. "Aaargh!" Meis's 'agonizing' scream echoed as he collapsed, convulsing on the ground. "I'm dying! Save me! Save me!" "It's merely a shock! You haven't perished, Mr. Meis." Lijie, unfazed amidst the dust and cobwebs, cast a Healing Light over her shoulder without a glance, soothing Meis's pain. She then resumed her diligent search. Protective spells were common in a mage's sanctum, but with the church's long neglect and the passage of time, their potency had waned. Lijie's half-angelic nature lent her significant magic resistance; the once-lethal traps now fizzled out harmlessly under her touch. Poor Mr. Meis, lacking her resilience, restored some dignity to the traps with his reactions. "This accursed place..." Meis grumbled, dusting himself off and rising to his feet. The dim church was lit only by Lijie's Sacred Radiance, casting light on a world shrouded in darkness. Meis, heart racing, could see the eerie magic circles and bones strewn across the floor, while the bloodstains on the walls nearly sent him fleeing at their entrance. If not for Lijie's calm and his own fear of the dangers outside, he would have fled. Now, he reluctantly joined her in scouring the mess for the elusive 'Control Core.' How could they find anything in this chaos? Wiping off dust, Meis continued his hushed search alongside Lijie, who remained fixated on her task. Back with Rhode, the battle intensified. "———!" The Gargoyle's screech heralded its dive. Rhode pivoted, narrowly evading its talons, but this time, the Gargoyle didn't retreat. Instead, it spun, its muscular tail lashing out! Rhode's heart sank at the sound of the approaching strike. He spun, sword raised in defense. The impact was immediate and massive, bending the blade and hurtling him across the ground, his body tumbling before coming to a stop. "Whoa!" Rhode rose, his head spinning, his limbs numb. He nearly dropped his sword, fighting to steady his reeling senses. But the soft hiss from behind sent a surge of adrenaline through him. "Sss..." A cold breath touched his neck, and instinctively, he rolled away, narrowly avoiding the strike. When he looked up, three Wraiths loomed, creeping closer. The Gargoyle's strike had not harmed him, but it had cast him to the barrier's edge, where the Wraiths, hindered by the enchantment, couldn't approach the church. Yet, they hadn't dispersed, lurking near the invisible barrier, waiting. Now, they saw their chance. Rhode wouldn't oblige them. Gritting his teeth, he released his hold on conserving power. A brilliant white light erupted from his sword, streaking forward. The Blade of Light cut through the air, dispersing and striking a Wraith, shattering its defenses. Without hesitation, Rhode lunged forward, his sword tracing a perfect arc through the air, piercing the Wraith's core. As the doomed Wraith screamed and disintegrated, Rhode had already crossed through it, back within the safety of the barrier. What next? A system prompt before Rhode brought a moment of clarity. [Experience Points 4000/1800, level up available, Talent Tree unlocked, Level 8] I've attained level ten? But before entering the Mist Ruins, wasn't I only level eight? Rhode was momentarily stunned, then recalled the system prompt indicating enough experience to level up during the Gargoyle ambush, which he had disregarded in the heat of battle. It seems the Wraiths he had slain en route provided ample experience for another level. It was no surprise—this was a five-person instance, with Rhode reaping all the experience. His low level and the bonus for defeating higher-level monsters made reaching level ten plausible. The existence of experience points in this world was the real curiosity. But this was not the time for such musings. Rhode swiftly accessed his attributes and made his choice. It was his chance to gain an upper hand. [Experience Points 4000/1800, level up available, Talent Tree unlocked, Level 8] [Experience Points 2200/2000, level up available, Talent Tree unlocked, Skill Points gained: 1, Level 9] [Experience Points 200/2500, Talent Tree unlocked, Skill Points gained: 2, Level 10] [Activate Talent System?] "Activate!" With no hesitation, Rhode made his choice. In an instant, three distinct Talent Trees unfolded before him. In Dragon Soul Continent, each class is granted three talent paths upon reaching level ten. Players can specialize or mix and match talents for optimal synergy. Skill Points, scarce and valuable, dictate these choices. Players often struggle with this decision. Each level awards a single Skill Point, and even beyond Talent Trees, mastering swordplay or spellcraft demands a bounty of these points. But players in the mid-tier realm can supplement their Skill Points with 'Awakening Scrolls' and high-difficulty tasks. Rhode's Summoner Swordsman class offered three paths: 'Summoning Master,' 'Soul Messenger,' and 'Hell Lord.' 'Summoning Master' augments the number of spirits summoned. 'Soul Messenger' bolsters their power. 'Hell Lord' turns non-human foes into undead summoned spirits—a macabre but potent choice. To some, the decision was daunting, but Rhode had spent seven years mastering his class. His strategies were the gold standard, textbooks for his fellow Summoner Swordsmen. For many, the Talent Tree was a crossroads of possibilities. For Rhode, the path was clear the moment the tree appeared. Chapter Seventeen: Summoning Master Summoner Swordsman's First Principle—Never face the enemy alone at any time. [Expends 1 Skill Point to enhance Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 1/5, Proficiency C—Moon Splendor Unlocked] [Expends 1 Skill Point to select Talent—Summoning Master Awakening] [Summoning Master's First-Tier Talent Unlocked: Soul Resonance (character can summon additional spirits for every ten levels), Mind's Call (shares senses with summons, extending the duration of mental link), Structural Harmony (enables fusion of two spirits)] [Acquires permanent skill: Soul Resonance LV1 (character can summon +1 Spirit for every ten levels)] [Summoned Spirits +1] As the last system message faded, a massive shadow darted across Rhode's peripheral vision. Yet he did not retreat or show any fear. On the contrary, Rhode lifted his longsword and swung it mightily forward. 'Swish!' A verdant silhouette shot out rapidly from the blade, pouncing towards the swooping gargoyle. The Spirit Bird. [Note: 'Spirit Bird' refers to '灵魂之鸟' from the glossary] Rhode's predicament lay in his inability to summon more than one entity at a time, and the Star Scar, serving as his weapon, was one of the summons. Most Summoner Swordsmen, like their conventional counterparts, wield a 'standard' weapon. Rhode was an outlier, having pondered over using a more typical weapon, yet the allure of the Star Scar's attribute enhancements was too compelling to relinquish. Its unique properties allowed him to vanquish adversaries of comparable and even superior levels with ease, amassing an abundance of experience in the early stages. However, this also meant Rhode could not employ the characteristic combat style of Summoner Swordsmen, which involved simultaneous attacks with their summons. To an observer, he resembled more a classic swordsman than a summoner. This unfamiliarity was uncomfortable for Rhode, yet unavoidable. If he were to summon the Spirit Bird, he would have to forego the Star Scar, rendering him defenseless. As a swordsman and not a mage, Rhode couldn't simply stand back and do nothing. To wield the Star Scar meant to seal the Spirit Bird, which didn't bode well for him as engaging in combat like a regular swordsman wasn't ideal. Summoner Swordsmen faced a major disadvantage compared to traditional swordsmen—their occupational penalty: all sword techniques proficiency -1. This meant that while a traditional swordsman could reach SSS proficiency, the Summoner Swordsman, despite their diligence, could only reach SS. The starting point was also different for both. A traditional swordsman's initial proficiency levels were all D. In contrast, Rhode's proficiency as a Summoner Swordsman started at E. This was the disparity that had made his battles in this world toilsome. Without the Star Scar and his knowledge of the Dragon Soul Continent, he would have likely been in dire straits. His comfort in having a summon always at his side in battle was missing, and this new state brought considerable pressure. Now, having unlocked the 'Summoning Master' talent, Rhode felt the burden lift. It's true that Summoner Swordsmen lacked the solo offensive power of their traditional counterparts, but they never fought alone. When the Spirit Bird charged, the gargoyle hesitated, sensing the magic within but its rudimentary AI failed to identify the threat. It saw the Spirit Bird as a foe and lashed out. But this time, the gargoyle found nothing but air. As it thought it made contact, the once solid form dispersed like a snowball hit by a gust of wind, leaving only a trail of air slipping through its claws. Rhode, however, was quick to follow. With his sword, he unleashed a burst of silvery light. A crescent of moonlight, the third skill of Moonshadow Swordsmanship—Moon Splendor. Similar to the Shattered Blade in condensing sword energy, its effects differed—the Shattered Blade projected a Blade of Light forward, powerful and penetrating, yet its narrow scope made evasion simple. Moon Splendor's crescent sweep threatened a vast area, making it challenging to dodge. As expected, the gargoyle tried to dodge the incoming blade light by flapping its wings, but it was too slow. The silver arc struck its right wing, scattering pieces of stone as the gargoyle lost balance. But the fight wasn't over. As it tried to stabilize, Rhode advanced, gesturing with his left hand. The Spirit Bird, which had evaded the gargoyle by turning into a breeze, reappeared behind it. With a piercing cry, it slammed into the gargoyle's back, the wind's momentum sending the creature flying. Enraged yet unable to express its fury, the gargoyle was bombarded by a succession of gleaming blades. One, two, three. The spinning Shattered Blades precisely hit the gargoyle's wounded wing. Even obsidian couldn't endure the successive strikes, and as the gargoyle withstood the barrage, its wing cracked and shattered. With its wing destroyed, the gargoyle crashed, creating a crater in the stone floor. Outnumbering and overpowering, the merger of quantity and quality—such was a Summoner Swordsman's approach. Rhode had rediscovered his natural combat rhythm. If he held a standard weapon now, with 'Summoning Master' activated, controlling two summons at once would be possible, and not even Bosses would be safe from his relentless assault. Alas, the world offered no 'ifs', and Rhode lacked a second Soul Core to awaken another spirit. He reluctantly ceased his pursuit, retreating as another gargoyle dived at him. Angered by its ally's injury, this gargoyle attacked with vengeance. But Rhode, now able to summon the Spirit Bird, had no intention of a direct confrontation. Facing the shadow that once troubled him, he simply whistled. A gust of wind erupted, diverting the shadow's attack and leaving it to crash into the church wall in confusion. Rhode wouldn't waste such an advantageous moment. Under his command, an azure cyclone rose, and the bird took flight once more towards its foe. Roles reversed—those who lorded above were now like beaten hounds, and Rhode, once under duress, now sang victoriously, gaining the upper hand. He strategically coordinated with the Spirit Bird, keeping the gargoyles apart, ensuring a 'two-on-one' advantage at all times, preventing the other from aiding its companion. Though the tide had turned momentarily, Rhode couldn't press for a decisive victory. His energy was already spent, and unlike in the game where leveling up meant an instant revival, reality offered no such luxury. Leveling up to ten and unlocking talents only added to his existing soul power. With just this, defeating the gargoyles was out of reach. Controlling two summons further drained his soul power, and Rhode had to conserve energy or risk complete exhaustion. Given the level discrepancy and the gargoyles' formidable defenses, Rhode's attacks had only managed to shatter a wing, inflicting no severe damage. Going all out could eliminate one gargoyle, but then he'd face the other unarmed—a predictable outcome. Rhode's only option was to suppress the nuisances and await Lijie and Meis to locate the 'Control Core'. Otherwise, he'd revert to his prior predicament. '——!' Despite one wing down, the gargoyle remained a threat. On the ground, it was like a dark stone hound, its limbs propelling it forward like a spectral runner. This was the horror of alchemical creatures; mistaking them as mere aerial show-offs would prove costly. Fortunately, Rhode's knowledge ran deep. He wasn't naive to think that grounding them was enough to control them, but it eased his burden, no longer concerning himself with overhead threats. The dark figure lunged at Rhode from behind, its right claw aiming for his back. But Rhode sidestepped, his sword turning into a bolt of lightning, just deflecting the strike. Simultaneously, Rhode signaled with his left hand, and the circling Spirit Bird, heeding the gesture, blocked the other gargoyle's aerial attack. While the Spirit Bird couldn't harm the Rare Elite gargoyle significantly, as a pure elemental, it faced no great difficulty in obstructing. Time ticked on, and Rhode's anxiety mounted. He felt fatigue creeping in, a sign his soul power neared depletion. Inside the church, all was quiet—had they not found the Control Core? 'Whoo!' The piercing wind alarmed Rhode, who instinctively dodged, attempting to use Shadow Flash, but as he moved, he stumbled, and the skill failed to activate. His soul power was running dry! This realization sank Rhode's heart. Without time for further thought, he spun and thrust his sword. The stone claw clashed with the white blade, screeching on impact. The gargoyle, missing its mark, retreated, and Rhode couldn't give chase. Then, suddenly, a voice echoed from behind. 'Mr. Rhode! We've found it!!' Chapter Eighteen: Heart of the Gargoyle 'Mr. Rhode! We have found it!' Hearing this, Rhode turned around to see Meis standing at the church entrance, his face lit with excitement. He triumphantly held up a small statue, exquisitely carved to depict a gargoyle coiled in repose, its eyes—crafted from ruby fragments—emitting a faint dark red glow. That was the Gargoyle Control Core! Meis's shout caught the attention of the gargoyles. As alchemical creatures, they knew what he held, and two of them quickly changed direction, barreling toward Meis. 'Ah!' Seeing the monstrous creatures charge at him, Meis let out a frightened yelp. Instinctively, he was about to flee, but at that moment, Rhode's voice reached him. 'Throw it here!' Despite the terror wrought by the approaching gargoyles, Meis gathered his courage and tossed the ornate black statue. Regrettably, the merchant's aim was off. The object he hurled arced through the air, straying from its intended path and whizzing past the gargoyles. To an uninformed observer, it might seem as if the rotund merchant was in league with the stone beasts. The gargoyles, momentarily baffled by this unexpected delivery, nonetheless reached out reflexively to grasp the tiny statue. But just as one was about to seize it, a breeze whisked underneath it. The nearly insubstantial Soul Bird, leaving a series of half-transparent ripples in its wake, deftly intercepted the statue. This was Rhode's final reserve of strength. Completely drained, he had to sheathe his sword, and with his right hand, he snapped his fingers. Accompanying this gesture, the Soul Bird traced an elegant arc in the sky and then flew towards Rhode. Realizing their prize was escaping, the gargoyles abruptly ceased their chase and shifted their course. 'Swish!' The gargoyle skimming along the ground flipped over, its thick, muscular tail whipping out fiercely and striking the Soul Bird. Although the attack didn't inflict significant damage, the Wind Elemental Attribute enveloping the bird wavered slightly, causing the bird's trajectory to wobble. Unyielding, the Soul Bird continued to beat its wings, skimming rapidly over the ground, striving to reach its master. But its journey was cut short. A stony claw descended from on high, piercing through the Soul Bird's body. The Wind Elemental could no longer sustain the bird's form, and it immediately dissipated into its most primal state, vanishing into thin air. The black statue, which had been secured in the bird's beak, was now hurtling through the air. However, two dark figures swiftly gave chase, their claws outstretched and jaws agape, reaching for the statue—until it serenely and steadily settled into Rhode's awaiting hand. [Item Acquired: Gargoyle Control Core - Identification Complete] [Command——] 'Aig!' Though Rhode's voice was soft, almost a whisper, it carried a profound authority. The shadows that had been on the attack stopped instantly—their once glowing bodies dimming and becoming lifeless in the blink of an eye. Their outstretched limbs froze mid-air, and the ghoulish red glow that had once illuminated the gargoyle's faces flickered out. Then, the two shadows swept past Rhode, crashing heavily onto the ground behind him. 'Boom!!!' With the collision, the gargoyles, now devoid of momentum, reverted to their original statuesque forms. They lay in silence on the ground behind Rhode, still posed as if leaping forward. Without the support of magic, they were no longer as resilient as they had been. After the impact, the gargoyles crumbled, transforming from artistic sculptures into useless debris. 'Sigh...' Only then did Rhode allow himself a sigh of relief. He felt utterly drained, his legs weak, his fingers barely able to clench the statue. Despite his fatigue, Rhode maintained a calm exterior. He stood silently for a moment before stowing the statue away. 'Mr. Rhode!' At that moment, Lijie and Meis hastened to his side, their expressions filled with concern and anxiety. 'Are you alright?' 'I am fine.' Rhode took a deep breath, yearning for a moment of rest. The excessive use of soul power had left him feeling lightheaded, and even holding the statue was an effort. Fortunately, the thick fog that had enshrouded them seemed to have cleared, and the wraiths were nowhere to be seen. It appeared that after failing to draw close, they had decided to forsake this accursed place—at least for now. Rhode remained silent. His leadership had ingrained in him the importance of composure; a commander must not be shaken by adversity or become overly exuberant after a victory. This conduct would not foster a positive influence on his subordinates. Though no longer the guild leader of tens of thousands of players, the habits of leadership continued to shape him. Seeing his composed demeanor, Lijie and Meis felt a wave of relief wash over them. They had been anxious about the situation outside while searching for the statue. Lijie had been diligent, but it was Meis who had the fortune of discovering the statue tucked away in a corner. A bit more delay, and the outcome could have been entirely different. Rhode had initially intended to traverse the Mist Ruins swiftly, but the appearance of the gargoyles compelled him to alter his plan. The confrontation had nearly exhausted all his strength, and without adequate rest, future battles promised only increased danger. Thus, Rhode decided to rest in the church for the night and set out anew the next day. He harbored little concern for their safety in this place. In the game, this church had served as a haven for players to regroup and organize their spoils, so significant threats were unlikely. Although the dark, silent church with its eerie decorations made Meis's legs quake, as always... He had no voice in contesting Rhode's decision. As night deepened... The dense fog lingered outside the church, and through the windows, nothing could be seen but an expanse of white. The three sat at the center of the church. The decayed benches and tables, once used for worship, now served as kindling, offering their last bit of warmth in the burning fire. A chilly wind blew through the broken windows and crevices in the walls, carrying a slight chill. Cautiously, Lijie reached out and unwrapped the bandage from Rhode's left chest, her beautiful eyebrows furrowing slightly. 'It has opened up again, Mr. Rhode.' 'I'm aware.' Rhode nodded, sparing his words. This was not the first time. Throughout their journey, he had led every battle. Although he had tried to minimize the use of his injured left hand, in particularly troublesome situations, he could not afford such caution. This led to the wound reopening time and again. According to Lijie, what should have been a few days of rest to heal had now potentially become weeks of recovery due to their relentless journey. Yet the young woman had no complaints. After all, it was all done in their defense. All she could do was help Rhode change into a clean bandage each day to prevent the wound from getting infected. Fortunately, before they had left the Skyship, Lijie, as a Spirit Master, had made sure they were well-stocked with supplies. Upon removing the bandage, the sight of the wound under the firelight made everyone gasp. Meis even touched his own chest, a flicker of fear crossing his face as he looked at Rhode's wound. Three black claw marks, as thick as a small forearm, were etched across Rhode's chest. Surrounded by blackened scars from dried blood, many of the scars had been torn open again due to the ferocious battle with the gargoyles. Fresh blood seeped from them, mixing with the dark clots to create a chilling sight. Lijie took out a handkerchief, poured some clean water from a water bottle, and gently pressed it to Rhode's chest. He tensed up momentarily, and even Meis couldn't bear to look, turning his head away. 'I'm sorry, does it hurt?' 'It's bearable.' Rhode shook his head in response to Lijie's anxious query. It hurt, but not to an intolerable degree. Relieved by Rhode's response, Lijie continued to wipe his wound. Meanwhile, she couldn't help but stealthily observe the young man before her, slightly older than herself. To be honest, when she first met Rhode, her impression of him was quite average. His delicate features and pale skin had led her to categorize him as a noble's son. But unlike the arrogant young nobles she had encountered, Rhode's demeanor was different, and she found him bearable. At that time, she hadn't taken him seriously, as a man who resembled a woman often seemed weak. But over time, her perception changed. Unlike those effete young nobles, this young man possessed considerable strength, matching even her own leader. His temperament was reassuring, providing a sense of security even in danger. And contrary to his delicate appearance, he was a man of resilience. Lijie knew the pain such injuries could inflict. As a Spirit Master, she had treated many people, and she knew that many warriors who could withstand the battlefield would cry out in pain during treatment. But Rhode had remained stoically silent throughout the process, not to mention that he continued to fight with such severe injuries... Lijie hesitated for a moment. What was she thinking? These thoughts were absurd. The girl shook her head to dispel the strange notions and refocused on her task. Rhode, unaware of the girl's internal struggle, was focused on the item in his right hand—a pair of gems emitting a dark red glow. These were the spoils from their recent battle—the Gargoyle Control Core. Chapter 19: The Holy Sword's Upgrade As indispensable guardians for spellcasters, Gargoyles are cherished by mages for their unwavering protection. However, these creatures are far too valuable to be used merely as bodyguards. Many mages take advantage of Gargoyles' dual functionality: they act not only as stalwart defenders but also as living safes. This was precisely the case with the pair of Gargoyles that Rhode encountered. Within their fragmented remains, Rhode discovered an array of valuable items. True to their status as level 15 Rare Elites, the loot they 'dropped' was befitting. In addition to a variety of gems, crystals, and gold coins, Rhode unearthed three magical items. Frostguard Amulet [Elite Item]: Triggers a Frostguard Shield upon taking damage, absorbing 50~150 damage points and granting immunity to water attribute attacks. Oathkeeper's Guardian [Excellent Item]: Grants the bearer a +5 increase in spell potency and magical resistance. Mistveil Ring [Excellent Item]: Enables the wearer to activate 'Phantom Wraithform' for half an hour, with a recharge period of every ten days. These coveted accessories for casters would undoubtedly garner significant sums at any auction. Unfortunately, they were tailored for casters. Eventually, Rhode delegated these items among his companions. He bestowed the Frostguard Amulet and Oathkeeper's Guardian upon Lijie Noelle. As a Spirit Master, her role wasn't offensive, yet the items still offered her considerable benefits. Rhode retained the Mistveil Ring for himself. In the game world, the capabilities of such a ring were invaluable to those who ventured alone, compelling Rhode to claim it without hesitation. Lijie Noelle was perplexed by her sudden acquisition of two magical items, given without any effort on her part. In most mercenary groups, magical items from adventures were typically sold by the leader, the proceeds sustaining the group. The notion of directly distributing such treasures was virtually unheard of. This highlighted the disparity between NPCs and players. For mercenaries, the ultimate goal was straightforward: earning a livelihood. Therefore, rare equipment was often promptly sold. Many small mercenary groups shied away from high-risk tasks, content with menial assignments that players might find trivial, their aspirations limited to subsistence. Those deemed worthy of magical gear were only the most esteemed and skilled members within a group. The less capable? They could only dream of such treasures. Players, however, aspired to different heights: the relentless pursuit of betterment and might — superior gear, abundant experience, elevated prestige, and formidable personas. Thus, to players, magical equipment was not rare, and concerns about excess were non-existent — once better gear was found, the old could be sold just as easily. To Rhode, the three magical items were merely transitional gear, useful for levels 10~15, but soon to be outgrown. The Frostguard Amulet, though beneficial, was not indispensable to him. With a high-tier Water Elemental Summoned Spirit, he could achieve immunity to water attacks, making the distribution of such 'low-end' gear a negligible issue. Only the appearance of artifacts such as the 'Sword of the Sky' or 'Heart of the Saint' — legendary, pseudo-legendary, or ancient-level treasures — would truly capture his interest. For Lijie Noelle, however, these magical items represented 'high-end' gear. Even a medium-sized mercenary band leader might possess just a few such items. Mages might have more, but for a support role like a Spirit Master, this equipment was a rare boon. Considering their role and nature, they typically had little need for such items. Now, here she was, a Spirit Master in a humble group, suddenly endowed with two significant magical items. It felt almost dreamlike to Lijie Noelle. Meis, observing the exchange, discerned even deeper implications. As an experienced merchant, Meis was well aware of the value of magical items. These artifacts, if auctioned in the bustling port of Karag to the north, could fetch tens of thousands of gold coins. Yet Rhode parted with them as if giving away bread rather than treasures. His nonchalance was not an act of bravado before the fairer sex but stemmed from genuine indifference — Rhode truly placed little value on these magical items. Such an attitude was not commonplace. Meis, who had interacted with many, from mercenaries to nobles, knew that to them, these magical items were treasures, not to be given away lightly nor dismissed with indifference. What did this reveal about the young man? It suggested that, in his eyes, such magical items were trivial. This demeanor indicated that the young man might hail from an extraordinary background. If Meis had initially thought of Rhode as just another noble amongst the many on the continent, he now began to suspect his association with storied noble houses or even royalty. Only families of such stature possessed vast quantities of magical items and viewed them with such nonchalance — like a magnate who regards a small fortune as mere pocket change, although to the common folk, it could represent a lifetime's earnings. This realization excited the merchant. A modest trader like himself rarely had the chance to meet with the great noble families, as those nobles were served by powerful allies, leaving little room for a small merchant in their sight. Now, with this opportunity at hand, if he played his cards right, the possibilities were endless. However, this hopeful thought was fleeting, tempered by the acknowledgment of his own unremarkable performance thus far. Although the young man had spared him complaints, the merchant knew he had yet to demonstrate any worth that might capture the other's esteem, dampening his excitement. Indeed, Rhode was unconcerned with the three magical items. What captivated him now were the twin heart-shaped gems in his hands. Gargoyle's Heart. Artificial Soul Convergence. This term, although complex-sounding to players, essentially refers to a rare and highly sought-after core capable of imbuing inanimate forms with a semblance of life, much like the central processing unit within a robot. Their value was self-evident. In Dragon Soul Continent, the creation of alchemical creatures represented the apex of arcane craftsmanship. The divine prerogative of life creation was beyond mages, and artificial souls were the compromise they reluctantly accepted. As a result, intact artificial soul cores were exceedingly scarce, a privilege not every mage could attain. For mages, possessing an artificial alchemical life form was among their loftiest ambitions — akin to how a luxury car is a status symbol for the rich elite. These cores were coveted, with few in circulation, and produced in limited quantities, thus commanding exorbitant prices. At auction, they could fetch tens of thousands of gold coins, and in secret markets, even more. The most exquisite artificial soul cores could sell for millions, enough to purchase a significant estate. Mages were accustomed to affluence. But Rhode sought not wealth. His experience as a player had taught him that although money was always to be earned, it was never sufficient. Some things, however, were beyond the reach of wealth. For example, the additional ability of the Gargoyle's Heart. Forced Summoned Spirit Evolution +1. A summon's experience points were shared with its master. Normally, in combat, if Rhode earned 1000 experience points, only 700 would be his. The remaining 300 would go to the spirits engaged in battle. Though this division might seem inconsequential, it added up over time, which is why Summoner Swordsmen faced a steeper ascent to the pinnacle than other professions. By the game's rules, had Rhode been of any other profession, devouring a level 10 five-person instance at level eight would have likely propelled him to levels 12 or 13 by now. But due to the experience shared with the Azure Bird and Star Scar, he had only just surpassed level 10. As for his summons... [Eternal Holy Sword No.10: Star Scar, Attribute-less, Fusion Compatible — Not even the dust of history can obscure its dazzling radiance.] Level: 5, The glory of victory leads the charge, Blade Trait. A summon's level could reach up to ten, at which point they were eligible to evolve. Post-evolution, they would transform, and their level cap would increase by another ten levels, until the third evolution. The Gargoyle's Heart's power was to forcibly elevate a summon's level to 10, initiating evolution. This saved additional experience points and reduced the time needed for leveling. What remained elusive to wealth? Time remained elusive to wealth. Rhode was uncertain of Star Scar's level cap, but his extensive experience suggested that cards at the end of a deck rarely reached high levels, with three evolutions likely being the limit. If he invested both Gargoyle's Hearts, then, at least in battles against equals, the forcibly advanced Holy Sword would no longer vie for Rhode's experience points. But... Rhode fell into deep thought. This set of Holy Sword Cards was extraordinarily unique. When receiving the card from the CEO of B&M Company, he was explicitly told it was the only one in existence. At the time, Rhode didn't ponder the significance, but now, he found it curious. The only one? Hadn't the system prompt stated he had acquired only 1/10th of the Eternal Deck? How then did it become the only card? What of the nine remaining cards? Moreover, this was the tenth card, implying nine precedents. No such deck existed in the game, for it was merely a memento from the real world. In the lore of Dragon Soul Continent, no mention of a Holy Sword Deck existed. It couldn't be hidden within the game, as the deck's creation was inspired by his victory in the competitive arena and his guild named Starlight. The company crafted this card as a prize, a token of remembrance. Such a hastily produced item was not integrated into the game's system. Nonetheless, an attempt was warranted. With this in mind, Rhode extended his right hand, clasping the gem within. Instantly, a system prompt materialized before him. ['Gargoyle's Heart' (Magical Item) detected, would you like to use it?] Use. Rhode affirmed internally. Following Rhode's decision, the summoning circle on his palm shimmered with a delicate magical light. The dark red gem crumbled under the glow, disintegrating into dust that vanished without a trace. Shortly after, new insights appeared before Rhode. [Target?] Star Scar. Rhode's eyes lowered as he replied in his thoughts. [Target — Star Scar — Forced Evolution] [Level Upgrade Complete] [Evolve?] Yes. The immaculate card reappeared in Rhode's grasp, its radiance drawing the curious looks of Lijie Noelle and Meis nearby. At that moment, a succession of system prompts unfolded before Rhode. [Evolution Complete] [Eternal Holy Sword No.10: Star Scar, Attribute-less, Fusion Compatible — Not even the dust of history can conceal its resplendent radiance.] Level: 10, The glory of victory leads the charge, Blade Trait. Snow-white wings offer sanctuary to all life, Guardian Trait. The pure light dispels darkness, Piercing Trait.] [Attached Skills: Blade Technique, Wingguard, Star Beacon. Usable thrice per natural day] Satisfactory! Rhode nodded, content with the system's prompt. Star Scar possessed three exceptional skills, all inherent to the weapon, thus sparing Rhode's soul power for their activation. The provision of three daily uses was ample, and it was evident these abilities would play a significant role in combat. Nevertheless, the next system prompt gave Rhode pause.
