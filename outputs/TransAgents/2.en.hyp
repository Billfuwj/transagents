Chapter 70: Cave Lord of Donglai (Part 8) As bewilderment swept through the onlookers, Cave Lord Miao Yi took charge, his voice cutting through the silence, demanding answers. The others, struck by the sudden turn of events, could only exchange glances of confusion, equally clueless. Cave Lord Miao Yi, without hesitation, soared towards the origin of the deafening clamor with Yan Xiu and two disciples swiftly on his heels. Song Fu and his peers, after a brief exchange of looks, hastened after them, eager to uncover the truth. Arriving at the mountain gate, they were met with a sight that sent a wave of shock through them – the stone gateway bearing the proud inscription 'Donglai Cave' had been reduced to rubble under the moonlight. The sacred gate of Donglai Cave had been violated. Whirling around, Cave Lord Miao Yi’s eyes bore into Song Fu and his companions with a venomous sneer, 'Excellent! It seems someone is already eager to challenge my authority! Very well!' Song Fu and the others were momentarily speechless. The implication in his words was clear, yet they were innocent. They had been strategizing over a meal when they were startled by the noise and came out. Initially suspecting Cave Lord Miao Yi himself, they now realized that he had no reason to destroy his own symbol of authority – such a disgrace would be unbecoming of the new Cave Lord of Donglai. Clarity was essential. Song Fu, with a tone of sincerity, clasped his fists—an ancient gesture of respect and earnestness—and proclaimed, 'Cave Lord, this act was not of our doing!' The others, for the first time addressing Miao Yi with the proper deference due to a Cave Lord, echoed his sentiment. 'Excuses!' Cave Lord Miao Yi glared at Song Fu, contempt in his voice, 'Today, I appointed you guardian of the mountain gate, and now it's been destroyed. How could you not be aware? Surely this wasn’t a deliberate oversight?' '...' Speechless, Song Fu was forced to admit, 'Cave Lord, perhaps you are not yet informed. The servants from Donglai Town have yet to be assigned, and we fend for ourselves for sustenance. In a moment of necessity, I left briefly to secure food, never expecting such a calamity.' Wang Zifa and the rest also stepped forward, 'Cave Lord, we can vouch that Brother Song Fu was indeed with us at that time, breaking bread.' Cave Lord Miao Yi, gesturing towards the shattered arch, demanded sharply, 'Are you suggesting it collapsed without cause? Do not dare to tell me it was toppled by mere wind!' '...' At a loss for words, Song Fu could only raise his hand in oath, 'Cave Lord, I swear upon the honor of 蓝玉门, we are innocent. If I speak even a half-truth, may I, Song Fu, meet an untimely demise!' Cave Lord Miao Yi's eyes flickered suspiciously over the assembled disciples as he darkly suggested, 'Could it be that an intruder has dared to provoke chaos within my Donglai Cave?' A collective shudder of alarm prompted the disciples to scan their surroundings vigilantly. 'What are you waiting for? Do you wish to meet your end in your slumber? Disperse and search at once!' commanded Cave Lord Miao Yi, his fury palpable. 'Yes!' Yan Xiu alongside the others saluted and dispersed into the forest. 'Hmm?' Cave Lord Miao Yi snorted, his piercing gaze fixed on Song Fu and the others, questioning their inaction and possible foreknowledge. Now was the moment to demonstrate their innocence. Song Fu turned and barked, 'Why are you not obeying the Cave Lord's command to search?' With a collective bow to Cave Lord Miao Yi, they too scattered. However, Song Fu was stopped by Cave Lord Miao Yi, 'Song Fu, you shall accompany me!' Song Fu paused, then nodded in assent, following Cave Lord Miao Yi. After the others had departed, a figure emerged like a mirage upon the water – the enigmatic and peerless Lao Bai. Lao Bai, gazing upon the ruins, chuckled lightly, 'The game of life is akin to chess, and a true warrior must possess more than brute strength. I have always feared your inherent kindness would be your undoing... A man of valor must wield strategy as well as might; the simple brute does not ascend to the heavens. I can now set my worries aside.' With that, he vanished as silently as he appeared, like a ripple dissolving on the water's surface. Within the Donglai Grand Hall, where candlelight danced upon the ancient walls, casting a ghostly ballet of shadows, Song Fu followed Cave Lord Miao Yi, standing behind him as the latter contemplated his throne in heavy silence. The atmosphere between them was tense. After a while, Song Fu could no longer hold his silence, 'Cave Lord, for what purpose have you summoned me?' Cave Lord Miao Yi's voice was ominous, 'Song Fu, do you comprehend the gravity of your offense?' Song Fu, his lips curled into a sneer, glanced at the food and drink on the side table, 'This incident was not of our making. How, then, stands Song Fu accused?' 'I do not speak of that!' Cave Lord Miao Yi turned sharply, his gaze icy as he accused, 'I entrusted you with the duty of guarding the mountain gate. Why did you abandon your charge? Could it be that you hold my command in so little regard?' Song Fu thought to himself, 'Do you even need to ask?' But he answered with measured words, 'I have already informed you, Cave Lord. It was a matter of survival, a brief departure for nourishment. I had no wish for this unfortunate event to transpire.' Cave Lord Miao Yi inquired, 'Do you think if I report this matter, the Prefecture Head and the Mountain Lord will believe your explanation?' Song Fu's laughter was laced with scorn, 'A tongue can spin any tale. Should the Cave Lord of Donglai choose to accuse me falsely, then do as you must. Remember, Song Fu too has a voice for self-defense; I am no mute.' Cave Lord Miao Yi sneered, 'It seems you truly are beyond redemption.' With his words hanging in the air, Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun, in a silent accord, swiftly barred the hall doors, sealing Song Fu's fate. Startled by the noise, Song Fu spun around to face the descending axes of Yan Xiu, his fury unleashed. With a swift draw of his blade, a flash of cold steel met the raging attack. Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun joined the fray in an instant, their spears collaborating in a deadly dance that encircled Song Fu. Yan Xiu and Song Fu, both formidable in their cultivation, were well-matched. But with Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun adding their might, Song Fu’s situation quickly turned perilous. 'You contemptible traitors! How dare you conspire to...' Caught in their snare, unable to escape, Song Fu's anguished cry was cut short as he desperately clashed with Yan Xiu. Before he could finish, the relentless spears pierced his defenses, striking deep. Song Fu's eyes widened in shock as he struggled to look at Cave Lord Miao Yi, his lips trembling, the indignation in his gaze indescribable. He finally understood – it was all a trap. The fall of the mountain gate arch was not just meant to frame him but also to draw away his fellow disciples, preventing any united defense. The true aim was his life. Chapter 71: Master of Donglai Cave (IX) When else to strike, if not now? Yan Xiu's blade danced with lethal precision, and with one formidable swing, 'plop'—a head was sent aloft. Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun likewise withdrew their spears from Song Fu's body. With their hearts still pounding, the trio ceased their actions and immediately turned their gaze to Cave Lord Miao. Cave Lord Miao had refrained from intervening, instead casting a spell to shield the table of delicacies from the battle's stray energies. Now, lifting the spell, he stretched out his fingers and summoned a cup of wine toward him, emptying it in one gulp, his tone detached, "The curtain falls on this farce." The three saluted and swiftly disappeared towards the rear of the hall, vanishing from sight. It was then that Cave Lord Miao proceeded to the entrance, flung open the grand doors, and stepped across the threshold, affectionately stroking Black Charcoal's mane, while contemplating the moonlit sky. His gaze was icy, but his thoughts were consumed by the past—a younger self, leading his siblings against a mob of taunting adults, feeling a mix of rage and helplessness. In a moment of profound despair, he had stabbed his own thigh, blood pouring out... "My brothers, I've failed you, shouldn't have led you into such peril; it’s all my fault. Stay safe, my abilities are still limited, but give me a little more time..." Cave Lord Miao murmured, as the dark green bead at his neck flickered faintly. Black Charcoal shook its head and sneezed... The sounds of the fight and Song Fu's last screams had drawn his fellow sect members back. Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, both White Lotus Third Rank cultivators, arrived first, followed quickly by Shang Youlai, Hou Sheng, Wang Xiuqin, and Nan Sisi. Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun were the last to arrive, apparently alerted by the commotion. As they tried to enter the grand hall to see what had happened, they were blocked by Cave Lord Miao, who, astride his Dragon Steed and brandishing a silver lance, stood resolute on the steps before the grand hall, looking down upon them. The night sky outside the grand hall was adorned with stars, while inside, behind Cave Lord Miao, the flickering candlelight created a play of light and shadow that made it difficult to discern his expression, lending an air of mystery and authority. His aura of lethal intent was almost palpable. The Blue Jade Sect members exchanged wary looks before Wang Zifa proceeded with a bow to inquire, "Cave Lord, did we not hear the clash of battle and Brother Song Fu's pleas for aid? Is Brother Song Fu inside?" "He is! However, now headless," Cave Lord Miao disclosed bluntly, raising a hand that held a head by its hair, showing it to those gathered, then carelessly tossing it toward the crowd. The group instinctively stepped back, watching a severed head roll to a stop at their feet. Upon closer inspection, there was no doubt that it was Song Fu's. Yan Xiu's trio exchanged covert glances, while the rest were visibly shocked. Wang Zifa, fuelled by sudden anger, pointed at Cave Lord Miao on the steps and demanded, "Was it you who killed Brother Song Fu?" From his elevated position, Cave Lord Miao's voice, devoid of any warmth, stated coldly, "I commanded him to guard the mountain gate, yet he dared to desert his post, leading to the destruction of our Donglai Cave's gate. When questioned about his crime, he not only refused to accept guilt but even dared to disrespect me, the Cave Lord. For such a reckless fool, who treats the Cave Lord's orders as child's play, should he not deserve death?" At this, Wang Zifa and the others swiftly drew their swords, aiming them at Cave Lord Miao. Wang Zifa accused sharply, "You dare to execute a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect!" "How dare you!" Cave Lord Miao's thunderous voice served as a warning, "Regardless of your sects, having joined Donglai Cave, you should forsake prior allegiances and obey our rules. Do you really wish to challenge the Emissary of the Celestial Path's million-strong army? Such arrogance is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot!" He pointed his spear at them, "Song Fu is neither the first White Lotus Third Rank cultivator to fall by my hand nor will he be the last. Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, Qiu Shaoqun!" Yan Xiu and his companions, positioned behind the crowd, brandished their weapons, replying in unison, "Present!" "Should anyone dare to revolt against their superior!" Cave Lord Miao, looking down, his spear directed at Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, ordered, "I'll handle these two; the other four are yours to deal with!" "As commanded!" Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun, alongside axe-wielding Yan Xiu, responded with a roar, "Death to those who defy!" This had been their agreed strategy; they had resolved to execute Song Fu as an example to all. While Cave Lord Miao was unsure if he could singlehandedly defeat White Lotus Third Rank cultivators Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, with Black Charcoal's agility, he could certainly keep them occupied. The remaining four, of White Lotus Second Rank, would be evenly matched against White Lotus Third Rank Yan Xiu, with Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun as support. Should a conflict arise, once Yan Xiu and his comrades vanquished the four, they would immediately aid Cave Lord Miao against Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, greatly increasing their chances of victory. The Blue Jade Sect disciples glanced at Cave Lord Miao, steadfast with his lance at the hall's entrance, then back at the stern Yan Xiu and his group. They found themselves in a dilemma. Having witnessed the battle at Gleaming Light Cave from the sidelines, they knew that even with Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao joining forces, defeating Cave Lord Miao was not a certainty. If the fight dragged on, the four White Lotus Second Rank cultivators would likely fall against White Lotus Third Rank Yan Xiu and his two assailants. They stood no chance in this battle. Furthermore, they were unaware that Song Fu's death was a joint effort by Yan Xiu and the others, and Cave Lord Miao's swift execution of Song Fu only heightened their apprehension, filling them with unease. "I, Cave Lord Miao, stand here; who dares to challenge me?" Cave Lord Miao called out again, his voice echoing with authority. "You've killed a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect; be assured, they will demand an explanation," Wang Zifa declared, having already sheathed his sword, not daring to provoke further conflict. The others also slowly sheathed theirs. With the situation under control, Cave Lord Miao scoffed, "The affairs of the Blue Jade Sect do not concern me. I am solely focused on Donglai Cave. Should you be dissatisfied here, then leave; I will not stop you. However, if you choose to stay and heed my commands, you will be well compensated. Starting today, any member of Donglai Cave who obeys my command will be handsomely rewarded. Each White Lotus Third Rank cultivator shall receive three Grain of Rice Pearls annually—a type of valuable cultivation resource—and those of White Lotus Second Rank, two. Those unwilling to pledge their loyalty, leave at once!" The declaration left everyone present in a state of amazement, including Yan Xiu and his group, for Cave Lord Miao had not previously informed them of this. They quickly assessed the situation. Donglai Cave had roughly 120,000 followers, yielding nearly 120 Wish Power Pearls per year. After offering up eighty percent, only twenty percent remained—twenty-four pearls in total. With three White Lotus Third Rank cultivators claiming nine pearls and six White Lotus Second Rank cultivators another twelve, twenty-one pearls were already spoken for. Could it be that Cave Lord Miao, having strived so hard to attain his position, was content with a mere three pearls for himself? But could Cave Lord Miao's generous offer conceal a deeper stratagem? Chapter Seventy-Two: Cave Lord of Donglai (Part Ten) The disciples of the Blue Jade Sect had curried favor with Yang Qing for one singular purpose: the acquisition of Wish Power Pearls. With the issue of Song Fu momentarily set aside, the veracity of the Cave Lord's words demanded immediate verification. Wang Zifa, marked by hesitation, respectfully inquired, 'Cave Lord, are you not merely jesting with us? Should you proceed as stated, you would be left with merely three Wish Power Pearls. If we...' His voice tapered off, his unfinished thought swallowed as he and the others fixated on Miao Yi's hand. In the night's embrace, the Wish Power Pearl, modest in size yet potent in presence, glowed with an ethereal light, its allure irresistible. Held deftly between Miao Yi's fingers, it was as though it contained the collective hopes of thousands, its magnetism undeniable. Those gathered, blessed with sight far beyond ordinary men, immediately recognized the pearl's true essence—a Wish Power Pearl, charged with a year's worth of countless aspirations. 'Regarding Wish Power Pearls—whether two or three—the quantity is of little consequence,' Miao Yi pronounced, as he skillfully stowed the pearl within his Storage Bag. Overlooking the crowd with an authoritative gaze, he declared, 'Should you heed my command with unwavering loyalty, I possess the means to secure more. In due time, the pearls you receive annually may indeed surpass what I have pledged. Those who serve this Cave Lord with unwavering loyalty shall be rewarded generously!' Their hearts stirred with excitement, their eyes aglow with anticipation. The sight of the Donglai Cave Lord nonchalantly producing such a pearl dispelled any lingering doubts. Each disciple's heart raced; such a pearl was a rarity for a modest abode like Donglai, and it was improbable that even Yang Qing would grant such a gift without reservation. The prospect that Miao Yi might have alternative sources for Wish Power Pearls became a plausible consideration. For a domain such as Donglai Cave, irrespective of one's cultivation rank, a mere pearl per year was the standard for those who had fallen from the Cave Lord's grace—a predicament Yan Xiu knew all too well from his days in Gleaming Light Cave. Yet, should Miao Yi's promises come to fruition, and the supply of Wish Power Pearls were to double or triple, the implications were profound. For a White Lotus Third Rank cultivator, a century of cultivation could now equate to three centuries; for the Second Rank, two centuries. The potential to significantly reduce one's time in cultivation, to swiftly elevate one's prowess and status, was indeed tantalizing. Some entertained malevolent thoughts—of seizing the Wish Power Pearls from Miao Yi by force. Upon further contemplation, however, the impracticality of such an action became apparent. No single individual could confidently claim victory over Miao Yi, and if they did prevail, to whom would the prize belong? Even if one managed to secure the pearl, it would only equate to ten lesser Grain of Rice Pearls. According to Miao Yi's promise, such wealth could be amassed in just three years. For cultivators, three years was but a brief moment in the vast expanse of their cultivation journey. To take the pearl now would mean severing a potentially endless stream of future prosperity. Suppressing the impractical desires that promised more risk than reward, Wang Zifa, with resolve, clasped his fists and earnestly sought confirmation, 'Cave Lord, may we consider your word as a pledge most solemn?' Miao Yi cast a downward glance, his voice steady, 'You, disciples of the Blue Jade Sect, stand united. If my word were not my bond, what advantage would that afford me?' After exchanging a meaningful glance, Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, along with their expectant peers, nodded in agreement. Swords were sheathed in unison as the disciples aligned themselves in two orderly rows. Their voices echoed in unison, 'We pledge to heed the Cave Lord's command!' Miao Yi sat up straight, the scene before him reflecting his rightful dominion. This was the moment when Donglai Cave truly became his realm. However, mere words were insufficient. Miao Yi was not one to be appeased so easily. 'Words alone will not suffice; your commitment must be demonstrated through concrete actions.' The disciples glanced at one another, and once again, led by Wang Zifa, they sought guidance with clasped fists. 'Cave Lord, we await your directive.' With a detached air, Miao Yi asserted, 'Song Fu's insubordination has shown contempt for the edicts of Donglai Cave!' The message was clear; a stance must be taken, and allegiance proven to merit rewards. Wang Zifa exhaled deeply, conceding, 'We too disapproved of Senior Brother Song's conduct. Despite our repeated admonitions, he remained obstinate. He is, after all, our senior brother. Every nation has its laws, every mountain its rules. The Cave Lord’s execution as just punishment raises no doubts in us, and we hold no objections.' The others mirrored his gesture, bowing and clasping their fists, 'The Cave Lord’s execution as just punishment, we hold no objections.' Yan Xiu and his companions exchanged looks, their expressions a mix of annoyance and reluctant respect. These same disciples, who once made light of their suffering, were now models of obedience, quick to shift all blame onto Song Fu. Their gaze toward Miao Yi shifted, now tinged with a newfound respect, recognizing in the Cave Lord the skill to turn the tide with a mere flick of his wrist, upending the status quo of Donglai Cave. It was clear why Prefecture Head Yang Qing had so ardently advocated for his leadership. 'Song Fu, though deserving of his fate, remains a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect. At this juncture, when Nanxuan Prefecture and the Blue Jade Sect stand united, it would be imprudent to let the transgressions of one man tarnish the rapport between our two factions. This matter warrants reporting; we owe an explanation to our superiors,' Miao Yi articulated, pausing deliberately to scan the faces before him. He continued, 'A solitary testimony from me might invite skepticism within the Blue Jade Sect. If you, his fellow disciples, are willing to corroborate the account, it will surely alleviate any concerns within your sect. Are you prepared to record your testimonies and join me in informing the Mountain Lord?' Yan Xiu and the others barely contained their amusement, impressed by the Cave Lord’s bold strategy. Wang Zifa and the rest displayed discomfort as they grasped the extent of Miao Yi's stratagem. He had vanquished a Blue Jade Sect disciple and now sought to absolve himself of all responsibility, expecting the sect to sanction their disciple's demise as warranted. Was it not evident that he held no fear for their sect, that he did not regard them with due respect? As a weighty silence descended, Miao Yi sighed, 'If writing is not your wish, I shall not coerce you. Nevertheless, consider this: once the Blue Jade Sect begins its investigation and discovers the Wish Power Pearls you are to receive yearly, few will seek to fault me. The allure of the Wish Power Pearls overshadows the standing of a mere Cave Lord. Should another take my place as Cave Lord of Donglai, they may not show the same generosity. It is conceivable that your brethren might scheme to displace you, eager to take up your mantle. When that moment comes, I shall be powerless to stop them. What is your decision?' Miao Yi's words struck at their core, resonating with the grim certainty of a future where one's own brethren might indeed conspire to usurp their position, particularly those of the Blue Jade Sect relegated to the lowest ranks, vulnerable to the machinations of those with influence. Nan Sisi murmured, 'Brother Wang, Senior Brother Song's defiance led to the mountain gate's ruin. His culpability cannot be denied.' 'Certainly...' A chorus of agreement followed, subdued yet laden with implications, trusting in Brother Wang's understanding. Wang Zifa recognized the collective sentiment; none were willing to forfeit the advantages promised to them. Yet to yield to this impulse was to deceive their sect. Once aboard Miao Yi's vessel, there would be no retreat; they would be beholden to him, resigned to servitude indefinitely. Chapter 73: Master of Donglai Cave (Part 11) The allure of the Wish Power Pearls, those coveted tokens of spiritual fortitude, proved irresistible. What other reason would there be for these cultivators to willingly submit to another's command if not for these Pearls? Amidst the quiet murmurings of his fellow disciples, Wang Zifa set his resolve and approached the steps. With a sigh, he conceded, 'I am merely heeding the collective wish of our brethren; this decision was not mine alone to make.' 'Of course!' 'Certainly!' All around, nods were exchanged, a silent agreement that no single person should bear the weight of this decision alone. A shared responsibility was the only safeguard against any future discord that might arise from hidden resentments. United in accountability, they stood on firmer ground. With a consensus reached, they collectively bowed and declared, 'We shall heed the commands of Cave Lord Miao Yi!' Witnessing the transformative events, Yan Xiu and his companions could not help but look upon their Cave Lord with newfound respect. Miao Yi had, with remarkable ease, enlisted the allegiance of numerous Blue Jade Sect disciples. Their admiration for him knew no bounds. Upon reflection, they realized they were in a similar bind. It was their hands that had slain Song Fu, and should the truth surface, they would be equally culpable. It appeared that all were now bound to Cave Lord Miao Yi's 'ship of shared fate,' with no chance for retreat. 'Acceptable!' Miao Yi sheathed his silver spear and dismounted, standing with a casual air at the top of the steps. He now wore a smile, 'The hour is early. Why not scribe your statements now? Once I verify there are no discrepancies, they shall be dispatched to Zhenhai Mountain to inform Mountain Lord Qin Weiwei.' Between the lines, it was clear – Cave Lord Miao Yi was giving no quarter for second thoughts, not even a night's reprieve. Resigned to their fate, they all consented. Miao Yi wasted no time, 'Yan Xiu, distribute the Jade Slips.' One by one, the Jade Slips, used for recording in the cultivation world, were handed to each disciple. The disciples stood beneath the steps of the Grand Hall, each inscribing their testimony with mystical characters. Some faltered, their hands uneasy as they pondered the appropriateness of their actions towards their deceased comrade... Once scribed, they ascended the steps and presented their Jade Slips to Miao Yi for inspection. After reviewing a submission, Miao Yi would either nod in approval, 'This is satisfactory,' or offer guidance for improvements. If a script appeared too lenient, he would inquire, 'Is this not downplaying the severity of Song Fu's misdeeds?' With an apologetic smile, the disciple would reply, 'I shall redraft it immediately.' When the narrative was overly harsh, Miao Yi would advise, 'Moderation is key. Let us not ascribe undue malevolence – such portrayal would serve only to further shame the Blue Jade Sect. Please, revise it accordingly.' Yan Xiu and his companions also contributed their accounts. After all the Jade Slips were collected, Miao Yi prepared his own Petition. It described Song Fu's defiance and dereliction of duty, leading to the destruction of the Mountain Gate. His execution was justified as a deterrent to others. His own account was intentionally understated, aiming to reflect the magnanimity expected of a Cave Lord. With so many condemning Song Fu, Miao Yi's voice was but one among many. Once he affixed his signature dharma seal to the document, he gathered it along with the revised Petition from the Donglai Town Governor. Looking up, he called out, 'Shan Biaoyi!' Shan Biaoyi stepped forward promptly, 'At your service!' 'You must depart at once and ensure these are delivered to Zhenhai Mountain. Inform Mountain Lord Qin Weiwei without delay,' Miao Yi instructed as he passed the papers. 'As you wish!' Shan Biaoyi departed with haste. As his figure vanished, the crowd was left contemplating the Cave Lord's urgent dispatch, realizing there would be no delay, not even through the night. With the pressing matters addressed, Miao Yi allowed himself a moment's respite. He then turned to Yan Xiu, 'Have the Town Governor of Donglai come to see me on the morrow. He is to bring all necessary aides. We must not disrupt the daily lives and cultivation of our people.' The order was met with approval, the assembled disciples responding in chorus, 'The Cave Lord's acumen is unparalleled!' 'Yet, do not revel in relief too soon,' Miao Yi cautioned, his gaze sweeping over the Blue Jade Sect disciples. 'Do not presume I am oblivious to the machinations you once conspired with Song Fu. His failure to guard the Mountain Gate implicates you all. I expect to see Donglai Cave's reputation upheld by the arrival of tomorrow's guests. You shall quarry stone tonight and work diligently to rebuild the Gateway Arch. This is your opportunity to atone. Do not shirk this duty – it must be executed with both grace and grandeur.' No dissent was voiced; all acquiesced, knowing the Mountain Gate would be well-guarded through the night. Miao Yi signaled for the assembly to disperse and turned to Qiu Shaoqun, 'Tidy the Grand Hall.' Yan Xiu then escorted Miao Yi to the Rear Palace, the exclusive domain for the Cave Lord's cultivation and rest. Black Charcoal, unbound by the niceties of protocol, trailed behind. En route, Yan Xiu couldn't contain his query, 'Cave Lord, is the yearly distribution of Wish Power Pearls not too liberal?' He saw himself as a trusted confidant, voicing concern for the Cave Lord's affairs. Miao Yi arches an eyebrow, 'Do you not see why I hastened Shan Biaoyi to deliver the documents? It is to cement the matter. Should I choose to withhold the Pearls, what recourse would they have? They would not dare cross me, for fear of Blue Jade Sect's retribution. Let them try to defy me!' '......' Yan Xiu was left speechless. 'Do not overthink it. I merely posited a scenario. Should the annual harvest of Wish Power Pearls meet expectations, my promises will be honored,' Miao Yi clarified. Stroking Black Charcoal's side, Miao Yi shared a revelation, 'Dealing with outward affairs has led me to a realization – 'a horse ungrazed at night grows not in girth.' Relying solely on fixed stipends is unsustainable. We must seek alternative means to augment our revenue.' His words stemmed from earnest experience, not idle musing. Setting aside the Pearls gifted by the charming innkeeper and those obtained from the demise of Mo Shengtu and Zhang Shucheng, including the one seized from Huang Baolong, he had acquired a taste for prosperity. It was time to marshal his forces within Donglai Cave for larger endeavors. A singular strength was insufficient in the grand scheme of things. Slightly discontent, Black Charcoal made do with the courtyard between the front and rear palaces. Miao Yi's private quarters, designated for sleep and cultivation, were not suited for such a sizable beast. Reluctantly, the loyal creature lay down at the entrance, its laziness on full display. The courtyard was a sanctuary steeped in ethereal tranquility, with potted ancient trees, refined pavilions, and small towers encircling a picturesque pond – a far more elegant resting place than the outdoors. Miao Yi, entering his personal sanctum with a sense of ease, marveled at the Cave Lord's lavish accommodations. Thick carpets, ornate furnishings, and a blend of luxury and elegance unlike anything he had seen before, made a lasting impression on him. Meanwhile, Yan Xiu's mind was preoccupied not with the opulence but with the Cave Lord's mention of new income sources. He was curious about the origins of the powerful Wish Power Pearl and the potential it represented. He ventured, 'Cave Lord, may I inquire how we might pursue these new revenue streams?' With a knowing smile, Miao Yi replied, 'The optimal strategy would be to emulate the Prefecture Head and claim all of Nanxuan for our own.' Yan Xiu was taken aback, hastily gesturing in disapproval, 'That would be unwise. Our current strength is insufficient to annex the territories around us.' Chapter 74: Master of Donglai Cave (Part 12) "I am indeed aware of the potential consequences. If we attempt to seize another's territory now, we risk not only failing to secure it but also leaving our own domain vulnerable to invasion." With a hint of self-mockery, Miao Yi shook his head, turned, and seated himself on the thickly padded, ornately carved couch. "What are your thoughts on making a journey to the Stellar Sea?" "The Stellar Sea?" Yan Xiu's eyes widened in shock; he was the one who had first spoken of this place to Miao Yi. "Why would we venture to the Stellar Sea? That region falls within the Demon State ruled by Sorceress Saint Ji Huan! The Stellar Sea is teeming with demons, and human cultivators who dare enter rarely return." "Did you not mention that Fiend Pills not meeting the quality grade could be exchanged for Wish Power Pearls?" Miao Yi inquired. This piece of information had come from Yan Xiu after they had witnessed the fierce battle between Yang Qing and Lu Yu. Fiend and Yin Pills are integral in crafting Mystic Relics, which are the source of a relic's power. Since relics cannot be used for personal cultivation and lose energy with each use, replenishing their energy becomes essential. Thus, lower-grade Fiend Pills have become the preferred source for energy replenishment for relics, ensuring their market value, whether traded for currency or Wish Power Pearls. Yan Xiu, his heart pounding, responded with trepidation, "Cave Lord Miao, when you spoke of seeking alternative paths, you surely didn't envisage hunting in the Stellar Sea?" "Hehe, I merely made an offhand remark. Look how anxious you've become; I was merely jesting," Miao Yi replied with a dismissive chuckle. After Yan Xiu departed, Miao Yi walked into his private Meditation Chamber to inspect it. This was an underground space, substantial in size, with floors and walls lined with thick, polished stone slabs. Copper lamps cast a moderate glow throughout the chamber. In front of a stone couch designed for quiet meditation stood three large baths constructed of jade stones, each with sculpted animal heads that served as spouts. One bath drew from a mountain spring, another from a hot spring, and their waters merged into a third, creating a bath with the ideal temperature for relaxation. Miao Yi disrobed and eased into the bath, his sighs of contentment echoing softly... The next morning, as the sun rose, Miao Yi, flanked by his followers, inspected the new gateway arch at the entrance to Donglai Cave. He was immediately impressed by the sight. Throughout the night, he had faintly heard the sounds of chiseling from his chamber. The six cultivators who had toiled through the night had indeed created a remarkable edifice. The gateway featured four main pillars and three entrances. The primary entrance, over three zhang high (approximately 10 meters/33 feet), was adorned with lifelike reliefs of birds and beasts amidst cloud motifs, and the words 'Donglai Cave' were inscribed prominently above. Stone dragons and tigers, poised as guardians, flanked the inscription. The entire gateway arch was imposing and magnificent, evoking Miao Yi's admiration. "Excellent work. It seems that even if the people of Donglai Cave did not cultivate, they would still make fine stonemasons." Relieved by his approval, the Blue Jade Sect disciples, who had feared his unpredictable demands, breathed easier. They had devoted much effort to the arch's construction. The group's laughter and banter momentarily lightened the atmosphere. However, Miao Yi's attention soon shifted to their blue garments. "I find your attire rather jarring. Onlookers might mistake Donglai Cave for an extension of the Blue Jade Sect. You may wear your blue robes back at the Blue Jade Sect if you like, but here in Donglai Cave, we should have a unified dress code. Yan Xiu, arrange for the tailors in the city to make us black robes." "As you command, Cave Lord Miao," Yan Xiu responded, bowing respectfully. The Blue Jade Sect disciples exchanged uncertain glances at this directive. Disregarding their preferences, Miao Yi continued to inspect the gateway arch with a satisfied demeanor. As they admired the structure, Yan Xiu suddenly pointed toward the lakeside path, "Cave Lord, it appears that the Town Governor of Donglai Town is approaching." Looking in the direction indicated, they saw a procession weaving its way along the path, with numerous palanquins and a train of carts suggesting they brought many offerings. Miao Yi glanced at them briefly, his attention lingering longer on the great lake below. "Yan Xiu, ensure we stock the lake with more fish and shrimp for cultivation purposes." "Understood, Cave Lord Miao," Yan Xiu acknowledged, aware that the additions were likely for Black Charcoal, the Dragon Steed that favored fresh seafood and enjoyed frolicking in water. The large lake would serve as a perfect habitat. "Wang Zifa, assign someone to guard the gate. You will oversee the mountain gate from now on. If it is damaged again, you will answer to me. The rest of you, to the Grand Hall," commanded Miao Yi, then turned and left, deeming the Town Governor unworthy of a formal welcome. While Wang Zifa would not dare to assign someone like Yan Xiu, a confidant of Cave Lord Miao, to guard duty, he left Shang Youlai on watch. In the Grand Hall, after only a short wait, the portly Town Governor Xu Xinliang arrived at the mountain gate, dismounting courteously and seeking admission from Shang Youlai. No permission was needed; Cave Lord Miao was already aware of their arrival, and Shang Youlai allowed them to pass. The visitors respectfully left their mounts outside, with only the heavily laden carts following Xu Xinliang into the courtyard of the Grand Hall. Sixteen palanquins were set down gently; none dared to be careless, as they contained maids intended for the practitioners' service. A cultivator was traditionally entitled to two maids, a rule that the cultivation world strictly enforced. If every cultivator demanded more, given their elusive abilities, there wouldn't be enough women in the secular world to satisfy them. This would impact the followers and, consequently, the Wish Power. Therefore, restrictions were necessary. Until given permission, no one else was allowed to enter the Grand Hall, save for Xu Xinliang, who wiped the sweat from his brow and climbed the steps, a box held tight in his arms. His concern was not fear of the cultivators but the knowledge that his position was most vulnerable during the transition of the cave's leadership. If the new Cave Lord found him wanting, he could easily be replaced. Inside the Grand Hall, Yan Xiu and others stood at attention. Xu Xinliang, carrying the heavy box, did not dare meet their gaze directly. He knelt and bowed deeply, announcing, "Town Governor Xu Xinliang greets the Cave Lord!" Seated above, Miao Yi smiled, "Governor Xu, it is our destiny to cross paths once more." Xu Xinliang was startled, lifting his gaze to a face he recognized, then realization dawned — this was the immortal who had saved Lady Ji. He had not expected him to become the new Master of Donglai Cave, a leader so youthful in appearance! "Please rise and speak," Miao Yi beckoned with a gesture. Xu Xinliang quickly got to his feet, producing a smaller box from his sleeve and offering it along with the larger one. "Cave Lord Miao, these are tokens of esteem from the citizens of Donglai Town. We hope you will accept our humble offerings." Having previously dealt with Huang Baolong, Miao Yi did not need to inspect the offerings. He subtly nodded to Yan Xiu, who stepped forward to accept the gifts. Chapter 75: Qian'er and Xue'er Cave Lord Miao Yi did not put the Town Governor through any further difficulty. After an exchange that demonstrated the governor's familiarity with Donglai Town's civic matters, Miao Yi encouraged him and then allowed him to depart. There was little shared interest to continue their dialogue. Relieved, Governor Xu, along with his entourage, exited. Miao Yi then instructed Yan Xiu to present the gifts for examination. Indeed, nestled within the small box was a Grain of Rice Pearl, emitting a gentle glow. Miao Yi unhesitatingly secured it within his Storage Bag. The chest contained an impressive sum of five thousand Gold Crystals, the hard-earned sweat and toil of Donglai Town's residents. For Miao Yi, who hailed from humble beginnings, accepting such offerings was somewhat uncomfortable. However, decline was not an option—the well-being of Donglai Cave's many inhabitants depended on the town's faithful. Without keeping any for himself, Miao Yi directed Yan Xiu to distribute a portion of the Gold Crystals—two hundred to every White Lotus Third Rank, one hundred to the Second Rank, and placed the remainder into the Cave's treasury, entrusting Yan Xiu with its care. Yan Xiu, visibly pleased, had never experienced such a trusted role during his time in Gleaming Light Cave. Subsequently, the group left the Grand Hall to assemble in the Square, where sixteen maidens of exceptional allure stood apprehensively in a row, eager for the cultivators to make their choices. Particularly striking were the two at the forefront, standing gracefully, their heads bowed modestly, like bashful blossoms on the cusp of bloom, their freshness and charm captivating. Their only shortcoming was their youth; their figures not yet fully developed, lacking the curves and fullness of mature beauty. Yet, they held a unique charm, perhaps appealing to certain tastes. With Miao Yi leading, the men surveyed the maidens. Miao Yi himself was curious about the attendants Yan Xiu had picked out for him. Yan Xiu beckoned to the two in front, "You two, come here. This is the Cave Lord whom you will serve!" After a brief glance at Yan Xiu and Miao Yi, they cautiously approached, bowed, and greeted him with melodious voices, "Zhao Qian'er, Liu Xue, at your service, Cave Lord Miao Yi!" The other attendants couldn't help but sneak peeks, feeling a tinge of envy. Though all served as attendants to immortals, they understood that serving the master was inherently different from serving others. "Raise your heads," Yan Xiu ordered, allowing Miao Yi to appraise them. He added, "Both are fifteen years old. Zhao Qian'er, slightly the elder, excels in dance. Liu Xue specializes in musical instruments. They both exhibit potential for cultivation. Does Cave Lord Miao Yi approve?" A dancer and a musician? Miao Yi gave Yan Xiu an additional glance. No longer a naive newcomer, he recognized that finding attendants young, beautiful, skilled, and with cultivation potential was no easy feat. Yan Xiu had clearly expended considerable effort. Awaiting a response, Yan Xiu offered, "Should the Cave Lord be unsatisfied, we could seek others." Miao Yi pondered briefly. While any man naturally appreciated beauty, he had vowed not to entertain female company until he had found his two lost brothers. Imagining them possibly in distress while he indulged weighed heavily on him. Nonetheless, he consented, "No replacement is necessary. They will suffice." Having attendants would minimize distractions, facilitating his cultivation. After Miao Yi made his selections, others took their turn, including Shang Youlai, the Mountain Gate Guardian. Once everyone had made their choices, two maidens remained. Yan Xiu directed them to Qiu Shaoqun, stating, "These two will serve Shan Biaoyi." Qiu Shaoqun nodded in acknowledgment. It was then they noticed the absence of two attendants. Puzzled, since Yan Xiu had personally arranged the matter with Donglai Town, Miao Yi inquired, "Where is your attendant?" While the others might not have realized, Miao Yi sensed a momentary wave of melancholy pass through Yan Xiu's eyes. Yan Xiu put on a forced smile and bowed slightly, "Yan Xiu has aged; solitude has become a preferred companion." Wang Zifa and others jovially teased him, "Not at all aged, still fully capable of enjoying life's blossoms." Nan Sisi and Wang Xiuqin also smiled discreetly, their spirits lifted by the day's gains. Yan Xiu, reddening with embarrassment, clasped his hands and sought clemency from the group. Miao Yi was reminded of a woman who could not bear disgrace, took up arms to wash away her humiliation, and was ultimately beheaded... He studied Yan Xiu silently, then turned his gaze away, saying nothing more. He understood Yan Xiu's choice. Miao Yi, once resentful towards Yan Xiu due to Luo Zhen's death, seemed to now comprehend that some scars within a man so accustomed to flattery could never be erased. Qiu Shaoqun, also a former subordinate of Gleaming Light Cave, cast a contemplative look at Yan Xiu but remained silent. After each had taken their attendant, Yan Xiu called two to follow Miao Yi. Black Charcoal, full and dozing at the Rear Palace entrance, casually flicked his tail, enjoying his leisure. Roused by the commotion, he opened one eye, recognized Miao Yi's return, sneezed loudly, and closed his eyes again. In the courtyard, Zhao Qian'er and Liu Xue took in their surroundings, their initial curiosity tinged with apprehension. Miao Yi turned to Yan Xiu, "Since they are new here and unfamiliar with our ways, please assist them in settling in. I'll be taking Zhu Tianbiao for a Territorial Inspection." It was a necessary task for a new Cave Lord to become acquainted with his domain. Hearing of Miao Yi's departure, Black Charcoal's eyes sparkled, and he perked up. Before Miao Yi could exit, Yan Xiu interjected, indicating the girls, "Cave Lord Miao Yi, you have yet to confer upon them their new names." Miao Yi, momentarily puzzled, asked, "Do they not have names already?" Yan Xiu, with a gentle smile, explained, "Those were their former secular names. Now, as your attendants, it is customary for you to give them new names, symbolizing their elevation from the secular world and a new beginning in the path of cultivation. It is our established custom." "I see," said Miao Yi, scratching his head. Naming was not his forte, and after a moment's thought, he decided, "Zhao Qian'er, Liu Xue, henceforth you shall be known as Qian'er and Xue'er!" The names were straightforward, catching Yan Xiu off guard. He nudged the maidens, "Express your gratitude to the Cave Lord for your names." The two maidens promptly bowed, "Qian'er, Xue'er, we are honored by Cave Lord Miao Yi's gracious bestowal of our new names!" Chapter 76: Qin Weiwei in Disarray (Part I) Miao Yi waved his hand dismissively, sparing little concern for the two maids, and entrusted them to Yan Xiu's supervision. He departed with a determined stride, leaving the matters of discipline and order to his trusted subordinate. Outside the Grand Hall, Zhu Tianbiao, having been previously informed, stood ready in a fresh set of clothes. As Miao Yi emerged, Black Charcoal burst forth from behind, its teeth firmly latching onto Miao Yi's robe with a steadfast grip. Zhu Tianbiao's frown deepened at this display, deeming Black Charcoal's conduct somewhat excessive. Here was the Council Hall of Donglai Cave, and yet the beast conducted itself as if in a horse pen, a clear testament to the lax discipline instilled by its master. A few firm lashes might remedy such behavior. But Miao Yi held no inclination to use the whip on Black Charcoal. The beast had not only saved his life but also proved its worth through swiftness and utility, attributes best appreciated by those who had experienced them. He turned, patting Black Charcoal's head, 'I have urgent business to attend to and cannot take you along. Go play in the lake; there are fish and shrimp aplenty for you to feast on.' He gestured toward the expanse of water. Black Charcoal released the cloth from its jaws, shook its head vigorously, sneezed robustly, and galloped into the square, leaving a trail of dust in its wake. Inwardly disapproving of Black Charcoal's indiscipline yet outwardly polite, Zhu Tianbiao offered, 'The Cave Lord's mount exhibits a remarkable level of intelligence, responding to direct speech. Such understanding is rare among our steeds. This is undoubtedly a reflection of the Cave Lord's exemplary training.' Miao Yi chuckled, knowing full well the flattery was both hollow and clumsy. Black Charcoal's antics were not generally endearing, and even Qin Weiwei had once harbored ill feelings towards it. Nonetheless, the rare indulgence in such insincere praise was not entirely unpleasant. At the mountain gate, two spirited horses awaited them, courtesy of the Donglai Town Governor. Preferring subtlety over conspicuousness, Miao Yi chose not to mount a Dragon Steed for the journey into town, as it would draw undue attention and hinder his observations. He was also intent on evaluating Xu Xinliang, the Town Governor's ability to manage. Should Xu prove inadequate, especially in the collection of Wish Power Pearls, it could compromise Miao Yi's position as Cave Lord. In such a case, changes would be necessary, regardless of any gifts or bribes presented. With a signal, Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao set off, the horses breaking into a spirited gallop... Within the secluded confines of the Meditation Chamber atop Zhenhai Mountain, Qin Weiwei concluded her cultivation session. Pressing her palms to her Dantian, a six-petaled lotus flower of light blossomed at her brow, pulsating with life. Her eyes fluttered open to find her maids, Hong Mian and Lu Liu, bowing and beaming, 'Congratulations to the Mountain Lord for advancing yet another rank in cultivation.' Qin Weiwei retracted her spiritual energy and secured the Wish Power Pearl from her mouth. Descending from the stone couch, she offered a modest smile, 'It is but a breakthrough to White Lotus Sixth Rank.' Although she downplayed her achievement, the unmistakable elation on her face spoke volumes. The maids exchanged knowing smiles, assisting her to disrobe. Freed from the constraints of her attire, Qin Weiwei's figure, reminiscent of Mutton Fat Jade, was unveiled within the chamber—a sight that could stir the heart of any onlooker. Her pristine Jade Feet stepped gingerly into the warm waters of the pool. Submerging herself, the water level rose just enough to conceal her bountiful, blushing bosom—an image of pure enticement. Hong Mian and Lu Liu unfurled her hair, and together they began the tender task of cleansing her. As Hong Mian's hands, holding a soft towel, grazed over Qin Weiwei's full chest, she remarked playfully, 'The Mountain Lord's figure is indeed enviable. To forego seeking a companion for dual cultivation is a shame.' 'Indeed,' Lu Liu concurred with a mischievous grin, 'It's akin to hiding away a treasure bestowed by the heavens!' Qin Weiwei's cheeks bloomed with the delicate flush of a peach blossom at the maids' teasing words, and she chided, 'You two impudent girls!' She then playfully splashed water at them in jest. The sounds of mirth reverberated through the steaming sanctum of the cleansing chamber as the maids dodged and pleaded for mercy. Once the frolicking subsided, Hong Mian spoke with a touch of seriousness, 'Mountain Lord, we have a confidential matter to disclose. The Prefecture Head once summoned us to ask about a certain issue.' As Qin Weiwei permitted the maids to towel her dry, her curiosity peaked, 'What did the Prefecture Head inquire about?' Suppressing a giggle, Lu Liu revealed, 'He was curious if you had taken a liking to any man. He instructed us to inform him immediately should there be someone, promising to discreetly make arrangements on your behalf.' Qin Weiwei's cheeks burned with renewed color as she retorted, 'Father has truly lost all sense of propriety! With a myriad of pressing matters to attend to, he wastes his time on such frivolities. Should he inquire again, tell him I have no interest in such matters. I am perfectly content in solitude!' Hong Mian laughed softly, 'We wouldn't dare convey such a message to the Prefecture Head; he might think us the instigators. Perhaps it's best to wait until you find someone to your liking before we report back.' 'I have no intention of seeking!' Qin Weiwei declared firmly, 'What good are men? Not one is worth the trouble.' Glancing about, she added, 'You are better off serving me. Observe how men treat their maids—claiming them as servants, yet ultimately, they all become concubines. The mere thought is repulsive!' Lu Liu discreetly stuck out her tongue, wisely choosing silence over commentary, especially given the implied critique of the Prefecture Head. Hong Mian proposed, 'Perhaps, Mountain Lord, we should be patient. We'll keep watch for a man of appropriate stature who does not consign his maids to the bedchamber.' 'Indecent and shameless! Have you both succumbed to the whims of spring? Perhaps I should send you away to become concubines!' Qin Weiwei's voice carried the chill of a winter breeze as she issued a veiled reproof, before deftly steering the conversation elsewhere, 'Has there been any disturbance outside?' As the discussion turned to weightier matters, Hong Mian's expression grew serious, 'All is calm. The sole item of note is a petition delivered overnight from Donglai Cave. The messenger awaits within the mountain, ready to carry back the Mountain Lord's directive.' 'Donglai Cave? That man has scarcely departed, and already a petition has been submitted. He had better not be taking me lightly,' Qin Weiwei's ire flared at the thought of Miao Yi, and she commanded, 'Bring me the petition.' 'As you wish!' Lu Liu promptly rose, dried off, donned a robe, and hastened away. She returned shortly, presenting the sealed container which held the petition, unsealing it on the spot, and placing it beside the pool. Qin Weiwei let her raven hair drape elegantly over her shoulder, leaning back against the edge, and reached into the box... Why this multitude of petitions? Had the Cave Lord penned a treatise or an ode of considerable length? She extracted a Jade Slip, infusing it with her spiritual energy to peruse its content, and then swiftly moved to the next. Yet, the more she read, the more her expression betrayed confusion and disarray. After reviewing the contents, she doubted her own eyes, hastily re-examining each petition with careful attention. Still unconvinced after the second perusal, she scrutinized each Jade Slip once more, searching for any signs of tampering. Setting the Jade Slip aside, Qin Weiwei's brow furrowed deeply, her eyes flickered with bewilderment and uncertainty, while she muttered to herself, 'What could this man possibly be plotting...' Hong Mian and Lu Liu, cautious not to disrupt the Mountain Lord's official duties, sensed that something was amiss with Qin Weiwei. They couldn't grasp what Cave Lord Miao Yi had written to leave the Mountain Lord so perplexed. Yet, they did not perceive any anger in her demeanor. Exchanging glances, the maids took note of the extensive number of Jade Slip petitions. It appeared that a single submission from Donglai Cave held the collective weight of all the petitions submitted by the Cave Lords of Zhenhai Mountain combined. Chapter 77: Qin Weiwei became disordered (Part 2) After waiting in silence, with Qin Weiwei still deeply immersed in her thoughts and showing no sign of response, Hong Mian tentatively asked, 'Shan Zhu, could there be some trouble at Donglai Cave?' '......' Regaining her senses yet still entangled in her thoughts, Qin Weiwei struggled with what to say. She faintly gestured with her hand, 'Look at this and help me analyze what exactly is happening at Donglai Cave.' Due to their roles as attendants, they would normally not dare to scrutinize such matters without the Shan Zhu's express command. Qin Weiwei's unusual display of confusion had piqued their curiosity. With her permission, they eagerly examined the jade slip. To their astonishment, they too felt their thoughts become disordered after reading its contents. Exchanging glances and scrutinizing the slip multiple times, they shared Qin Weiwei's suspicions, questioning the authenticity of the documents. They checked and double-checked to be certain. The ten petitions were unmistakably inscribed by ten different individuals, each with a unique mana signature. The signature Dharma Seals, as unforgeable as fingerprints, served as irrefutable personal identifiers. Lu Liu, still clutching the jade slip, commented in awe, 'Cave Lord Miao is incredibly formidable! He has managed to subdue the entirety of Donglai Cave in just one night!' Qin Weiwei, deeply engrossed in thought, couldn't suppress an eye roll at the remark. She turned to her attendants and skeptically inquired, 'With his level of cultivation, do you truly deem that possible?' Hong Mian murmured, 'It is indeed exceedingly strange!' Both attendants, having served Qin Weiwei for some time, were well-versed in the affairs of Nanxuan Prefecture. For Prefecture Head Yang Qing, welcoming the Blue Jade Sect into his domain was akin to harboring a wolf in one's home. Initially, Yang Qing harbored no immediate ambitions for rebellion, preferring to accumulate power gradually. But the former Prefecture Head Lu Yu, unwilling to witness Yang Qing's rise, summoned him to serve closely, determined to neutralize his influence. Realizing that closeness to Lu Yu would spell the end of his rise, Yang Qing made a decisive move, allying with the Blue Jade Sect to overthrow Lu Yu and take control of Nanxuan Prefecture. Though Yang Qing and the Blue Jade Sect both benefited from the alliance, they were cognizant of the implications. The Blue Jade Sect recognized that Yang Qing was not one to be content in subordination and would inevitably seek to curtail their influence over Nanxuan. Yang Qing, on the other hand, was aware that the Blue Jade Sect's current hesitation was only a front; they would surely scheme to replace him once they established firm ties through this incursion. Yang Qing's daring rebellion was bolstered by the network he had cultivated within the system, with allies near the Fa Wang interceding on his behalf. Without the Fa Wang's endorsement, even if Yang Qing laid claim to Nanxuan, it would not be recognized, and he could potentially be accused of rebellion. The Blue Jade Sect's cautiousness stemmed from their lack of influential connections, which made them wary of confronting the formidable systemic power. Should they secure such ties, the Blue Jade Sect's adherents in Nanxuan Prefecture would outnumber Yang Qing's, posing a significant threat to his position. Both parties understood that their cooperation was provisional. In perhaps fifty years, their alliance might dissolve, and either the east or the west wind would prevail. Due to Yang Qing's shortage of allies, while key positions in Nanxuan Prefecture were held by his supporters, the Blue Jade Sect occupied nearly all other significant roles. Zhenhai Mountain faced a similar predicament; Qin Weiwei coped with the Blue Jade Sect disciples' facade of obedience and their covert defiance. Nevertheless, as Yang Qing's goddaughter, Qin Weiwei's direct subordinates from the Blue Jade Sect did not dare challenge her openly, showing some deference to Yang Qing. However, the Cave Lords under Qin Weiwei lacked this advantage. The petitions from nine Cave Lords were filled with grievances about the Blue Jade Sect disciples' duplicity, making their positions increasingly untenable. One Cave Lord, the weakest among them, sent the only beacon of good news. A White Lotus First Rank Cave Lord had executed a Blue Jade Sect disciple with White Lotus Third Rank cultivation. This could have been the catalyst for a conflict between the Blue Jade Sect and Yang Qing. Instead, the Blue Jade Sect collectively vilified Song Fu, asserting his fate was justified, listing his heinous actions, and unifying in condemnation and full support of the Cave Lord's actions, leaving the Blue Jade Sect little room for objection. Upon receiving this news, Qin Weiwei was not elated but filled with questions. How had that scoundrel, newly arrived, so swiftly taken control of Donglai Cave? And with Blue Jade Sect disciples staunchly rallying behind the formidable Cave Lord Miao... Was this not farcical? It was stomach-turning. What did this signify? Was it a slap to the nine Cave Lords, or to Qin Weiwei herself, the Shan Zhu? Were they all less capable than Cave Lord Miao? Was her initial reluctance to send Miao to assume the role of Donglai's Cave Lord misguided? Yet, if it were all a farce, how could the credibility of these testimonies be doubted? Was Song Fu truly that detestable? How odious must one be to unite all disciples of the Blue Jade Sect against him? Qin Weiwei shook her head slightly, finding the notion implausible. Even if Song Fu were that reprehensible, it seemed unlikely that all Blue Jade Sect disciples would issue petitions condemning him and pledging allegiance to the mighty Cave Lord Miao. The man had just arrived, and with such modest cultivation, from whence did he derive such immense influence? If anyone suggested that his mere presence commanded enough sway to convince them, Qin Weiwei would outright dismiss such a notion. Hong Mian and Lu Liu also furrowed their brows, equally perplexed by the unfolding events. 'No more bathing, help me get dressed, and summon that messenger!' Qin Weiwei ordered as she rose from the water and stepped onto the shore. Casting a spell, a mist of Mutton Fat Jade erupted, evaporating the water droplets on her skin. The attendants quickly clothed her and styled her hair into a bun, secured by six snow-white jade hairpins fashioned into butterflies. In the grand hall of Zhenhai Mountain, Shan Zhu Qin Weiwei sat with an air of imposing authority. Shan Biaoyi, standing below, felt his heart race with each of Qin Weiwei's questions. Despite her persistent probing, he insisted that Song Fu's insubordination led to the gate's destruction and his subsequent disrespect warranted his slaying by the Cave Lord as a just punishment and to serve as a deterrence. Qin Weiwei had little reason to question Miao Yi's ability to slay a White Lotus Third Rank cultivator. The clash at Gleaming Light Cave and Miao Yi's triumph over a Ghost Cultivator, with two White Lotus Third Rank cultivators perishing, made it plausible that Miao Yi could eliminate Song Fu. Nevertheless, she was no simpleton. Could it really be so straightforward to align all of Donglai Cave's Blue Jade Sect disciples behind Miao Yi and absolve him of any wrongdoing? 'Shan Biaoyi, are you absolutely certain there is nothing you are concealing from me?' Qin Weiwei's piercing gaze locked onto the man below as she uttered a cold rebuke. Those at the lower rungs were often oblivious to the power plays at the highest levels. Shan Biaoyi knew of his direct involvement in the demise of Song Fu. Admitting as much would not only alienate him from Donglai Cave but also provoke the Blue Jade Sect's vengeance, and risk forfeiting the opportunity to amass a bounty of Wish Power Pearls. As such, he adamantly clung to his narrative, leaving Qin Weiwei feeling somewhat helpless and leading her to suspect that Donglai Cave might truly have been united into a solid front overnight by that man. It seemed implausible to believe that the man had simply chanced upon a cohort of fiercely loyal supporters by mere good fortune. Such a tale was more fitting of a children's fable than the reality she faced. Chapter 78: Qin Weiwei's Disturbance (Part Three) 'You may leave us,' Qin Weiwei ordered coldly, sending Shan Biaoyi away. After his departure, Hong Mian cautiously ventured, 'Mountain Lord, should we make the Prefecture Head aware of this situation?' 'How can I report anything when the full picture is still so murky?' Qin Weiwei retorted, her head shaking in disapproval. She promptly instructed Lu Liu to bring forth a disciple from the Blue Jade Sect at random. Before long, a Blue Jade Sect disciple made his appearance, bowing before Qin Weiwei. 'Do you recognize your sect brother, Song Fu?' she inquired. 'Song Fu?' The disciple looked befuddled, unaware of the events that had unfolded, yet he affirmed, 'Yes, I am acquainted with him.' 'What can you tell me of his character?' Qin Weiwei pressed. The disciple, caught unawares by the line of questioning, respectfully responded, 'Brother Song is known for his honesty and simplicity, and he holds our teachings in high esteem. There is nothing to fault in his character.' Irrespective of the circumstances surrounding Song Fu or their personal rapport, it was imperative to endorse a fellow sect member when questioned by outsiders. In uncertain times, commending one's comrade was undeniably the correct approach. Upon the disciple's dismissal, Qin Weiwei, indicating the retreating figure, remarked to Hong Mian and Lu Liu, 'Did you witness that? That is how sect brothers should speak of one another, unlike the absurdity we've heard from Donglai Cave's ranks!' 'What do you intend to do, Mountain Lord?' Hong Mian inquired. Qin Weiwei stood, her intent clear. 'Seeing is believing. I will personally journey to Donglai Cave to ascertain whether they truly revere our 'illustrious' Cave Lord Miao as they profess. Should he dare cause any trouble or disrupt our plans, he will face my fury.' 'And if their allegiance is indeed sincere?' Lu Liu questioned. Qin Weiwei asserted with conviction, 'That's inconceivable. There is certainly some subterfuge at play. Were their loyalty genuine, I'd willingly relinquish my title as Mountain Lord to him. If he truly possesses such prowess, let him resolve the situation with the Blue Jade Sect disciples at Zhenhai Mountain and thus alleviate some of the Prefecture Head's burdens.' Hong Mian and Lu Liu exchanged a knowing glance, recognizing their Mountain Lord's exaggeration. However, arriving to inspect Donglai Cave so shortly after Miao Yi's appointment seemed somewhat impetuous... Having finally received a response, Shan Biaoyi was en route back to Donglai Cave. But his heart was fraught with anxiety, as Qin Weiwei, along with her attendants, had resolved to accompany him. The Cave Lord had barely taken office, and already the Mountain Lord was on her way. Shan Biaoyi sighed inwardly, silently praying for a flawless visit, hopeful that the Cave Lord had managed everything without a hitch. Once on board a ship of scoundrels, disembarking is rarely an option. Despite the vessel being riddled with leaks, those aboard must collaborate, rowing vigorously to stay afloat. To cease rowing is to succumb; to row is to cling to a sliver of hope. Ignorant of the intricate dynamics between Yang Qing and the Blue Jade Sect, Miao Yi, like many of his low-ranking peers, faced a common challenge. His recent pledge of loyalty to Yang Qing had not granted him much insight into the secretive workings of power. As the rightful Cave Lord of Donglai, Miao Yi expected absolute obedience. Immediate action against any defiance was not only his right but his obligation. Securing Donglai Cave firmly within his grasp was crucial; without such control, his tenure as Cave Lord would be rendered insignificant. Unaware of the upper echelons' trepidation over his swift and decisive takeover of Donglai Cave, Miao Yi relished the bliss of ignorance, sparing himself undue concern for the time being. Meanwhile, Miao Yi roamed the streets of Donglai Town, garbed in his finest. Zhu Tianbiao, the reticent sentinel, rarely initiated conversation. His attempts at flattery were clumsy at best, and he often remained silent, trailing Miao Yi with a sword at the ready, the very image of a faithful guardian. Miao Yi had intentionally brought Zhu Tianbiao along for his protection, as the company of a White Lotus Third Rank cultivator offered significant defense against potential threats. As they passed a pavilion adorned in red, they observed a large crowd. A noble family's young maiden was engaged in the traditional ritual of throwing the embroidered ball—a matchmaking event that momentarily captured Miao Yi's and Zhu Tianbiao's attention, though they chose not to stay. The maiden, shy yet eager, held the embroidered ball tightly, her eyes scouring the crowd for an ideal match. Her gaze swiftly settled on Miao Yi. His rise to Cave Lord at such a young age, along with the inherent vibrancy of a cultivator, distinguished him from the common folk. The guardian standing behind him clearly signaled his status. With determination, the maiden launched the embroidered ball towards Miao Yi. Her throw was robust and accurate, indicating she might have practiced for this exact moment—for attracting an unsuitable suitor would be quite the predicament. As the ball soared, the crowd stretched out their hands eagerly, only to watch it sail past them. Without sparing a glance, Miao Yi flicked his wrist, and the ball was sent flying back to the pavilion. Zhu Tianbiao glanced sideways and continued to accompany Miao Yi, passing the astounded crowd without a word. The maiden, clutching the returned ball, stood in disbelief. As she watched the two men depart without a care, she gnawed her lip in vexation. For a woman of her standing, such an event was unprecedented—the ball she had cast out being returned to her was unheard of. Beneath the pavilion, the crowd was flabbergasted, stretching on tiptoes to follow the retreating figures. They then turned to each other, erupting in urging cheers, 'Miss, throw again, throw again...' The maiden, her lip bitten in indignation, vanished from view into the pavilion... Within Donglai Town, a tranquil river cut across the landscape. After Zhu Tianbiao had inquired about the fare, both he and Miao Yi stepped onto a black-canopied boat moored at the bank. The boatman commenced rowing, guiding them along the river's gentle current. Miao Yi stood poised at the prow, hands clasped behind him, while Zhu Tianbiao, ever vigilant, stood at the stern with his sword at the ready. They hadn't traveled far when the rhythmic beat of hooves resounded from the riverbank. Glancing back, they spotted the maiden who had thrown the embroidered ball, now flanked by several stalwart men, hot on their trail. 'Halt!' she bellowed, gesturing at Miao Yi at the bow. Surveying his surroundings, Miao Yi subtly displayed the mystical lotus mirage on his forehead, aiming to discourage her from pursuing further. Yet, the maiden continued her chase, undeterred by the threat of immortals. Miao Yi then realized his oversight—he had applied spirit-concealing mud to his forehead, masking the mirage. His penchant for using the mud to hide his lower cultivation level had now backfired. As Cave Lord, the prospect of being ridiculed was intolerable, so he opted to conceal the hallmark of his spiritual prowess. With no other recourse, he covertly signaled Zhu Tianbiao. Zhu Tianbiao turned sharply, exposing the lotus mirage on his own forehead. The sight stunned the maiden and her entourage, arresting them in their pursuit and silencing their audacity. The maiden's fanciful dreams of spring promptly dissipated as she realized the reason for his indifference. She sensed the vast chasm between them and bit her lip in a silent admission of defeat... For Miao Yi, however, this was but a minor diversion. Chapter 79: Qin Weiwei's Disarray (Part 4) Willows draped green along the riverbanks, where women could occasionally be seen squatting at the water's edge, laundering clothes and rinsing vegetables. Brothels lined the way, with courtesans leaning on railings, waving handkerchiefs and calling out in sweet, coquettish voices to lure travelers passing by on the boats. Further on, where the river ran green, groups of young noblemen composed poems, hoping to draw the attention of maidens strolling in clusters, who cast shy glances towards the noble figures standing proudly at the bows of the black-canopied boats. On the flower boats that glided close by, heavily made-up madams called out loudly to the gentlemen on the boats, inviting them to come aboard and partake in the revelry of the floral wines. Above in the taverns, rowdy patrons called out to their friends, trading punches in jest and drinking heartily together. The riverbank was alive with the hustle and bustle of merchants and porters, while children chased one another, lost in their games. Living by the water is human instinct; the journey by boat revealed the full splendor of Donglai Town. Although the inhabitants must dedicate three hours each day to generating Wish Power and pay their taxes, they receive the protection of the cultivators in return, who ward off demons and evil spirits, safeguarding peace for all. The Six Saints of Heaven and Earth, too, rely on the collective effort of cultivators in all regions to amass vast amounts of Wish Power—without them, even their vast powers would be insufficient to cover such an expanse. It is the presence of these cultivators that ensures the local nobility and powers-that-be dare not overly oppress their followers, lest they disrupt the collection of Wish Power Pearls and invoke the ire of the cultivators first and foremost. While cultivators may not often show themselves openly, they nonetheless firmly establish the order of this world. Of course, not everyone living along the riverbank is bound to the same daily toil of generating Wish Power. Those with power and influence can outsource their tasks to places like 'Ciyuan Manor' or even hire others to fulfill their duties. And so, those who toil continue to toil, and those who indulge continue their indulgences—the immutable law of life. Regardless, for Miao Yi, standing at the prow of the boat surveying his domain, the sight of his followers living harmoniously eased his concerns about the annual contribution of Wish Power Pearls... As darkness fell, Shan Biaoyi rode his Longju under the moon and stars, his heart filled with anxiety. Drawing near to Donglai Cave, he pressed on with determination, slightly trailing behind Qin Weiwei, and respectfully addressed her, 'Mountain Lord, I shall immediately notify the residence to prepare for your arrival and welcome the Mountain Lord's Dharma Chariot.' His true aim was to alert the Cave Lord and the others, to mentally prepare them for what was to come. Qin Weiwei looked back at him with a piercing glance, her eyes icy as the winter moon, and replied curtly, 'No need.' Then she turned to the cultivators following her in swift pursuit, 'Keep a watch on him, ensure he sends no messages. I wish to see for myself what tricks Donglai Cave is up to!' Shan Biaoyi's heart skipped a beat as two 白莲三品修士 (White Lotus Third Rank cultivators) quickly closed in on him, trapping him in their midst. The party of five, under the silver light of the moon, raced toward the 山门 (Mountain Gate) of Donglai Cave with the speed of lightning. 商又来 (Shang Youlai), the guardian of the gate, emerged abruptly from the shadows, 提枪 (ti qiang) in hand, and bellowed a command, 'Halt and dismount!' His voice echoed, serving as a warning to the others within the dwelling. At the signal, figures from different corners of the estate appeared instantly, speeding toward 'Sleeping Dragon Valley.' Six silhouettes, weapons in hand, rode their Longju at breakneck speed to face the unexpected. Mountain Lord Qin Weiwei was not one to break protocol by storming the 山门 (Mountain Gate); she signaled her followers to halt. They reined in their mounts abruptly before the gate, narrowly avoiding being thrown off. Across the gate, another six fierce Longju approached with an air of menace. Qin Weiwei was somewhat surprised by Donglai Cave's swift response; their efficiency was not ordinary. For Miao Yi had made it clear—if the 山门 (Mountain Gate) were to be smashed again, it would be Wang Zifa who would answer for it. Furthermore, Miao Yi had warned that those who disobeyed would not receive a single Wish Power Pearl and would face expulsion. Where else could they find such favorable treatment in any other cave dwelling? Everyone was keen to do their utmost, lest they invite Miao Yi's questioning. Upon recognizing Mountain Lord Qin Weiwei, the gatekeeper 商又来 (Shang Youlai) immediately fell silent and saluted with a fist. 阎修 (Yan Xiu) and the others, who had rushed to the scene in anticipation of trouble, exchanged looks and quickly dismounted, advancing to the gate to offer their respectful greetings. Some glanced questioningly at Shan Biaoyi, who had accompanied Qin Weiwei, wondering why he hadn't signaled the Mountain Lord's approach in advance. Whispers and secret messages were exchanged among them, seeking to understand the situation. But Shan Biaoyi was in a predicament; the two cultivators at his side had prepared to thwart any attempts at communication, casting spells to disrupt his efforts. Qin Weiwei glanced at the 牌坊 (Gateway Arch) and snorted with disdain, 'This archway stands even more majestic than that of Nanxuan Prefecture!' The crowd caught the hint of disdain in her voice and were unsure of how to respond. After sweeping her gaze across the assembly, Qin Weiwei led her entourage into the cave, striding directly toward the 大殿 (Grand Hall) where she dismounted authoritatively. Shan Biaoyi was led in tow, entering the Grand Hall behind Qin Weiwei. Finding the Grand Hall deserted, Qin Weiwei proceeded to the rear courtyard where the Cave Lord resided. There, 黑炭 (Black Charcoal) lay sprawled by the doorway, idly swishing his tail against the ground. At the sight of Qin Weiwei, he shot up, eyes wide with alarm, seemingly unsure where to hide. With no other option, Black Charcoal leaped dozens of meters high, landing beyond the boundaries of the residence, and swiftly made his escape. That beast! Qin Weiwei was a mix of annoyance and amusement. Was she truly so terrifying? She might not be fond of Black Charcoal, but she was above resorting to petty vengeance by storming into a subordinate's home at night to slaughter their mount. Such a spiteful act would disgrace her, and she would not allow herself to be seen in such a light. Miao Yi was nowhere to be found outside, so Qin Weiwei boldly entered his private chambers unannounced, searching thoroughly but finding no trace. Emerging from the chambers, she noticed a side room lit from within. She marched over and, with a forceful kick, the door burst open. Inside, two beautiful maids, scantily clad, screamed in fright, clinging to each other, trembling before the intruding figure of Qin Weiwei. It was clear that these maids, who lived in the Cave Lord's private quarters, were Miao Yi's attendants. Qin Weiwei glanced at her own attendant, 红棉 (Hong Mian), with a look that carried a mocking edge—as if to comment on the predictable behavior of men. Hong Mian remained silent, her smile the only response. This time, she was the only one to accompany Qin Weiwei; 绿柳 (Lu Liu) had not come. After failing to find Miao Yi, Qin Weiwei fixed a cold stare on the two trembling maidservants and demanded, 'Where has your Cave Lord gone?' The maids remained silent, shaking their heads. With a contemptuous 'hmph,' Qin Weiwei did not bother to argue with the maids any further. She left the room and returned to the 大殿 (Grand Hall), ascending to the high seat that belonged to Miao Yi. Overlooking the entrance, she called out with authority, '阎修 (Yan Xiu)!' Yan Xiu, who had been standing among the crowd outside, rushed into the hall, bowing and scraping. Chapter 80: Drag Out and Behead Qin Weiwei inquired, 'Where has Miao Yi gone?' Yan Xiu, with a forced smile, responded, 'The Cave Lord is out inspecting the territories under his domain.' Qin Weiwei paused, surprised at how swiftly Miao Yi felt secure enough to delegate the cave's affairs and venture out. She probed further, 'When will he return?' 'That...' Yan Xiu faltered, 'I am not privy to the Cave Lord's schedule of return.' Qin Weiwei let out a cold snort, 'Then summon him back at once.' Yan Xiu's heart sank; the vastness of Donglai Cave's territory made the task daunting. He dared not voice his concern fully, yet the implication was clear. Qin Weiwei, realizing the undue hardship, refrained from persisting. Instead, she started interrogating individuals about the execution of Song Fu and the subsequent petitions of condemnation. 'Has Miao Yi coerced you in any manner?' 'Why would the Mountain Lord insinuate such? The Cave Lord has not resorted to threats. Song Fu's insolence was beyond tolerance; even as fellow sect members, we could no longer stand idly by...' Efforts to muzzle Shan Biaoyi proved futile; no matter how slyly Qin Weiwei inquired or how she threatened or tempted, the uniform response was of censure for Song Fu's faults and staunch support for the distinguished Cave Lord Miao Yi. This left Qin Weiwei gritting her teeth in vexation. If only all of Zhenhai Mountain were as united as Donglai Cave. Alas, Donglai stood alone in this regard. Something was clearly amiss, yet whether it was her own appointees like Yan Xiu or those from the Blue Jade Sect, all stood as one, tight-lipped and unyielding. Qin Weiwei resolved to settle accounts with Miao Yi upon his return. Yet, three days elapsed with no sign of Miao Yi, casting doubt on when he might return. The most irksome matter for her was the flawless order maintained in Donglai Cave, even without the Cave Lord's presence. While other Cave Lords lamented Blue Jade Sect disciples shunning gate-guarding and menial tasks, such complaints were non-existent in Donglai Cave. There, it was Miao Yi's loyal aides like Yan Xiu who were relieved from these duties, with Blue Jade Sect disciples fulfilling their obligations with zeal. Furthermore, Wang Zifa and others exhibited considerable deference towards Yan Xiu, indicative of their esteem for the formidable Cave Lord Miao. Consider the authority Miao Yi wielded; he had, in a single night, brought Donglai Cave to order, commanding high regard from his subordinates. Her own appointees grappled with their charges, incessantly presenting grievances, while Miao Yi, whom she had reluctantly appointed, managed everything impeccably. Was this not a rebuke to her own authority? Qin Weiwei, stewing in silent contemplation, nearly choked on the bitterness of her frustration. Was she misjudging Miao Yi with undue suspicion? In these times of strife, she could not linger indefinitely, and the whereabouts of Miao Yi remained a mystery. After a three-day vigil, she departed, taking Shan Biaoyi with her. The sight of Yan Xiu and the rest, their expressions fraught with anxiety as they bade farewell at the mountain gate, attested to the severity of the situation. Everyone was cognizant that if Shan Biaoyi crumbled and disclosed everything, the repercussions would extend beyond the acquisition of Wish Power Pearls from Cave Lord Miao. The ire of the Blue Jade Sect would be unavoidable. Yan Xiu and his comrades had slain a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect. And the Blue Jade Sect disciples had, in essence, committed treason. Amidst the current tumult, they were beset with fear and regret, cursing the day they had joined this ill-fated venture. Despite Qin Weiwei's lucrative overtures, they dared not desert, remaining steadfast with the sinking ship they had so unwisely embarked upon. Qin Weiwei, discerning the unease in their expressions, solidified her conviction that there was a conspiracy afoot. Attendant Hong Mian, observing her master's intense scrutiny, could barely suppress a smirk, realizing that regardless of any underlying machinations, the unity demonstrated was a clear affirmation of Cave Lord Miao Yi's leadership. It came as no surprise that he confidently left the cave's operations to others and roamed freely. If other Cave Lords possessed such capability, the governance of Zhenhai Mountain would be much less challenging. She wondered if the Mountain Lord's vow to relinquish her position to Cave Lord Miao Yi, should he genuinely secure the fealty of his subordinates, was uttered in earnest... Qin Weiwei, catching her attendant's inquisitive gaze, gave her a sharp look—were her impulsive words to be taken literally? Qin Weiwei, having rushed back to Zhenhai Mountain, wasted no time upon her return. After addressing pressing affairs, she proceeded with Shan Biaoyi to Nanxuan Prefecture. Miao Yi, whom she had appointed as the Cave Lord of Donglai Cave, appeared to have courted trouble. Concealment was futile; the incident was destined to come to light. Regardless of the Blue Jade Sect's reaction, they were bound to make inquiries. Qin Weiwei felt compelled to report the details personally, to keep Yang Qing abreast of the situation. Learning of their impending visit to Nanxuan Prefecture, Shan Biaoyi's anxiety intensified. Was the matter escalating unnecessarily? Those at the lower rungs were blind to the high-stakes chess game played by their superiors—the complex power struggles at play. Had they been apprised, they might have hesitated before acting so audaciously. Upon arriving at Nanxuan Prefecture, Qin Weiwei's status afforded her immediate audience with Yang Qing. Following Attendant Qingju, she ascended to the pavilion atop the highest peak of the rear mountain, finding Yang Qing deep in meditation. 'Qin Weiwei pays respects to the Prefecture Head!' Clad in a robe as white as snow, Qin Weiwei offered her salutations. In the presence of others, Qin Weiwei always adhered to the formalities due her superior, Yang Qing. Only in the most private moments would she address him as 'Father'. Yang Qing gently concluded his meditation, and as he opened his eyes, he expelled a Wish Power Pearl the size of a quail egg. He greeted her with a smile, 'Weiwei, what brings you here?' He arose and seated himself beside the tea table, gesturing for her to sit, 'What matters are at hand?' Qin Weiwei took her place opposite him, 'Prefecture Head, I fear the Cave Lord of Donglai Cave you personally selected may have caused you some trouble.' Yang Qing emitted a soft 'oh', his brow creasing slightly, 'Miao Yi? What trouble has he now stirred?' 'Prefecture Head, please review these documents.' Qin Weiwei presented the box containing the petitions before him. Yang Qing perused the contents, momentarily unsettled. Under the watchful eyes of Attendants Qingmei and Qingju, who exchanged knowing glances, Yang Qing meticulously re-examined each jade slip. A man of composure, his reaction was more subdued than Qin Weiwei's initial shock; he inquired with mild intrigue, 'Weiwei, what exactly is this about?' 'I am as perplexed as you. To verify the matter, I journeyed to Donglai Cave, only to discover that Miao Yi had departed on an inspection of his territory...' Qin Weiwei recounted the situation in detail. Yang Qing, fingers rhythmically tapping on the tabletop, mused for an extended period. Shaking his head, he found himself at an impasse, ultimately declaring, 'Bring forth the one you've brought. I shall question him myself.' Shan Biaoyi was promptly summoned. Now face-to-face with Yang Qing, a man of great stature, and burdened by his own secrets, he was overcome by trepidation. Nevertheless, he achieved one thing: regardless of how Yang Qing inquired, he repeated his established narrative. Yang Qing did not engage in roundabout questioning as Qin Weiwei had. Standing, he advanced slowly to the pavilion's railing, surveying the distant mountains, his hands casually clasped behind him, his expression serene, his voice firm, 'Take him away for execution.' Attendants Qingmei and Qingju sprang into action, swiftly securing Shan Biaoyi's shoulders, immobilizing him, and without delay, they dragged him away to meet his end. Chapter Eighty-One: The Admission This was no laughing matter. With Qingmei and Qingju both possessing the cultivation of White Lotus Seventh Rank (Bai Lian Qi Pin), they easily subdued Shan Biaoyi, whose inferior White Lotus Second Rank (Bai Lian Er Pin) afforded him no chance of resistance. He was apprehended so swiftly that he barely had time to react. Qin Weiwei spared only a brief glance for the dragged-away Shan Biaoyi. Miao Yi was Yang Qing's chosen appointee, and she had to acknowledge this, if not for Miao Yi's sake, then for Yang Qing's. It wouldn't do to execute one of Miao Yi's men without clear evidence, although Yang Qing had the authority to do so without facing any consequences. Caught off guard, Shan Biaoyi only started to comprehend his plight when he was already being dragged out of the pavilion, fear clawing at his very soul. He knew Yang Qing was likely trying to frighten him into spilling the truth. Yet he also knew that Yang Qing's word was final. If he couldn't satisfy Yang Qing with his answers, his life was as good as forfeit. For Yang Qing, eliminating him would be of little significance. "Prefecture Head, I have sinned, I will confess, please give me another opportunity, Prefecture Head, I'll speak..." Shan Biaoyi's cries and pleas for mercy echoed as he was pulled outside the pavilion, his face deathly pale. Yang Qing, who had been gazing at the distant mountain ridges, did not turn to face him but simply raised a hand in a quiet gesture. Qingmei and Qingju exchanged looks and released Shan Biaoyi. A dread-filled Shan Biaoyi stumbled into the pavilion, falling to his knees behind Yang Qing. "Prefecture Head, I will tell everything!" Without turning, Yang Qing's voice was calm yet carried the weight of authority. "Why did the Blue Jade Sect collectively accuse Song Fu?" "It was under the coercion of... the Master of Donglai Cave, Miao Yi!" Shan Biaoyi managed to get the words out, his expression filled with remorse. He worried that if Miao Yi remained as the Master of Donglai Cave after this, there'd be no place for him there. Qingmei and Qingju listened intently, while Qin Weiwei's gaze flickered, perhaps on the verge of unraveling the mystery. Anyone could guess that the Blue Jade Sect must have been pressured. The only question was what methods Miao Yi had used. "Explain everything, from start to finish," commanded Yang Qing, his voice as unruffled as a serene lake yet resonating with unspoken power. Knowing full well that any inconsistency in his story would spell his doom, Shan Biaoyi recounted the events, his voice heavy with the gravity of his situation. "To the Prefecture Head, it truly was the Blue Jade Sect who first acted without respect. Before Master Miao took over Donglai Cave, the Blue Jade Sect disciples openly defied the acting manager's orders and were confrontational at every turn. Despite their overwhelming numbers, we were at a loss. On the day Master Miao assumed his position, upon reaching the gates of Donglai Cave and finding them unattended, he let out a thunderous outcry..." Shan Biaoyi laid out the details with painstaking precision. From Yan Xiu and the others arriving at the gates after hearing the commotion to Miao Yi's scathing rebuke for the unguarded state of the esteemed Donglai Cave's entrance, and Yan Xiu's grievances about the Blue Jade Sect's misconduct. The Blue Jade Sect, with Song Fu leading them, arrived late and had the audacity to belittle Miao Yi. At this point, Yang Qing, still facing away from the crowd, narrowed his eyes, a cold gleam passing through. Miao Yi was his chosen envoy, and his brazen stance made it clear how the Blue Jade Sect would treat his other appointees. "What did your Cave Lord do in response?" Yang Qing asked, his tone deceptively mild. "Without a moment's delay, the Master of Donglai Cave ordered his subordinates to immediately proceed to Zhenhai Mountain and inform the Mountain Lord that the Blue Jade Sect had rebelled," replied Shan Biaoyi. "This shocked the Blue Jade Sect disciples, who then reluctantly greeted Master Miao. But Master Miao did not reciprocate their civility, immediately commanding Song Fu, of White Lotus Third Rank (Bai Lian San Pin), to guard the gate. Ignoring Song Fu's willingness, he drove his Dragon Steed (Long Ju) straight at them!" Yang Qing, who stood with clasped hands behind his back, allowed a faint smile to curl the corner of his lips. He could almost see Miao Yi's defiant and aggressive demeanor, not giving an inch and completely disregarding the Blue Jade Sect's disciples. This was exactly how he envisioned his own appointee to behave, a true source of pride. "And how did it come to pass that Song Fu was killed?" inquired Yang Qing. "In truth, it was not the Master of Donglai Cave who killed Song Fu, but rather myself, Yan Xiu, and Qiu Shaoqun, acting together..." Having already divulged so much, Shan Biaoyi did not see the point in withholding any further details. He narrated how Miao Yi had called them together, anticipated Song Fu's disobedience, and ordered Qiu Shaoqun to secretly destroy their own mountain gate to create a pretext for confronting Song Fu. Though they realized the gravity of the act, Miao Yi was adamant about making an example of Song Fu. Afterward, when Qiu Shaoqun shattered the gate, causing an uproar, Miao Yi took the opportunity to rage forth. While organizing a search for the enemy and dispersing the Blue Jade Sect disciples, he summoned Song Fu to the Donglai Grand Hall for questioning. Song Fu refused to admit any guilt, but the already concealed Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun, at Miao Yi's command, converged and cut down Song Fu inside the grand hall. Miao Yi then exerted pressure on the Blue Jade Sect disciples, forcing them to draft a petition under duress and to reconstruct the mountain gate overnight. They later banded together in a superficial effort to appease Qin Weiwei's subsequent inquiries, all of which Shan Biaoyi disclosed in full detail. After concluding, Shan Biaoyi bowed his head and said, "That is the entirety of the events." Qingmei and Qingju looked at each other, realizing they had underestimated the Master of Donglai Cave. Classifying him as endowed with both intellect and valor seemed an understatement. Within mere hours of his arrival, he had managed to bring the entire Donglai Cave under his control with decisive actions—a truly remarkable feat. Qin Weiwei bit her lip gently, the enigma now unraveled. She felt a pang of regret for having unearthed the truth, as it only served to highlight the young man's bravado, portraying him as the sole capable individual in all of Zhenhai Mountain, which irked her immensely. Yang Qing, who had been meditating with closed eyes, turned around to face the kneeling Shan Biaoyi. "Rise," he said simply. "Thank you, Master!" Shan Biaoyi stood, his face a mixture of relief and apprehension, wondering what lay ahead for him. Surprisingly, Yang Qing did not further torment him but offered, "Let not a word of today's conversation reach the ears of outsiders. Act as if this never happened. No one will hold you to account. Should any issue arise in Donglai Cave from now on, I grant you the privilege to report directly and covertly to the Mountain Lord of Zhenhai Mountain. Do you understand what I'm saying?" Shan Biaoyi, initially stunned, quickly lit up with joy, understanding Yang Qing's intent. He was being reassured that his confession would remain a secret, and he was now personally appointed as an informant within Donglai Cave—a sign that he had caught Yang Qing's favorable eye. Unexpectedly, what seemed like a dire situation had turned into a stroke of good fortune. "I understand and will obey," Shan Biaoyi replied with joy, clasping his hands in salute. The shock, fear, and subsequent relief were so intense they almost overwhelmed him; the reversal of his fortune was almost too much to grasp. Chapter 82: The Insightful Cave Lord 'Reward him!' Yang Qing commanded with a smile and an affirming nod. Qian'er quickly produced a softly luminescent Wish Power Pearl from her Storage Bag, presenting it to Shan Biaoyi. 'This humble one thanks the Cave Lord for his generous gift!' An overjoyed Shan Biaoyi bowed repeatedly in gratitude. 'You may leave,' Yang Qing dismissed with a casual wave. As Shan Biaoyi made his way down the mountain, Yang Qing chuckled and shook his head, 'To think he'd start his tenure by clandestinely smashing his own Mountain Gate, such audacity. His strategic acumen and valor mark him as an asset. As a Mountain Lord, he could relieve many of my concerns. His cultivation level is a bit low, though; being a Cave Lord is a stretch, let alone a higher position. I had placed him, a White Lotus First Rank, no less, in charge of Donglai Cave to test the waters in Nanxuan Prefecture, to see if my words carry weight, not out of whim. I wanted to identify any dissenters. Initially, I was apprehensive about entrusting Donglai Cave to him, worried if it was the right decision. But now, it appears the lad has quite the aptitude; my worries were unfounded.' Qian'er and Xue'er exchanged glances, recognizing Yang Qing's growing appreciation for Miao Yi. They knew he would be called upon again when the time was right and understood the need to treat Cave Lord Miao with due respect from now on. Meanwhile, Qin Weiwei's lips curled with a hint of annoyance. Yang Qing, still wearing a grin, playfully prodded her, 'Weiwei, the Donglai Cave Lord I handpicked for you didn't disappoint, did he?' He was fully aware of the friction between his daughter and Miao Yi. Qin Weiwei, clearly irritated, approached him and retorted, 'He seems to be enjoying himself now, but I'm curious if he'll remain so carefree when it's time to deliver those Wish Power Pearls he promised to his followers!' Yang Qing burst into hearty laughter, shaking his head, 'Oh, Weiwei! The man I've chosen for you, you find him so disagreeable? It was merely the loss of your mount; you're fixating too much. Consider this: his subordinates are all compromised, having even betrayed their own sect for him. If he reneges on his promises later, do you really think they'd dare to confront him?' Qin Weiwei fell silent, the realization dawning on her. Settling back into his chair, Yang Qing lamented, 'If only Nanxuan Prefecture had more like him, the Blue Jade Sect wouldn't stand a chance, and our affairs would be much easier to manage.' Qin Weiwei frowned, 'Prefecture Head, after this ordeal, don't you find his scheming too deep?' Yang Qing softly disagreed, 'If he were truly scheming, he wouldn't have confronted you directly upon arrival. He would've first secured his exit strategy, ensuring no responsibility before taking action. His direct approach after the fact indicates he sees his actions as justified, hence his nonchalance in inspecting the territory afterward.' Qin Weiwei still wasn't satisfied, mumbling, 'No matter how you slice it, I see him as somewhat despicable and shameless. It's only because you favor him that he seems so agreeable to you.' Yang Qing chuckled helplessly, 'Whether it's your disapproval or my admiration, it's inconsequential. The clash at Gleaming Light Cave, his willingness to face formidable foes with but a White Lotus First Rank and not retreat, speaks volumes of his valor; the two White Lotus Third Rank cultivators under Xiong Xiao fell in the Changfeng Territory, yet he alone returned, mission accomplished; and when I assigned him to Donglai Cave, he was the only one among the Cave and Mountain Lords of Zhenhai Mountain, within Nanxuan Prefecture, to quickly and decisively stabilize the situation, while others cowered before the Blue Jade Sect, merely whining without presenting a single viable solution. Is this how they justify their rule? Miao Yi has never disappointed me. Isn't his capability unequivocal? Weiwei, as a leader, you must sometimes set aside personal biases and appreciate the strengths of your subordinates. No one is perfect; to recognize and utilize the talents of others is the hallmark of true leadership.' Qin Weiwei remained silent, accepting the validity of Yang Qing's reasoning, yet unable to shake her aversion to Miao Yi. She simply found the man unbearable! A father knows his daughter best. Observing her demeanor, Yang Qing gently shook his head, realizing it would take time to alter her perspective... At the bustling docks of Donglai Town, seagulls circled above the boundless ocean. Miao Yi, having spent days touring, quietly returned to the city for a brief encounter with Ji Xiufang before reaching the seaside where his journey began. The pier was alive with activity, with fresh seafood unloaded from boats and sailboats docking from voyages afar. After making inquiries, Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao resumed their journey. 'We can retain Xu Xinliang as Town Governor; he's proven competent,' Miao Yi commented upon leaving the pier. Zhu Tianbiao was quick to praise, 'Cave Lord, your judgment is impeccable!' Miao Yi, unimpressed, rolled his eyes. What does it have to do with my judgment? It's about recognizing someone else's capable appointment. He found the flattery unwarranted. Riding along the shoreline, Miao Yi's decade on an island had made him intimately familiar with the sea. He could read the depths from the hues of the water. Reaching a rugged reef, they stopped. Miao Yi dismounted and leaped atop a boulder to survey the area. 'What are you looking for, Cave Lord?' Zhu Tianbiao inquired. 'Have you heard of sail-less ships in the cultivation world that voyage without human effort?' Miao Yi questioned. 'Indeed,' Zhu Tianbiao confirmed. He explained, 'Those capable of flight in the Red Lotus realm have no need for such vessels. It's the cultivators below that level who find them useful.' 'Is building one a challenge?' 'Not at all. They look much like ordinary ships, but with a spiral propeller at the stern, driven by an artisan-crafted mechanism. Some use Mystic Relics for power, while others employ the leg strength of a dragon steed on a stern treadmill, which is significantly faster than manual rowing. Cave Lord, why do you ask?' Ignoring the question, Miao Yi gestured to the spot, 'Here, we'll dig out a small dock and build a ship for Donglai Cave's exclusive use. Have Yan Xiu arrange for local labor from Donglai Town to start the construction.' Zhu Tianbiao bowed, 'Cave Lord, your foresight is remarkable!' Miao Yi thought to correct the sycophantic response but decided against it. Realizing the futility of discussion, he pounded the boulder with his silver spear, leaving a thunderous mark, and waved dismissively, 'We've been out for days; we've seen enough. Time to head back!' Chapter 83: The Abyss of Donglai (Part One) Wang Zifa was notably attentive to his fellow sect members, arranging for a rotation of four White Lotus Second Rank juniors to stand guard at the mountain gate—a sign of their prestigious status within the sect. This day, it was Nan Sisi’s turn for guard duty. As Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao descended from their mounts at the base of the Gateway Arch, she took their reins and, using a loudspeaker spell, announced, "The Cave Lord has returned!" Miao Yi cast an extra glance at Nan Sisi, his smile barely masking his skepticism toward the professed eagerness for his return; it seemed more likely that Nan Sisi was merely flattering him. Before reaching the Grand Hall, they were met by a flock of disciples, each one echoing, "The Cave Lord has returned." Miao Yi nodded in acknowledgment and led them into the Grand Hall. Once seated in his high seat, he inquired, "I trust there were no disturbances in my absence?" "There was indeed an incident!" came the near-unanimous outcry, anxiety evident on the faces of Wang Zifa and others. "An incident? But all seems well. What has occurred?" Miao Yi questioned, turning to Yan Xiu, who stood below—a figure whose loyalty was unquestioned. Yan Xiu, ever composed, bowed and reported, "Cave Lord, the day after your departure, Mountain Lord Qin Weiwei arrived with her retinue, intent on uncovering the truth behind Song Fu’s untimely end." The mere mention of Qin Weiwei darkened Miao Yi’s expression. It wasn't the exposure of Song Fu's death that concerned him, but the fact that she had come to inspect so soon after his appointment. What did she mean by that? Moreover, he had sent a Petition to her directly. Clearly, she doubted him. With a piercing gaze, Miao Yi asked sharply, "That troublesome woman didn’t come merely to nitpick, did she?" A hush fell over the group, expressions of concern replaced by shock as their Cave Lord openly disparaged the adopted daughter of Prefecture Head Yang Qing and the Mountain Lord of Zhenhai Mountain. Clearing his throat, Miao Yi realized his public lapse and softened his approach, "The Mountain Lord didn’t express any grievances, did she?" Wang Zifa and the rest exchanged covert glances. It seemed that Cave Lord Miao’s relationship with Prefecture Head Yang Qing was not as harmonious as they imagined. The disdain was evident, as shown by Miao Yi’s frank criticism of Yang Qing’s daughter. Members of the Blue Jade Sect had pledged loyalty to Yang Qing, often with underlying motives. Now, Miao Yi's leverage over them raised questions about future interactions with their sect. It appeared that Cave Lord Miao could potentially be swayed to side with the Blue Jade Sect. Turning Yang Qing's confidants into the Blue Jade Sect's secret agents within Yang Qing's inner circle could satisfy their sect’s expectations and might even be seen as a meritorious deed. Yan Xiu, less inclined to such machinations, simply reported, "The Mountain Lord voiced no specific accusations, merely persistently probing us for the truth behind our Petition." 'That’s it?' Miao Yi had braced for something more dire. As long as he could control the narratives of the Blue Jade Sect members here, what did it matter if Qin Weiwei learned the truth? He couldn’t imagine Yang Qing, having recently appointed him, would undo his title over such an incident, thus undermining his own judgment. He didn’t believe Yang Qing would compromise his prestige as Prefecture Head. Besides, what wrong had he committed? Donglai Cave was his domain; what harm was there in reorganizing his own territory? Yang Qing had appointed him to Donglai Cave; while he might not provide support, he shouldn’t hinder him. Unperturbed, Miao Yi asked, "You all kept mum, correct?" A chorus of affirmations echoed, "We’ve kept our lips sealed, but the real concern is with Shan Biaoyi, who was taken by the Mountain Lord. We're unsure if he withstood her questioning." Miao Yi chuckled, "No need to worry. I trust Shan Biaoyi wouldn’t have spoken out of turn." Unsaid was his knowledge of Shan Biaoyi's involvement in Song Fu's demise; it would be out of character for him to confess so readily. Indeed, Yan Xiu and Qiu Shaoqun shared similar thoughts. Their discussion was punctuated by the distant sound of Dragon Steeds galloping. A brief wait later, Shan Biaoyi, the subject of their conversation, briskly entered the Grand Hall. He greeted everyone energetically, bowed, and stated, "Cave Lord!" Before Shan Biaoyi could speak further, the crowd surrounded him, bombarding him with questions about whether he had revealed any secrets after being taken by the Mountain Lord. Shan Biaoyi assured them, bolstered by Yang Qing's earlier support, that he had not betrayed anyone’s trust. At his assertion, relief washed over the crowd as they patted his shoulder, praising his loyalty. From his elevated position, Miao Yi smiled at Shan Biaoyi’s words, crossing his legs and reveling in a smug sense of control—Donglai Cave was firmly in his grasp. "Let’s not be too quick to celebrate," Shan Biaoyi interjected, surveying the room before asking, "You’re familiar with Zheng Jinlong, aren’t you?" Wang Zifa nodded, "Certainly, he’s our esteemed senior brother, having joined the sect even before Song Fu." Curiosity was piqued as to why Zheng Jinlong was mentioned, and Shan Biaoyi gestured outside, "He accompanied me here and is currently awaiting the Cave Lord’s summons." The crowd sensed trouble brewing. Without delay, Wang Zifa inquired, "Why has Senior Brother Zheng come here?" Shan Biaoyi sighed deeply, "I withstood the interrogation, but our Petition has been scrutinized by your Blue Jade Sect. A sect elder, mediating in Nanxuan Prefecture, personally petitioned the Prefecture Head, asserting Song Fu’s death was justified due to his insolence and requested that the Prefecture Head allow another from the Blue Jade Sect to fill Song Fu’s vacancy to redeem the misdeed. Consequently, Zheng Jinlong has come with me. Gentlemen, to be forthright, your sect appears to be questioning the incident. Zheng Jinlong subtly probed throughout our journey, so prepare yourselves." He then turned to salute Miao Yi, "I deliberately left Zheng Jinlong outside to inform you beforehand, hoping the Cave Lord would prepare accordingly." Acknowledging the assembly from his high seat, Miao Yi asked, "Your thoughts on this matter?" After a moment of exchange, Wang Zifa spoke with solemnity, "Cave Lord, Senior Brother Zheng’s arrival likely confirms what Shan Biaoyi suggested—he’s here to verify the truth about Senior Brother Song’s demise." Miao Yi scoffed, "The persistence of the Blue Jade Sect is relentless, probing our integrity. Should he step out of line, join forces and take him down. We outnumber him and need not fear. What’s his level of cultivation?" The atmosphere tensed, and Wang Zifa quickly advised, "No, Cave Lord, we mustn’t take such measures against Senior Brother Zheng. That could only exacerbate our troubles. Even if Senior Brother Zheng could be easily handled, what if they send a cultivator of the Green Lotus rank to replace him? What then?" Observing from the sidelines, Yan Xiu, Qiu Shaoqun, and Shan Biaoyi exchanged knowing looks, their expressions twitching subtly. The Cave Lord was seriously discussing the elimination of a Blue Jade Sect disciple with its own members—a bizarre and unprecedented situation. Indeed, the Blue Jade Sect had gathered quite an 'exceptional' array of disciples. Chapter 84: The Abyss of Donglai (Part 2) Miao Yi posed the question with a tone of indifference, 'If neither advancing nor retreating is an option, what do you propose we do?' Wang Zifa, with due respect, cupped his fists and offered, 'Cave Lord, I believe I have a strategy that could persuade Brother Zheng to join our cause, but it would require your approval on a particular matter.' Could this be an attempt to ensnare his fellow sect brother in the scheme? Miao Yi pondered silently before replying, 'I am all ears for your suggestion.' Wang Zifa elaborated, 'Cave Lord, Brother Zheng has attained the cultivation of White Lotus Third Rank. If... if you could grant Brother Zheng the same entitlements in the allocation of the Wish Power Pearls as the rest of us, I am confident that I can sway him to our side.' Many in the assembly furrowed their brows, keenly watching Miao Yi's response. Such a demand seemed presumptuous; dividing the Wish Power Pearls even further meant leaving nothing for the Cave Lord, which would effectively nullify his leadership. Predictably, Miao Yi's expression grew stern as he leaned in slightly, 'Wang Zifa, are you jesting? Should all the Wish Power Pearls be claimed by you, what would be left of my stewardship? Let it be known that when the time comes for the harvest of the Wish Power Pearls at year's end, out of the twenty-four, a mere fourteen shall be yours. This is the utmost I can offer. As for their distribution—that is a matter for you to decide. Regarding Brother Zheng—if he can be pacified, by all means, do so. Otherwise, remove him without hesitation. I have no patience for those who covet what is mine.' He harbored no trepidation towards Brother Zheng or any other scheming disciple. With an array of loyal followers under his command, any White Lotus Third Rank cultivator on his territory was at his mercy—there was no cause for him to compromise. 'Cave Lord, you misconstrue my words,' interjected Wang Zifa quickly, his hands gesturing in defense. Miao Yi scoffed, 'Then, pray tell, what is your actual intent?' All present turned their attention to Wang Zifa, who cautiously ventured, 'Cave Lord, did you not mention alternative sources of Wish Power Pearls? My proposal is to provisionally divvy up three pearls from my junior brothers and sisters to Brother Zheng. Once the additional sources of Wish Power Pearls are secured, you can recompense them accordingly.' The countenances of Hou Sheng, Shang Youlai, and Wang Xiuqin shifted dramatically. Obviously, any redistribution would be to their detriment as White Lotus Second Rank cultivators. Furthermore, the Cave Lord's mentioned extra sources of Wish Power Pearls had not yet materialized, making immediate benefits the more prudent choice. Despite Wang Zifa taking the lead, their reluctance was kept to themselves, none daring to voice their objection. Nan Sisi, standing guard at the mountain gate and unaware of the deliberations within the hall, would undoubtedly share their discontent. 'I understand,' Miao Yi murmured, tapping the armrest thoughtfully before slowly nodding, 'Your request is reasonable. Nevertheless, when the time arrives to acquire these additional Wish Power Pearls, you must not waver. You are all obliged to join me in this endeavor!' A sense of foreboding washed over Yan Xiu, as a thought flashed through his mind—could the Cave Lord actually be considering a venture into the Stellar Sea? Wang Zifa affirmed with a smile, 'Of course. We shall heed the Cave Lord's commands and stand ready to accompany you wherever you lead.' His affirmation was cautiously phrased, implying their support was contingent on the Cave Lord's ability to lead them there. Miao Yi cast a glance over the Blue Jade Sect disciples, 'Are there any dissenting voices?' Wang Zifa sternly surveyed his juniors. Although Hou Sheng and the rest were inwardly hesitant, they mustered a smile and nodded in concurrence. 'Very well,' Miao Yi announced, slapping the armrest decisively. 'The matter of Zheng Jinlong shall be left to his sect brothers to resolve. Shan Biaoyi, bring him in.' Shan Biaoyi executed the order and promptly escorted in a stout man clad in blue robes, his face ever-present with a gentle smile, appearing even younger than Song Fu. Wang Zifa and his peers greeted their senior brother with salutes. The arrival reciprocated with a courteous gesture, then stood firm, grinning as he bowed to Miao Yi, who was seated in a place of honor, 'At your behest, I, Zheng Jinlong, have arrived to serve in Donglai Cave, greeting the Cave Lord!' His outward amiability was a refreshing change compared to Song Fu's demeanor, making Miao Yi somewhat less averse to him. Miao Yi responded by gesturing dismissively, 'Dispense with the formalities.' Following an exchange where Zheng Jinlong maintained a demeanor befitting a subordinate, the assembly dispersed from the Council Hall. At that moment, Miao Yi called out unexpectedly, 'Shan Biaoyi.' Shan Biaoyi, who was close to the exit, turned back and approached, 'What would you have me do, Cave Lord?' Descending from his seat with a sly smile, Miao Yi locked eyes with Shan Biaoyi, 'You have truly said nothing? And the... Mountain Lord just let you go, just like that?' A tremor of concern ran through Shan Biaoyi, but confident that he had not betrayed any secrets, he expressed surprise, 'Being complicit in Song Fu's downfall, speaking out would serve me no advantage. You surely do not question my loyalty, Cave Lord?' 'Not in the slightest, it was merely a casual question,' Miao Yi replied with a laugh, giving his shoulder a friendly pat before motioning to Yan Xiu to proceed towards the Rear Palace. In the courtyard of the Rear Palace, Black Charcoal, full and idle, was sprawled beside the doorway, idly flicking its tail as it dozed. On Miao Yi's entry, the creature opened one eye—sensing no danger, and with no sign of the woman who had once threatened its rear, it returned to its slumber. Yan Xiu broached the subject tentatively, 'Cave Lord, do you harbor suspicions that Shan Biaoyi may have divulged the truth?' 'Not really, I just find it hard to believe that that cunning Qin Weiwei would let matters rest so easily. She has always sought to pick a bone with me,' Miao Yi dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand. 'But no matter, it's of no consequence.' Qian'er and Xue'er, who had been stationed in the courtyard awaiting the Cave Lord's return, slightly inclined their heads and trailed behind the men as they walked inside. Settled in the Cave Lord's quarters, the two maids promptly presented tea, then stood silently to the side. Miao Yi gave them a brief glance before gesturing for them to withdraw; he was yet to foster any trust in the pair. Once they had departed, Miao Yi shared with Yan Xiu, 'I've marked a location along the shoreline. Later, coordinate with Donglai Town to commission some laborers...' He detailed his plans for constructing a wharf and ships, causing Yan Xiu to express his apprehension, 'Cave Lord, you surely do not intend to brave the trials of the Stellar Sea?' 'You are overly concerned; this is a necessity for my cultivation,' Miao Yi assured him. 'Cultivation?' 'The wages for the laborers must not be scrimped upon; this responsibility is yours to manage. I've been traveling for days; I desire to refresh myself with a bath.' Miao Yi concluded, leaving the room. Yan Xiu acknowledged with a bow, exiting the chamber. On his way out, he passed by Qian'er and Xue'er, casually remarking, 'The Cave Lord requires a bath.' Pausing as he brushed past them, he offered a word of advice, 'The honor of serving as maids to the Cave Lord is a rare privilege in Donglai Town. Those who cannot secure the Cave Lord's trust do not last long here...' Chapter 85: Bottomless Cave (Part Three) Within the Meditation Chamber of the Master of Donglai Cave, Miao Yi had just disrobed and submerged himself into the temperate waters of the bath. As he closed his eyes to relish the tranquility, the sound of approaching footsteps prompted him to look towards the chamber door. Who would dare to intrude in such a manner? The answer soon revealed itself as Qian'er and Xue'er entered, appearing slightly apprehensive. They had shed their outer garments, wearing only a tube top over their torsos and mesh sand shorts below. Their translucent shoulders, delicate collarbones, and limbs as supple as lotus stems were laid bare before the cool air. The two maidens, shy as unopened buds and dressed in minimal attire, approached with flushed faces, carrying bathing essentials. Miao Yi, struck dumb, was at a loss for words. His cheeks flushed with sudden understanding, and he hastily grabbed a nearby garment, plunging it into the water to cover his modesty, asking with evident alarm, "What brings you two here?" "We are here to attend to the Master of Donglai Cave's bathing needs," the two said in unison, their faces tinged with crimson. Miao Yi, clutching his garment tightly to his lower body, quickly protested, "No need, no need, I am quite capable of bathing myself." "It is our duty," they insisted, remembering Yan Xiu's prior instructions. Undeterred by Miao Yi's objection, they set down their supplies, delicately stepped into the bath, and without awaiting his consent, went about their tasks—one helping to untie Miao Yi's hair, the other scooping water to rinse his shoulders. Miao Yi was overwhelmed by embarrassment, his temperament flaring with vexation. Yet, some reactions are instinctive to man. As the maids entered the water, their sheer shorts clung to them, revealing more with each soak. The fragrance of their untouched skin caused Miao Yi's heart to race. He dared not let his gaze wander further, the words to send them away caught in his throat and ultimately unspoken. Forced to divert his eyes from their semi-revealed forms, he closed his eyes and secured his hands firmly over his loins, allowing their tender fingers to graze his skin. The trail of their touch caused involuntary shudders to ripple through him. Over time, he grew accustomed to their presence, and the resulting comfort was unspeakably pleasant, although his hands never left his loins. Donglai Town had selected these girls for the express purpose of pleasing cultivators, hence their skills in service were honed to perfection. The town would not dare offer such talents without confidence in their abilities... A cultivator's cave dwelling, commanding a region, is invariably a place of refinement. Amidst the dreamlike verdure of the mountains, with birds and beasts scattered amongst the stone paths and ridges, a group journeyed around remarkable peaks, taking in the endless forest and the babbling of spring water. Wang Zifa and his fellow junior cultivators were escorting Senior Brother Zheng Jinlong through the scenic vistas of Donglai Cave, acquainting him with its environs, all while showing due reverence. "The Six Saints reign supreme over the world, and the cave dwellings within their purview are blessed with lands of divine natural beauty—indeed, splendid places!" The group stepped into a pavilion nestled amidst the mountains while Zheng Jinlong, absorbing the narratives of his juniors, marveled at the beauty surrounding him, noting that even the humble Donglai Cave could rival the esteemed Blue Jade Sect. His expression remained amiable and serene, his true thoughts obscured from view. Beside him, Wang Zifa added, "Now our Blue Jade Sect has entered the picture, and there is much potential to be realized!" Zheng Jinlong merely 'Oh'-ed in response, then inquired pointedly, "Does our sect still hold a place in your eyes?" At this, the smiles on the faces of those present stiffened, the air thickening with tension, as they anticipated the long-avoided confrontation. "Brother, such words make us uneasy..." Before Wang Zifa could elaborate, Zheng Jinlong turned abruptly, his smile unwavering but now laced with an iciness, "Uneasy? Is your boldness not yet sufficient?" All eyes shifted to Wang Zifa, who had previously claimed to have a solution at hand. With feigned astonishment, Wang Zifa replied, "Brother, to what are you referring?" Zheng Jinlong's gaze softened with feigned amusement, "Junior brother, are you pretending to be confused with me? Aren't you going to provide the sect with an explanation for Song Fu's death?" Wang Zifa’s expression hardened as he declared, "Song Fu nearly sabotaged the Blue Jade Sect's endeavors; his death was warranted! Given another chance, we would act no differently!" Zheng Jinlong was momentarily taken aback, his gaze shifting as he slowly ventured, "Could there be more to the story? I am eager to hear the full account." Wang Zifa leaned in and whispered the altered facts to his brother, a mixture of truth and fabrication. "Three pearls? From where does he procure so many Wish Power Pearls to distribute among us?" Zheng Jinlong questioned with surprise. "We witnessed him in possession of a Wish Power Pearl that encompasses the collective wishes of ten thousand people over a year..." Wang Zifa confided further. "He has another source for Wish Power Pearls?" Zheng Jinlong's eyes gleamed with intrigue. Wang Zifa sighed, "Now, brother, you must see the predicament we face. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but despite your higher status within the sect, once this news reaches the sect, the once-insignificant Donglai Cave will become highly sought after. The elders are sure to send their most trusted kin to take our place. Our downfall is trivial, but should the news leak, and Miao Yi be called back by Yang Qing, wouldn't our efforts to discover the source of the Wish Power Pearls for the sect come to naught? That would be a loss for the sect. Therefore, Song Fu deserved his fate!" Zheng Jinlong doubted that these individuals truly sought to uncover the source of the Wish Power Pearls for the sect; it was more likely they sought the information for their own gain. Nonetheless, if Miao Yi were displaced from Donglai Cave, the annual three Wish Power Pearls would certainly be jeopardized. A different Cave Lord would not be so generous. Yet, the prospect of such gains was enticing. His juniors were sharing this information with him, hoping he would join them in mutual support and share in the spoils. The matter, however, had already raised the sect's suspicions, prompting them to send him. Zheng Jinlong furrowed his brow, "Junior brother, while I understand your loyalty to the sect, you must realize that failing to provide the sect with a reasonable explanation is unacceptable. How do you propose I address this with them?" Chapter 86: The Bottomless Cave (Part 4) Wang Zifa noticed the budding curiosity in his companion, a secret thrill bubbling within him, yet on the surface, he feigned astonishment, inquiring, 'Brother, did you not grasp the subtext of my earlier remarks?' Zheng Jinlong halted, his thoughts swirling, yet clarity eluded him. 'Elaborate for me, Junior Brother,' he implored. Wang Zifa's voice was hushed, 'Indeed, as you've mentioned, Miao Yi is perceived as Yang Qing's trusted aide. Yet, his vitriolic critique of Qin Weiwei uncovers his deeper discontent, indicating that his loyalty might be superficial. Remember, he chose resistance over capitulation, submitting to Yang Qing only when bereft of alternatives. The Blue Jade Sect stands to gain immensely from this scenario. If we could subtly turn Yang Qing's trusted figure into our planted agent... Brother, such a rationale might alleviate the concerns of our sect elders.' Zheng Jinlong descended into contemplation, the weight of the decision dawning on him. By siding with these conspirators, he risked binding their fates together; one misstep could ensnare them all in mutual downfall. Retreating to his secluded cultivation quarters, Zheng Jinlong wrestled with hesitation and inner turmoil. The fear of enraging the sect battled with the enticement of potential riches. Ultimately, the lure of the attainable spoils proved irresistible. After days of surveillance and consideration, further egged on by Wang Zifa and his associates' seductive incitements, Zheng Jinlong steeled his resolve and composed a covert memorial. The memorial wove a narrative of Song Fu's presumptuous and unruly conduct, arguing that his execution was warranted due to his blatant indifference to the common cause. When Miao Yi executed Song Fu, Wang Zifa and his allies were incensed, nearly succumbing to a violent clash with Miao Yi. But at that pivotal juncture, they inadvertently unearthed Miao Yi's veiled dissatisfaction with Yang Qing, his grudges simmering under a guise of subservience, even covertly reviling Yang Qing's adopted daughter. Considering the grand scheme, Wang Zifa and his confederates believed it unwise to sever ties with Yang Qing over a single individual. With Song Fu beyond salvation, they chose to capitalize on the situation. They resolved to suppress their ire, safeguard Miao Yi, earn his gratitude, and cultivate him into a secret asset for the Blue Jade Sect's future maneuvers. Moreover, Miao Yi's comparatively modest cultivation level rendered him an amenable pawn. Gaining his allegiance was tantamount to gaining sway over Donglai Cave. Ousting Miao Yi for a more formidable successor would only complicate the Blue Jade Sect's grip over the cave. In his final remarks, Zheng Jinlong expressed his belief in Wang Zifa and the others' noble intentions and pleaded with the sect to deliberate their course of action. In the courtyard, as Zheng Jinlong slipped the secret memorial into a goshawk's leg tube, he wavered, his conviction faltering. Nevertheless, with a firm set of his jaw, he released the goshawk into the skies. The goshawk messenger soared away, swiftly vanishing into the horizon... The saying goes, 'Even heroes struggle to resist the charm of beauty.' This might be an exaggeration, but following the intimate bath with the two attendants, Miao Yi's demeanor towards them had noticeably softened. He ceased to treat them with the indifferent detachment of mere subordinates. While Miao Yi had restrained himself from crossing that ultimate boundary, their close encounter had indelibly changed how he perceived them. For the first time, having been so close to women, he began to view them not just as servants, but as his own. His directives became more personal and relaxed. Qian'er and Xue'er, now less anxious in their master's company, even found humor in recalling the initial bath they assisted him with. The formidable Cave Lord had been more bashful and nervous than they had been—it seemed that immortals could indeed feel shy! Entering the back courtyard of Donglai Grand Hall—the esteemed seat of the Cave Lord's power—Yan Xiu couldn't help but smile faintly. Inside the pavilion, Xue'er's fingers danced over the zither strings, weaving an enchanting melody, while Qian'er's dance was a graceful display of celestial beauty. Miao Yi, holding a teacup, watched with serene appreciation, seemingly content with life's simple pleasures. Upon noticing Yan Xiu's approach, Miao Yi signaled, prompting Qian'er and Xue'er to cease their performance. Yan Xiu, stepping into the pavilion, glanced at the pair and inquired with a smile, 'Cave Lord, are these two attendants meeting your expectations? If not, I could have the Town Governor of Donglai Town supply alternatives.' Indeed, owing to the principle of followers, not everyone was afforded such preferential treatment. Once an attendant was selected, the decision was typically irrevocable. No cultivator could claim the right to treat all the women in the world as potential personal attendants—for that would invite anarchy. However, certain privileges were accorded to the Cave Lord. Only those within the system, under the Six Sages, were entitled to be assigned attendants. Rogue cultivators had no such luxuries. While frequenting brothels was permitted, if they dared disrupt the delicate balance by preying on followers, the system's cultivators would swiftly marshal forces to pursue and punish them, preserving their exclusive rights. This desire to join the system, with its array of privileges and entitlements far beyond what rogue cultivators could aspire to, was a driving force for many. Yan Xiu's words immediately alerted Qian'er and Xue'er, their eyes swiftly turning to Miao Yi with a mix of hope and trepidation. Before the prospect of serving immortals, Donglai Town had invested heavily in their grooming. They were pampered and protected, their untouchable status a reflection of their future service to immortals. To offend them was to risk future vengeance. Yet, if they were sent back, they would experience a fall from grace, losing the protection of immortals. No longer would anyone hold them in the same esteem, and the consequences of being returned were well understood—they had failed to satisfy the immortals, which would undoubtedly infuriate those who had painstakingly prepared them. Unsettled by the maids' imploring looks and the memories of their skin-to-skin contact, Miao Yi cleared his throat awkwardly, 'They will do, quite adept indeed. No replacement necessary.' He had no wish for the embarrassing details of his bath to become fodder for gossip. His affirmation implied that the maids had proven their worthiness, receiving the Cave Lord's formal approval. Their status was immediately elevated, now recognized as the personal attendants of the Cave Lord, shielded from arbitrary disrespect. Even Yan Xiu promptly saluted them, 'Eldest Aunt, Younger Aunt!' With an immortal bestowing such honorifics, the maids' eyes gleamed with delight. They understood that the Cave Lord had formally accepted them. Their status had ascended, now towering over many, especially their fellow maids selected to serve immortals, for they were the attendants of the Cave Lord. Unaware they were destined to serve the Cave Lord, their fortune was rare—found only in two out of a hundred thousand. In their excitement, tinged with modesty, their gaze towards Miao Yi transformed. They both subtly moved to stand at his sides. Miao Yi no longer shied away from them. Having chosen them, he was ready to involve them in certain affairs. Like Qingmei and Qingju who served Yang Qing, they would need to handle tasks for him. Without knowledge, they would be of little use. 'Has there been any response from Zheng Jinlong?' Miao Yi inquired. Yan Xiu responded, 'As of now, none. Zheng Jinlong remains secluded in his cultivation quarters, showing no inclination to step out. Wang Zifa and his group are growing impatient, pressing him persistently.' Chapter 87: The Abyss of Donglai (Part 5) As Zheng Jinlong, anxiously awaiting news in the courtyard, brought his pacing to a halt, he welcomed the dark speck descending from the sky. The goshawk messenger he had dispatched two days earlier finally returned, landing on his outstretched arm. Impatient for updates, Zheng Jinlong quickly extracted a slender jade slip from the bird's leg tube and infused it with qi to read the inscribed message: 'Wang Zifa and his companions have exerted commendable efforts; grant them your cooperation!' This directive from the Blue Jade Sect brought Zheng Jinlong a profound sense of relief. Uncertain of his sect's stance, he had been hesitant to offer full support to Wang Zifa's group, fearing repercussions if the sect's internal investigation implicated him. Now with the sect's stance unequivocally conveyed, Zheng Jinlong felt emboldened. After securing the goshawk back in its aviary, he retreated indoors and exchanged his blue robes for a black uniform, signaling his allegiance to the Donglai Cave Master's mandate for uniformity in attire. Now adorned in black, Zheng Jinlong was promptly approached by Wang Zifa and others, who seemed to materialize from the ether, pressing him with urgency, 'Senior Brother Zheng, what is your decision?' Their urgent desire for his cooperation was unmistakable; without Zheng Jinlong's support, they would be at the mercy of Miao Yi, potentially compelled to act against Zheng Jinlong himself. Despite the gravity of their situation, they were prepared to face the consequences of their choices. 'Recognizing the lengths you've gone for our sect, I have deliberated deeply on your behalf,' Zheng Jinlong sighed, presenting them with the jade slip—a secret missive—he had just received. After each man inspected the message with their qi, their faces lit up with relief. At Wang Zifa's silent cue, they lined up and bowed in unison, 'We are indebted to you, Senior Brother Zheng!' 'Having not received directives from our Cave Master for some time, might he have assignments for us?' Zheng Jinlong inquired, demonstrating his readiness to heed the Cave Master's commands. Their collective front was a testament to their commitment to reassure Miao Yi of their loyalty. They accompanied Zheng Jinlong, lavishing him with praise as they proceeded to present their unified allegiance. Informed of their arrival, Miao Yi, accompanied by Qian'er and Xue'er, emerged from the seclusion of the Rear Hall into the solemn Grand Hall. As he seated himself in a position of authority, Qian'er and Xue'er, a blend of excitement and apprehension evident in their demeanor, took their places at his sides, while Yan Xiu, who had followed them, assumed his designated spot below. 'Bring them in,' Miao Yi commanded, his voice imbued with an understated authority. Yan Xiu had briefed the attendants on the proper etiquette. Xue'er, the younger of the two maids, steadied her nerves. Taking a deep breath, she approached the Grand Hall's entrance and, her voice betraying a tremble, called out to the group awaiting below the lofty steps, 'The Cave Master invites you to enter the Grand Hall for discussion.' As the men entered the Grand Hall, the sight of Zheng Jinlong's black attire did not escape Miao Yi's notice. A knowing smile crossed his features, recognizing the implicit pledge of loyalty. Wang Zifa caught Miao Yi's discerning gaze and, without a word, confirmed, 'All has been settled.' 'Greetings, Cave Master!' they chorused, offering a respectful bow. With this assembly, Miao Yi felt his strength in numbers solidify, ready to face any challenges that lay ahead. Even a White Lotus Fourth Rank cultivator would now find a formidable opponent. 'There is no need for formalities,' Miao Yi responded, his smile tinged with a hint of satisfaction. Qian'er and Xue'er, witnessing the display of respect from the sect members, sneaked glances at Miao Yi. The Cave Master's authority was palpable, compelling many to heed his command. To the maids, who had rarely encountered such esteemed cultivators, the gathering was impressive. How would they feel, knowing their master, commanding the attention of all present, was the least cultivated among them? After everyone had found their place, Zheng Jinlong once again came forward, bowing, 'I, Zheng Jinlong, am new to Donglai Cave and have yet to prove my worth. Does the Cave Master have any instructions for me?' His question was a pledge of service. Miao Yi, with an amused smirk, suggested, 'A newcomer should make a positive impression. How about starting by guarding the Mountain Gate for a day?' The crowd hesitated, unsure of the implication. Was another White Lotus Third Rank cultivator to be relegated to mere gate duty? Could this be another of the Cave Master's strategies, or did he harbor ill will toward Zheng Jinlong? Zheng Jinlong was taken aback. His earlier polite offer had been taken at face value. He understood this to be the Cave Master's test of his genuine commitment. True allegiance required more than words—it demanded action. 'As the Cave Master wishes,' Zheng Jinlong affirmed, his salute both formal and determined. With that, Miao Yi saw no need for further circumspection. This was his domain, and matters would unfold according to his will. 'Now that we are gathered, let me introduce two individuals,' Miao Yi gestured towards the maids, 'This is Qian'er, and this is Xue'er.' With mutual respect, the group bowed in acknowledgment, 'We are honored to meet the Da Gugu and Xiao Gugu.' Qian'er and Xue'er, caught between nerves and pride, reciprocated the gesture. After the introductions, the group disbanded. Zheng Jinlong headed to the Mountain Gate to take over from the current guard, Wang Xiuqin, who hesitated to impose such a task on her Senior Brother. When told it was the Mountain Master's instruction, Wang Xiuqin stepped aside but whispered a warning, 'Senior Brother Zheng, as you're aware of Brother Song's ordeal, please exercise caution.' Zheng Jinlong nodded, appearing unconcerned on the surface but internally tightening his guard. He was acutely aware of the Cave Master's capacity for covert action. The recent incident at the Mountain Gate, resulting in Song Fu's demise, was still fresh in everyone's memory. They all suspected Miao Yi's hidden hand, recognizing it as a mere pretext for his rage. Resolved to guard his post, Zheng Jinlong vowed to remain vigilant at the Mountain Gate, determined not to share Song Fu's fate... News of Zheng Jinlong's submission swiftly reached Zhenhai Mountain. Qin Weiwei, donned in her pristine white cultivator's robe, lounged on her balcony, scanning the secret report with disdain. That man had once again swayed the Blue Jade Sect's envoy to his side—were they so easily influenced? Yang Qing, aware that Song Fu's end could not remain concealed, had taken a direct approach. There was no merit in secrecy, so he summoned the Blue Jade Sect's delegate and laid bare the stack of petitions. Without hesitation, the Blue Jade Sect's representative condemned Song Fu's actions and beseeched Yang Qing to allow another to 'redeem sins with merits.' The pretense of redemption was transparent, a guise to scrutinize the actual events. Nonetheless, Yang Qing acquiesced immediately. Later, when Qin Weiwei queried Yang Qing about his decision and its potential implications, he replied dismissively, 'If the truth comes to light, so be it. I'll stand by the youngster. I'm intrigued to see the Blue Jade Sect's response—to ascertain their limits. Besides, it's another chance to test that young Cave Master. Let's see if he can handle the pressure and not disappoint me.' The confidential report was promptly forwarded to Nanxuan Prefecture. Yang Qing, secluded in his mountain pavilion, chuckled softly to himself, 'Another has been drawn in. That young Cave Master truly has turned Donglai Cave into an insatiable abyss that devours all who enter. It appears the Blue Jade Sect is not as formidable as they claim, unable to deal with even a minor Cave Master under my command. Haha!' Qingmei and Qingju exchanged glances. Once again, the Cave Master had met the Prefecture Master's expectations. It was clear that Yang Qing's appreciation for Miao Yi was growing, particularly given Miao Yi's deft maneuvering of the Blue Jade Sect—a tactic that resonated with the Prefecture Master's own predilections. Chapter 88: Hatching the Nether Eggs (Part One) With the issue of Zheng Jinlong settled, and the Blue Jade Sect matter effectively resolved, Miao Yi could, at last, concentrate on his cultivation without any lingering concerns. Before he could dedicate himself fully to that pursuit, he had another task to address. Having recently taken control of Donglai Cave, he had been too preoccupied with its reorganization to do anything else. Now, with some time available, he decided to attempt the hatching of the Nether Mantis eggs that he and Lao Bai had procured from the endless Red Dust. On an early morning, as the sky began to brighten, Miao Yi instructed Qian'er and Xue'er to ensure that no one would disturb him. He secluded himself in the meditation chamber to begin his preparations, as the secret method he was about to employ could not be revealed to others, as per Lao Bai's instructions. The mass of eggs, once brought out, seemed to lower the temperature of the room; they were cold as ice to the touch. Miao Yi, feeling the chill, remarked, 'Truly bizarre creatures!' He carefully separated the eggs from the mucus, arranging a hundred quail-sized, dark eggs onto a jade plate. He then drew a small knife across the palm of his left hand, wincing as blood began to flow freely. He had to ensure his blood covered each egg thoroughly, leaving no part untouched. This was crucial to sever the connection between yin and yang using his essence blood and to allow the Nether Mantis within to be fully accustomed to his presence from the outset of their incubation. After ensuring each egg was coated in black and red, he loosed his hair bun, reluctantly plucking strands from his scalp. The hair, Lao Bai had explained, must remain intact, as continuity was essential in the hatching of Nether Eggs. With a hundred perfect strands in hand, each with its root, Miao Yi began the peculiar process. He dipped the roots in his blood, holding the tips together. At his command, the hairs stiffened, splaying outward like a porcupine's quills. Hovering his hand over the plate, he directed each hair into an egg, piercing the tough, slippery shells. This arcane technique, named 'Thread of Yin and Yang Connecting Two Realms,' was meant to bind the Yin of the Nether Eggs to his Yang. His hair served as the tether, ensuring that the hatched Nether Mantises would be in harmony with his will. As the strands penetrated the eggs, a bone-chilling sensation coursed through them, almost causing Miao Yi's spirit to falter—a feeling like being plunged into the netherworld, making one's soul quiver. Only Miao Yi's cultivation of the 'Starfire Technique' prevented his soul from straying, his Dharma Origin repelling the yin energy and restoring warmth to his body, an assertion of dominance that expelled the intrusion in an instant. Shivering, Miao Yi came back to his senses, observing the hair now coated with frost. 'What strange Nether Eggs, to have nearly ensnared my mind!' he marveled. With his mind composed, he recalled Lao Bai's mental technique. Grasping the hairs, he began funneling his mana through them into the eggs, weaving in the secret method. Less than half an hour later, Miao Yi ceased the infusion of mana. The previously cleared frost now crept back over the hair, starting at the roots. Unsure of the outcome, Miao Yi proceeded as instructed. He took out the Stellar Flora Immortal Herb and gently blew a wisp of star cloud onto the cut in his palm, which rapidly healed before his eyes. With the wound healed, he marveled at his good fortune in obtaining the herb from the Nether Mantis that day in the endless Red Dust. Without it, hatching the Nether Eggs would have been far more troublesome. Because, as Lao Bai's secret method prescribed, the eggs needed to be bathed in fresh blood daily for eighty-one days without pause, or the entire effort would be for naught. In other words, he would need to bleed eighty-one times, making continuous incisions for as many days. Had he not chanced upon the immortal herb, the constant bleeding would have been unbearable, even for a cultivator. After rinsing the blood from his hands in the warm spring pool, Miao Yi picked up the jade plate and exited the meditation chamber. Qian'er and Xue'er, standing guard outside, eyed the contents of the plate curiously. The black and red objects, furred in white, puzzled them. Xue'er reached out to help Miao Yi with the plate. Accustomed to their service, he handed it to her. But as he was about to offer guidance, Xue'er's face turned ashen. The plate shook in her trembling hands, nearly slipping from her grasp. Miao Yi's quick reflexes saved the plate and prevented Xue'er from collapsing. He realized he had been careless; the items on the plate were heavy with yin energy, which he had nearly succumbed to himself. It was too much for a mere mortal to withstand. His cultivation technique was especially effective against such yin energy. Casting a spell, he directed it into Xue'er's body, clearing the invasive yin energy in an instant. Xue'er, her eyes having rolled back, slowly regained consciousness. The yin energy had momentarily sapped her vitality, leaving her weak and pallid. Chapter 89: Incubating the Nether Egg (Part 2) 'Sorry, I forgot you two are mortals and shouldn't touch this.' Miao Yi asked, 'Xue'er, are you alright?' Qian'er and Xue'er looked at the Jade Slip with awe, realizing it was not intended for mortals. Xue'er shook her head and quickly apologized, 'This servant's carelessness nearly caused damage to the Mountain Lord's property.' 'It's fine,' Miao Yi chuckled. 'I have something for you to do; come with me!' They followed him out of the Grand Hall into the bright sunlight. The frost on the hair within the Jade Slip began to emit wisps of black smoke upon exposure to sunlight, and the white frost quickly vanished, revealing the hair's true color. Frost wouldn't melt so quickly in the sun, nor produce black smoke. Obviously, this frost was a manifestation of intense Yin energy, not a natural occurrence. The sight of the frost turning to hair and then emitting black smoke once again alarmed Qian'er and Xue'er. The feeling wasn't that of an immortal's aura, but rather a sinister one. Black Charcoal, who had been dozing at the entrance flicking his serpentine tail, suddenly sneezed. He opened his eyes wide, focusing on the object Miao Yi held, as if he sensed something unusual. However, seeing Miao Yi leading the two maids to the Star Observation Platform and realizing it had no effect on him, he went back to sleep, the epitome of laziness. The Star Observation Platform was designed for stargazing. Ascending, Miao Yi placed the Jade Slip on the ground, which, according to Lao Bai, must not touch the earth until the hatching is complete; it needed to be isolated, and the platform was perfectly suited for this. Under the harsh sunlight, Miao Yi crouched to observe for a while. The breeze rustled the strands of hair sticking out of the Nether Egg, leaving him to wonder if Lao Bai's claim about the hair helping the nether embryo adapt to the mortal realm was true. 'Qian'er, Xue'er!' Miao Yi stood up. 'Present!' The two attendants responded in unison. Miao Yi pointed to the item in the Jade Slip and instructed, 'Starting today, I will be in secluded cultivation. You two will take turns guarding this spot, making sure no one comes up here to touch this item. Neither of you should touch it, nor let it come into contact with the ground beneath the platform. Remember to summon me from the Meditation Chamber every evening before sunset or when it's cloudy or raining, and the sun is obscured, and also before sunrise each day!' 'We will remember,' the maids nodded in agreement. After descending from the Star Observation Platform to the pavilion, Miao Yi invited them to sit and asked, 'Can you both sew?' Both nodded, 'Yes, we're quite skilled.' 'I need a fitted vest...' Miao Yi began outlining the design he wanted them to create. Once they grasped his intention, they quickly fetched needle and thread. Upon their return, Qian'er began cutting the fabric, while Xue'er used a comb to tidy Miao Yi's hair, which had been disordered from the earlier plucking. At that moment, Yan Xiu entered the courtyard, reporting that the dock and shipbuilding at Donglai Town were set to commence immediately. 'Do not shortchange the craftsmen's pay,' Miao Yi reminded. He had mentioned this previously, and Yan Xiu assured him it would be adhered to. Noticing Xue'er's pallor, he inquired out of concern, 'Attendant Xue'er seems pale. Is she unwell?' Xue'er hastily shook her head, still shaken from the earlier experience. Miao Yi glanced back at Xue'er, noting her slightly pale complexion and knowing she had experienced a minor drain on her spiritual energy, but it wasn't serious. Turning to Yan Xiu, he mentioned, 'Regarding these two, I have a matter to discuss with you.' 'What does the Mountain Lord require?' Yan Xiu inquired. 'They possess aptitude for cultivation, do they not?' Yan Xiu immediately grasped Miao Yi's implication, 'Does the Mountain Lord intend for them to commence cultivation training?' Qian'er and Xue'er covertly glanced at Miao Yi, their curiosity piqued. Having been in his service long enough, they had heard enough about cultivation and had a rough idea of its significance. The prospect excited them. 'Indeed!' Miao Yi confirmed. He had indeed contemplated this, as the two women beside him seemed somewhat ineffective, especially for someone on the path of cultivation. Such attendants were a burden; even a simple journey to the back mountain for a consultation was arduous. They would return from the climb gasping for breath and visibly distressed—a situation that was unsustainable. For someone like Yang Qing, who had the benefit of two cultivator attendants, life was much more convenient. They were not only useful for tasks but could also serve as personal bodyguards. Especially after witnessing Xue'er's near mishap with the Jade Slip, Miao Yi was motivated to address the issue. 'Where can we obtain a set of cultivation techniques for them?' Miao Yi inquired. Yan Xiu pondered a moment before replying, 'Complete cultivation techniques are a sect's heritage, not to be shared lightly. To control their disciples, sects disseminate these teachings incrementally. Acquiring such knowledge is extremely difficult. If there's a chance to visit the Flowing Cloud Sand Sea, that place is a sanctuary for outlaws where laws do not apply. Rogue cultivators who have no place in the Six Saints' domain gather there. It's a melting pot of demons and spirits, where betrayal is commonplace. There, one might purchase such techniques at a high price. However, without prior cultivation experience, there is no guarantee the techniques are complete. Incorrect practice could lead to Qi deviation. Most cultivators commit these techniques to memory, and any tangible records they carry are usually encoded to prevent the unauthorized spread of their cultivation practices.' 'Flowing Cloud Sand Sea...' Miao Yi murmured, his thoughts momentarily drifting to the enchanting woman he had encountered at the Miao Fa Temple. Shaking off the distracting image of the innkeeper's charming mannerisms, he dismissed the idea, 'That place is too far and fraught with peril for a mere visit, and as you've said, it's not reliable. Surely there must be another solution.' Yan Xiu shook his head, 'It's a formidable challenge. The clandestine trade of cultivation techniques is sternly punished to prevent an influx of cultivators. Such transactions are mainly confined to lawless places like the Flowing Cloud Sand Sea.' He left unsaid who was enforcing this, but Miao Yi understood it to be the Six Saints. They were eager to avoid an excess of cultivators vying for the world's incense prayer power. Too many cultivators would lead to unrest, threatening the established order—a scenario the Six Saints would not allow. Miao Yi's brow furrowed, 'Where did the Prefecture Head's attendants learn their cultivation techniques?' 'The Prefecture Head would have imparted her own techniques. That's typically how it's done.' At this, Yan Xiu seemed puzzled, 'Mountain Lord, why not impart your own cultivation methods to them? You could teach them incrementally, based on their ability to comprehend.' His suggestion was well-intentioned, but the subtext was for Miao Yi to act like other sect leaders—impart his knowledge gradually, thus maintaining a hold over the attendants.
