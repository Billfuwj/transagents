Chapter 368: Narrow Escape The balance tipped decidedly in one direction as gunfire raged, enveloping the sea's airspace in smoke. Bai Ye, wielding his high-speed magnetic wave gun with a fondness akin to addiction, took down another aircraft. Xiao Naibao, with poised command, led the premier terrorist organization's air force into an impenetrable formation, initiating a final ferocious assault. Upon discerning their disadvantage, Nikla eschewed formality and blurted out, 'Master Louis, we must retreat. Persisting in this battle ensures our complete destruction.' Louis' fists clenched tighter, and a turbulent fury engulfed him. He could clearly see their dire circumstances yet the thought of retreating burned him; victory had been within arm's reach. His emerald eyes flickered with a murderous glint before sinking back into a deep melancholy. He gestured to Nikla, signaling a strategic withdrawal. Louis cast a final, contemptuous glance at the pair drifting above the waves. 'Consider yourselves lucky,' he hissed under his breath, 'but this isn't over.' 'Babe, they're retreating. Shall we pursue?' Bai Ye inquired, his lips curving into a sly, dangerous smirk. Xiao Naibao's elegant smile mirrored Bai Ye's sentiment as he instructed a ceasefire. 'No, the game of cat and mouse has just begun. It would be a waste to end his game too soon,' he stated, his dark eyes betraying a calm resolve. With the situation reversed, Louis had erred grievously in provoking them. Nuo Nuo's demise demanded retribution, and Xiao Naibao's pride would settle for nothing less. While Louis might dictate the game's outset, its conclusion was Xiao Naibao's prerogative. Adopting a nonchalant stance, Bai Ye agreed, 'Fine, no pursuit. We have ample resources to play this game, and Louis might just find himself targeted by others eager to claim his head.' Xiao Naibao watched their adversaries flee, his cold laughter unspoken. 'Chu Li, it's over. Stand down; we're returning to Rome immediately,' Bai Ye communicated, directing his team home. Black Hawk and his team expended Herculean efforts to rescue Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya, taking all precautions against the virus they harbored. Ye Sanshao, who had warned them of his own infection, was treated with utmost caution. Exhausted, Ye Sanshao lay gasping, and with a playful nudge, teased Cheng An Ya, 'Miss Cheng, you might consider losing some weight; you're a bit too heavy.' His shoulder numbed from the prolonged exertion in the water, not to mention the added burden of Cheng An Ya. The thought of nearly losing his grip on her in the sea sent a shiver down his spine. The team's spirits soared with their safety assured. Towels were passed, hot water poured, and the atmosphere buzzed with jovial teasing and the hearty spirit of camaraderie. Wrapped in a blanket to fend off the chill, Cheng An Ya ignored Ye Sanshao's taunts, a sneeze reminding her of their narrow escape. Black Hawk's chuckle echoed, 'Sanshao, the missus couldn't get much thinner, or she'd be just bones.' 'I'm already bothered by it,' Ye Sanshao retorted, drying off, 'Her bones are the very reason she's so heavy.' Choosing silence over argument, Cheng An Ya accepted a change of clothes from Black Hawk, the men's attire hanging comically on her frame. She preferred the blanket's cocoon. As they settled, Black Hawk relayed that Ning Ning wished to speak with her. Seizing the microphone with fervor, Cheng An Ya cried, 'Baby, it's mommy here!' 'Hey, mommy, missed me?' Xiao Naibao's voice, brimming with mirth, emanated from the sofa. It had been too long since he had heard his mother's voice. 'Not one bit,' Cheng An Ya retorted with feigned ferocity, 'You're too slow. Mommy needed you sooner. You deserve a spanking.' At the mention of Xu Nuo, Xiao Naibao's heart clenched, but he masked it with a smile, 'Ready for that spanking. Once in Rome, you can do as you please. But I did miss you, mommy. Your indifference wounds me.' 'Mutual disdain,' she replied with a chuckle, her concern surfacing, 'You weren't hurt, were you?' 'I'm unscathed, really. Don't fret, mommy. The plane's landing soon; we'll speak afterward.' Ending the call, Cheng An Ya sipped her hot tea, while Ye Sanshao, deprived of a chance to speak with his son, watched with a silent accusation in his gaze. Ignoring Ye Sanshao, Cheng An Ya wrapped herself tighter as Black Hawk reassured, 'Sanshao, we'll be landing soon. The young master awaits.' Feeling ignored, Ye Sanshao pinched Cheng An Ya playfully, 'You heartless creature.' 'Stingy ghost,' she retorted, passing the hot water his way. They landed shortly after, the entire party safely ensconced within the castle walls. Chu Li, Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and others greeted them, their collective relief palpable at the sight of Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya unharmed. 'Brother, sister-in-law, quite the disheveled pair,' Ye Wei teased, her laughter shaking, 'Brother, I should have captured this moment as a keepsake.' 'Impudent girl,' Ye Sanshao chided with a laugh. With Weiwei, Shi Yi, and Xiao Naibao all safe, his own relief was profound. After such an ordeal, what else could go wrong? Xiao Naibao, yearning to embrace Cheng An Ya, was halted by her stern command. He remembered her warning of the virus. Then, noticing the clasped hands of his parents, he felt a pang in his heart. 'Daddy, mommy, you both... Bai Ye, check on them, please,' he implored, his faith in Bai Ye's medical genius unwavering. 'Understood, don't worry,' Bai Ye reassured with a smile. 'Virus?' The inquisitive gaze of a golden-haired, blue-eyed handsome man named Jason landed on Bai Ye, 'Xiao Bai, isn't this beyond your expertise?' Bai Ye, unfazed, retorted with a gentle smirk, 'Try calling me Xiao Bai again, Jason, and see what happens.' 'What's the harm? Xiao Bai is your name, just as they call Black Jack, Xiao Tie,' Jason shot back, his fiery temper akin to a regal lion, albeit with undeniable charm. His sapphire-like eyes blazed with indignation, and when riled, his presence was as formidable as a volcanic eruption. Black Jack, a man in his twenties with an intricate blend of Chinese and English heritage, bore a mysterious allure with a hint of Western depth in his eyes, which were a misty grey-blue, creating an illusion of depth. Yet, beneath that mist was a sharpness that betrayed his concealed acumen. Leaders of the premier terrorist organization, despite their youth, possessed dominant auras. With one alone, the air thrummed with authority; the combined presence of the three was nothing short of imperial. 'Jason, you truly need a lesson in manners,' Shi Yi interjected, her voice laced with humor, 'Why call him Xiao Bai? It's time to teach you a lesson.' The group's laughter filled the air. Ye Wei shook her head, focusing on the more pressing matter, 'Brother, sister-in-law, don't mind them. Better to soak in a hot bath and get checked later so you don't catch a cold.' At her behest, maids ushered Ye Chen and Cheng An Ya away for a bath. Xiao Naibao, torn between following and staying, ultimately remained as Bai Ye appeared poised for a scuffle. Tugging at Bai Ye's sleeve, Xiao Naibao looked up at him with hopeful eyes. 'Bai Ye, is there a way to cure my daddy and mommy?' 'Ning Ning, let me conduct a thorough examination first. Stay calm,' Bai Ye soothed, patting the boy's head. 'I'll do everything in my power.' Xiao Naibao had lost Xu Nuo, and now with his parents' fate hanging in the balance, his heart was fraught with anxiety. Bai Ye understood the turmoil churning within the boy. 'Don't worry too much,' Bai Ye comforted him. 'Let's leave it to Bai Ye. There's no problem that can't be solved,' Ye Wei declared confidently. 'If Louis created the virus, there must be an antidote. Impossible is not an option. Should Bai Ye fail, we'll strip him of his title.' Chu Li nodded in agreement, 'Precisely.' 'Xiao Bai, do you even have a title to strip?' Jason quipped, his curiosity piqued. Shi Yi barely suppressed her desire to knock some sense into him. 'And why didn't you two manage to bring back Louis?' Black Jack inquired, the weight of their unfinished business heavy in the air. 'I've wanted to annihilate him for some time. With the Mafia provocations escalating, it's high time we ended his reign of terror,' Bai Ye stated, his resolve as sharp as ever. 'Louis can wait,' Xiao Naibao calmly articulated, his young face shadowed with a menacing grin. 'To win without fighting is the pinnacle of victory. Personal vendettas aside, the conflict between the Mafia and terrorist organizations requires a different strategy. To wipe out the Mafia will demand significant resources. His standing within the Mafia is now precarious, and I suspect another power lurking in the shadows. So, let Louis unwittingly lead us to them, and we shall eliminate them in one fell swoop.' Their young compatriot's cunning had not gone unnoticed; though his tender years often softened their perception, his true nature was ever present. 'Wily indeed!' Jason exclaimed, his thumb raised high in approval. A man of action, he had always valued direct strategies, but Xiao Naibao's plans had his unwavering support. 'I concur with Ning Ning's strategy,' Chu Li affirmed. 'It's time to end this nuisance once and for all.' 'You always side with Ning Ning. Birds of a feather,' Black Jack teased, the corners of his mouth lifting in amusement. 'But I agree. It's time the Mafia learned to fear us, to avoid our shadow for decades to come.' Bai Ye nodded, his focus now solely on finding a cure for the virus plaguing Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya. That was his mission; the rest was Chu Li's domain. Ye Wei and Shi Yi exchanged knowing glances. Could there be another force at play? Their minds conjured the same visage â€“ Mo Ye and Mo Jue. Only they held enough sway within the Mafia, shrouded in mystery enough to rival Louis. It made no sense otherwise for them to follow his lead. As the group settled in the living room, Xiao Naibao sought out Cheng An Ya. She had just emerged fresh from her bath, her cheeks flushed with warmth, cupping a steaming tea in her hands as she pondered deeply. 'Mommy...' Xiao Naibao pushed the door open, gracing the room with his presence. Cheng An Ya, stirred from her thoughts, admired her son with a soft smile, 'Baby, you've got quite the presence.' His attire exuded an aura that belied his age, transforming him into an imposing figure. 'Thank you for the compliment, mommy.' 'Keep your distance, sit over there. I might not be able to restrain myself from disciplining you,' she cautioned, pointing to the sofa across the room. Xiao Naibao cast a plaintive look Cheng An Ya's way, 'Mommy, you're pushing me away.' 'Precisely,' she affirmed, her laughter echoing around them. She studied Xiao Naibao, sensing an indefinable change in him. A mother's intuition was never wrong; she could feel the subtle shifts in her child. 'Mommy, why do you look at me so? Is it because you think your baby's become more handsome?' Xiao Naibao teased, his eyes twinkling mischievously. Cheng An Ya eyed him with mock seriousness, 'You've inherited your father's vanity, I see. But tell me, have you been alright? Were you bullied? Speak truthfully to mommy.' Xiao Naibao's denial was swift, 'Absolutely not. Louis must have manipulated those photos. Look,' he rolled up his sleeve, revealing an arm nearly healed from its earlier wounds, 'not a mark to be seen.' His injuries, once inflicted by Xu Nuo, no longer pained him. In fact, he longed for the days when her reprimands were but a symbol of her presence. If only she were alive, he'd gladly endure a lifetime of such scolding. 'Ning Ning, you're truly unharmed?' Cheng An Ya's brows knit together, detecting a fleeting sorrow in his eyes. With a nod, Xiao Naibao assured her, 'I'm fine, truly. But it's you and daddy we should worry about. Uncle Black Hawk mentioned the virus. How did daddy contract it too?' Cheng An Ya's thoughts turned to Ye Sanshao's insatiable desires, her face reddening anew. She chose to deflect, 'Let's not dwell on that. After all the chaos in the desert and at sea, contact was inevitable.' Xiao Naibao took her evasion at face value. 'Mommy, don't worry. Bai Ye's medical expertise is unparalleled. He will find a way to heal you both.' Chapter 369: Self-reliance Ensures Ample Sustenance After Bai Ye, the medical prodigy, conducted a thorough examination and drew blood for a comprehensive analysis, his face showed an unusual solemnity, igniting a sense of foreboding in Xiao Naibao. Previously, when Cheng An Ya was critically injured and faced with a life-threatening infection, doctors had resignedly suggested amputation as the only lifesaving measure. Yet, Bai Ye, unfazed and armed with sardonic wit, had confidently retreated to his laboratory sanctuary. As a healer without parallel, no malady seemed beyond the reach of his gifted hands. Even when Chu Li had been critically wounded by 23 bullets, Bai Ye remained the epitome of calm and composure, a living legend in the medical realm. Now, just as Jason had predicted, the realm of viruses was Bai Ye's Achilles' heel. The unusual gravity in his demeanor was an ominous sign, prompting even Jason to offer a sympathetic pat on Bai Ye's shoulder in a rare gesture of camaraderie. 'Finally, you've met a case that tests you,' Jason mused. This was akin to Xiao Naibao being outmaneuvered by the Mo brothers, Mo Ye and Mo Jue, the digital warfare maestros. Bai Ye had summoned over a dozen virus experts from Rome to the castle to collaborate on the research, enveloping the stronghold in an air of palpable gravity. Yet, the individuals at the heart of the matter were remarkably composed. Cheng An Ya had long since come to terms with the concept of mortality. During her harrowing escape, she had accepted the idea that death was not the worst fate. She had loved fiercely, had the unwavering support of Ye Sanshao, and the adoration of Ning Ning. With a fulfilling family and a successful career, she had experienced the full spectrum of life. This tumultuous episode only added to the richness of her life's tapestry, and she felt contentment. Her only lingering regret was not being able to see Ning Ning one last time. Now that her wish was granted, she was indifferent to the outcome of life or death. Ye Sanshao, the indomitable force, shared her disregard for the end. Chu Li, the stoic commander, commented on their fortitude, 'That's the spirit and courage we need.' As the group convened in the conference hall to discuss the virus and Ye Sanshao's dwindling days, Cheng An Ya's memory was jogged by a significant detail. 'Ye Wei had administered a virus-delaying agent that should buy us a few more days.' In the whirlwind of their reunion, she had nearly forgotten the critical interaction between Ye Wei and Chu Li. Though Ye Wei hadn't explicitly conveyed a message for Chu Li, the tacit understanding between them was undeniable. Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao felt compelled to inform Chu Li. Chu Li's gaze sharpened, focusing on Cheng An Ya with an urgency that startled her. The room, previously filled with the banter of Jason, Black Jack, and others, fell into an expectant hush. 'You have news of Ye Wei,' Chu Li stated calmly, his voice belying the tension that gripped him. His body was tense, his concern evident. Xiao Naibao was equally taken aback. As Ye Sanshao narrated the incident, Chu Li abruptly stood, offering a curt 'Thank you' before hastily departing. Jason and Black Jack quickly rose to follow. Ye Wei chuckled, 'Dark Chu must be over the moon this time. Look at his eagernessâ€”it's a rarity indeed.' A significant military campaign by Dragon Gate seemed imminent. With the three giants poised to enter the fray, an earth-shattering confrontation was in store. Ye Wei inwardly mourned for Prince William, whose dominion was likely to be halved or entirely lost. If Ye Wei had the means, Bai Ye should, too, Xiao Naibao reasoned. His entire focus was on the virus threatening his parents. As he pondered his next move, a man approached, 'Young master, Brother Chu requests your presence in the study.' Xiao Naibao's lips pressed into a thin line. 'Dad, Mom, I'll return shortly to keep you company.' Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao exchanged a knowing glance, each filled with a sense of pride. Xiao Naibao seemed to have firmly chosen his path within Dragon Gate, a stark contrast to the obedient son of times past. Resigned to his choice, they resolved to support him on his chosen path. For Ye Sanshao, the pride was palpable. Cheng An Ya watched her son disappear into the corridor's silhouette. Turning back to the present, she inquired of Ye Wei, 'Wei Wei, has something happened to Ning Ning?' A mother's intuition is never wrong. Xiao Naibao's silence did not convince her of his well-being. Ye Wei admired her sister-in-law's perceptiveness and exchanged a meaningful look with Shi Yi. They debated whether to disclose Xu Nuo's fate. It was clear to Ye Sanshao that they were withholding something. 'Wei Wei, speak up.' Ye Wei met their gaze and relayed the full story of Ning Ning and Xu Nuo, including Xu Nuo's death and Xiao Naibao's blindness, sparing no details. Cheng An Ya's heart grew heavier with each word. It explained why her son's eyes had lost their usual clarity and innocence. Despite his background, he had always been a child at heart. But some experiences change a person's gaze, and the world seems differentâ€”it wasn't just her imagination. Ye Sanshao frowned, his heart aching for his son's ordeal, filled with remorse for his own absence. If Cheng An Ya had died for him, madness would have been too mild a term for his despair. Xiao Naibao's experience mirrored his own periods of isolation. 'Is the girl confirmed dead?' Cheng An Ya inquired. Ye Wei nodded. 'Our people have confirmed it. Speaking of Nuo Nuo...' She slammed her hand on the table in frustration, recounting Xu Nuo's lineage. 'All misfortunes seem to have converged on Nuo Nuo. Fate has been exceptionally cruel.' Ye Sanshao paused thoughtfully. 'Xu Mingyang and I have business connections. He seems like an upright man, not the type to be superstitious. Could there be more to this?' 'It's not like that,' Shi Yi interjected. 'I've researched the Miao family. Their life charts are indeed accurate, and their curse is real. But there were alternativesâ€”they didn't have to abandon Xu Nuo. Even letting her be raised by others could have been an option. Her parents' decision was excessively harsh.' Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao remained silent. According to this, their son's future seemed precarious. Especially for Cheng An Ya, it wasn't unwarranted worry. She knew her son best. He might appear unchanged, but that was just a facade. A desolate heart renders one lifeless. 'Third sister-in-law, don't worry too much. Ning Ning is still young; perhaps time will heal,' Ye Wei reassured, suggesting that even the deepest bonds can fade over time. Cheng An Ya smiled faintly, acknowledging with a murmur. Ye Wei's words were meant to console them, but even Ye Sanshao knew that forgetting is harder than remembering. To fall in love takes but a second. To forget requires a lifetime. Ye Sanshao inquired about the current state of Dragon Gate, and Ye Wei was forthcoming. The situation was dire, with all three leaders embroiled in their own complex battles, Lin Yixuan's especially mounting. 'Brother, set aside these concerns. First, rid yourself of the virus. Dragon Gate has plenty of capable individuals,' Ye Wei advised with an enchanting smile. 'Louis will likely remain quiet for a while. It's a chance for everyone to recuperate. You weren't aware, but our commander berated us last night for that sensational naval battle.' The introduction of new weaponry into combat, especially by the world's largest illegal arms dealer, was bound to cause a commotion. Shi Yi offered a cold smile. 'According to Jason's tally last night, thirteen countries are vying for these arms at exorbitant prices, all of them major powers. They're publicly declaring resistance against terrorists, vowing to eradicate terrorist organizations. Yet, behind closed doors, they're purchasing our weapons.' 'That's the truthâ€”ephemeral as a cloud!' Ye Wei's laughter grew even more enchanting. Miss Cheng remained silent, while Ye Sanshao chuckled. The arms market, under the control of the covert organization's senior members, had a stranglehold on many international lifelines. Their power was formidable, undeniable. The next heir was their own Ning Ning, whose influence was anticipated to grow even grander. After a brief moment, Ye Sanshao sought out Black Hawk for the latest on Dragon Gate. Ye Wei approached Cheng An Ya, 'Third sister-in-law, let's not bring up our earlier conversation to Ning Ning.' 'Why not?' 'He hasn't spoken of Nuo Nuo since regaining his sight.' 'I understand,' Cheng An Ya replied. 'Thank you all. Without you, Ning Ning's prospects would have been dire.' 'We owe our thanks to Nuo Nuo. Ning Ning owes his life to her sacrifice.' ... By noon, five fighter jets and three helicopters took to the skies from the castle, all charting a course for Mesilia. Chu Li, Jason, and Black Jack were aboard. In truth, Chu Li alone could have managed the situation. There was scarcely a challenge that necessitated the combined might of the three leaders of Dragon Gate. Jason and Black Jack were simply bored, and with the Mafia unable to stir up trouble, it was an opportune time to hone their skills. Inside the research lab, a whirlwind of activity unfolded, with the team of virus experts ensnared in a frenzy of urgency. Bai Ye's expression was stoic as he faced a situation that left him at an unprecedented loss. His brows, typically distant and aloof, now nearly converged in deep concern. 'Mr. Bai, who is the mastermind behind this virus?' the head of the expert team inquired. 'In my nearly four decades in this field, I have never encountered such a malevolent virus.' 'It was developed by the Mafia,' Bai Ye revealed, his gaze unyielding as he scrutinized the molecular structure of the virus displayed on the large LCD screen. Although virology may not have been his specialty, Bai Ye had some expertise, generally with laudable results. Yet, he had never before seen a virus with such a complex pathology. 'That's unfortunate,' the team leader mused. 'Last June, over a hundred virus experts converged on Rome. One was my friend. He mentioned working on a virus for the Mafia, likely this very one.' 'Can you still contact him?' Bai Ye asked, urgency coloring his tone. Those experts were undoubtedly the best of the best. 'He's passed away,' the team leader replied somberly. Bai Ye understood the grave implication. These experts were under the terrorists' command, Rome's elite. If they were at an impasse... Hope was fading. 'Mr. Bai, are there any leads at all?' Bai Ye shook his head. 'This is the most challenging case I've encountered.' The complexity of the virus was daunting. 'Proceed with the best relief agent possible. Every day we can gain is precious,' Bai Ye instructed with resolve, and the team leader quickly set to work. Although the antidote was elusive, a relief agent was within reach. Yet, it could only delay the inevitable for about 20 days at most. Bai Ye's thoughts turned to Xiao Naibao's earnest gaze, and his heart grew heavy. 'Mr. Bai, I've examined all virus records. This is a new strain, previously undocumented,' a middle-aged man reported, offering a dossier to Bai Ye. 'However, in 1934, a similar pathogen swept through Siberia. It was also transmissible and cellular, with symptoms akin to Miss Cheng's. The difference lies in the absence of a second-wave infectant. The infected had a lifespan of a month, but the principle should be similar. The official stance was a nuclear war leak, but the actual cause was the virus.' Bai Ye's eyes ignited with interest as he seized the report, devouring its contents with an almost voracious hunger. The virus, designated su-1934, was formidable, having ravaged a Siberian town. The government had sealed all exit routes to contain the spread, leading to a cleanup of the entire town and nearly 50,000 deaths. This virus was also cellular, the most analogous precedent they could find. 'Gather all information on 1934. I need every piece of data,' Bai Ye ordered decisively, and the man nodded, rushing off to gather the requested information. The stately Bai Ye, draped in his white lab coat, leaned intently over the computer. The lab buzzed with activity, a hive of dedicated study as specialists analyzed the virus and experimented with various reagents in their quest for solutions. 'Mr. Bai, perhaps we should consider this. Since the Mafia are the architects, they surely know the antidote,' the team leader suggested. 'Developing a new viral agent is a lengthy process, and Ye Sanshao and Miss Cheng may not be able to wait.' Even with a relief agent, they could only delay the outcome for 20 days, and they might still be without a clue. Furthermore, the virus's inherent instability and its cellular nature meant that if it manifested abruptly, the relief agent would be useless, sealing a fatal outcome. 'Self-reliance ensures ample sustenance,' Bai Ye declared, invoking the proverb with a composed demeanor. The team leader was speechless. With Louis having targeted Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao without mercy, it was dubious he would provide an antidote. He would have anticipated their detoxification attempts, their inevitable failure, and their search for him. By the time they found himâ€”if everâ€”their lives would likely be over. The risk was too great. He was convinced that Louis would remain hidden for the foreseeable future. Why waste effort on a futile pursuit? After lunch, Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao succumbed to exhaustion. Since their return the previous night, they had been preoccupied with medical exams and blood tests. Fatigued by the relentless assault of the virus, rest had eluded them. Ignored by Ye Wei for a full day, Mo Jue felt slighted. He clung to Ye Wei's sleeve, his gaze filled with reproach and yearning. Ye Wei was sorely tempted to send him into the swimming pool. Xiao Naibao was intrigued by this version of Mo Jue. 'Auntie, has he been acting like this for days?' 'Five days,' Ye Wei confirmed. 'He's been possessed.' Xiao Naibao was fascinated by Mo Jue's transformation. The once enigmatic and formidable Mo Jue now brimmed with innocence, his violet eyes free of their typical duplicity, a stark contrast to his past. Watching him now, endearingly referring to Ye Wei as 'wife' repeatedly, was a sight to behold. 'Wife, are you speaking ill of me?' Mo Jue's eyes conveyed a sense of hurt as he puckered his lips, planting a bite on Ye Wei's cheek. Xiao Naibao shivered; such tenderness was foreign to him. His own displays of affection at three years old paled in comparison to Mo Jue's current demeanor. Ye Wei, now accustomed to his touches, stroked his hair. 'Behave, wife adores ghosts the most. The ones you loathe, you could easily scare to death. It's a form of flattery, understand?' 'Really?' Mo Jue's innocence radiated through his gaze. Without missing a beat, Ye Wei affirmed, 'Of course, when have I ever deceived you?' Xiao Naibao remained silent. Such remarkable calm. He couldn't help but reflect on Ye Wei's composure, a trait beyond the reach of ordinary individuals. 'Auntie, can he find Mo Ye?' Xiao Naibao asked directly, unconcerned whether Mo Jue comprehended. He sought a straightforward answer. 'He claims he can't,' Ye Wei replied. 'Big Boss Mo, that ice block, seems untouchable. The second brother is still the second brother, after all.' Xiao Naibao, '......' Mo Jue once again wore an aggrieved expression, clinging to Ye Wei as he continued to nibble. Xiao Naibao considered the scene inappropriate for children and promptly retreated to the research lab. 'Ning Ning, what brings you here?' 'Any leads yet?' Xiao Naibao discerned the gravity of Bai Ye's expression and grasped the severity of the situation, though he had braced himself for such news. At that moment, the comprehensive data on the 1934 virus was delivered. 'I'll discuss it with you shortly,' Bai Ye assured as he delved into the material. Driven by curiosity, Xiao Naibao joined him. The data on su-1934 was comprehensive, detailing the havoc, death toll, and the government's stringent measures. Bai Ye was most concerned with the virus's creator. 'Su Jinxiao?' 'Su Jinxiao?' Bai Ye echoed, the name unfamiliar to him, an encounter for the first time. The incident had been an accident, with the public narrative attributing the tragic deaths to a nuclear plant leak, while only a select few knew the virus was the true culprit. A spark of realization flared within Xiao Naibao, 'The grandfather of Su Man.' Chapter 370: To Riyadh Upon discovering that the creator of su-1934 was Grandfather Su, Xiao Naibao immediately reached out to Su Man. Beside him, Ye Wei's emotions were tumultuous; her gaze upon Xiao Naibao was filled with intense sorrow and rage, her delicate fingers tensed as if they were a ghost's claws, ready to deliver vigilante justice. Shi Yi, aware of the undercurrents of tension, maintained a composed smile. Mo Jue, with his lips forming a childlike pout, gazed at his wife and meekly remarked, "Wife, you're quite intimidating!" The group concurred; her presence was indeed fearsome, even Ye Sanshao was apprehensive that his sister might lash out at her own son. Her expression was downright chilling. Unaware of the reason behind the upheaval, except for Shi Yi, Bai Ye touched his nose thoughtfully. While Xiao Naibao waited for Su Man to answer the phone, he inquisitively looked at his aunt and asked, "Auntie, what are you doing?" "I despise you, I truly do..." Ye Wei, known for her enchanting allure, now looked like a sorrowful and vengeful spirit. Even Ning Ning felt a shiver down his spine. Before he could articulate his concerns, Su Man's voice emerged from the receiver. "Ning Ning?" Su Man's voice was remarkably soothing, like a breeze atop a mountain peak at dawnâ€”chilly yet refreshing, pure and untouched by worldly dust, instilling a sense of unapproachability and sanctity. "Yes, Su Meiren, I need your help. Can you get online? I have something to send you." Ning Ning's tone was urgent, foregoing any pleasantries, his attention solely on the pressing matter, ignoring his aunt's darkened expression. "Is there trouble?" "Yes, it's a life-and-death situation." Ning Ning was forthright. "Send it through, I'm online." Su Man responded calmly, without probing for details. As Ning Ning was about to reply, Ye Wei snatched the phone, "Su Meiren, it's been so long. Have you missed me?" After a brief pause... "Ye Wei?" "Why so formal? Just call me Weiwei. After all, we've been close before, no need for such distance now," Ye Wei responded, her laughter sultry, her voice dripping with seduction. Mo Jue's eyes conveyed a mix of sorrow and jealousy as he witnessed his wife's flirtatious behavior. His inner beast stirred, ignited by a fierce desire to confront Su Man, to tear him apart. A sudden cold wave of murderous intent swept through the room, causing Shi Yi, Bai Ye, and Ye Chen to shiver. Ye Wei merely raised an eyebrow at Mo Jue and continued to regally ignore him. Mo Jue's aura of deadly intent grew thicker. The others felt a fleeting wave of concern that he might revert to his former self, but his eyes, though filled with lethal purpose, were devoid of malice. His fists clenched in silent anguish, yet he took no action, reassuring the others of his restraint. "I'm busy. Goodbye," stated Su Man, ending the call with decisive finality. Ye Wei's captivating charm was not something that any man could easily endure; it tested one's very resilience. Even Su Man, a man known for his composure, chose to steer clear of her, which spoke volumes about Ye Wei's formidable allure. If she set her sights on a man, no one, regardless of their identity, could do anything but flee from her, utterly incapable of standing as her equal. "Su Meiren's dismissal with a mere three words..." Ye Wei lamented, her frustration palpable as she held the phone. "After all my yearnings, such a waste of my affections." Cheng An Ya and Ye Chen shared an amused glance as Bai Ye approached Xiao Naibao. Ning Ning had just sent Bai Ye's organized data to Su Man. Shi Yi gestured towards Mo Jue, who now resembled a ghost. Ye Wei's smile faded slightly, and with a feigned innocence, she inquired, "Big White, who's troubling you? Tell your wife, and I'll make them pay." Mo Jue, in his characteristically straightforward manner, pointed directly at Ye Wei, conveying his sense of betrayal, "Wife, it is you who have wronged me." Everyone, "......" Ye Chen managed to suppress a smile, not wishing to completely dismantle Ye Wei's facade. The childlike Mo Jue had become her bane; her typical guile was ineffective against him. He expressed his discontent in the simplest ways, oblivious to the nuances of adult interactions. Ye Wei offered a playful smile, "Are you implying I should punish myself?" Mo Jue, still visibly upset, glared and swiftly moved to Ye Wei's side, grasping her sleeve and crying out, "Wife, who is this person, who is he, why are you so kind to him? You are seducing him!" Shi Yi felt a chill at the word 'seducing'. The once naive Mo Jue now grasped the concept of seduction, a revelation that was nothing short of miraculous. Recalling his time as Big White, he was a blank slate, with no understanding beyond 'wife'. Now, he understood it all. Ye Wei's influence had been transformative; she had imbued the innocent soul with her own hues. The term 'influential' was an understatement. Should Mo Jue return to his former self and reflect on his days as Big White... Well... Ye Wei might not have enough heads to spare for the vengeance he would seek. Such was his relentless nature; forgiveness was not in his vocabulary. She harbored a tinge of concern for Ye Wei's future prospects. With a tender stroke of Mo Jue's cheek, Ye Wei's smile was captivating, "Big White, how could you accuse your wife like that? He's miles away; seduction is impossible. The only one I would ever seduce is you." "Wife, you don't love me anymore, do you? Please don't let your heart wander. Big White will be very good, very obedient." Mo Jue's face was a picture of misery as he clung to Ye Wei's arm, fearing that she might cast him aside. Ye Wei remained silent, pondering the child's choice of words. Speaking of transferring affections, one was past tense, the other present. Surely it meant transferring love from Su Man to herself, right? Ye Wei was at a loss for words. "Wife..." Mo Jue was not easily mollified. Ye Wei, her patience waning, struck his abdomen with a punch and declared, "Stop this nonsense, or I'll beat you so badly, you won't even recognize your own brother." Everyone, "......" Miss Cheng and Ye Sanshao watched the unfolding drama with unbridled amusement, exchanging glances that reflected their enjoyment of the couple's dynamic. Miss Cheng contemplated the thrilling challenge of managing a man with such extremes. She vividly recalled the scars on Ye Wei's body, the aftermath of a savage beating, the iron lotus on her wrist that had nearly crippled her handâ€”these scars attested to the man's ferocity. Now, in his pallid state, he was malleable, presenting a unique challenge. Only Ye Wei's formidable spirit could keep him in check. Mo Jue felt a profound sense of betrayal, his violet eyes brimming with tears, his delicate lips quivering as if caught in an autumnal breeze, startling all present. Xiao Naibao, witnessing this spectacle for the first time, contrasted it with the stern figure he had encountered in the supermarket. His lips curved into a sly grin, "Big White, do you know who Su Meiren is? My aunt's former lover. She was quite passionate about him, pursued him for a full year. Now she's jealous because I have Su Meiren's contact, and she doesn't. That's why she's envious of me." Hearing this, Mo Jue's sorrowful gaze upon Ye Wei intensified. He rose abruptly, his anger surging, and departed with a dramatic sweep of his sleeve, displaying unexpected dignity and resolve. Ye Wei stood there, dumbfounded... o(â•¯â–¡â•°)o! Damn it, Mo Jue, are you rebelling? He had the audacity to turn his back on her, to sulk with such petulance. She was genuinely taken aback by his insolence. Miss Cheng, with unwavering calm, advised, "Weiwei, you should go and soothe him; he is truly upset." "Weiwei, is this the first time he's been angry with you?" Shi Yi inquired, seemingly in disbelief. Since that day, Mo Jue had held Ye Wei's words in the highest regard; she said one, he wouldn't dare say two. If Ye Wei commanded death, he wouldn't allow life. Her words were sacred, her decrees were truth. His obedience was absolute, his devotion unshakableâ€”he feared nothing more than displeasing Ye Wei. This was indeed a rare spectacle. Shi Yi surmised that Ye Wei had not only colored Mo Jue's world with her own hues but also infused him with a dose of her own fiery temperament. After Xiao Naibao's troublemaking, he grinned elegantly, and Bai Ye gave a nod of approval. Witnessing Ye Wei's unraveling was a rarity, and with the show freely provided, he was naturally eager to spectate. "He's defied me." Ye Wei slammed the table, stood up with determination, and stormed off, her fury suggesting she was ready to exact vengeance on someone. "Auntie, Su Man responded to your message." Xiao Naibao called out behind her, but Ye Wei, as if deaf to his words, had disappeared from sight. Laughter filled the room. Indeed, every force meets its counterforce, yet Ye Wei's nemesis was unexpectedly extraordinary. They say a pure heart and a dark mind are a perfect match, and they couldn't be more right. Especially when one is as purely white as this. Su Man had clearly reviewed the documents, including the data on su-1934 and the analysis of the new virus. As a virologist, he quickly understood the specialized information. Su Man: Bring the person here. Mommy is the Most Important of All: Is there hope for a cure? Su Man: 70% certainty. Mommy is the Most Important of All: Excellent, I'm departing immediately. Su Man sent an address to Xiao Naibao, and Bai Ye committed it to memory. He harbored a mild curiosity, "A 70% chance, is he sure? With so many experts at a standstill, can he truly make a difference?" It was a bold claim to assert a 70% chance of success based solely on the documents. "If Su Man believes there's a chance, then we must trust there is one. Let us hasten to Riyadh. It's only a matter of hours away, and the round trip will be swift," Xiao Naibao urged. This opportunity, promising a potential cure for his parents, was not to be missed. Miss Cheng and Ye Sanshao exchanged a glance, signaling their agreement. "I will accompany you," Bai Ye declared, his countenance calm, his emotions hidden. Yet within him, a whirlwind of curiosity and excitement was brewing. Chapter 371: A Beauty's Smile Overturns the City (Part 1) In the silent contest of prowess among men, Bai Ye, lauded as a genius medic, was intrigued by a virus that baffled many experts, despite his modest foray into virology. When a man confidently claimed a seventy percent chance of success, it invariably signaled a near certainty of a cure to their kind. Bai Ye was keen to gauge the true extent of this individual's abilities. The mention of a high-speed magnetic wave scanner alone was an eye-opener. Su Man was a name that rang like thunder. Neither Ye Sanshao nor Cheng An Ya had any objection; a trip promised to be brief, and the prospect of a cure was too enthralling to delay. With Bai Ye and Ning Ning orchestrating the logistics, the aircraft was swiftly prepared. The leadership of the premier terrorist organization was temporarily entrusted to Claude, while Bai Ye instructed the lab experts to press on with virus research, directing them to communicate any breakthroughs immediately to preclude redundant efforts by Su Man. The arrangements were faultless. Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and Mo Jue weren't initially considered, yet as the aircraft readied for takeoff, Ye Wei boarded, Mo Jue in tow. Shi Yi, ever loyal to Ye Wei, quickly followed suit. Mo Jue's presence raised the possibility of an encounter with Mo Ye. 'Why join this escapade, Auntie?' Ning Ning was puzzled. Everyone knew of Ye Wei's past affair with Su Man, and now she had brought along a visibly jealous Mo Jueâ€”wasn't this inviting chaos? He had hoped Su Man would focus on treating his parents. 'Why can't I go? It's been ages since Su Man and I last caught up,' Ye Wei countered with a smile so beguiling it was regrettable that only Bai Ye, Ye Sanshao, and Mo Jue were present to witness. Otherwise, she would have dazzled the entire room. Everyone was skeptical about her definition of 'chatting.' Surely, it wasn't meant to be this provocative. She must dream of rekindling things with Su Man. Indeed, with Mo Jue, a paragon of compliance and beauty, Ye Wei still harbored thoughts of Su Man, leaving everyone bewildered. What magic did Su Man wield to captivate so thoroughly? Even Ning Ning, who typically possessed high standards, couldn't help but express admiration for Su Man. Mo Jue, who had earlier stormed off with dignified fury, now quickly transformed into the very image of a doting husband, clinging to Ye Weiâ€”an image of a man who'd do anything his wife desired. Such a drastic transformation was unexpected. Ye Sanshao and Bai Ye both gave Ye Wei a thumbs-up, while simultaneously expressing disdain for Mo Jue's henpecked demeanor. 'Brother Mo, feeling jealous?' Bai Ye inquired. Mo Jue, embracing Ye Wei, nodded emphatically, his innocent face devoid of any trace of jealousy. Ye Sanshao scoffed at the display; such docility was indeed rare. He wasn't nearly as indulgent with Cheng An Ya, sometimes delighting in her pursuit. Cheng An Ya gave a thumbs-up too, 'You have a gift for taming husbands, Wei Wei. Teach me your ways sometime.' 'Certainly, no problem. I guarantee Ye Sanshao will be beyond tractable,' Ye Wei assured. Ye Sanshao immediately pulled Cheng An Ya closer, his grin sinister, 'Miss Cheng, am I not treating you well enough? Why the need for taming techniques? Voice your concerns, and I shall address them forthwith.' Ning Ning shuddered and sought refuge closer to Bai Ye. Shi Yi's eyebrows arched, and Ye Wei quipped, 'You're so sour, brother. What did you eat for lunch? There's no need for such threats. If you were as accommodating as Big White, sister-in-law would treat you even better, with more tenderness.' Ye Sanshao silently glared at Ye Wei; he had no intention of emulating Mo Jue's pallid obedience. He was certain Cheng An Ya would take advantage and bully him more than Ye Wei ever did. His pride as a man was at stake. He couldn't fake Mo Jue's pure, unsullied demeanor even if he tried. 'I agree,' said Miss Cheng, looking forward to seeing if Ye Sanshao could assume a new guise for a bit of excitement. 'Come on, give me a smile, dear,' Miss Cheng teased, playfully hooking Ye Sanshao's chin. Ye Sanshao's lips twitched vehemently. This flirtatious demeanor mirrored Ye Wei's, wholly mastering the art, indeed birds of a feather flock together. He concluded his wife needed to stay a good two hundred meters away from his sister to avoid being led astray. Ye Wei collapsed into Mo Jue's arms, laughing, while even Shi Yi couldn't help but curl her lips with a hint of amusement. Ning Ning innocently covered his eyes, 'Mommy, please, not so stimulating. This is hardly suitable for children. You should also consider the pure hearts of your children.' Everyone, '......' Pure? If you're pure, what is dark? Bai Ye chuckled, offering an evaluation, 'Women, terrifying indeed.' 'I empathize with you,' Ning Ning solemnly patted Bai Ye's shoulder, expressing his condolences, 'Truly terrifying, I mourn for your future.' Bai Ye and Chu Li, long oppressed by Ye Wei and Shi Yi, empathized deeply. Now, witnessing Miss Cheng's wicked humor, anyone would find women intimidating. Bai Ye returned Ning Ning's comforting gesture, 'I also mourn for you twenty years from now.' 'I don't need it,' Ning Ning replied with a smile. The one who would have been tormented was no longer there, leaving everything hollow. He was content having Nuo Nuo in his heart for a lifetime. Other women didn't matter; he didn't need anyone else, so no one could torment him. Miss Cheng was conversing with Ye Sanshao when she overheard this and felt a deep heaviness in her heart, not sure what to say to Ning Ning. She gave him a profound look. The rest didn't think much about Nuo Nuo and continued to jest. Ye Sanshao and the others were family, familiar with each other, and Bai Ye, despite his reserved nature, had grown up with Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and others, forming good bonds with them, so he got along well with Ye Sanshao. The atmosphere remained vibrant, unmarred by the virus situation. Everyone was carefree, unwilling to let the circumstances dampen their spirits. Shi Yi curiously asked, 'Big White, why did you allow Wei Wei to go to Riyadh? Aren't you afraid your wife will be lured away by Su Man?' Ye Wei kicked her. Since when had this block of ice learned to watch her drama? That deserved a reproof. Shi Yi, always cool and detached, ignored Ye Wei's protest, thinking the drama was too good to miss. Not just her, but Bai Ye, Miss Cheng, Ye Sanshao, and Ning Ning were all curious, their gaze fixed on Mo Jue. Mo Jue blinked, answering truthfully, 'Wife said Su Man isn't as attractive as me. She left Su Man, not me. I am the rightful partner.' Everyone, '......' Even Shi Yi, usually so cold, choked up a bit, let alone Cheng An Ya and the others. Wei Wei, you could actually say such things, truly... Formidable. 'Brother Mo, Wei Wei is fooling you. I assure you on my character that those words are insincere. Look at her excitement at the mention of Su Man. And you believe that?' Bai Ye, oppressed for years, naturally wouldn't miss a chance to incite chaos. Ning Ning expressed similar suspicions. Mo Jue's purple eyes flitted with confusion, seeing everyone nodding in agreement, then looking at Ye Wei. He tugged at Ye Wei's sleeve and asked, 'Wife, would you deceive me?' 'No,' Ye Wei replied, her beauty nonchalantly serene. Mo Jue was content, scornfully sweeping over everyone, 'Wife said she wouldn't deceive me. Do not sow discord.' Shi Yi's eye twitched; to think Mo Jue could be trained like this by Ye Wei was indeed rare. Ning Ning laughed heartily. As a fellow man, Bai Ye saluted Mo Jue with a hundred points of respect. Ye Sanshao, quite heartlessly, leaned on Cheng An Ya's shoulder, laughing uncontrollably. This man was too adorable. Miss Cheng was composed; Mo Jue's expression as he said 'don't sow discord' was quite something, the epitome of an innocent white rabbit. 'Wei Wei, you have the skills,' Miss Cheng acknowledged. 'Miss Cheng, you flatter me,' Ye Wei responded. The two women exchanged a smile, and Miss Cheng glanced at Ye Sanshao. He shivered, feeling very uneasy. Miss Cheng's mischievousness was not minor, and being targeted by her meant a dead end. 'Miss Cheng, stop imagining those strange things in your head. He's not my type,' Ye Sanshao declared. Mo Jue was the quintessential image of a henpecked husband, and no man would aspire to emulate him. Ye Wei laughed, 'Brother, our Mo Jue is younger and more tender than you, delicious indeed. From his exterior to his core, he's pure.' Miss Cheng's smile grew even more gentle, 'You don't even know the meaning of 'pure,' do you?' Ning Ning joined in, 'Mommy, if you feel unconvinced, you could try having an affair. Su Man isn't bad, quite the beauty.' 'Watch it, or I'll end you,' Ye Sanshao threatened. If he could strike someone right then, he'd have slapped Ning Ning on the back of the head. Ye Wei wanted to say that Su Meiren was hers, but considering Mo Jue's pure white face, she wisely held her tongue. Observing the two beleaguered men, Bai Ye relished the joys of being single. The sun was bright, and life was beautiful. 'Wife, what are you talking about?' Mo Jue inquired with innocence. Cheng An Ya suddenly spoke up, 'Wei Wei, I suddenly concur with your earlier remark. Mo Jue must indeed be more alluring than Su Man. A man of such appearance is a world's first.' He was matchless, indeed. She had never encountered anyone more beautiful than Mo Jue. Had he been a woman, he would have appeared like a fairy descended to earth, particularly those purple eyes brimming with allure. Even now, as untarnished as a blank canvas, his every scowl and smile were incomparable, without peer. Ye Wei chose not to comment, just laughing lightly. 'Miss Cheng, you dare compliment another man? Have you lost the will to live?' Ye Sanshao narrowed his eyes, reaching for her hair, clearly green with envy. Miss Cheng patted his head, advising earnestly, 'Ah Chen, be honest.' You indeed lack Mo Jue's looks; just accept it. Ning Ning pondered, 'I'm also keen to see Su Man's appearance. Auntie, is he truly celestial?' 'Ask Shi Yi,' Ye Wei waved her hand dismissively, remaining silent with Mo Jue present. Shi Yi glanced at Mo Jue and offered a fair assessment, 'Each has their strong points.' 'Then he must be celestial,' Ning Ning concluded with a chuckle. Cheng An Ya suddenly noted the jade pendant on Ning Ning's chest and couldn't contain her curiosity, 'My dear, what are you wearing? A jade pendant?' That seemed more suited to a girl. Her son never wore such things. Ning Ning's smile waned slightly, a flash of sorrow crossing his face, then quickly returned to calm. Before he could answer, Mo Jue responded, 'It belonged to my Nuo Nuo.' The mood sobered. Ye Wei and the others were privy to the backstory, but Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao were not. Ning Ning nonchalantly stowed the accidentally exposed pendant back inside, his expression serene, betraying no hint of grief or desolation. But years later, Cheng An Ya would reflect on this moment and realize. There is a tranquility akin to still waters. 'It's quite beautiful,' Cheng An Ya commented softly, Ye Sanshao tightening his grip on her hand. 'Yes, I also find it very pretty,' Ning Ning said, his smile returning. As they watched their harmonious tableau, he longed for Nuo Nuo. At night, he dared not sleep, fearing dreams of her would come, and upon waking, he could only grasp at the regrets lingering in the air, leading to sleepless nights. These feelings, experienced too early, felt all the more intense. As time passed, these memories grew clearer, deeply etched into his heart, leaving an indelible mark, never to be erased, a lifetime's companion, and he would live with these memories, without regret. Bai Ye patted Ning Ning's shoulder, and everyone fell silent for a moment. It was Ye Sanshao who broke the silence, tapping the table, 'Ning Ning, didn't I tell you to bring home an idiot? Straying too close to a strong one, you'll have to keep your distance. Didn't listen, and now you've suffered, right?' Miss Cheng was wordless. Bai Ye laughed. The lessons in love started exceptionally early. Ning Ning clasped his hands in an exaggerated gesture of worship, 'Wise and mighty daddy, your son will diligently heed your teachings and dare not transgress again.' Everyone chuckled lightly. The ambiance was once again lively, and Cheng An Ya smiled, no longer speaking, her heart, however, ached tremendously. His forced laughter was apparent to her, very heart-wrenching. Upon reaching Riyadh after a journey filled with laughter, the plane landed on a private airstrip, within a spacious manor resembling an oasis with vast date palm groves and a dense forest of palm trees. At the center of the courtyard garden was an exquisite fountain. The elegant villa courtyard was verdant, planted with a variety of exotic flowers and plants. The manor, though showing signs of age, exuded a heavy sense of history. The curved corridors were adorned with crystal lights shaped like lotus petals, exceptionally beautiful. Walls were covered with climbing vines, lush and green. Maids, dressed in traditional Arabian attireâ€”black robes, headcovers, and shawlsâ€”led them into the main hall. Ye Wei greeted them cheerfully, eliciting a round of light laughter. One of them, speaking English, said with a laugh, 'The master is going to have a headache again.' Riyadh was intensely hot in the summer, but the main hall was cool throughout. Bai Ye, with his keen observational skills, noticed the walls were made of ice jade carvings. Though ordinary in appearance, they were cool to the touch, a design to counter the summer heat. A clever innovation. 'Their walls are all carved from ice jade, the luxury of the rich,' Ye Wei commented, who had stayed here with Shi Yi before and was very familiar with the place. She naturally took some fruit from the table to quench her thirst after disembarking from the hot plane. Soon, maids brought over cold beverages and fruit snacks. Knowing Ye Wei and Shi Yi's preferences, they also prepared two glasses of blue-green fruit drinks for them. Using Arabic, Ye Wei said, 'Sister Daina, I didn't expect you to remember my favorite. I'm so touched.' Daina smiled and replied, 'The master is currently hosting Princess Qi. He'll be over shortly.' 'Is she attractive?' Ye Wei was curious. The visitor must have come to throw herself at him. Ye Wei had witnessed even more astonishing scenes last year. Daina's large eyes brimmed with laughter, 'Not as pretty as you.' Ye Wei was satisfied. Sister Daina, you're really on point. Bai Ye shook his head and nudged her shoulder, 'Can your husband understand Arabic?' Flirting should be preceded by pacifying the home front. Ye Wei had neglected this and spoke to Mo Jue in Arabic, 'Big White, my drink tastes awful. Let's swap.' Mo Jue obediently exchanged their drinks, but Ye Wei quickly stopped him, 'Never mind, I suddenly find it quite palatable.' He understood. Ye Wei was in a dilemma. Ning Ning laughed and translated for Cheng An Yaâ€”they were the only ones who didn't understand Arabic; she wasn't as multilingual as the others, knowing just English, Japanese, and French. Before long, someone outside announced the master's arrival. A tall figure slowly entered, backlit by the sun, clad in a white robe, radiating a calm and tranquil aura. He exuded an aura of untouchable sanctity. Cheng An Ya's first impression was, indeed, it was Su Man! Everyone shared the same thought. A beauty's smile overturns the city. Chapter 372: A Beauty's Smile Overturns the City (Part 2) Su Man, in his mid-twenties, exudes a dignified posture, breaking away from the traditional Arabian attire. Opting out of the classic white robe, black headband, and white headscarf, he dons only the robe, his long hair bound with a silver ribbon trailing behind him. His willow leaf eyebrows, slender and extended, conjure images of distant mountains' silhouettes, while his black, spirited eyes mirror the clarity of spring water in mountain gorges, emanating a crisp cleanliness within their frostiness, akin to the penetrating chill of winds across icy expanses. His nose stands high, his lips are finely shaped, boasting a vibrant hue, and even his chin is exquisitely alluringâ€”each feature a testament to divine artistry. He carries an aura of aloofness, an inviolable coldness that seems out of reach. The distinction of his features would never mistake him for a woman; he is unmistakably a man brimming with self-assurance and potency. No woman could wield such a domineering presence, nor exude such an air of unmatched pride. Dressed in white that surpasses the snow's purity, with black hair accented by a silver ribbon, he personifies an unmatched, breathtaking elegance. As he makes his entrance, he effortlessly captures every gaze; he becomes the center of the universe, with the world fading into obscurity around him. Even the worldly men and women of the hall, though often unfazed, find themselves ensnared in a reverent hush by his beauty. Even Ye Wei and Shi Yi, accustomed to his allure, are taken aback. Some individuals, regardless of the frequency of encounters, never fail to dazzle as if seen for the first time. Su Man's eyes, accustomed to such admiration, sweep across the hall and finally come to rest on Xiao Naibao, his lips, which seldom curve into a smile, now doing so ever so slightly. Instantaneous charm, a smile that captivates the entire city. "Su Meiren, I've missed you," declares Ye Wei, snapping out of the collective trance. Disregarding Mo Jueâ€™s potential jealousy, she rushes forward, hoping for an embrace. Yet, someone is quicker than her. Mo Jue moves with swift grace, intercepting her with a pull of the waist, drawing her away from Su Man. His face, a masterpiece of God, is etched with protest, "Wife..." He lingers on the word 'wife' with a longing undertone. Su Man raises an eyebrow, his gaze as cold as the Antarctic as it lands on Ye Wei and Mo Jue. Ye Wei, failing to reach Su Man, is inwardly aggrieved, though she dares not let Mo Jue's temper flare; she is steeped in frustration. "I don't miss you at all," Su Man states, his voice crisp, carrying a clear, clean timbre that cuts through the silence. He harbors a deep respect for Mo Jue, the only man who seems to rein in Ye Wei; otherwise, who knows how many others would have fallen under her spell? "Su Meiren, that's hardly fair," protests Ye Wei, patting Big White's hand, signaling he can let go. Bringing him along was starting to seem like a misjudgment; if not for the fact that no one else in the castle could rein him in, she would not have brought him. "Su Man." Xiao Naibao approaches, his expression contemplative, and openly praises, "You are indeed full of surprises." Though tales of Su Man's otherworldly allure are widespread, it's only upon meeting him that one truly grasps his formidable nobility and unparalleled elegance. "Little one, you too are a surprise," responds Su Man, patting Xiao Naibaoâ€™s shoulder with a trace of warmth, "And Ye Wei is here as well?" Ye Wei bristles immediately, "What do you mean by that, Su Meiren?" Shi Yi states plainly, "He has discarded you." Xiao Naibao smiles, "She's my aunt." "The world is indeed quite small." Su Man's usually icy eyes reflect a hint of resignation, as he finds himself surrounded by familiar faces once again. Xiao Naibao introduces everyone in the group. Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao, burdened by the virus, simply nod in acknowledgment. Su Man, who usually prefers solitude, finds this situation surprisingly agreeable. A nod is sufficient for Bai Ye as well. "Ning Ning, why such a crowd for a medical visit?" Su Man's chilly glance sweeps across the room, exerting a subtle pressure. Some people naturally command such an atmosphere, and with a simple comment, they can intimidate. Ye Sanshao holds her peace, and Miss Cheng also remains silent. Those touched by genius often carry peculiar temperaments. However, their presence is necessary for treatment, so the rest is of no concern. "Can't I miss you? It's common knowledge that Shi Yi and I are inseparable," Ye Wei retorts. "Yes, and you've brought the whole family along." "Ah, are you regretting not accepting me earlier?" Ye Wei flirts, linking her arm with Su Man's, "Do you truly not miss me at all, Su Meiren?" "I don't," Su Man responds succinctly. His gaze shifts, freezing in its coldness, and Mo Jue has already secured Ye Wei by his side, his purple eyes emitting a subtle sourness. "Wife, please don't do this. If you wish to embrace someone, let it be me, okay?" The onlookers, "......" The others have their rationales; Bai Ye comments lightly, "He's quite arrogant." "He has the gravitas to match," Shi Yi observes, "He never offered us a friendly face, even after learning of our identities." "Ah, Wei Wei, so that's your preference? But..." Bai Ye glances at Mo Jue with a teasing smile, "The shift in your taste is remarkable." Mo Jue misses the nuance in Bai Ye's words, but Xiao Naibao smiles, and even Shi Yi can't suppress a chuckle. Ye Wei dismisses the subject with a wave of her hand, finding herself at a loss for words, "It was entirely accidental..." "Is he Arab?" Bai Ye inquires curiously, noting Su Man's features which bear the depth of an Arab's, yet also the refinement of an Easterner's, leaning more towards the latter. "His mother is Arab, his father Chinese. He's of mixed heritage," Xiao Naibao explains. Everyone nods; individuals of mixed heritage often possess a stunning beauty, and while they've encountered several, none have been as mesmerizing as Su Man. Ye Wei reclines in her chair, sipping her chilled drink, and slowly states, "Now you see why I was so captivated. Su Meiren is irresistible, both inside and out. Spend more time with him, and you'll seeâ€”he's a man of rare authenticity." Unfortunately, he holds no interest in her. Rumor has it Su Man prefers men, making her ineligible from the startâ€”a true tragedy indeed. "Auntie, it appears your charm is waning," Xiao Naibao teases. "Nonsense, child. He's still utterly ensnared," Ye Wei gestures toward Mo Jue, her allure undiminished by him. Mo Jue, gripping Ye Wei's hand, interrogates, "Wife, didnâ€™t you say he was less handsome than me, and that you had already forsaken him? Why do you still seek his closeness? You lied to me." "Old friends naturally miss each other, and embracing is a basic courtesy. Do you understand?" Mo Jue shakes his head, pointing to Shi Yi, "She didn't hug him." Bai Ye and Xiao Naibao stifle their laughter, Shi Yi snorts coldly, and Ye Wei elaborates, "Have you ever seen Shi Yi hug anyone? One would have to be courting death to seek her embrace. How can you compare your wife to Shi Yi?" One must never conflate fire with ice. "Wife, I would prefer it if you were like Shi Yi, less warm. Big White doesn't fancy it much," Mo Jue mutters, his mood plummeting, his head bowed, his once vibrant purple eyes now dim with despondency. Ye Wei feels a pang of discomfort at this version of Mo Jue; it makes her... uneasy. She never intended to change her ways for anyone, and since Su Man isn't interested, a little harmless flirtation seems inconsequential. "Wei Wei, have you noticed? He seems to be growing more astute," Shi Yi suddenly says, observing a distinct evolution over recent days. He's no longer the blank slate he once was, no longer taking Ye Wei's every word as gospel. Ye Wei nods in agreement, while Shi Yi harbors another concernâ€”is he close to regaining his former self, or...? "Big White, have you recalled anything?" Ye Wei inquires softly. Mo Jue shakes his head, and both Shi Yi and Ye Wei exchange glances, choosing silence. Perhaps it's merely an illusion. "Wife, if you persist in this manner, I will end him," Mo Jue declares somberly, his purple eyes brimming with a deadly intent. "..." "Big White, come along. Let's take in the splendor of Riyadh together." Ye Wei ushers Mo Jue out of the room, and his somber expression instantly gives way to a bright, sunny disposition. This is a modestly sized research lab. As a virus expert, Su Man's personal lab is equipped with the world's most sophisticated research tools, compact yet fully stocked. One glance reveals test tubes, reagents, automated apparatus, computer diagram analysis, and vast LCD screens. Su Man collects blood samples from the pair and administers two different colored reagents. With only three present, Ye Sanshao senses no need for restraint and asks with urgency, "Mr. Su, is there truly a cure for this virus?" As Su Man performs a systematic check on Cheng An Ya, he responds with detached professionalism, "There might be, or there might not. I cannot guarantee it; it all depends on the virus's level of instability." Ye Sanshao prepares himself mentally, exchanging a subtle smile with Cheng An Ya, which she returns. At this point, life and death have seemingly lost their weight. Su Man, observing this pair, feels a kinship, likely due to his closeness with Ning Ning. If they could raise someone like Xiao Naibao, the parents themselves must be extraordinary. Moreover, the world has been abuzz with Ye Sanshao's exploits and scandals just months prior. Aware that they are Ning Ning's parents, Su Man took an interest, finding their story quite captivating. Now, witnessing their composed approach to life and death, he admires them. "Just call me Su Man." His voice remains crisp, bereft of any emotional undulation. Cheng An Ya smiles, allowing the examination to continue while engaging in conversation, "Su Man, how did you come to know Ning Ning?" "It was a chance encounter. He wanted a weapon diagram that I possessed. I was hesitant to share it, but he managed to hack into my computer. I had no choice but to concede; otherwise, he might have 'assisted' me in becoming stateless, gratis. I could have woken up to discover an unexpected name in the spouse column of my ID card, all thanks to his interference." Su Man recounts the incident. As Xiao Naibao's parents, Ye Sanshao and Miss Cheng experience a mix of embarrassment and pride... Their son's approach... was undoubtedly bandit-like! Emulating his son, Ye Sanshao thinks smugly, though the tactics are underhanded and scheming, they are undoubtedly effective. "...you are indeed unfortunate." Miss Cheng manages to say, instantly regretting her words. Shouldn't they, as parents, be the ones apologizing? Miss Cheng, o(â•¯â–¡â•°)o! "Indeed, I've accepted my fate," Su Meiren replies nonchalantly, in a tone that doesn't quite match the seriousness of the situation. Miss Cheng's coddling of Xiao Naibao has reached new heights. "A little misfortune isn't so terrible; my son is quite useful." Ye Sanshao comments, feeling no shame for Xiao Naibao's behavior, but rather a sense of honor. Su Man nods in agreement, "Indeed." Miss Cheng and Ye Sanshao feel a sense of closure; Su Meiren is exceedingly cooperative. The circumstances of their meeting are trivial; what matters is their current friendship, ageless and agreeable. As Su Man wraps up his examination of Miss Cheng, he raises an eyebrow, a flicker of realization crossing his frosty gaze, "I now understand that Ning Ning's personality wasn't shaped by his upbringing but is inherited." Ye Sanshao, "......" Miss Cheng, "......" Su Man instructs Miss Cheng to stand and Ye Sanshao to lay down, adding, "But you were correct." While examining Ye Sanshao, Su Man reviews the on-screen images and data, his gaze darkening. Cheng An Ya, unfamiliar with Arabic, can't decipher the text, but the images are explicit enoughâ€”they depict a liver. "This is going to be challenging." Su Man muses aloud. Cheng An Ya's heart quickens, a sense of apprehension arising, "What's the problem? Is there no hope?" "The virus has penetrated the liver; his case is more severe than yours," Su Man reveals bluntly, assuming they can withstand the truth, so he refrains from sugarcoating, "It's a cellular virus. Once it invades the liver, his bodily functions will sharply decline. In less than a day, he will lose the ability to move, only able to survive in a lab with the help of sedatives and an oxygen mask." Cheng An Ya's eyes widen instantly, her complexion turns ashen, her heart clenches with pain. Her mind goes blank, her limbs grow numb and icy with dread. The premonition of losing Ye Sanshao intensifies. "Su Man, what can we do?" Cheng An Ya strives for composure but fails; her voice trembles, her slender body rigid with tension. Ye Sanshao extends his hand, grasping Cheng An Ya's, the chill of his touch wrenching at her heart. Although they have reconciled with the notion of life and death, the imminent reality of a permanent separation elicits pain and despair. "Do not fret, Xiao An Ya, the situation is not devoid of hope," Ye Sanshao speaks soothingly, "We've already come to terms with it, haven't we?" "The predicament is more dire than anticipated, but it's not hopeless. Be assured; I'll exert every effort," Su Man asserts with determination, his icy eyes unwavering, "Ning Ning seldom requests my help, and I am committed to fulfilling his wish." Cheng An Ya breathes a sigh of relief; Su Man's words carry an inherent trustworthiness. "And her?" Su Man glances at Cheng An Ya, "She's faring well, still within manageable limits. She's the initial wave of infection; the virus is more stable in her, so her condition remains favorable." "Why is he affected more severely? I was infected before him." "Infection timing plays a minimal role." Su Man elucidates, "This variant of the cellular virus wasn't particularly unstable to begin with, and as he is the second wave of infection, the instability is exacerbated, heightening the potential for mutations." Cheng An Ya, not well-versed in viral dynamics, feels a heavy sense of gravity as Su Man's expression becomes more solemn, while Ye Sanshao calmly accepts the grim news. "By the way, Su Man, su-1934 was developed by your grandfather. Bai Ye mentioned its principle is akin to this virusâ€”is there an antidote?" Cheng An Ya inquires. Su Man nods, his gaze briefly shadowed by a quickly concealed grief, "su-1934 was the product of my grandfather's research in his younger days. My grandmother was battling liver cancer, and his pursuit of cellular viruses was solely aimed at finding a cure. He worked in isolation, his research hidden from the world, aware of the catastrophic consequences that could result from virus research. Yet, it was stolen by an apprentice and fell into the hands of illicit elements, leading to a devastating loss of life in a Siberian town. He lived with profound regret, and dedicated his life to creating an antidote for su-1934, achieving success only in his final years. However, some documents were misplaced during a move, leaving the antidote's records incomplete. I need time to reconstruct the missing parts. While the principles are alike, this virus is evidently more intricate. At present, I have merely a preliminary concept and must be certain before venturing to test it on you." Ye Sanshao watches Su Man and offers a gentle smile, her demeanor serene, "Proceed with your work; I have confidence in you." Chapter 373: Wife, I Have No Interest in Him After Su Meiren had meticulously examined Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya, it was nearly evening when she emerged from the laboratory to prepare documents, leaving the maid to escort the couple to their accommodations. Xiao Naibao had been waiting anxiously in the room all afternoon, fretting over the examination that took longer than it had in Rome. He feared that if even Su Meiren couldn't find a solution, there might be no hope left in the world. Upon their return, Ye Sanshao's pallor was evident, causing Xiao Naibao's heart to sink. He hurried over, but Cheng An Ya, cautious of any accidental contact, instructed him to keep a safe distance. Reluctantly, Xiao Naibao complied. "Daddy, Mommy, are you okay? What did Su Meiren say?" Xiao Naibao asked urgently, having waited all afternoon and desperate for a glimmer of hope, despite the slim chances. Cheng An Ya didn't hide the truth from him. Xiao Naibao, though filled with fear and worry, didn't let it show. He pursed his lips and said, "Here, we have the world's top doctors and leading virus experts. Daddy and Mommy will surely be safe." Ye Sanshao managed a carefree laugh, admiring Xiao Naibao's composure, reminiscent of when Cheng An Ya had faced a car accident that nearly led to amputation. The child had been calm and even comforting to his grandfather. "Kiddo, don't worry excessively. Carry on with your usual activities. Since we trust them, let's trust them completely. No matter the outcome, your mommy and I will accept it," Ye Sanshao said calmly. "No need for such a long faceâ€”it's unlucky. Your daddy and mommy aren't dead yet, and you're already looking like you're cursed. Cheer up a bit." Miss Cheng waved her hand dismissively, unable to stand the sight of her son frowning. In her eyes, her son should always be smiling gracefully and adorably. A frown just didn't suit him. "Alright, alright," Xiao Naibao muttered, his rosy lips betraying his displeasure. "But you have to promise not to leave me." Miss Cheng smiled, playfully nudging him. "Wasn't it you who just said that with the top doctors and experts here, nothing would go wrong? How quickly have you changed your tune? Have you lost faith?" "Mommy, don't expose me like that," Xiao Naibao protested, his eyes wide with indignation. Miss Cheng and Ye Sanshao exchanged a knowing smile. "Little An Ya, Ning Ning, let's all go out later. You've never seen Riyadh before; the nightlife is truly splendid," Ye Sanshao suggested. Thanks to business, he had visited Riyadh twice, but each trip had been hurried, leaving no time to appreciate the city's beauty. However, the nighttime view had made a lasting impression. The idea of a family outing was precious to him. Aside from their previous seaside trip, the family had never traveled together, and Ye Sanshao wasn't sure if he would have another chance to enjoy these moments. He cherished the thought. "I agree," Xiao Naibao said, smiling elegantly, his eyes shining with childish delight. "Su Meiren mentioned that the local specialties here are quite famous." Ye Sanshao nodded and showed his son a thumbs-up, sharing a smile. Cheng An Ya hesitated, her eyes clouded with worry and fear as she recalled Zhang Bo's incidentâ€”a pain so intense it defied description. "With our condition, it's not safe for us to go out in public. If we accidentally infect others, it would be terrible." "You're right," Ye Sanshao conceded, realizing the potential risk on Riyadh's streets. "Damn, I can't even enjoy one last night of pleasure before I'm laid up tomorrow. Fate is truly a cruel mistress." Miss Cheng, "......" Xiao Naibao, "...... Daddy, please use civilized language and don't set a bad example for me." Ye Sanshao gave a sardonic smile and threw a 'spare me' look at Xiao Naibao. "Seriously, you've already given Louis the finger; how much more civilized can you get? Since it's just us, let's not pretend." Xiao Naibao touched his nose, his smile gone. "Still, Daddy, image is important." Cheng An Ya watched the father and son, chuckling at their endearing display. "Let's do it this way then: we'll drive around without getting out. Anything we want to buy, we can send our diplomat here to fetch it," Cheng An Ya suggested with a smile. "Babe, considering your old man might start his tough times tomorrow, you're going to have to put in some extra effort." "Yes, sir!" Xiao Naibao saluted. Ye Wei and Mo Jue had been so absorbed in each other that they'd vanished the entire afternoon. It was dinner time when Su Meiren left the lab, and the couple returned conspicuously. Mo Jue affectionately called Ye Wei 'wife' so often that it made everyone's meal seem more delicious. Seats were reserved for them, and they sat without hesitation upon arrival. The maid served them food and drinks. Big White had been unhappy earlier, but now he returned with a beaming smile, his cheeks tinged with a rosy hue, looking exceptionally adorable. Shi Yi whispered to Ye Wei, inquiring if she had managed to get a handle on him and if she had discovered anything. In terms of unspoken understanding, Ye Wei and Shi Yi were unmatched. In a short span of time, without any eye contact, they could grasp what each other had been up to. Ye Wei shook her headâ€”everything was normal. Due to her unique status, Ye Wei, regardless of her feelings for Mo Jueâ€”whether love or otherwiseâ€”always kept her guard up. She couldn't let anything interfere with the bigger picture, so their caution was only natural. However, it was unclear whether it was all an act or if genuine feelings were involved. How much was real and how much was fabricated was something perhaps not even Ye Wei could discern, let alone others. Her thoughts had always been enigmatic, and others perceived her as the same carefree and captivating figure as in the past. This confidence from Ye Sanshao and Bai Ye had led them to entrust Mo Jue to her care. "Su Meiren, how are my brother and sister-in-law?" Ye Wei and Mo Jue were seated opposite Su Meiren. One glance was enough to behold a sight pleasing to the eyes, and Ye Wei's mood soared. "They're doing well," Su Meiren replied succinctly. Xiao Naibao interjected, "Aunt Ye Wei, you've been so wrapped up in your own world, you still remember my dad and mom, huh?" "Child, eat more and talk less." "Mo Jue, did Aunt Ye Wei bully you?" Mo Jue, the picture of innocence, shook his head in defense of his wife. "No, Aunt Ye Wei treats me very well." The room fell silent as everyone silently mourned for Brother Big White. Any clear-eyed person could see that things were far from fine. Su Meiren fiddled with her food, her brows occasionally lifting as her gaze fell on Mo Jue. Sitting opposite her, it was only natural for their eyes to meet, but what was strange was how often Su Meiren looked over. Everyone present was sharp, and aside from Mo Jue, who seemed unaffected, they all sensed something. Su Meiren's sexual orientation was known to Ye Wei and Shi Yi, as it had been mentioned on the plane. Shi Yi, typically characterized by her icy demeanor, and Miss Cheng, who usually maintained composure, both struggled to keep a straight face, as the implications were too suggestive. With his looks, Mo Jue could captivate both men and women, especially now with his innocent gaze, face flushed with amorousness, purple eyes shimmering, and tender lips. He looked like the perfect pet for pampering. As Ye Wei relentlessly teased him, a complex love triangle formed in their minds: Mo Jue had fallen for Ye Wei, Ye Wei for Su Meiren, and Su Meiren for Mo Jue. Ye Wei had pursued Su Meiren for over a year, coming specifically for her. Unexpectedly, bringing Mo Jue along had somehow added a rival in loveâ€”a rival who called her 'wife'. They couldn't help but ponder how heartbroken Ye Wei must feel. Xiao Naibao sipped his iced coconut drink, his black eyes darting between Ye Wei, Mo Jue, and Su Meiren, his expression as cunning as could be. Ye Wei slowly put down her cutlery, her smile brimming with allure as she cut to the chase, "Su Meiren, have you taken a liking to my Mo Jue?" Su Meiren remained composed, not even raising an eyebrow. "Absurd." Mo Jue looked at Ye Wei with innocent concern, worried she might get angry. He hastily waved his hands, "Aunt Ye Wei, don't be upset. Rest assured, I like you the most and won't be interested in anyone else." Silence... Shi Yi discreetly turned her face away, her shoulders shaking as she suppressed laughter. Miss Cheng had to grip the tablecloth tightly, nearly collapsing with laughter onto the table. Ye Sanshao's eyes twitched, fighting the urge to laugh, feeling it quite inappropriate since Su Meiren was their host and they were guests. Xiao Naibao choked on his drink, turning away to spray it out while coughing uncontrollably. "Haha... In a room filled with an eerie silence, only Bai Ye laughed uproariously. Known for his casual and indifferent nature, such a loss of composure was rare. Su Meiren's eyebrows twitched coldly, and with a motion slow as a breeze, her piercing gaze swept over Bai Ye. She took a sip of tea with an air of nonchalance. Mo Jue still seemed unaware of the consequences he had caused, looking around with bewilderment, "What's wrong with everyone?" Ye Wei patted Mo Jue's head reassuringly. She had been bullied by Su Meiren many times without ever winning a single battle. She hadn't expected Mo Jue to give Su Meiren a red face so directly upon his first encounter. Good. Very good. The child had great potential. Watching Su Meiren turn red was a satisfying sight, although she maintained her calm and collected demeanor. "It's okay, Mo Jue. You did well and deserve commendation." Ye Wei praised him generously, and Mo Jue beamed with delight at his wife's commendation. "Ye Wei, you've trained an exceptional pet," Bai Ye said, finally catching his breath. Ye Wei smiled devilishly. "Su Meiren, don't be shy. If you consider giving me a kiss, I might consider lending you Mo Jue for a cuddle." Everyone, "......" Xiao Naibao was relieved he hadn't been drinking anything. Aunt Ye Wei, you're still the strongest. Ye Sanshao couldn't help but muse that with a sister like this, his life was indeed complete. Miss Cheng, however, felt that the Ye family was truly full of eccentrics, something she had long realized. Su Meiren's gaze remained frosty; her lips curving into a smile that could hardly be called a smile, as if brushed by autumn frost. The man's tone was even, without a ripple, "Personality-wise, he exhibits what's known as a fragmented personality. Age-wise, he is a dual-year layer. Regarding the soul, he cannot be considered a complete individual." ......  The room fell silent once more. Ye Wei's smile faded as she glanced at Mo Jue. "Have you encountered such a case before?" "A few years ago," Su Meiren replied. "Why does this happen?" "How should I know?" Su Meiren responded indifferently. Ye Wei looked aggrieved. "Su Meiren, that's not very nice of you." "I've always been this way." Su Meiren retorted. Ye Wei fell silent, even if it was the truth, Su Meiren, you didn't have to be so brazen about it, o(â•¯â–¡â•°)o. Xiao Naibao was curious. "Su Meiren, Mo Jue wasn't like this before. I've seen him once before, and he was completely different. He's been like this for many days now. When will he recover?" Mo Jue was still clueless, not understanding what they were discussing. Su Meiren raised her eyebrows and glanced at Mo Jue. "I don't know." "Didn't you say you've seen cases like this before?" Ye Sanshao also inquired, equally curious. Su Meiren stated, "This isn't a disease, it varies from person to person, so naturally, I'm not clear on the specifics." Shi Yi was more concerned about another issue. "Can he be cured?" "I don't know." "Why do you know nothing?" Bai Ye remarked. Ye Wei nodded in agreement. A quack indeed. Su Meiren's icy gaze swept over Bai Ye. "If I were to ask you, you'd probably be even more ignorant." Everyone fell silentâ€”Su Meiren, you're quite sharp-tongued. Bai Ye laughed casually, not taking offense. "It's not a medical condition, so not knowing is normal. We have different areas of expertise; it's futile to compare." Su Meiren sipped her tea, her demeanor unchanged. "Making excuses." Bai Ye smiled serenely, taking a sip of wine, and everyone was silent once again. The atmosphere was truly peculiar. Ye Wei looked at Mo Jue, not saying a word. A fragmented personality? She had never heard of such a thing. Not a complete individual? That was even more nonsensicalâ€”he was clearly a living person. Chapter 374: The Return of the Enigmatic Beauty, Mo Jue After their evening meal, Ye Sanshao, accompanied by Cheng An Ya and Xiao Naibao, ventured out into the cool night for a leisurely drive. Despite Su Man's offer to guide them, Ye Sanshao declined, preferring to rely on his all-competent son. Unfamiliar as he was with Riyadh, he cherished these intimate moments reserved for their family of three. The transformation of Riyadh from a desert city to a resplendent metropolis was striking. Towering skyscrapers pierced the skyline, and the city's thoroughfares, awash with light, cast a radiant glow reminiscent of a vast sea of lamps. As they cruised at a leisurely pace, Cheng An Ya couldn't help but notice the abundant fountains. It seemed each street boasted a couple, each uniquely designed, adding a refreshing touch to the summer's heat. Ye Sanshao, with a knowing smile, illuminated the city's efforts in greening, 'A large part of the Sahara Desert falls within Saudi territory. Maintaining the greenery in Riyadh demands significant human and financial resources. These fountains aren't just for show; they play a crucial role in regulating the city's temperature.' Cheng An Ya nodded in understanding, her respect deepening. She had felt the stark contrast between the icy jade coolness within Su Man's abode and the fierce heat that awaited outside. Ye Wei had casually mentioned that forty degrees was the norm here, and temperatures could soar as high as forty-five degrees. It now made perfect sense why the streets lay deserted during the day; only those seeking punishment would venture out in such sweltering conditions. The trio occasionally paused to capture these moments, their laughter a joyous refrain against the backdrop of the simmering heat, blissfully unaware of the brewing storm back at Su Man's estate. Following dinner, Su Man secluded himself in his laboratory to finalize the antidote data for su-1934 and continue his virus research. Alone in the expansive lab, he wasn't surprised when Ye Wei dropped by. 'Su Meiren, what do you say to spending a delightful evening together?' Ye Wei's voice was sultry, her body leaning into him with a flexibility and fragrance that hinted at sensuality. She draped her arm around his neck, planting a seductive kiss on his cheek. Unmoved by such forwardness, Su Man remained detached. His noble and stern presence was accentuated by his ink-black hair, tied back with a silver ribbon. He set aside a scroll, fixing Ye Wei with a gaze as frosty as his tone, 'If you aim to entice, at least make an effort to dress the part.' Ye Wei's laughter was rich and unrestrained, her eyes alight with playful mischief as she toyed with Su Man's chin, 'I have lain naked beneath your sheets, and yet you showed no more emotion than a statue.' 'Forewarned is forearmed,' Su Man shot back, brushing aside her hand with a gesture of disinterest. Resolute, Ye Wei reached for Su Man's chest but found only solid muscle. She pouted, feigning sorrow, 'When will I be greeted by softness instead of this unyielding strength? Su Meiren, you should have confessed your preference for men. I've wasted a year chasing a mirage.' 'You never thought to inquire,' Su Man replied, his brows furrowing as he subtly urged her to stand, clearly uncomfortable with the proximity. Unyielding, Ye Wei's laughter was tinged with defiance, 'Had you revealed your inclination, I might have considered a transformation for your sake. By now, we could have been the epitome of a match made in heaven. How do you reconcile with severing such a perfect bond?' Unruffled by Ye Wei's capricious and illogical stance, Su Man retorted, 'Even if you were a man, my feelings would remain unchanged.' 'Beauty should not be constrained by gender,' Ye Wei countered, her voice layered with a slight grievance yet resilient in her pursuit. 'Enough. Speak plainly. I am otherwise engaged,' Su Man cut in, his voice icy and authoritative. His demeanor alone could intimidate the faint-hearted, but Ye Wei was not so easily cowed. 'You know the matter at hand. Spare me the charade,' Ye Wei pressed on. 'Then speak directly. No amount of circumlocution can mask your affections,' Su Man responded, his incisive words fully aware of the playful nature behind her year-long pursuit. He had, after all, accepted Ye Wei and Shi Yi as friends, which was why they had been allowed to stay for so long. Regardless of their formidable presence, he had the means to send them away should he choose. 'What harm is there in my affection for him?' Ye Wei boldly admitted, unabashed when her secret was unveiled. She motioned to Su Man's chest, 'What if he's entwined with the Mafia, potentially even the mastermind behind Louis? What if our relationship is nothing but a ruse?' Su Man arched an eyebrow, his white robe lending him an air of regal intelligence against the backdrop of night. 'Do you fear he's playing you?' he inquired. 'It's a logical deduction,' Ye Wei asserted, pulling up a chair to sit. 'I've spent my life orchestrating the fates of others, not to be outmaneuvered myself.' 'Ye Wei, you've sunk too deep,' Su Man stated, his voice carrying a hint of warmth in its icy delivery. 'You've truly fallen for him.' Ye Wei's smile receded, replaced by a veneer of cruelty and authority. 'Su Meiren, do you believe I should eliminate him? To cut off future threats at the root?' Su Man's smile was pristine, untouched by the grime of the world. 'I'm certain you lack the resolve to follow through.' 'Is there anyone I cannot bring myself to kill?' Ye Wei challenged him, her laughter embodying a natural grace and undisputed dominance. 'I'm certain,' Su Man reiterated, his arms crossed. 'Ye Wei, you seize what you desire and obliterate what you reject. But remember, the stiffest tree is most easily cracked by the wind.' 'You're no saint yourself,' Ye Wei retorted with a dismissive wave. 'Aren't we all the same in the end? You, me, Shi Yi, Bai Yeâ€”we all share this ruthless path. Even the past Mo Jue was no different.' Su Man simply observed her, his dark eyes brimming with an unsettling clarity. Ye Wei shifted uneasily, 'You truly have no inkling of when he might awaken?' 'I do not. His kind are as rare as phoenix feathers or unicorn horns. There are no precedents to draw upon, and even if there were, Mo Jue's circumstances defy comparison,' Su Man spoke candidly. 'Is there any way to preserve him as Big White indefinitely?' Ye Wei inquired. 'What exactly are you suggesting?' Su Man probed. 'I want him to remain this way forever.' 'Ye Wei, that's a fantasy,' Su Man declared gravely, his voice a sharp chill. 'You're grasping at straws. This transient identity is fleeting; his true nature will inevitably resurface. Do not confuse illusion with reality.' 'I'm not concerned with the particulars. Is it feasible or not?' Ye Wei pressed. She held no preference for the current Mo Jue over his past self; she was well aware that the true Mo Jue was the man he had once been. Her fear was that if he reverted to his prior temperament, their camaraderie would dissolve. It seemed preferable to maintain the current faÃ§ade. 'Would you really settle for a mere husk of the man?' Su Man questioned, taken aback. This was uncharacteristic of Ye Wei, who lived freely and never went to such lengths for anyone. 'He isn't completely hollow; his present demeanor has its own appeal,' Ye Wei argued, her tone shifting to one of frost. 'Can it be done, or can it not?' 'Impossible,' Su Man stated unequivocally. 'If the constructed personality overshadows the original for an extended period, it will consume him entirely, culminating in his death.' Ye Wei's expression darkened. Could he truly perish? She hesitated, a weight seeming to press upon her chest, an ominous premonition clouding her thoughts. 'Su Man, I have a grave foreboding. It's a choice between his life and mine. How should I proceed?' 'Do you wish death upon him or yourself?' 'Nonsense, I'm in the prime of youth; I have no desire to die.' 'Is the solution not evident then?' Su Man challenged, leaving Ye Wei at a loss for words. 'Understood,' Ye Wei conceded with a smile that thinly veiled a trace of lethal intent. 'I comprehend now.' With that, she turned on her heel and left the lab. As she departed, Bai Ye made his entrance. Su Man's gaze turned icy, his voice cutting like the sharpest blade. 'What purpose brings you to my sanctum?' 'Rome has dispatched the latest viral analysis data,' Bai Ye responded evenly, his gaze following the path Ye Wei had taken. 'Are you certain you're not erring on the side of disrupting fate?' 'Fate at times warrants defiance,' Su Man retorted. Bai Ye found himself at a loss for words. Ye Wei sat alone in the central courtyard, engulfed in silence, her heart heavy with regret for her encounter with Su Man. She had never before been plagued with such indecision. As the moon shone bright above, it only served to amplify her inner turmoil. Mo Jue, Mo Jue... What to do about him? Ye Wei's thoughts were in turmoil. If Mo Jue reverted to his former self, they would stand as adversaries. The memory of their past fierce clashes filled her with a mix of thrill and helplessness. If he remained as Big White, it would be an unfair existence, a life built on an illusion. Ye Wei wanted neither. Nor could she bear the thought that Big White's gentle nature might be nothing but a ruse. She knew herself too well; she would not hesitate to strike down an enemy, even if that enemy was Mo Jue. To kill him? To be unable to follow through? Su Man's eyes held a penetrating clarity. If it came to blows between her and Mo Jue, she would fight with all her might. But to actually take his life? She was likely incapable, as evidenced by the incident on the beach. If she were to act, now was the time. His recent behavior was concerning. Should he revert to the old Mo Jue, she might never find the strength to end him. To kill or not to kill? Ye Wei rubbed her forehead, grappling with the vexing question. 'Why sit here brooding amidst the sweltering heat?' Shi Yi clapped Ye Wei's shoulder, settling beside her. 'Debating Mo Jue's demise?' 'You know me too well,' Ye Wei replied with a smile. 'I am indeed conflicted over whether to kill him.' Allowing the tiger to escape once nearly cost her brother's entire family. The virus within Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya remained a puzzle, and though Xiao Naibao was unharmed, Nuo Nuo's death had left an irreparable void. Had she taken Shi Yi's advice on the beach and eradicated the Mo brothers, none of this would have unfolded. Louis would have found it nearly impossible to seize them. Now, with a growing sense of foreboding, all signs pointed to the Mo brothers. With Mo Jue right beside her, an opportunity beckoned. If it slipped by, she might never have another chance to vanquish Mo Jue. They were the architects of their own fate; it was theirs to conclude. 'Shi Yi, if it were Mo Lao Da in this state, would you end him?' Ye Wei suddenly inquired. Shi Yi's response was chilling, 'My words hold no weight. Decide for yourself, lest I influence you wrongly.' 'That's as good as a yes,' Ye Wei surmised, her smile betraying her understanding. 'Such a quandary. How could I possibly bring myself to harm such an innocent Mo Jue?' '......' Ye Wei, you are hopelessly entangled. 'Where could Mo Lao Da have vanished to these past days?' Ye Wei pondered aloud, the anomaly of the situation causing her concern. 'On the beach, he nearly relinquished his gun, his life, for Mo Jue. Now that Mo Jue is in our custody, Mo Lao Da has disappeared. Isn't that peculiar? His affection for Mo Jue runs deep; it's inconceivable for him to abandon him thus.' 'I, too, find it peculiar,' Shi Yi concurred, his eyes narrowing. 'It's not just you; I also harbor an ominous premonition.' Their assassin instincts were razor-sharp. Exchanging glances but no words, they remained seated for a time before Ye Wei retreated to her room. Within, Mo Jue was consumed by a computer game. Ye Wei's brows knitted; it had been days since she'd last observed Mo Jue so engaged with a computer. His face lit up upon seeing her, 'Wife, you've returned. Give me a kiss.' Ye Wei acquiesced, kissing his lips, 'What is it that you're playing?' 'Games,' Mo Jue declared, eager to show off his triumph. 'I've conquered the monster.' 'Impressive,' Ye Wei acknowledged, her smile genuine. The gaming screen allayed her apprehensions. This simpleton... She regarded Mo Jue, his exceptional features, his smile pure. Who could bear to harm someone so guileless? 'Wife, why do you gaze at me so?' Mo Jue inquired, pausing his game, his eyes reflecting confusion, 'What troubles you, wife?' 'Nothing,' Ye Wei replied offhandedly, collapsing onto the bed. This fool, his gaze was too innocent. 'Wife, you appear saddened,' Mo Jue pressed, his tone laced with severity, 'Who has wronged you? Inform Big White, and I shall rend them limb from limb.' In an instant, an angelic facade gave way to a demonic resolve. 'The only sorrow is for those I choose to afflict; none dare wrong me,' Ye Wei stated, dismissing the idea, 'Do I truly look despondent to you?' Ye Wei, does he understand the concept of sorrow? 'Your visage is that of sorrow,' Mo Jue insisted, 'Wife, do you indeed cherish Su Man so dearly?' 'Indeed, I do.' 'And what of me? Of Big White?' 'You are different.' Ye Wei responded with laughter, soothing his ruffled demeanor, 'No need for frowns. Why concern yourself with my feelings for Su Man?' 'I do not wish for you to cherish him.' 'I harbor affections for manyâ€”third brother, Shi Yi, third sister-in-law, Ning Ning... My heart is vast,' Ye Wei responded, amused by Mo Jue's pique. 'Wife, you omitted me.' Mo Jue's eyes brimmed with a palpable sense of injury, his grip on Ye Wei's sleeve reminiscent of a yearning pup. 'Enough. Allow me to freshen up, and we shall converse,' Ye Wei announced, springing from the bed and entering the en suite. Mo Jue, left behind, sulked, his fingers dancing across the keyboard, the screen transitioning to another three-dimensional image. To drink or not to drink? Why was his brother advocating for inebriation? Through typed words, Mo Ye conveyed: After you drink, your wife will adore you even more. Mo Jue considered the proposition. Could there be truth to this? Mo Lao Da: Trust in me, be good. Mo Jue's gaze drifted to the side where two glasses of red wine stood, recently delivered by a maid. His wife had always forbidden him from drinking, but curiosity prevailed... As Ye Wei emerged from the bathroom, she was struck by a discernible shift in the atmosphere. Despite the chamber's chill from the ice jade embellishments, a visceral cold enveloped her. Mo Jue sat at the edge of the bed, the wine glass slipping from his fingers... When had alcohol made its way into this room? Ye Wei's heart raced, yet Mo Jue looked up at her, his eyes now a frosty shade of purple, cold and menacing, his aura exuding an air of sinister mystery. Ye Wei paused for a mere three seconds before her lips curled into a familiar, alluring smile, 'Greetings, Mo Jue the beauty. Have you stirred from your slumber?' Chapter 375: The Onset of the Virus Mo Jue stood up slowly, his tall figure casting a shadow as if dipped in the darkness of the night, exuding a formidable pressure that made the already cool room feel like it was swept by a frigid blizzard, pregnant with lurking danger. It was an atmosphere strained and piercing, seemingly capable of slicing a person into shreds. Ye Wei's smile became more bewitching by the second, while her eyes held a fierce murderous intent. A cold ruthlessness and complex determination lay beneath her alluring exterior, making her resemble a poppy perched precariously at the cliff's edgeâ€”stunning, yet fraught with peril. In their standoff, neither spoke, each seeming to measure the strength of the other's aura. Their gazes, both beautiful and perilous, clashed in mid-air, sparking ferocious scorching sparks of intensity. This scenario was all too familiar. It reminded them of their encounter in the underground waterway, where both were unrelenting, unforgiving, each intent on putting the other in the ground. Mo Jue, do you, too, wish for my demise? They were akin to each other; if she harbored intentions to kill Mo Jue, she was well aware that the true Mo Jue would not spare her life either. The feeling was mutual. "Where is this place?" Mo Jue asked, each syllable ice-cold, his voice chilling. His last clear memory was on the island, being struck by Ye Wei with a rum bottle. Everything since then, the past seven days, were a void in his memory. He had no recollection of the events that transpired while he was his alter ego, Big White. But, with his keen observational abilities and astonishing deductive reasoning, he deduced that Ye Wei had managed to escape peril, and it was he who had assisted her. Otherwise, on that island, even if Shi Yi had been unharmed, the two of them wouldn't have been able to escape. He knew that once he consumed alcohol, he would become subservient to whoever he laid eyes on first, which is why Mo Ye never allowed him to drink. Since his birth, he had only been drunk foolishly once by accident, three times when Big Boss Mo deemed him adorable when inebriated, and once as a child after they had caused mischief, Big Boss Mo made him drink, then go and act coquettishly with their master. Other than these five times, this was the sixth. Mo Jue was acutely aware of Ye Wei's nature; she would surely exploit his vulnerability to the fullest, and his elder brother would certainly give Ye Wei and Shi Yi a pass, for the time being, to protect him. "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia," Ye Wei replied, her laugh as melodious as a silver bell. "Mo Jue, have you truly forgotten everything?" Her statement was conclusive; however well he hid it, his reaction spoke volumes. He had forgotten, indeed... Ye Wei was stricken with indignation. Although she often felt she had the upper hand over Mo Jue, in the past seven days, she had treated him with exceptional kindness, freely embracing and kissing him, stopping just short of consummating their relationship. She had seldom been so kind, so gentle, and now... He had forgotten? Ye Wei struggled to keep her composure, while Mo Jue, ever so detached, said curtly, "Not required!" "Not required?" Ye Wei's eyebrows arched; she could hardly believe her ears. The smile on her face turned chillier, her ire rising. Mo Jue regarded her coldly, "These memories, I don't need them." Ye Wei's eyes grew colder, the flicker of anger within them flaring into a blaze. Despite herself, she smiled, "Indeed, there's no need. For you, it was but a dream that left no trace upon waking. For me, it wasn't even worth a dream, so naturally, it's not worth remembering." Mo Jue's eyes darkened further, and the room's curtains fluttered. The vast room was suddenly filled with a ferocious, murderous intent. The tension was like a bowstring drawn tight, ready to snap. In a flash, Mo Jue moved, his silhouette as quick as a specter. In the blink of an eye, he was before Ye Wei, his fingers stretching out towards her throat at an astonishing speed. A gust swept through the room, and Ye Wei retreated rapidly, her right foot pressing against the wall to leverage a flip, landing behind Mo Jue. Her leg swept toward Mo Jue's spine. Without even turning his head, Mo Jue used the sound to locate her, catching her ankle, pulling and yanking her like an eagle tossing a chick, slamming Ye Wei against the wall with force. That's brutal indeed! Ye Wei turned mid-air, her back facing Mo Jue. He didn't grant her a moment's reprieve, his palm strike following immediately. Ye Wei braced herself against the wall with one palm, her feet kicking rapidly against the wall to ascend, narrowly avoiding Mo Jue's subsequent palm strike. She grasped the crystal chandelier's iron handle, spun with agility, and kicked at Mo Jue, compelling him to retreat. Seizing the opportunity to land, Ye Wei kicked up the wooden chair in the room and swept it toward Mo Jue, not giving him a moment to react. Mo Jue's fist met the chair head-on, the massive force of the impact clashing and utterly obliterating the chair. Splinters flew in all directions. His fist collided with the oncoming fist of Ye Wei, and that very moment, Ye Wei felt her wrist go numb, a sharp pain in her tiger's mouth. Her other hand opened, pressing up along Mo Jue's arm, trying to pin him down. However, Mo Jue easily turned around, securing her in a reverse embrace. "You cannot defeat me." Mo Jue's voice was deep, as he coldly stated an incontrovertible truth. His hot breath sprayed across Ye Wei's neck, the same scent she had grown deeply familiar with over these seven days. Ye Wei cracked a faint smile, "Then, let's see whose heart is the coldest." As she finished speaking, her elbow thrust backward, but Mo Jue restrained it. Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain on his other wrist. Ye Wei had twisted it, her body spinning as she fiercely kicked toward his head. Mo Jue was caught off guard and took the blow full-on, his body slamming against the wall. Ye Wei lightly touched down, the chair rising to meet her grip, and she swung it fiercely at Mo Jue. Mo Jue shielded his head with his arms, and the chair shattered against his arms, leaving behind only a single leg. As sturdy as iron. "Damn it, Su Meiren, with all your wealth, you still resort to counterfeit products?" The chair was too fragile, clearly a knockoff, as it had fallen apart so easily. Ye Wei threw the stick in her hand and swung her fists furiously at Mo Jue's handsome face. Before she could revel in the violence, Mo Jue caught her wrist and yanked her forward. Their positions were swiftly reversed, Ye Wei now pinned against the wall by Mo Jue's relentless assault, no mercy in his blows, his fists pummeling her chest and abdomen. "You think you're tough?" Mo Jue's voice was dark, his face indifferent as Ye Wei coughed up blood from his punches. He raised his fist again, landing it hard on her abdomen. Ye Wei vomited a mouthful of blood, her face instantly turning pale as paper, feeling as though her internal organs had shifted, a searing pain engulfing her. The agony was beyond bearable... Compared to their initial clash in the sewer, this time, Mo Jue's blows were harsher, swifter. His actions made it clear that he was the more ruthless one, so she should not dare to outdo him in cruelty. Ye Wei wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth, her smile alluring and stubborn, like a rose losing its luster but still fiercely blooming in beauty, determined to wither in a blaze of glory. "Why have you stopped hitting?" Ye Wei's smile was radiant as she raised her hand and lashed out fiercely at Mo Jue. He dodged with a turn of his head, and seizing the moment, Ye Wei's other hand, stained with blood, slapped Mo Jue's face hard. Mo Jue's eyes plunged into darkness, and with a chuckle, Ye Wei said, "That punch, that slap, let's settle all our accounts from these past seven days. We are even now." He hesitated, and Ye Wei smiled, her beauty devilish, and Mo Jue realized that in the midst of their fight, Ye Wei's palm had reached his chest, striking him with force. Mo Jue stumbled back several steps. Blood trickled from his lips. He lifted his gaze, his eyes sweeping coldly over her, as Ye Wei's palm wind struck him repeatedly in the chest, holding back no force, clearly intending to beat him to death. Utterly ruthless. She wore a smile, but it was one that smothered with its danger. "Ye Wei!" Mo Jue, normally a man of few words, was now filled with rage. His body surged up swiftly, a man and a woman, both formidable, entangled in a wild fight. It was an unsophisticated brawl, as if they had both forgotten their martial arts skills, fighting like street brawlers, all attack and no defense. A punch for a punch, a slap for a slap. Like wild beasts, they growled and wrestled, the furniture in the room scattered and shattered, leaving nothing intact, resembling the aftermath of an earthquake. They were both battered and bruised, here a contusion, there a purple mark, a gruesome sight, especially Ye Wei, who looked like a blood-stained, shattered doll. Yet she seemed to possess infinite strength, stubbornly standing off against Mo Jue, showing no sign of weakness. Such commotion had already alarmed Bai Ye, Su Man, and Shi Yi, along with Ye Sanshao, Cheng An Ya, and Xiao Naibao. When they arrived, Ye Wei was on top of Mo Jue, delivering punches relentlessly, a ferocity that sent chills down Bai Ye and Ye Sanshao's spines. Suddenly Mo Jue's leg lashed out at her abdomen with force. As Ye Wei fell backward, seemingly about to land on a pile of broken glass, Shi Yi was about to step forward to catch her, but Mo Jue was quicker. With a skillful tug at her hand, the two rose from the ground. As they steadied themselves, they both threw punches, their fists colliding with violent force, each retreating. Shi Yi steadied her waist, and Ye Wei finally stood upright, both panting, their appearances disheveled. Mo Jue's once heavenly face was now marred by conflict, and Ye Wei was no better off. The stark difference in Mo Jue's demeanor signified his return to his original self. The contrast was night and day. "You two certainly put on quite the show," Bai Ye commented dryly. It was the first time he had witnessed Ye Wei beaten to such a stateâ€”an extraordinary sight indeed. While he had come with the intent to watch, his fists were clenched, ready to join the fray at any moment. Ye Wei laughed, her voice rich and alluring, like a rose stained with blood, "Mo Jue, I can't outfight you alone, but what about a brawl?" Mo Jue gave a cold snort, "Feel free to try." "Big White, no... Mo Jue, you boast a bold tongue. If we set Wei Wei aside, Shi Yi and I alone would ensure you cannot leave this estate," Bai Ye coldly jeered, fully prepared to engage in battle. Shi Yi grunted, "He won't escape." After receiving such a brutal beating, Mo Jue wouldn't be allowed to leave unscathed. Cheng An Ya then suggested, "Ah Chen, why don't you fight him? If you lose, his demise is guaranteed either way." The virus, what a formidable weapon. Bai Ye gave a thumbs up, "Smart thinking." However, Ye Sanshao's gaze still lingered on Ye Wei. Suddenly, a tear gas canister shattered through the window and into the room, breaking the glass. White smoke billowed, and everyone quickly evacuated the room, closing the door behind them. When they re-entered, the room was empty. "Boss Mo has made his move," Xiao Naibao declared. Since Mo Jue had vanished, any pursuit would be futile. Shi Yi furrowed his brows, and at that moment, Ye Wei clutched her abdomen, spewing another mouthful of blood, and collapsed into Shi Yi's arms. "Wei Wei..." Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya rushed over anxiously, not daring to touch her, their concern evident. Ye Sanshao turned to Bai Ye, "Bai Ye..." "To my room," Shi Yi directed, and Bai Ye carried her there. Ye Sanshao wanted to follow, but Xiao Naibao had already entered Ye Wei's room. Concerned for their son's safety, Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya stayed behind. Xiao Naibao carefully avoided the debris and leaped onto the bed. "Ning Ning, what are you doing?" Ye Sanshao asked sternly, his curiosity piqued as he took a seat. All eyes turned to the computer screen. Mo Jue: Drink? Boss Mo: After drinking, your wife will love you even more. Mo Jue: Is that true? Boss Mo: Trust your brother. Ye Sanshao's eyebrow twitched, and Miss Cheng looked to the heavens in silent queryâ€”was this enticement? "Damn, Boss Mo is truly ingenious, summoning Mo Jue back just like that?" It was a blatant lure. The game between the wolf and the rabbit. Clearly, the rabbit had lost. "Only Boss Mo could pull that off," Xiao Naibao mused, his fingers flying across the keyboard until the screen appeared to nearly collapse, a torrent of English text scrolling rapidly before coming to a halt. "Daddy, do you remember the car we saw parked outside when we arrived?" Xiao Naibao suddenly asked. Ye Sanshao nodded. "Boss Mo was there," Xiao Naibao stated. Before Ye Sanshao could speak, a sharp pain erupted in his arm and liver, as if fine needles were stabbing his organ. His limbs began to ache terribly, followed by violent convulsions. He collapsed onto the bed, his body writhing in torment. "Ah Chen..." "Daddy..." "Quick, call Su Man!" Cheng An Ya cried out in urgency as Xiao Naibao jumped down and dashed away. "Ah Chen, hold on. You'll be okay," Cheng An Ya spoke, her voice filled with uncertainty, whether for him or for herself, her anxiety peaking. The fear of losing him was ever-present. Her hands trembled with dread, Cheng An Ya's face deathly pale. Hadn't Su Man said the virus would strike tomorrow? Why had it come early? "Ah..." Ye Sanshao let out a sudden, agonizing scream, veins bulging on his forehead, his delicate features contorting with an inhuman pain. Pushed beyond his limit... he fell into unconsciousness. Chapter 376: Untitled The virus inside Ye Sanshao manifested sooner than anyone anticipated, sending Cheng An Ya into a state of panic. Desperate to be by his side, yet advised by Su Man against visiting the lab, she reluctantly complied. Su Meiren's commanding presence made her words difficult to ignore, compelling Cheng An Ya to heed the advice despite her profound anxiety. 'Mommy, don't worry, Daddy will be fine.' Xiao Naibao reassured Cheng An Ya, his young face carrying a steadiness and determination that seemed beyond his years. His graceful smile held a poise that suggested the chaos around him hadn't touched him, his composure remarkable. 'Darling, Mommy isn't that fragile. I shouldn't need comfort at a time like this. Everything will be okay.' Miss Cheng knew her son well and smiled back, encouraging him not to fret, though her concern lingered. No matter her own fears, she made sure not to let Xiao Naibao see any panic. How would it look if Xiao Naibao, who shared her apprehension, had to be the one consoling her? She had always been Xiao Naibao's most formidable mommy, hadn't she? The mother-son duo then went to see Ye Wei, who was unconscious due to severe injuries. Bai Ye had already examined her, instructing that medicinal herbs be prepared and painkillers administered. Cheng An Ya felt a twinge of sympathy for Ye Wei's battered state. 'These injuries would be severe for an ordinary person, but Ye Wei will recover from this in a few days,' Bai Ye reassured. 'So these aren't considered severe?' Cheng An Ya asked incredulously. What would it take then? Being beaten to death? In Ye Wei's room, the bloodstains on her clothes were a testament to the brutality she had endured. Ye Wei's unconscious state was indicative of the extremity of her wounds. 'Itâ€™s nothing serious; sheâ€™ll recuperate in a few days,' Bai Ye commented lightly, while Shi Yi diligently attended to her wounds. 'What kind of deep-seated enmity makes them battle to near-death? It seems rather excessive, doesn't it?' Bai Ye pondered, stroking his chin. Could it be Mo Jueâ€™s rage from embarrassment? 'When have they not fought as if their lives were at stake?' Shi Yi remarked, her tone a mix of curiosity and concern over Mo Jue's sudden, inexplicable recovery. 'Bai Ye, when will she likely awaken?' 'She should come around by tomorrow morning,' Bai Ye anticipated, tapping Shi Yiâ€™s shoulder. 'Shi Yi, has Wei Wei truly fallen for him?' 'What do you think?' 'Is her heart captivated by the noble Big White, or the enchanting Mo Jue?' Bai Ye inquired further, genuinely curious. Xiao Naibao pondered for a moment, 'It must be the enchanting Mo Jue, right?' 'Why do you think that?' Both Shi Yi and Bai Ye asked in unison, Bai Ye inwardly marveling, 'Ning Ning, my dear, have you also come to understand what it is to fall in love? The world evolves so rapidly.' 'Just a feeling,' Xiao Naibao explained. Mo Jue's character might be more appealing to Ye Wei. And Big White? It was Mo Jue's transformation that made Ye Wei tolerate his foolishness afterward. With anyone else, she would've distanced herself long ago. In the end, it was all because of Mo Jue. 'Poor Wei Wei.' Bai Ye observed her wounds, feigned a sigh, and laughed freely, arms crossed in anticipation. 'I'm quite curious to see how Wei Wei will manage to win over the formidable enchantress Mo Jue.' Miss Cheng, who had remained silent, finally spoke up, 'I've never understoodâ€”what's the difference between Big White and Mo Jue? Aren't they the same person?' 'Mommy, there's a world of difference,' Xiao Naibao contended, with Bai Ye and Shi Yi concurring. They couldn't be viewed as one and the same. One akin to a demon, the other an angel. Different realms, different factions; they simply couldn't be equated. 'But consider Daddy. Sometimes, he's the epitome of seriousness, and at other times, he's utterly foolish. Isn't it true that everyone has many aspects to their personality? So why can't Mo Jue?' Cheng An Ya shared her perspective with a smile. 'It's all the same person after all, isn't it?' 'Different.' 'The same.' 'Mommy, it's three against one. The majority rules; you're outnumbered. There's no use resisting.' Xiao Naibao remarked playfully, the very image of a charming young English gentleman. '......' Cheng An Ya fell silent, her ideals of democracy in tatters. As if reading Cheng An Ya's mind, Xiao Naibao added with a chuckle, 'Mommy, when have you ever witnessed true democracy in action? And as for societal harmonyâ€”when has that ever been achieved?' Bai Ye and Shi Yi gave a thumbs-upâ€”impressive was all they could say. Cheng An Ya felt slighted, 'You, being a grown man, shouldn't be so harsh with a delicate woman.' Xiao Naibao, '......um......' They left Shi Yiâ€™s room amidst laughter, Bai Ye commenting, 'They truly are an extraordinary mother and son.' 'Their entire family is extraordinary.' Shi Yi concluded concisely, alluding to their unique peculiarities. 'Mr. Su, the master requests your presence in the lab.' A maid arrived quickly to summon Bai Ye, causing a brief pause among everyone. Bai Ye nodded and followed her to the lab. 'Ning Ning, what's wrong?' 'Su Man has called Bai Ye to the lab.' Xiao Naibao clarified, and Cheng An Yaâ€™s heart sank. Had Ye Sanshaoâ€™s condition worsened? Her heart pounded, and Cheng An Yaâ€™s complexion turned pale. She sat alone in the central courtyard, Xiao Naibao willing to stay, but as the night progressed, Cheng An Ya sent him to bed. Reluctantly, Xiao Naibao retired to his room. The night in Riyadh was stifling, the air motionless, the outdoor temperature unbearable, even in light attire. Cheng An Ya, however, was gripped by a cold that seeped into her bones, cold sweat beading on her brow, devoid of any sense of warmth. Cold. A chill from within, unsettling in its pervasiveness. It brought back the feeling of when Louis had revealed the virus's presence and they awaited Ye Sanshao's arrival. Profoundly afraid. The night deepened, the second half drawing near. She contemplated visiting the lab several times but hesitated, paralyzed by fear of what the virus's outbreak might entail. She knew all too well the torment it caused. When it struck her, the pain was excruciating, each moment an ordeal. Yet, her suffering was brief, as Louis would soon administer an agent to alleviate the pain. But she had witnessed Zhang Bo, in that small house, bashing his head, bloodied and battered, choosing death over enduring such pain. The more Cheng An Ya recalled Zhang Boâ€™s tragic fate, the colder she felt, her heart rate quickening, the ominous premonition returning. The night was silent, save for the sound of the courtyard fountain's spray. Once soothing, it now only added to her unease. She paced the courtyard, then sat, arms crossed in deep reflection, blending into the darkness, her presence as silent as non-existence. Then, she stood, a decision made, and strode toward the lab. The closer she approached, the more daunting it seemed. She dreaded hearing Ye Sanshao's agonized screams, but to her surprise, all was quiet. Cheng An Ya reassured herselfâ€”perhaps everything was fine. Bai Ye's medical expertise was renowned, and Su Man was a virology expert; this situation was different from Zhang Bo's. Perhaps there was hope; she should not let fear overwhelm her. Resolved, she pushed open the lab door and entered. Bai Ye, focused on the research monitor, was the first to notice Cheng An Ya. He arched an eyebrow, 'An Ya, why have you come?' Su Man, engrossed in testing two agents, didn't look up, his attention fixed on analyzing the compounds through the microscope. Cheng An Ya spoke softly, 'Please continue. I won't be a disruption. I just want to be with him.' Bai Ye glanced at Ye Sanshao on the operating table and nodded. The lab was small but equipped with state-of-the-art technology, making Cheng An Ya feel as though she had stepped into the setting of a sci-fi film. Ye Sanshao lay on the operating table, clad in an isolation gown, an oxygen mask secured to his face. Shackles restrained his limbs, and numerous needles protruded from his arms, chest, thighs, calves, and even his head. Various vials with mysterious fluids trickled into his bloodstream. Cheng An Ya gazed at his hand, her eyes catching the sight of blood on the floor. Following the crimson trail, she discovered a larger pool beneath her feet. Turning to his wrist, she saw it tightly clamped by handcuffs. Struggle had left clear wounds on his wrist, oozing blood. She bit her lip, holding back the tears that threatened to spill. She could imagine his struggle, the self-inflicted harm. There was no need to look further; his ankles were likely injured too. He must have tried to break free. Ah Chen... Through the isolation gown, she held his hand, Cheng An Ya looking at the unconscious Ye Sanshao, her heart aching in silence, tears threatening but never falling. She couldn't cry; he was bound to get better. As the saying goes, every wrongdoing meets its fate, and every act of kindness its reward. The one due for retribution was Louis, not Ye Chen, who had endured a lifetime of suffering. Ah Chen, don't be afraid, I am here with you, always. Even if it meant descending into hell, she would not let him face it alone. Cheng An Ya remembered a vow she had made: from that day on, she would be Ye Chen's guardian deity. But she had not lived up to her promise. Instead, her actions had nearly cost him his life. What sort of guardian was she? More like a harbinger of doom. Cheng An Ya felt a surge of regret, holding Ye Sanshao's hand tightly, biting back the tears, simply keeping him company in the quiet. Ye Sanshao slept deeply, his pale face serene. His breaths were faint, his heartbeat barely audible, his hand faintly warmâ€”Cheng An Ya found a sliver of comfort. He was alive, and for that, she was grateful. As long as he drew breath, she would be by his side, every second, for every day that lay ahead. Chapter 377 Untitled Cheng An Ya had steadfastly remained beside Ye Sanshao in the laboratory until the wee hours of the morning. After administering a sedative, Ye Sanshao succumbed to a profound slumber. The only audible sounds were the muted beeps of electronic instruments and the gentle clinking of test tubesâ€”the lab was steeped in a profound hush. Despite the dread filling her heart, Cheng An Ya had vowed not to disturb Bai Ye and Su Man, lest she impede their crucial endeavors. The duo worked in perfect syncâ€”one conducting hands-on experiments, the other immersed in data analysisâ€”sharing an unspoken rapport that negated the need for verbal communication. Cheng An Ya, seated silently beside Ye Sanshao, struggled against the tides of exhaustion; however, sleep continued to elude her. Her watchful eyes traced the contours of his face, occasionally darting towards Bai Ye and Su Man, seeking any hint of their progress from the subtle shifts in their expressions. Finally, Bai Ye could no longer overlook her plight. 'An Ya, it would be best if you rested. Sanshao won't awaken until we've concocted the antidote. Your vigil here serves no purpose.' 'I'm not weary,' Cheng An Ya asserted, her determination to remain by Ye Sanshao's side unwavering. Bai Ye afforded her a sympathetic smile. 'It isn't mere fatigue I'm concerned about; it's the risk of the virus within you becoming more unstable. It could manifest prematurely if you neglect your well-being.' Cheng An Ya's lips quivered, torn between her steadfast desire to stay and the logical truth in Bai Ye's admonition. She clenched Ye Sanshao's hand a little tighter, yet the strength to leave his side escaped her. She yearned to remain close to him, even at the expense of her own safety. 'You cannot possibly forgo sustenance and slumber indefinitely,' Bai Ye reasoned, recognizing the stubborn streak she shared with Ye Wei. Her face, a mask of resolve, rendered further persuasion pointless. 'Just a moment longer,' she whispered, each minute invaluable, acutely aware that there was nothing for her beyond these walls. Bai Ye exhaled a resigned sigh, yielding to her wish. He knew that eventually, fatigue would claim her. The enigma of love baffled himâ€”why did the wise willingly partake in folly, choosing paths that offered neither solace nor solutions? With the exchange of the latest batch of data with Su Man came a frosty glance. The ambient temperature of the lab seemed to drop as Su Man spoke, 'A woman's presence here only serves as a distraction; it diminishes our efficacy.' Bai Ye remained silent. The icy tone of Su Man's declaration hinted at an underlying truth, though it made Bai Ye question if there might be more to his aversion towards Ye Wei. Cheng An Ya rose to her feet, a mixture of sorrow and indignation etched onto her face. 'Su Man, there's no need for such flagrant sexism.' Unmoved, Su Man regarded her with an air of unyielding arrogance, devoid of any semblance of empathy or chivalry. As if a ghost, Miss Cheng wafted out of the labâ€”her presence evidently a hindrance. If Su Man considered her presence detrimental to their work, then she had no choice but to depart. The imperative of their research outweighed her personal desires, and she could no longer justify remaining. Bai Ye nodded in Su Man's direction with a mixture of admiration and resignation. 'Impressive.' Su Man's eyes narrowed, and with a contemptuous snort, he turned back to his work. The pressing nature of their mission left no room for idle conversation, and Bai Ye, too, returned his focus to the task at hand. This was a medical puzzle the likes of which Bai Ye had never encountered, demanding his full attention to match Su Man's pace. As a genius doctor, he could not allow himself to be outshone. His reputation as a genius in the medical field was not without merit. 'May you one day fall into the hands of a woman,' Cheng An Ya muttered under her breath, her vexation tinged with a wry humor. Would a BL enthusiast genuinely scorn women? It was a concept she had never considered. If all BL enthusiasts were sexist, the fujoshi and BL wolves would surely be distressed. The internet was nearly overrun with fujoshi. Having navigated its realms for years, Cheng An Ya knew many a BL wolf and fujoshi, all fervent in their passion for BLâ€”intimidating and formidable. And she herself was a proud BL wolf. The sting of being spurned was not a pleasant sensation. A curious thought crossed her mindâ€”what transpires when two men are left alone, particularly when one is openly gay? Bai Ye, with his impeccable character and magnetic allure, was undeniably captivatingâ€”poised and graceful like jade. The idea was... An image of their intimate affection flashed through her mind, throwing her into disarray. Ah, she must be losing her sanity to entertain such a fantasy. Su Man was the very embodiment of cold ruthlessness, his gaze exuding absolute dominance. His aura, noble and untouchable, seemed to consider any attention a desecration. How could he possibly harbor romantic feelings for Bai Ye? It was his overt sexism that had sparked her wild musings, sending her thoughts adrift. O(â•¯â–¡â•°)o. Time surged forward, and in the blink of an eye, seven days had elapsed. Ye Wei's injuries had healed without leaving a trace, her complexion clear of any blemishes, her recovery nothing short of miraculous. Xiao Naibao jokingly referred to his aunt as an invincible cockroach, marveling at the speed of her recuperation. One might have anticipated a shadow of despondency to linger, yet since regaining consciousness, Ye Wei had been the picture of radiance, her demeanor indistinguishable from before as if Mo Jue had never existed in her life. She refrained from mentioning Mo Jue or Big White, as if he had been permanently expunged from her memory, unworthy of even a cursory thought. With pressing matters concerning The premier terrorist organization and neither Ye Wei nor Shi Yi in command positions, they opted to stay put in Riyadh. The world outside seemed deceptively calm, except for the upheaval in Melilia. Driven by rage for a beloved, Chu Li orchestrated a siege with the elite air forces of The premier terrorist organization, unleashing a relentless aerial assault on Prince William of Country R in the desert. Considering Li Yan's presence in the castle, Chu Li refrained from a full-scale bombardment, choosing instead to rely on sophisticated military firepower to besiege and strike. In a more sinister move, he contaminated the castle's nearby water source, severing their lifeline. The daily aerial circling above the castle was Chu Li's way of stating, 'I have all the time in the world; let's see who can endure.' Such brutish and domineering tactics were characteristic of a terrorist. With Chu Li's shrewdness, cutting off the water supply was merciful compared to what he could have done. If not for considerations for Li Yan, the conflict would have been far more harrowing and savage. As for Dragon Gate, Lin Yixuan's legal battle concluded victoriously, and he was released. Authorities from City A officially cleared the misunderstanding. Tang Si's condition was also on the mend, securing stability for Dragon Gate's dealings. On behalf of Ye Sanshao, Xiao Naibao juggled Dragon Gate's operations in North America while remaining on standby to aid Chu Li and the terrorists. Simultaneously, he contended with the joint military suppression from the Spanish, Italian, and other governments. Xiao Naibao advocated for a strategic withdrawal from the Middle East to seek a temporary reprieve from the international spotlight. Chu Li's provocation towards Country R had incited neighboring nations to lend their support, through troops or condemnation, whether they desired to or not. Additionally, the recent clashes with the Mafia had sounded alarms, with countries approaching with resolute determination to exploit this chance to diminish The premier terrorist organization's might. Chu Li, unfazed, continued his desert vigils, mocking Prince William and brazenly ignoring the government troops' encirclement. He arrogantly proclaimed this was a personal grudge between him and Prince William, warning that any interlopers would rue their interference. Given Chu Li's notorious track record, most smaller countries dared only to protest vocally, lacking the audacity to act. Amidst the clash between The premier terrorist organization and several governments, the opportune moment for the Mafia to act had arrived. Xiao Naibao had expected Louis to rally the Mafia to suppress The premier terrorist organization, seizing the chance to unify the underworld's might. Unexpectedly, the Mafia seemed to have receded into the shadows. Aside from a few minor military operations in the Middle East in collaboration with government forces, the Mafia's trail had gone cold. Xiao Naibao was befuddled, and upon investigation, found that Louis had been convincing the authorities to capitalize on the conflict, thus maintaining a safe distance from the fray while observing the power play unfold. Shi Yi, with a somber countenance, remarked, 'This is uncharacteristically passive for Louis.' Ye Wei concurred; their dealings with the Mafia, albeit limited, suggested that Louis's usual demeanor would not allow for such restraint. 'Could this be the doing of the Mo Brothers?' Cheng An Ya posed the question abruptly, having stayed informed of the ongoing events and developed her own insights. 'What might they be plotting?' Ye Wei sharply identified the crux of the matter, leaving Xiao Naibao momentarily perplexed. 'Their alliance with the government forces is tenuous at best,' Ye Wei said, her smile laced with allure. 'The chief mentioned last night that the Counter-Terrorism Organization has begun to intervene. The government troops will soon be scattered. They didn't anticipate this, war and chaosâ€”that's the bane of counter-terror.' Chapter 378: A Scandal Brewing! Xiao Naibao paused, recalling the chiefâ€™s tirade in their group chat from the previous evening. With marked reluctance, he had instructed those in danger zones to hasten their withdrawal to avoid incoming fire. The sensation was indescribableâ€”a peculiar cocktail of trepidation and glee. This operation was slated to be the premier terrorist organization's most significant and far-reaching military action to date. The Counter-Terrorism Organization, eager for engagement since their almost-intervention on Fatal Island, now faced a threat extending to Country R. With Country R's robust ties with South American and European nations, intervention seemed inevitable. The probable conclusion seemed to be the dissolution of the united government forces. If they intervened, mutual destruction was likely. The optimal strategy to save Country R and maintain peace was to dissolve the government forces, recasting the conflict as a petty squabble over a woman between Chu Li and Prince William. Only by letting it peter out could peace potentially be preserved. "It looks like it'll take half a month," Xiao Naibao mused, stroking his chin with a cunning smile, keen to observe the impending struggle. Despite the chiefâ€™s notorious temper, he was astute. Trickery was no easy feat with him. Shi Yi concurred, "If you want the chief to make a move, you'd better have something worth his while. Consider who he's after or what case he's itching to crack. Otherwise, he wonâ€™t budge." "The chief is all about grand gestures. A word to Ning Ning, and heâ€™d have whatever information he needed," added Ye Wei with a laugh. Cheng An Ya joined in with a chuckle, "Wei Wei, let Chu Li claim his prize and return. If you stall and the Mafia ambushes, you'll be blindsided. Ning Ning, haven't you picked up any Mafia intel yet?" Xiao Naibao touched his nose, his smile wry, "I'd give it a few more days." Ye Wei nodded thoughtfully. Xiao Naibao's lips curled into a sly smirk, his eyes shining with mischief, "Auntie, youâ€™re anxious for news about your Brother-in-Law Big White, aren't you?" "I'm eager to act on his news," Ye Wei replied with seductive charm, toying with her luminescent cup as though Mo Jue and Big White were of no consequence to her. Cheng An Ya softly chuckled, "Wei Wei, don't play the tough girl. You can't outmatch him." A bitter pill. Having recently been on the receiving end of a thrashing, she likely desired to rip Mo Jue to shreds. But confronted with his superior strength, she had to admit, Mo Jue was a force to be reckoned with. Ye Wei arched an eyebrow, her smile blooming like a rose. She casually draped an arm around Shi Yiâ€™s shoulder, "I've got an ace partner here. If one can't best him, two will seal his fate. If a duel falls through, weâ€™ll turn to a brawl, right, Shi Yi?" Shi Yi, ever the embodiment of chill, simply nodded, "Mhm, affirmative, Iâ€™ll sync up with you next time." Cheng An Yaâ€™s smile blossomed, pure and radiant. Her eyes twinkled playfully as she innocently inquired, "Wei Wei, don't you always carry a gun? Why bother with a brawl?" Xiao Naibao stifled a chuckle. Mommy, on point. His mommy always hit the nail on the head with a smile that could disarm anyone. Shi Yi couldnâ€™t help but throw a sidelong glance at Ye Wei. An Ya was spot-on. Renowned for her sharpshooting prowess, Ye Wei could fire with either hand with uncanny agility. Even mid-fight, she could effortlessly draw her weapon. That day, Mo Jue was unarmed and unguarded; he was an easy mark for Ye Wei. Yet, she hadnâ€™t drawn her gun. That day, she had seen Ye Weiâ€™s hand poised over the gun handle, but it never emerged. That rapid motion, though swift as lightning, was transparent to her, thanks to years of unspoken understanding. Having been battered yet not drawing a gun to killâ€”what did that imply? The Ye Wei they knew would sooner dismember an opponent than suffer a blow. Yet, she had been beaten to a pulp by Mo Jue. Ye Wei remained unfazed, her allure intensifying, "Sister-in-law, youâ€™re missing the point. I enjoy a good stretchâ€”close-quarters combat reveals an adversaryâ€™s weak spots fastest. Itâ€™s all about tactics." Xiao Naibao held his tongue. Auntie, youâ€™ve got guts, to endure such a beating and still talk tactics. Cheng An Ya nodded as if enlightened, "Exactly. When you went after Ah Chen, you shouldâ€™ve engaged him up close instead of shooting from a distance. Right?" "Sister-in-law, youâ€™re vicious. If Brother Three and I sparred, you wouldn't recognize his face afterward," Ye Wei retorted, her innocence feigned. Cheng An Ya laughed along, not pressing the matter further. Ye Wei lowered her gaze, gently swirling her luminescent cup. The wine rippled, and from the side, it seemed as if a brilliant light had pierced the liquid. Indeed, the pleasure of grape wine in a luminescent cup was one of life's great delights. So, Mo Jue and Big White could go jump in a lake. In the clear wine, a pair of serene eyes reflected. "Has Brother Three shown any sign of waking?" Ye Wei suddenly asked. She hadn't ventured into the lab in days, instead, spending her time recuperating and scarcely leaving her room. Cheng An Ya had also kept her distance. Ever since Su Meiren mentioned that women were a distraction, whether true or fictitious, she genuinely waited for news without disturbing the lab. But she knewâ€”Ye Sanshao had not yet stirred. The virus was formidable. "Not yet," Cheng An Ya replied, her voice tinged with exhaustion. "Su Meiren said that until the antidote is ready, he has to continue like this, dependent on nutrition solutions, sedatives, and other reagents beyond my ken." "Brother Threeâ€™s life is a series of trials." Ye Wei felt a twinge of heartache. If asked about her most cherished person in the world, it wouldn't be Big White or Mo Jue, but Ye Sanshao. Cheng An Ya shared this sentiment. Everyone was aware that Ye Sanshaoâ€™s vitality was waning, day by day. The seven-day deadline had long passed, and he was clinging to life solely by virtue of these medications. Though she felt for him, she was powerless. Why was she unscathed, while Ye Sanshao was teetering on the brink of life and death? "Mommy, Auntie, Iâ€™m confident Daddy will pull through." Xiao Naibao smiled gracefully, "With Mommy and me still here, Daddy won't want to leave. Otherwise, if Mommy remarries with me in tow, heâ€™d spring out of his coffin, ghost or not." Ye Wei and Cheng An Ya couldnâ€™t help but chuckle. Even Shi Yiâ€™s lips curled into a faint smile, in keeping with Ye Sanshaoâ€™s character. Initially, Cheng An Ya thought Shi Yi and Ye Wei might have tasks to attend to, suggesting they might leave Riyadh. But Ye Wei was adamant about staying. Despite the turmoil beyond, Riyadh remained a sanctuary of calm. Few were needed to stand guard, so they assumed the responsibility of safeguarding the Ye family. They had failed in their duty before, precipitating a chain of events. This time, neither Ye Wei nor Shi Yi would consider leaving, determined that history would not repeat on their watch. Shi Yi suddenly inquired, "An Ya, you mentioned Louis could touch you. Could his blood work as an antidote?" "Bai Ye pondered the same. If we could analyze his blood, it might accelerate our progress. But Louis has likely thought of that too. Heâ€™s vanished without a trace," Cheng An Ya stated, a shiver running down her spine at the mention of Louis. "Where could he have gone? It feels like the stillness before a tempest; surely something is about to unfold." "Mommy, don't worry. The past won't repeat itself, you can rest easy." Su Meirenâ€™s mansion was few in number but impregnable. Even Mo Ye could only peer in from the outskirts, unable to breach, let alone others. The mansion stood as a strongholdâ€”exit allowed, entry barred, utterly secure. "Itâ€™s hard to pin down my unease." "Sister-in-law, Iâ€™m curious about something. Why hasnâ€™t the virus inside you activated yet?" Ye Wei posed the question, her eyes narrowing slightly. "Checking the calendar, there are only a few days left in the month-long deadline. Even if not fatal, the virus should have acted by now." "Iâ€™m at a loss." Cheng An Ya herself was perplexed. These days she felt fine, everything as usual. Su Meiren and Bai Ye were engrossed in saving Ye Sanshao, leaving her to her own devices for the time being. Once activated, sheâ€™d end up like Ye Sanshao, lying on an operating table, awaiting either death or awakening. "Iâ€™m just as bewildered." Xiao Naibao smiled, then playfully raised his finger, "Of course, Mommy, I donâ€™t wish for an outbreak." "Sister-in-law, you must be a variant." Laughter filled the room. As they were joking, footsteps approached. Bai Ye and Su Meiren appeared; they had spent the past two days in the lab. Fatigue was etched on their faces. Upon their arrival, Cheng An Ya and the others immediately flocked to them. Su Meiren looked especially drained. Despite her weariness, her cheeks were flushed. Flames seemed to dance in her frosty eyes, making Ye Wei pinch her own arm in disbelief. Huh, no fantasy elements? Su Meiren can blush? What was going on? She felt she had missed out on some spicy drama. "Su Meiren, is the antidote ready?" "Bai Ye, howâ€™s Ah Chen?" ...... "Tomorrow." Su Meiren replied succinctly. Bai Ye gestured and seated himself. After a sip of tea, he stated, "Weâ€™re down to the last component. Tomorrow will tell." Cheng An Ya felt the knot of anxiety in her chest unravel as hope was restored. A blush of relief spread across her pale face, her eyes nearly welling up. Even though she had maintained a facade of normalcy before Xiao Naibao, only she knew the sleepless nights spent worrying, her gaze locked on the labâ€™s direction. She had prayed to the heavens more than a hundred times, begging for his safety. "Thatâ€™s fantastic." Xiao Naibao's face brightened, a visible weight lifted from his youthful shoulders. Su Meiren stroked his head, her demeanor softening, and her tone gentler, "Worried sick, weren't you?" Ye Wei grappled internally with envy. Indeed, children are favored. Su Meiren had never spoken to her with such tenderness. She begrudged Xiao Naibao, the newcomer, and Ye Wei was in turmoil. "Concerned." Xiao Naibao affirmed, glancing between Su Meiren and the stoic Bai Ye. He sensed something was amiss, "Su Meiren, Bai Ye, with such good news, why the long faces when you arrived? It was quite the scare." Something was off. Bai Ye opened his mouth to speak, but Su Meiren silenced him with a sharp look. Bai Ye raised his hand, smiling, and made a shushing gesture, continuing his tea. The crowd was puzzled, and Ye Wei's gaze darted between Bai Ye and Su Meiren. They had all overlooked the distinct handprint etched on Bai Yeâ€™s face, Xiao Naibao included. The hall fell into an uneasy silence. Su Meiren snorted coldly, her brows like daggers, her chilling aura truly daunting. Bai Ye grinned, and everyone anticipated Su Meirenâ€™s next move would be his end. Instead, he shot Bai Ye a cold look and departed. The onlookers exchanged puzzled glances at his retreating figure. What had happened? Xiao Naibao sprang into Bai Yeâ€™s arms, his small hand pressing against the handprint, his dark eyes blinking, "Bai Ye, whatâ€™s with your face?" "A minor run-in with nature's finest." Bai Ye's smile remained poised as he set down his teacup and ruffled Xiao Naibaoâ€™s hair, leaving the child miffed. Why did everyone fancy patting his head? Ye Wei hummed dubiously, sizing up her fingers against the imprint. She sought confirmation pragmatically, "Bai Ye, your fingers donâ€™t seem quite that slender, do they?" The consensus was unanimous as several pairs of eyes scrutinized Bai Yeâ€™s face. They wore expressions that screamed, "Bai Ye, we demand the truth." With the knowledge that an antidote was imminent, Cheng An Yaâ€™s anxiety lessened considerably, and she too became fixated on the distinct handprint etched on Bai Yeâ€™s face. It was a hit that was forceful and precise. At a glance, it was evident that the hand behind it was elegant, slender, and delicate. "Cut the act. Su Meiren slapped you, didnâ€™t she?" Ye Weiâ€™s smile carried a dangerous edge, her demeanor conflicted and charged. "Why did he hit you?" "Bai Ye, what did you do?" "You didnâ€™t overstep, did you?" ...... The inquisitiveness was resounding. Bai Ye put down his teacup with grace, "Iâ€™m exhausted. Time for rest." As everyone watched Bai Yeâ€™s elegant departure, then considered Su Meirenâ€™s cold and formidable allure, they sensed the scent of scandal in the air. Ye Wei clenched her fists in frustration, "Bai Ye, donâ€™t say youâ€™ve just turned... to the other side... aahhhhh......" Chapter 379: Pregnant Ye Wei's visage contorted with rage, almost as if she yearned to charge at Bai Ye and tear him apart like a piece of jerky. Her exquisite features twisted into a ghastly facade, reminiscent of a vengeful specter from a harrowing tale. Xiao Naibao could almost visualize the horrifying image of Ye Wei with her hair ominously swirling around her. 'Wei Wei, stay composed, don't lose it,' Cheng An Ya gently admonished, her smile tinged with an undeniable tease. It was clear to everyone that the usually poised Wei Wei was on the edge of an outburst. Shi Yi silently questioned the heavens; among the geniuses, Wei Wei reigned supreme, yet even she was tested by the current predicament. Thankfully, Bai Ye, who had yet to turn his head at the comment, maintained an exceptional level of calm. Xiao Naibao timidly raised his hand, 'Auntie, I have a question. What does 'bent' mean?' Cheng An Ya's smile briefly stiffened before she recovered her poise. Shi Yi, grounded in his internal world, was as unmovable as a mountain. Ye Wei turned back, tenderly patting Ning Ning's head, imparting a lesson, 'My dear, you're certainly not 'bent,' and that's all you need to understand.' Xiao Naibao cocked his head, his eyes brimming with innocence. Though he didn't grasp the full meaning of 'bent,' he deduced from the women's reactions that it was not a term of purity. 'Mommy always says there's no end to learning, right?' 'Ning Ning, sweetheart, not every teaching is to be taken at face value. Otherwise, the world wouldn't be so rife with villains,' Ye Wei explained with gravitas. Ah, her composure was waning. Shi Yi shook his head, perplexed, 'Has Mo Jue left no imprint on you? To still spar with Su Man...' This woman was veiling an enigma, becoming more inscrutable with each passing day. 'He's inconsequential. How does he compare to Su Meiren? The blow to my pride has been profound,' Ye Wei sought sympathy, her voice blending lament with plea. 'Your lack of empathy is too cruel.' 'Do you yearn for someone's sympathy?' Cheng An Ya clearly relished the unfolding spectacle, 'It's only natural for you to be incensed.' Indeed! Upon reflection, Ye Wei had pursued Su Man for so long without any reciprocation, yet Bai Ye's interactions with Su Man over just a few days had stirred insinuations of an intimate liaison. With this envy blatantly displayed before her, it was natural for her to feel aggrieved. While Su Meiren's reaction wasn't positive, there was a reaction â€“ a vehement one at that. Would the King of Composure react so strongly to an ordinary person? Highly unlikely. 'Sister-in-law, Shi Yi, did Su Meiren's cheeks flush just now?' Ye Wei inquired, her twisted smile seeking confirmation. 'Possibly, yes.' Cheng An Ya's response was more diplomatic, while Shi Yi simply nodded in agreement, both directing their gaze at Ye Wei. Ye Wei blinked, her reaction not as expected by the others. Instead, she pondered, touching her chin, 'Why though?' 'Why what?' Ye Wei rolled her eyes, 'Bai Ye prefers women, and Su Man men, right? So, if there's any danger, Bai Ye should be the concerned one, right? If there's a hint of scandal, it should be Bai Ye who's irate, with Su Meiren remaining composed. Why then is Bai Ye the calm one, while Su Meiren loses his temper?' 'That is odd indeed.' Cheng An Ya considered it, finding the situation strange, 'Did Bai Ye flirt with Su Meiren? Why else would he receive a slap?' 'Not likely.' Ye Wei and Shi Yi denied in unison. Bai Ye wouldn't do such a thing; he wasn't interested in men. Despite Su Meiren's allure, Bai Ye was not one to be superficial. They had known each other for a substantial period, Bai Ye's temperament was well-known to them, and such behavior was out of character for him. Flirting with women was not in his nature, let alone with men. 'Then why did Bai Ye get slapped?' Cheng An Ya asked again, the trio sharing puzzled glances. 'One might expect a slap for making unwelcome advances.' Shi Yi speculated, 'But Bai Ye isn't that type of man, so that's not the reason.' 'Then the reason remains a mystery.' Miss Cheng also pondered, her head tilted in thought. 'Could Bai Ye have been so bold as to assault Su Meiren?' Ye Wei tossed out a shocking suggestion, leaving everyone thunderstruck. Bai Ye was not one to tease, so how could he possibly leap to such extremes without any prior indications? It was a matter of procedure. 'If Su Man were taken advantage of, surely it would be the other way aroundâ€”Su Man overpowering Bai Ye and then sending him to his demise. And all that would end with just a slap?' Shi Yi's tone was icy as he dissected Su Meiren's complex personality. 'Besides, Ah Chen was also present in the lab.' Once again, the three women fell silent, Xiao Naibao timidly raised his hand, 'Aren't you forgetting someone else is here?' 'Why are you still here? When you overhear discussions of adult matters, you should leave immediately,' Cheng An Ya admonished, implying it was his fault for eavesdropping, not theirs. 'Agreed.' 'Concurred.' Xiao Naibao, '......' Ah, the complexity of women. Yet, Nuo Nuo remained the best. 'Ah, I can no longer hold back. Why has my rival turned out to be a man...' Ye Wei completely lost her composure, her figure heading towards the central courtyard. Her silhouette seemed to glide eerily, a chilling sight indeed. As dinner commenced, Cheng An Ya, Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and Xiao Naibao's gazes frequently drifted between Bai Ye and Su Meiren, their expressions etched with curiosity and confusion. Cheng An Ya, an aficionado of the BL genre, felt a surge of relief knowing there was hope for the antidote, now having the leisure to revel in the affairs of others. From her many years immersed in the BL world, Bai Ye and Su Meiren were undoubtedly a match. Su Meiren, resplendent in white, exuded a cool arrogance; Bai Ye, the epitome of grace and charm. Together, they were a vision of rare beauty, a sight for sore eyesâ€”an ideal match of formidable personalities, and her favorite. The imprint of the slap on Bai Ye's face had faded after an afternoon, and he now calmly accepted everyone's attentive gazes as he dined. His unparalleled composure was on full display. Ye Wei inched closer to Su Meiren, her grin wide, 'Su Meiren, why did you slap our Bai Ye?' Everyone shuddered at the term 'our Bai Ye,' but Su Meiren, without lifting an eyelid, replied, 'No comment.' 'No comment, huh? Don't be such a miser with words,' Ye Wei tugged at Su Meiren's sleeve playfully, 'Did Bai Ye bully you? I'll help you get even, I know you can't beat him, but worry not, I can.' 'No need to trouble yourself.' Su Meiren dismissed her coldly. Indeed, he wasn't as skilled in combat as those from the special forces, but he had plenty of ways to take someone down without relying on physical strength. 'It's no trouble at all, I've been itching to give him a good thrashing for some time now, it's not a bother at all.' Ye Wei continued to smile warmly. Xiao Naibao, for the umpteenth time, silently questioned the heavens. There was no end to shamelessness, and ordinary folks certainly lacked such quick-witted adaptability. 'Then suit yourself.' Despite Ye Wei's words, she was dismissed by Su Meiren's four-word mantra, and even Ye Wei had to admit, he was too tight-lipped. There was no hope of coaxing any inside story from Bai Ye. 'You're too selfish, keeping the fun to yourself when sharing joy is far better,' Ye Wei protested unhappily. Shi Yi agreed. Cheng An Ya continued her meal, and Xiao Naibao kept out of the fray to avoid becoming collateral damage. 'Bai Ye, you are straight, aren't you?' Ye Wei blinked innocently, 'I remember last year's Miss World practically worshipping you. A Russian beauty, I even saw you two kissing. You must be straight, right?' Bai Ye paused, then raised an eyebrow, 'You really do pop up everywhere, so you saw that?' 'I knew that silhouette resembled you, it was indeed you.' Ye Wei clapped her hands, laughing, 'Since you're straight, I'm at ease. Don't set your sights on Su Meiren.' Bai Ye smiled without a word, while Su Meiren, unlike his midday outburst, seemed unfazed, casually telling Cheng An Ya, 'You should rest early, we need to draw blood samples tomorrow. Don't eat anything before entering the lab.' After that, he stood up and departed. Everyone glanced at his plate, which was left almost untouched. Cheng An Ya complied, asking Bai Ye, 'Is the last ingredient really my blood?' Bai Ye nodded, 'Exactly.' Cheng An Ya felt a wave of relief wash over her. Success or failure would be decided tomorrow. Bai Ye's assurance was something she had no doubt in. His tone was relaxed and confident; she could let go of half her worries. 'Sister-in-law's blood, I thought Louis's would be necessary.' Ye Wei mused, 'I miss my brother dearly; he needs to recover quickly.' 'There should be an eighty percent chance of success.' 'By the way, Bai Ye, why hasn't the virus affected sister-in-law? She seems almost like any other person, why is my brother's condition so severe?' Ye Wei asked, clearly puzzled. 'The first contagion of this virus is inherently more stable than the second, that's not surprising. Plus, there are still several days left in the one-month period. I've given her a relief agent that can delay the effects for another ten days, so the virus is under control, nothing to worry about.' Bai Ye explained with a gentle smile. 'That makes sense.' Cheng An Ya nodded, grateful for the absence of an outbreak. Shi Yi glanced at Bai Ye's empty plate, her eyebrows rising, 'If I'm not mistaken, you two haven't come out in two days. Why are you eating so much, and Su Meiren so little? Is it that you're upset, no appetite, or is he made of iron?' Ye Wei prodded Bai Ye's arm, 'What on earth did you do to him? It's rare to see Su Meiren resort to hitting someone.' Several pairs of eyes fixed on Bai Ye's face, and he simply smiled, 'No comment.' 'Ten, we haven't had a good workout in a while.' Ye Wei cracked her knuckles threateningly, and Shi Yi got the messageâ€”they could get a bit of exercise that night. A show of force might make him talk. Bai Ye raised his hands, he had a trump card, 'I still have to administer the detox to Ye Sanshao every day.' Everyone, '......' 'That's easy to handle. We'll break your legs, you can still detoxify in a wheelchair. We need your brain, not your legs.' 'Uncle, you're ruthless!' Xiao Naibao gave a thumbs up. Bai Ye ignored the comment as if it were a breeze. The maid served them abalone soup, a portion for each, and Daina said, 'This was gifted to the master by Princess Qi last time. It's exquisite. The master asked me to prepare it for everyone to try.' Ye Wei rested her chin on her hand and smiled, 'Daina, your flattery is improving by the day. Su Meiren would never instruct that, it must be your idea.' 'Wei Wei is indeed perceptive.' Daina laughed, her alluring eyes sparkling shyly from under the black veil. Though her full face was hidden, those eyes alone suggested Daina was a stunning beauty. Ye Wei laughed. Su Meiren had a taste for simplicity and didn't care for seafood; the abalone would've just been a feast for the rats in the mansion. Moreover, it was a gift from Princess Qi, certainly a treasure. 'This has a peculiar taste.' Cheng An Ya fanned her nose, her brow furrowed with discomfort. 'It's quite aromatic.' Xiao Naibao commented. Daina served each person a bowl, but as she placed one before Cheng An Ya, she suddenly felt nauseous. Not wanting to be rude in front of everyone, she tried to endure it. The smell, however, was too much, and unable to hold back, she covered her mouth and rushed from the dining room, retching... Daina and the rest were caught off guard, with Xiao Naibao and Ye Wei quickly abandoning their utensils to follow. Cheng An Ya, leaning against a column, vomited non-stop, leaving everyone in concern. 'Mommy, do you feel ill?' 'Sister-in-law, what's wrong?' ... Cheng An Ya couldn't stop heaving, and it took a while before she finally did, looking somewhat pale. Bai Ye's brow furrowed with concern. Once Cheng An Ya steadied herself, he insisted on checking her pulse. Cheng An Ya laughed it off, 'I'm fine, really, I might just be averse to the smell.' 'Let's have a look at your hand.' Bai Ye smiled warmly, and Cheng An Ya could only extend her hand. Bai Ye placed a thin paper and felt her pulse. After a moment, his eyebrows raised, and he regarded Cheng An Ya with a curious expression. Xiao Naibao was anxious, 'Bai Ye, what's wrong with my mommy? Is it the virus acting up?' 'It's not the virus.' Bai Ye mused, 'She's pregnant.' Chapter 380: To Keep the Child or Not? Pregnant? Cheng An Ya's eyes widened, her mind blank as if struck by lightning, leaving her at a loss. It felt as surreal as an alien invasion. Bai Ye was also somewhat taken aback, as if in disbelief, he checked her pulse several times before finally confirming the pregnancy. His gaze then settled on Cheng An Ya, as if pondering something. "Bai Ye, are you certain? Cheng An Ya is pregnant? They've jumped out of planes twice during their escape. If she were pregnant, the child would have likely been lost long ago. How could it possibly survive?" Ye Wei found the situation hard to believe; after all the intense action they had endured, it had to be a miracle, or... Shi Yi remained silent, while Little Bun, whose actual name is Xiao Naibao, stroked his chin, seriously contemplating this development. "It's a definitive sign of pregnancy; she's indeed with child," Bai Ye announced with finality, his gaze growing even more curious as he looked at Cheng An Ya, who was still reeling from the news, sitting dazedly as if the pregnancy had nothing to do with her. The group exchanged perplexed looks, momentarily unsure of what to say. Little Bun waved his hand in front of Cheng An Ya, snapping her back to reality. Her face turned pale, "This child..." Seeing her reaction, Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and the others couldn't help but wonderâ€”could this child belong to Louis? If it were indeed Louis's, that would complicate things significantly. Louis had coveted her and had held her captive for many days. If he had taken liberties with her, it wouldn't be surprising. Judging by the timing, the pregnancy was recent, and the logical conclusion was unsettling. Cheng An Ya's expression was also puzzling, prompting Ye Wei and Shi Yi to suspect the worst. However, Little Bun quietly watched his mother. "It's less than two weeks old, about ten days," Bai Ye added, his expression becoming increasingly odd. "What?" Ye Wei gasped, her eyes suddenly mirroring the same oddness, her lips twitching, "Could Ye Sanshao have...?" Ye Wei was quick to piece together the timeline of Ye Sanshao's viral infection and their escape. The child was not Louis's; it had to be Ye Sanshao's. Recalling that Ye Sanshao had worn gloves throughout their journey to avoid physical contact, everyone assumed that their collision during the plane jump had led to the virus infection. But the truth seemed to be more astonishing. Ye Wei's expression prompted easy assumptions, and Cheng An Ya's face flushed with embarrassment. Ye Wei, your bluntness is uncalled for. Shi Yi found the situation shockingly amusing, quipping, "It seems the true nature of a man is undeniable." Ye Wei seamlessly added an old adage, "To die under a peony flower, even as a ghost, would be romantic. Ye Sanshao... he's truly bold. Filled with desire, what folly..." This idiom emphasizes the pursuit of love and beauty, even at the cost of lifeâ€”a fitting description of Ye Sanshao's actions. "It's not what you're thinking." Cheng An Ya hastily waved her hands in denial, but her protest seemed to confirm their suspicions. As she spoke, all eyes turned to her, carrying a mix of insinuation and a look that said, 'Don't bother explaining, we understand.' So, Cheng An Ya composed herself. Alright, let them think what they will. Given Ye Sanshao's impression of rashness, she decided to remain silent rather than make things worse. How could this have happened? Cheng An Ya couldn't make sense of her feelings: a little joy, a bit of aimlessness, and a touch of fear. This was not the best time for a pregnancy. Back at the castle, she had been infected, and Ye Sanshao, carelessly, hadn't taken any preventive measures due to their need to escape. They hadn't thought much about it then, but now it seemed a life was at stake. It was a dire situation. Cheng An Ya was deeply conflicted. How could her 'hit rate' be so high? Twice, and both times, it was a success? If every encounter led to pregnancy, wouldn't she be setting a record? Cheng An Ya's thoughts were in disarray as she imagined a dozen children surrounding her, calling her 'mommy'. Cheng An Ya finally understood what it meant to be jolted awake. She swallowed hard; the thought was too frightening. Ye Wei, Shi Yi, Bai Ye, and the others were already stunned by the range of expressions on her face, enjoying a silent play filled with excitement. Little Bun timidly asked, "Mommy, what are you thinking about?" Cheng An Ya shook her head and quickly resumed her usual smiling expression, not even blinking, "Nothing." Unaware of her inner turmoil, they wouldn't dare tell others, lest she be made the butt of jokes for days. Perhaps she was the only pregnant woman in the world whose thoughts wandered this wildly upon learning of her pregnancy. But then again, their conception rate wasn't 100%. That day, Ye Sanshao had exerted himself for nearly a day and a night, and they had lost count of the number of times... Cheng An Ya felt psychologically balanced. "Bai Ye, could the child have any issues?" Cheng An Ya pushed aside the clutter in her mind, her primary concern now being the child's health. Being pregnant in an unhealthy state and having been injected with various relief agents, it was highly likely that the child would be affected. If the child was born with disabilities or mental challenges, it would be better not to have them at all. Though it would be hard to let go, how could she bring an unhealthy child into the world? "Yeah, could the child be infected with the virus?" Ye Wei and Shi Yi asked in unison. Bai Ye pondered deeply, "The exact situation is still unclear, as the child is too small. We'll have to wait until the child grows larger to perform a thorough examination. The virus will definitely infect the child." The extent was the question. Cheng An Ya's pregnancy seemed to complicate the detoxification process. He would need to consult with Su Man. Cheng An Ya clenched her fists anxiously, her heart racing. This pregnancy felt different from when she had Ning Ning. There was less joy this time, and more panic. She feared she couldn't keep this child. Ye Wei, sensing her thoughts, said softly, "An Ya, don't worry too much. Tomorrow the virus will be resolved, and since the child is still small, maybe once your virus is cured, the child's will be too. And even if the child isn't healthy, it's okay to terminate. You and Ye Sanshao are still young; there will be plenty of opportunities to have children." Little Bun's tender face showed reluctance, "I want mommy to have a little brother or sister." "We all do, but they have to be healthy before we can have them," Ye Wei said, feeling a weight in her heart. It seemed the child's fate was uncertain. Without an examination, they knew it would be unlikely to keep the child. Cheng An Ya also realized this, her face losing its luster, and her dark eyes dimming without a trace of light, crossed by a touch of pain, Was it really necessary to terminate? She didn't want to think too pessimistically; she hoped to keep the child. The fruit of love, she couldn't bear to lose it. "An Ya, don't be too anxious. Let's resolve the virus in your body first, and then we can address the child's situation. There's still hope," Bai Ye offered, his smile always distant yet so warm, comforting, especially in his white doctor's coat. Cheng An Ya nodded and smiled, "I know." Ye Wei turned her head, pondered for a moment, and asked, "Bai Ye, An Ya has always been in good condition without showing any additional symptoms. Could the virus have transferred to the child?" Cheng An Ya also considered this possibility. If her body had been healthy all along, could the virus really have moved to the child? If so, the child would surely be doomed. "There is that possibility." Bai Ye furrowed his brow, but Cheng An Ya's blood analysis showed the virus was still present, making it unlikely that it had fully transferred to the child. If it had transferred, the child definitely could not be kept. "I'll go consult with Su Man." With that, Bai Ye left the hall and headed to Su Man's room, his brow marked with grave concern. Cheng An Ya felt an ominous premonition, as if this little life she had not yet known for long might be fated to part, ending up as nothing more than a fleeting joy. Her heart ached as if pricked by needles. "Mommy, don't worry. After Bai Ye and Su Man discuss it, they will check you thoroughly, and then you'll know," Little Bun reassured her with a smile. He didn't like seeing mommy with a troubled face. "Right, An Ya, don't worry too much. Perhaps we're worrying over nothing," Ye Wei said with a smile. Cheng An Ya smiled back, "Don't worry, it's fine. I was just wondering whether it's a boy or a girl." Little Bun quickly raised his hand, "I prefer a little sister." Little sisters were the cutest. He could be her protector, a good big brother. "Why not a little brother?" "A little brother is fine too, but I still prefer a little sister," Little Bun replied, his excitement barely contained, "If the little sister is fine, she will be born soon." "Ning Ning, darling, I bet you it's going to be a little brother." "I bet on a little sister." "Then you're bound to lose. According to the Ye family tradition, it's yang over yin," Ye Wei said earnestly. Cheng An Ya, "... It seems so." "I just want a little sister."  Chapter 381: Beauty Under the Moon Cheng An Ya returned to her room, her mind unsettled. A mother's instinct whispered that her unborn child, Xiao Naibao, was growing strong within her, a bond of heart to heart forming. Surrounded by others earlier, she merely felt astonished. Now, standing alone on the balcony under the moon's soft luminescence, her emotions surged with a profound maternal instinct, more intense than when she first learned of Ning Ning's existence. Ning Ning had been her pillar in a foreign land; this new life, however, was a testament to the love she shared with Ye Sanshao, perhaps even more momentous. The moon over Riyadh cast a gentle, clarifying light, wrapping the bustling city as if in a mother's tender embrace. Cheng An Ya found herself praying for Xiao Naibao's survival, wishing for the heavens to grant them a chance at life. She was not one to believe in fate, yet in this moment, Cheng An Ya couldn't help but hopeâ€”if prayers held any power, she would willingly become a devout supplicant. "Mommy." Ning Ning's soft voice broke the silence as he appeared on the balcony, his smile warm and comforting. His face had lost its babyish roundness, looking more mature. As his mother, Cheng An Ya's heart ached with a fierce protectiveness, yearning for the days of his cherubic innocence. "Why are you still awake?" Cheng An Ya moved aside, wary of her own impulsive desire to embrace him. Ning Ning's lips turned downward in a silent protest. "Mommy, don't be so cautious." "I'm a walking contagion; keep your distance," Cheng An Ya dismissed the protest. "What's wrong? Can't sleep?" "A little. Mommy, will I really get a sister?" Ning Ning's eyes shone expectantly, the word 'sister' seemingly written in a bright pink hue within his gaze. Cheng An Ya hesitated, torn between the harsh reality and not wanting to dash his hopes. After a brief pause, she chose honesty. "It's uncertain for now. Don't get your hopes up too high. Whether it's a sister or brother, with daddy and mommy here, anything is possible." Ning Ning's laughter rang out, a light-hearted sound in the quiet night. "Mommy, you're funny. I don't want a brotherâ€”I want a sister." The adage came to mind: Love and bread will come in due time. "Alright then, a sister," Cheng An Ya conceded with a smile, sharing in Ning Ning's longing for the child's safety. She imagined Ye Sanshao's surprise upon waking, likely quipping about the disruption to their couple's world. Cheng An Ya couldn't help but be perplexed by her own thoughts. "Mommy, you seem to favor boys over girls." "That's absurd," she protested. She loved the idea of a daughter, to dote on and dress in beautiful clothes. "I like daughters just as much." "Then why do you keep mentioning a brother?" Ning Ning scrutinized her, pointing out she had never once spoken of wanting a daughter. Cheng An Ya defended herself, blaming it on the Ye family tradition favoring sonsâ€”a tradition Ning Ning himself was proof of. "Then keep having babies until a daughter comes," Ning Ning suggested earnestly, causing Cheng An Ya's expression to darken at the absurd suggestion. Ning Ning's eyes squinted with glee, his mood visibly uplifted. Cheng An Ya's worries for Xiao Naibao were momentarily forgotten. "Haven't you thought that mommy might not be able to keep this baby?" "With Bai Ye and Su Man on our side, there won't be any issues," Ning Ning said with a confident smile, his voice betraying a hint of bloodlust. Only in front of Cheng An Ya did he allow his ferocity to show. "Louis..." Cheng An Ya looked up at the moon, "Hasn't he disappeared without a trace?" "I'm on it. Once I level up my skills, I won't need to fear Mo Ye and Mo Jue," Ning Ning stated, his determination to surpass their technical expertise clear in his tone. He wouldn't let the matter rest. "You could leave Riyadh now," Cheng An Ya suggested, reassuring him that Black Hawk and the others could take care of things. "How could I? I won't be at peace until you're safe," Ning Ning replied with a smile. "In my heart, daddy and mommy always come first. How could I prioritize revenge over your well-being? That's out of the question." "Alright, stop trying to make mommy feel better. When you get a wife, you'll forget about your mom. I'll focus on your sister," Cheng An Ya quipped. To her surprise, Ning Ning agreed, "A daughter will forget her mom once she has a husband, too. Mommy, you're the same. How can you teach your daughter if you're setting a bad example?" Cheng An Ya was left speechless, only managing to say after a while, "That's why, in this world, parents are the most tragic figures." "..." "Mommy, I still love you the most," Ning Ning said earnestly. Cheng An Ya's heart clenched; she knew the depth of her son's love for her, for his most beloved was now gone. "I know," Cheng An Ya smiled. "You're quite the charmer tonight, aren't you?" "I'm just happy because you're pregnant," Ning Ning replied, his happiness evident. "I hope your dad wakes up tomorrow. I'm looking forward to his reaction." "Dad will probably say, 'Damn, just when I hadn't had enough of us two, another light bulb comes along,'" Ning Ning mimicked Ye Sanshao so vividly that Cheng An Ya doubled over with laughter on the balcony. "My dear, you've got it down to an art." ... Su Man's estate was reminiscent of an aristocratic dwelling from bygone days, a blend of modern design and classical grandeur. His secluded garden, resembling a small courtyard, foretold an ancient charm. The house's facade exuded wealth and antiquity, with marble for walls and glazed tiles for the roof, with white jade lotus lanterns hanging beneath the eaves, creating an air of elegance. The garden showcased a collection of exotic flora. Bai Ye, struck by the sight of a purple-blue flower, an unknown species to him, was engulfed in the sweet fragrances that filled the air. "What flower is this?" Bai Ye's curiosity piqued as he knelt before the unfamiliar bloom, resembling a rose yet clearly not oneâ€”a purple-blue rose, a sight unseen to him. He reached out tentatively, only to be halted by Su Man's chilling voice carried by the night breeze, "If you value your life, you'd best not touch it." His tone was akin to an icy spring in winter, chilling those caught in its cold embrace. Bai Ye withdrew his hand, pondering the eccentricity of planting a garden with such deadly botanicals. "What brings you here?" Su Man inquired coldly, his figure statuesque in the moonlight, distant and ethereal, like a deity descended upon earth. Even men might find themselves momentarily captivated by his beauty. Beauty under the moon, an elegance without equal. Bai Ye suspected that Su Man's frosty demeanor was reserved for him alone. Their rapport had warmed over the past few days, only to cool once moreâ€”unexpectedly so. With a polite smile, Bai Ye approached the matter at hand, "I've come to discuss something with youâ€”Cheng An Ya is pregnant." Chapter 382: Xiao Bai and the Scheming Mind Su Man was taken aback, having not expected Cheng An Ya's pregnancy. His typically stoic expression was briefly replaced by one of concern, but as the shock subsided, a frosty glint appeared in his eyes. 'Aren't you the self-proclaimed genius doctor? Missed the diagnosis, did you? So much for your perfect record.' Bai Ye offered a warm, soothing smile, as if to melt the tension. 'Why the blame game? You didn't notice either.' It had been eight days since Bai Ye's last examination of Cheng An Ya. Back then, her pregnancy was in its nascent stages, barely two days old, and showing no obvious signs. Given that their attention had been wholly consumed by the virus, how could they have suspected pregnancy? Precision has its limits, especially in Su Man's lab, where the focus was on virology, not the subtleties of pregnancy detection. Expecting a find like this in such a place would have been extraordinary indeed. The oversight had no bearing on his medical expertise. 'I'm not a physician,' Su Man responded coolly, deflecting responsibility. As a virologist, missing the signs of Cheng An Ya's pregnancy was understandable. However, for Bai Ye, lauded for his medical acumen, the oversight was a hard pill to swallow. Bai Ye kept his thoughts to himself, 'Su Meiren, a little grace would go a long way.' But 'grace' was not a term Su Man was familiar with. His lips pursed. 'The pregnancy doesn't change our approach to the virus. The detox must proceed as planned. Is there even any point to this discussion?' Bai Ye's headshake carried a mix of warmth and firmness. 'It's not that straightforward. An Ya's pregnancy introduces potential complications. The child she carries could be at risk of infection.' 'Abort it,' Su Man interjected, his voice unwaveringly pragmatic. 'We're dealing with a cellular virus capable of altering genetic makeup. If the fetus is already infected, who knows what kind of monstrosity might result?' A serious expression shadowed Bai Ye's features. He had contemplated this very scenario â€“ a cellular virus is not an ordinary infection; it could fundamentally change human DNA. The possibility of the child being some sort of bio-engineered entity or mutant was a harrowing thought. That would be a tragedy of unimaginable proportions. Yet, the very idea of a new life brought a flicker of hope to everyone involved. To bring up termination now would be nothing short of cruel. 'And if the child is virus-free?' inquired Bai Ye. Su Man's scoff was cutting. 'You're asking that? For a supposed medical prodigy, you seem to lack basic knowledge. The child is developing amidst a pandemic. Do you really think it could remain unaffected?' 'Su Man, no diagnosis is absolute. There could be a chance, however remote.' Bai Ye remained composed, undeterred by the sarcasm. A shadow crossed Su Man's face, his eyes sharp with an unspoken threat. 'Refer to me as 'Su Meiren' one more time, and you'll regret it.' Bai Ye chose to remain silent. Su Man stood, his white garb almost luminous in the moonlight, his black hair secured with a silver clasp â€“ an image of otherworldly elegance. Wasn't he celebrated as a beauty, just like Ye Wei and Xiao Naibao? Bai Ye saw no reason to avoid the term. Sensing Bai Ye's thoughts, the air around Su Man seemed to grow even colder, his presence intimidating. Bai Ye wisely refrained from further provocation. Though not a physical match for Su Man, the array of poisons at his disposal was formidable. One could only guess what toxins Su Man could unleash with a mere gesture. 'I came to discuss An Ya and the baby. Ning Ning is eager for this child. You wouldn't want to disappoint him, would you?' Bai Ye played his trump card, appealing to their collective fondness for Ning Ning. Despite his youth, Ning Ning had endeared himself to them all, not just with his charm, but with his genuine warmth â€“ a sentiment that had spurred Bai Ye to go to great lengths to protect Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya. Su Man's hard exterior softened just a fraction. 'We'll have to wait until the fetus is more developed to make a definitive assessment. If it's infected, it's likely not viable. The virus's inherent instability could lead to mutations or other issues during the pregnancy. However, if they're willing to take the risk, I won't stand in their way.' Gambling on the slim hope that the child might emerge with superhuman abilities, perhaps even surpassing Ning Ning, was a long shot. Even adults struggled to assimilate the virus into their cells; the odds for an unborn child were even slimmer. Bai Ye grew quiet, fully grasping the weight of Su Man's words. 'Would the antidote work if the fetus is infected?' Bai Ye asked. 'The likelihood is slim. This is not a typical case of infection; this is a natural-born carrier. Antidotes are ineffective against such.' Su Man spoke with a bleak resignation, as if discussing someone born to a life of poison, for whom antidotes offer no solace. Bai Ye felt a surge of concern. 'So there's no cure?' Bai Ye challenged, his casual smile masking the storm brewing within. 'And here I was, thinking I was the only one with an overstated reputation. We each have our specialties, and this is certainly not one of mine.' Su Man's eyes held a fierce, silent challenge, though he chose not to respond directly. 'We'll pick this up tomorrow.' Su Man stood, his figure blending with the moonlight, his aloofness clear. Bai Ye remained still, watching Su Man with an unwavering smile. Su Man's sneer cut through the air. 'Anything else?' 'Are you still angry? Surely, you're not so petty.' Bai Ye's voice was light, but it carried a strength to match Su Man's. 'It was an accident, and you've already retaliated. That should settle it.' He knew Su Man's pride was wounded. Bai Ye was known for his restraint; he seldom showed anger or indifference, instead maintaining a smile, a demeanor as polished and refined as jade â€“ his hallmark. Yet beneath that poised exterior lay a fierce pride and determination, traits skillfully veiled by his outward tranquility, creating the illusion of a consummate gentleman. Su Man, on the other hand, made no effort to disguise his nature. Aristocratic and haughty, his self-restraint was sheathed in ice. 'Enough. Leave,' Su Man said coldly, his impatience clear. Bai Ye's laughter was light, his demeanor unflustered. He raised an eyebrow, a playful challenge in his voice, 'Could it be that you're actually offended?' Su Man's gaze was icy, the sharpness in his eyes enough to cut through steel. Bai Ye met his look with a gentle smile, the frostiness seemingly melting away. Su Man's features grew colder, while Bai Ye chose silence over words. The memory of their earlier mishap in the laboratory surfaced unbidden in both their minds. They had spent nearly eight days in each other's company, diligently working on the antidote for the virus. Bai Ye's assistance had lightened Su Man's burden considerably. His expertise in detoxification was undeniable, yet in certain respects, he found himself outmatched by Bai Ye. Each had their own areas of specialization, and they had managed to compensate for each other's shortfalls, collaborating effectively. At first, Su Man had not been particularly impressed with Bai Ye, sensing a competitive streak in him that he deemed presumptuous. Su Man had every reason to be confident to the point of arrogance, dismissing the title of 'genius doctor' attributed to Bai Ye. Over time, however, as they worked closely together, Su Man began to recognize Bai Ye's genuine talent. Their understanding of each other deepened, and a tacit camaraderie developed between them. Heroes often find kinship with one another, particularly when they are unparalleled geniuses in their respective domains. Familiarity tends to dissolve formalities. One day, the conversation veered towards the topic of homosexuality. For two adult men, one of whom was gay, such a discussion was inherently awkward. Su Man clearly preferred not to dwell on it, and Bai Ye, perceiving this, didn't pry. Unexpectedly, Su Man had an accident with a reagent vial. As Bai Ye moved to clean up the spill, his footing betrayed him... Such scenes are a staple in TV dramas: the male lead, through some unforeseen mishap, falls and ends up in a compromising position with the female lead, usually culminating in an accidental kiss. And thus, a romance is sparked. In movies and television, this trope has been played out to the point of clichÃ©, leaving audiences numb, while actors relish the drama. It's a 'romantic encounter' scene in its purest form. But applied to Su Man and Bai Ye, it simply doesn't fit. Why? Because Bai Ye's agility is such that he could navigate an oil-slicked floor with ease. The idea of him stumbling was implausible; even if he did fall, he'd have righted himself before hitting the ground. But in the moment he realized he was toppling towards Su Man, Bai Ye was momentarily transfixed, And that split-second of distraction proved catastrophic. Su Man, unprepared, was indeed brought down by Bai Ye. The fall itself was inconsequential â€“ an accident, after all. Su Man wouldn't have held a grudge over something so trivial. However, the essential element of this classic scenario was missing: the kiss. Without that, it wasn't a true 'romantic encounter' moment at all. It wasn't accidental, Bai Ye had kissed him intentionally. From tumbling to kissing, there was no hesitation, so convincing that it might have been mistaken for an accident. But Su Man was no fool. He knew the weight of Bai Ye's body all too well. He was rooted to the spot for a brief eternity before his hand connected with Bai Ye's cheek in a resounding slap. In that instant, Su Man was livid. He had clearly sensed a shift in Bai Ye's gaze mid-fall and knew something was amiss. He had tried to push him away but was too late. For the first time in his life, he felt violated. This was nothing like Ye Wei's flirtation and seduction. At least Wei Wei had never breached the sanctity of his lips. An unexpected kiss exchanged for a slap from Su Man didn't seem like a bad trade. Su Man's first kiss, Bai Ye's first time being struck â€“ it was a first for both, a bizarre form of parity. Who would have guessed that Su Man, in a surge of indignation, would revert to treating him like a stranger once more? 'Are you courting death?' Su Man's voice was as sharp as a guillotine, his aura menacing. The recall of Bai Ye's momentary astonishment and hesitation at the contact only deepened his sense of affront. If Bai Ye was indeed flirting with danger, Su Man had no qualms about obliging him. They had just broached the subject of homosexuality, with Bai Ye wryly commenting that such relationships seldom endure, driven more by the thrill of novelty than lasting connection. The remark had irked Su Man. Yet, Bai Ye's observation was undeniably rooted in reality. Bai Ye was aware that his own preferences differed from Su Man's; he was unequivocally straight, attracted to women. So what did his kiss signify? A fleeting curiosity, a dalliance with temptation? Su Man, a man of unassailable integrity, was not ashamed of his orientation, but being kissed by another man had left him feeling as though his masculinity had been called into question. Considering Su Man's habitual pride and superiority, it was no wonder he was incensed. For the first time, Su Man found himself truly unsettled. Bai Ye's response was a raised brow, 'No, I rather enjoy living.' Su Man snorted coldly, his glare blazing with repressed fury, 'Leave now, or prepare to face the consequences.' He turned and walked away, leaving Bai Ye with the sight of his retreating, frost-tinged silhouette. Bai Ye remained where he was, his posture relaxed, his smile deepening. As a man celebrated for both his intellect and looks, he found himself genuinely puzzled. What had he done to be on the receiving end of such disfavor? Why he had kissed Su Man was a mystery even to Bai Ye. It had seemed an impulsive act, one he couldn't fully explain to himself. As he fell, the familiar scent of Su Man â€“ a cool fragrance he had grown accustomed to over their days together â€“ had enveloped him. For a man to carry a scent was often a source of embarrassment, but Su Man, who spent his days among flowers and plants, had become one with this cool aroma, as if it were a natural extension of himself, alluring in its subtlety. So close in proximity, perhaps it was the intoxicating scent or the allure of those lips that had clouded his judgment. Before Bai Ye could grasp the implications of his actions, their lips had met. To claim it was an accident would be disingenuous; he had been deliberate. Bai Ye cast a final glance over the resplendent garden, a sense of bewilderment settling over him. He couldn't fathom what had driven his actions, lost in thought as he exited Su Man's courtyard, oblivious to the piercing gaze that followed his departure. Hmph. Su Man's scoff echoed in the silence, a sound laden with the promise of retribution. The noble and exquisite man's lips curled in a faint smile, as though he had already seen his prey unwittingly ensnared. Chapter 383: The Poison is Neutralized The next day, within the sterile confines of the research lab, Cheng An Ya watched intently as Bai Ye administered the antidote to Ye Sanshao. The transparent liquid flowed through him like an icy spring, chilling her heart and limbs, her palms slick with cold sweat from the tension. She watched the operating table anxiously for any sign of Ye Sanshao's reaction. This wasn't the first antidote that Su Man and Bai Ye had devised. Over the past few days, they had experimented with three different formulas, each initially tested on lab rats. The first two were fatal, and the third elicited no response. But now, the lab rat had shown a reaction. Su Man's analysis confirmed that within an hour, the bloodborne toxins had been completely neutralized. This meant they had, at last, a successful antidoteâ€”at least it was effective in the lab rat. As Cheng An Ya was pregnant and the antidote's human effects were unknown, Ye Sanshao was chosen for the first human trial. His time was running out. The injection was necessary. Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and the others were present, including Xiao Naibao. It was a pivotal day. If the antidote failed, they would need to find another solution, losing even more time. Ye Sanshao's time was running short. Xiao Naibao and Cheng An Ya understood this was their last chance. Everything rested on today's outcome. After the antidote was administered, everyone's gaze was fixed on the diagnostic screen, silently observing. The sedatives had been stopped, and now Ye Sanshao was only on an oxygen mask; all other treatments had been withdrawn. They held their breath for the antidote's effects. Bai Ye checked Ye Sanshao's pulse, his expression grave. The pulse was steady due to the sedative's recent cessation and showed no awakening signs. After half an hour, there was still no reaction. The screen didn't show any decrease in viral activity. Cheng An Ya, not fully understanding the analytical diagrams, only knew they depicted the virus consuming cellsâ€”an internal view of Ye Sanshao's body. Bai Ye had explained that the black areas represented virus-infected regions. The scans showed severe invasion in Ye Sanshao's liver, stomach, and spleen. His body was rife with the terrifying virus, all in a state of fluctuation and mutation. Post-antidote, red bubbles appeared on the screen, relentlessly attacking the blackened regions. Having observed the lab rat demonstration, they expected the black areas to fade and eventually vanish after ten minutes, signaling the virus's eradication. Yet after thirty minutes, there was no change in Ye Sanshao. The red bubbles continued their futile assault on the black areas, a stark battle between good and evilâ€”goodness striving to eliminate evil but powerless to do so. With arms crossed, Bai Ye watched the screen, almost holding his breath. For the first time, his heart raced with anxiety. Could the antidote be wrong? His calculations had indicated a reaction within fifteen minutes. Why was there none? The lab rat had begun assimilating the virus within just ten minutes. Something was off. A fine sheen of sweat formed on Bai Ye's brow. At the computer, Su Man sat calmly, his eyes sharp as he focused on the screen. He appeared composed, as if the half-hour without reaction was expected. But beneath his calm exterior, Su Man's palms were sweating. He knew that if the antidote had no effect, Ye Sanshao would surely die. Even if he and Bai Ye worked around the clock to create another antidote, they wouldn't have results for at least three to five days. Cheng An Ya might be able to wait, but Ye Sanshao could not. Su Man's noble features were marked with grave concern. Without looking back, he knew the expressions of those standing behind him. Cheng An Ya and the rest refrained from disturbing Su Man and Bai Ye, worried about breaking their concentration. Ye Wei and Shi Yi pressed their lips together, waiting anxiously. Xiao Naibao stayed close to Cheng An Ya, fearing she might not withstand the tension. The suspense between life and death was excruciating. In such moments, many begin to lose hope. Xiao Naibao glanced at his father on the operating table, his eyes filled with pain. He had acknowledged his father for less than half a year. He couldn't bear the thought of losing him. Palm readers often say one is bound to lose a loved one within ten yearsâ€”a saying that seemed true, as most people had indeed lost a beloved family member within that timeframe. He had already lost Nuo Nuo. So he had already experienced the loss of a loved one. Therefore, daddy, you must survive. If he were to pass away, his mother would likely become a shell, forever devoid of happiness. Daddy, please, you must hang in there. He had always had faith in Su Man and Bai Ye, but at this critical moment, he realized just how anxious he was. Cheng An Ya stood aside, leaning against the edge of a table, her gaze intense as she stared at the screen, afraid to miss any detail. She prayed desperately for the antidote to take effect quickly. 'Bai Ye, increase the dosage,' Su Man ordered in a deep voice. Bai Ye's brow furrowed, and without hesitation, he administered another dose of the antidote. The antidote was also a toxin. Without the virus in Ye Sanshao's system, just the antidote would be fatal within a minute. Thus, increasing the dosage was risky. A slight miscalculation could lead to death from the antidote itself. 'Bai Ye, what's happening? Why is there no reaction?' Ye Wei asked, her voice tinged with anxiety, 'Could it be ineffective?' 'Wait,' Bai Ye said firmly. The agonizing wait continued as time slipped away. They had been told he would awaken within an hour. If not, he would die. Yet as an hour neared its end, he showed no sign of awakening. Hope seemed to be slipping away, drop by drop. Suddenly, a clanging noise came from the operating table. Ye Sanshao's wrist moved, attempting to break free from the handcuffs but to no avail. He grew frantic, pulling and tugging with great strength. Everyone gasped in shock. Su Man quickly began to analyze Ye Sanshao's bodily function indicators on the computer. Ye Sanshao first grunted as if in extreme pain, his head shaking uncontrollably, his body straining against the restraints. Cheng An Ya and Ye Wei moved to intervene but were stopped by Bai Ye. Abruptly, Ye Sanshao let out a vehement roar, 'Ahh...' His eyes, sealed in darkness for ten days, snapped open with an intensity reflecting his inner chaos. The dark pupils were streaked with blood, a fearsome red, and his limbs began to thrash violently, his cries and shouts echoing those of a madman. The sight tore at Cheng An Ya's heart, 'Achen...' She covered her mouth tightly, her heart wrenching, unwilling to watch any longer, her gaze falling to the table, Yet his cries of madness still rang in her ears. Achen... 'Daddy...' 'Brother... what's wrong with you?' Ye Wei was panic-stricken, 'Su Man, what's happening to my brother?' 'The antidote is finally taking effect,' Su Man stated calmly. 'Normally, without the sedative, he would be in excruciating pain. Now with the antidote attacking the virus, the two reactions are clashing. This is expected.' 'Furthermore, we've increased the dosage, which means his pain will be even more intense,' Bai Ye added. 'Daddy won't be harmed, right?' 'A reaction means he's not going to die,' Su Man assured, his hands swiftly testing all of Ye Sanshao's indicators while instructing Bai Ye to inject several more agents. So detached, yet so decisive. Relief washed over everyone upon hearing the news. Cheng An Ya and the others, not versed in medical intricacies, couldn't understand the technicalities, only that Ye Sanshao's agony seemed to lessen. The harrowing screams, as if his very insides were being torn out, were nightmarish. Ye Sanshao's visage was terrifying, his features twisted in pain, his voice hoarse, limbs marked with wounds from the handcuffs and shackles, blood flowing freely, the flesh nearly embedded into his bones. Cheng An Ya's heart ached. 'Daddy, you'll be okay. Hold on,' Xiao Naibao clenched his fist, cheering for Ye Sanshao. 'He can't hear you,' Bai Ye said with a smile. In his current state, Ye Sanshao could feel nothing but pain and the vertigo of impending death. This lasted for about ten minutes. Finally, the antidote began to merge quickly with the black virus areas, progressively purging Ye Sanshao's body of the virus. Ye Wei and Shi Yi, familiar with various modern technologies, had never witnessed such a detailed process. They could see the antidote cleansing Ye Sanshao's body, the black virus weakening, then slowly disappearing. Simultaneously, Ye Sanshao's body broke out in sweat. His roars quieted, turning into pained groans. In the end, Bai Ye administered the serum, completing the final detoxification step. Ye Sanshao, utterly exhausted, succumbed to a deep sleep. Cheng An Ya rushed forward, but Bai Ye quickly intervened, 'An Ya, he's just been detoxified. Don't risk getting poisoned again. It's your turn now.' Cheng An Ya paused, 'Detoxified, really? Is he alright?' 'Yes, it was successful.' 'Fantastic!' Ye Wei and Shi Yi high-fived, the lab erupting in cheers, even a faint smile passing Su Man's lips. After such a harrowing detoxification, Xiao Naibao voiced his concern, 'Will mommy also suffer as daddy did?' 'No,' Bai Ye replied with a chuckle.  Chapter 384: The Child Under Siege by the Virus Cheng An Ya's detoxification unfolded as smoothly as a standard inoculation. After the administration of the antidote, a veil of drowsiness enveloped her, and she lay rested on a separate operating table. The internal scan disclosed a stark reality â€“ the virus within Cheng An Ya had congregated menacingly around her womb. Bai Ye's suspicions were confirmed. Ye Wei had voiced that Cheng An Ya's symptoms were atypical for a viral affliction. Bai Ye reflected on their time at Louis's isolated island, where Cheng An Ya had displayed complete debilitation and sharp pains in her organs. These peculiar symptoms emerged at Prince William's fortress, suggesting the unborn child might be siphoning the virus, essentially marinating in a viral bath as it developed. Su Meiren had indicated as much, and without even glancing at the internal view, Bai Ye knew the child was surely tainted by infection. 'Is this child treating the virus as a nutritional supplement?' Ye Wei gasped, eyes widened in disbelief as she peered at the internal view, Xiao Naibao's expression clouded with worry. The sight they faced was unsettling. 'All signs point to yes,' Bai Ye intoned, a wave of trepidation washing over him. The child's conception occurred amidst Cheng An Ya's viral siege; it was possible the child was born a harbinger of the virus. The ramifications were daunting. Beyond the virus's impact on the child, if born, could any soul dare to touch him? Su Meiren's brows, normally a portrait of serenity, now knitted slightly â€“ a rare display from the refined Su Meiren. The serious turn of events wasn't lost on Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and Xiao Naibao. While Ye Sanshao slept in oblivion and Cheng An Ya seemed at peace in her slumber, their hearts raced with acute concern. 'Su Meiren, what do you foresee?' Xiao Naibao inquired. With a gentle pat on his hand, Su Meiren offered a pale consolation, 'It's too early for conclusions. Infection is confirmed, but only time will tell the depth of its consequences. Your mother will not suffer.' The antidote was working its silent war against the viral invader, methodically purging it from Cheng An Ya's body. Unlike Ye Sanshao's harrowing pain, she merely rested, tranquility etched upon her features. 'Bai Ye, didn't the elder witch mention once that Black Hawk experimented with creating toxic beings? Could this child's predicament be akin?' Ye Wei's query sliced through the air, evoking memories buried deep. 'Toxic beings?' Su Meiren's eyebrow arched in intrigue. A nod from Bai Ye confirmed the dark past, 'Black Hawk once reared infants as bearers of death, their sustenance laced with lethal toxins from the onset of life. From a dozen, only three survived infancy. Their sustenance remained venomous throughout growth; out of those, two succumbed, leaving only one. This survivor was no ordinary child; he was a bearer of death, his very touch fatal. The gravest exposure meant certain death, while the slightest required immediate serum and months of recuperation. Even his breath was a wisp of death.' 'How barbaric,' Xiao Naibao muttered, his frown deepening at the thought. Fortunate was his Nuo Nuo, not subjected to such torment under Black Hawk's clutches. 'Truly barbaric. The elder witch confined the child, severing ties with Black Hawk over this atrocity. It's a tale from many years ago, almost forgotten until Wei Wei's mention. Such experiments bear scant success, with a heavy toll paid in lives for a single survivor. Moreover, a toxic being's diet must always contain toxins, or the absence of poison would prove more fatal than its presence,' Bai Ye recounted somberly, a tale of horror they'd only heard whispers of â€“ whispers that were undoubtedly true. 'If the virus were to vanish, would the child then perish?' Shi Yi posed her enigmatic question, the complexity of the situation stretching the bounds of comprehension. 'I've heard of such phenomena, but the child's case differs,' Su Meiren replied with his characteristic calm, 'If the child withstands growth, it signifies a virus-cell integration within. Though formless still, growth persists. Viruses are not akin to poisons. Innate carriers may even master the virus. Should the virus's absence be fatal, then fate deems the child never to belong to this world.' Su Meiren's voice was even, the virus in Cheng An Ya's body diminishing, expelled through perspiration. Bai Ye too administered a serum. Everyone else, barring Bai Ye, grappled with understanding, though the sense of an impending resolution to the viral menace offered a sliver of solace. Ye Wei escorted Cheng An Ya back to their quarters, Bai Ye did likewise with Ye Sanshao, entrusting the maids with their care, particularly for Ye Sanshao's grievous struggles. Su Meiren and Xiao Naibao lingered, the latter expressing his deep gratitude, 'Su Meiren, your efforts have been nothing short of Herculean.' 'It was but a trifle,' Su Meiren offered dismissively, his hand finding a perch on Xiao Naibao's shoulder, 'We're allies, after all. Formalities are unnecessary.' Xiao Naibao's lips curled into a smile, and Su Meiren guided him to sit upon the courtyard bench. Riyadh's overcast skies cast a chill, yet the expansive central courtyard, aided by the fountain's mist, felt pleasantly cool. 'When do you plan to depart?' Su Meiren queried. Their departure was inevitable; Dragon Gate, the premier terrorist organization, and the Mafia stood at the precipice of chaos, with victory's mantle yet undecided. As pivotal figures within their factions, they would need to strategize against the Mafia and the coalition of government troops, with the latter half of the year promising upheaval. 'I was about to ask you the very same. Will my mother encounter any more issues? With the child harboring the virus, is re-infection a possibility for her?' Xiao Naibao's thoughts were cautiously protective. 'That won't happen. They've developed antibodies; they are now immune to the same virus,' Su Meiren assured, 'I've considered this. Should complications arise, they're more likely to affect the child, not the adults. The direst contingency would involve terminating the pregnancy.' Xiao Naibao nodded, his mind partially at ease. 'My primary concern is for my mother. I must be wholly prepared this time; I refuse to let Louis triumph again.' Determination shaded Xiao Naibao's tone, the specter of finding Louis's lair loomed near. 'In the weight of power, the premier terrorist organization holds dominion, the Mafia follows, and Dragon Gate trails. The second seeks to dethrone the first, a feat impossible to achieve aloneâ€”support from the third is essential,' Su Meiren's lips curled in a knowing smile. Worldly machinations could not escape his keen gaze from within his secluded abode. Xiao Naibao's smile mirrored his understanding, 'He surely can't win over Dragon Gate, thus his sole path lies in absorption, to dominate all of North America. With the Mafia dividing power across the continent, even the terrorist organizations proceed with caution. Success in conquering North America would lead to a two-tigers-one-mountain scenario; any resistance by then would be futile. But that assumes he can indeed conquer North America.' 'Precisely,' Su Meiren uttered with a chuckle. Xiao Naibao's first journey here had been consumed by the viral crisis, leaving scant opportunity for deeper exchanges. As their time for departure drew near, Su Meiren felt a pang of reluctance. Yet, he was a man who let life flow as it may; partings, after all, were at destiny's whim. Moreover, their paths were bound to intersect in times to come. 'Riyadh is a haven of tranquility. Mo Jue has been gone for days, and despite Louis knowing my parents are here, he remains inactive. Strange, indeed,' Xiao Naibao mused. He had hoped to set a trap, vacating all of Dragon Gate and the premier terrorist organization's operatives from Riyadh, leaving only Ye Wei and Shi Yi. Yet, Louis's inaction remained a curious aberration. 'With the world at one's feet, beauty becomes but an afterthought,' Su Meiren's tone was light. Xiao Naibao considered the wisdom before Su Meiren inquired further, 'Those firearms from before haven't been completed yet, have they?' 'The high-speed magnetic wave gun? One has emerged from the forge,' Xiao Naibao admitted, his lips pursed slightly. 'Your design proved formidable to manufacture, yielding many failures and a solitary success. Yet, future production should prove more manageable.' 'I'm impressed; I had anticipated another month or two for completion. Your organization's reserve forces are indeed formidable.' 'Of course,' Xiao Naibao proclaimed with pride. 'Bai Ye was fortunate to be the first to trial the weapon. Its power is formidable indeed; capable of taking down a fighter jet even at high speeds. It's almost inconceivable.' 'The speed nears that of light itself,' Su Meiren noted, a smile touching his lips. This had been his labor of love for three years, resulting in a creation he was immensely proud of. Had it been brought to market, it would have commanded a lofty sum, yet Xiao Naibao had managed to swindle it away. Bai Ye, fortunate to be the inaugural tester, had reaped the benefits. Xiao Naibao chuckled, his large, dark eyes flickering with cunning, 'Su Meiren, you are a true siren,' Xiao Naibao said with a teasing lilt. 'Our Bai Ye is no unsellable stock; he's our bestseller,' Xiao Naibao retorted with a twinkle in his eye. 'In terms of quality, appearance, and functionality, he's unparalleled. Not to mention, he's a versatile asset.' Su Meiren's laughter echoed, a rare and unguarded display that spoke volumes of his current ease. Xiao Naibao felt a sense of completion, having witnessed such unguarded mirth. This jovial scene, observed from the vantage of a distant villa balcony by Ye Wei and Bai Ye, seemed to radiate scandal. Su Meiren's smile was indulgent, Xiao Naibao's demeanor far too intimate. An indignant Ye Wei remarked, 'Su Meiren is far too immoral, harboring an inappropriate infatuation with my Ning Ning. It's excessive.' 'You might be overthinking it. Are you sure it's not Ning Ning who's taking liberties with him?' Bai Ye quipped with a chuckle as he began to descend the stairs. Ye Wei, quick to follow, playfully probed, 'Bai Ye, do you harbor feelings for Su Meiren?' 'I have a preference for beauties,' Bai Ye replied. Ye Wei, '...Perhaps I should suggest Su Meiren consider a different kind of change.' 'Even a change of that nature wouldn't make him a beauty,' Bai Ye countered, distinguishing between beauty and a beautiful woman. 'Spare me the self-contradiction,' Ye Wei chided. 'Are you forsaking Su Meiren for the embrace of Mo Jue?' Bai Ye teased, comfortable with Ye Wei's closeness. He hadn't overlooked the intimacy, but neither he nor others like Chu Li had ever viewed Ye Wei and Shi Yi as women. Otherwise, their shared history spanning over a decade would have naturally engendered romantic entanglements. 'Nonsense,' Ye Wei scoffed, 'I still favor Su Meiren.' She deliberately avoided mentioning Mo Jue. Bai Ye issued a gentle reminder, 'Once Ye Sanshao and An Ya awaken, we'll likely depart Riyadh, and a fierce battle awaits. Be mentally prepared. I trust you won't let emotions cloud your judgment, but a word to the wise, lest you find yourself beyond salvation.' Bai Ye's concern was clear; Big White, at least, was predictably obedient. Mo Jue, by contrast, seemed a dangerous variable, one that could lead to dire outcomes. 'Your faith in me is that scant?' Ye Wei pinched his arm, feigning offense, 'Would I betray our cause?' 'It's not about trust; it's about concern,' Bai Ye clarified with a friendly smile, 'Mo Jue appears dangerous, and I doubt you're his equal.' 'I'm not his match?' Ye Wei's pride was slightly wounded. 'In matters of cunning, men often hold an edge,' Bai Ye observed, 'Consider An Yaâ€”despite her intelligence, Ye Sanshao often outmaneuvers her in strategy.' 'That's discriminatory,' Ye Wei accused. 'I'm merely skeptical of you. Just be careful,' Bai Ye advised. 'Understood. I won't disappoint,' Ye Wei assured him with a mischievous grin. As they reached the central courtyard, she leaned in and planted a flirtatious kiss on Bai Ye's cheek, whispering, 'For your reward.' Bai Ye was bemused, his eyes catching Su Meiren and Xiao Naibao's attention. Su Meiren's expression remained stoic, his eyes now exuding a cold sharpness, the previously gentle smile vanishing in an instant, replaced by a chilly huff. Chapter 385: Caught in the Act Cheng An Ya woke to the deep silence of the night. Moonlight, unbidden, leapt through the balcony, casting silver shards across the floor. The room was bathed in the soft glow of a white jade lamp, a soothing light that didn't sting the eyes, but instead wrapped everything in a gentle embrace of warmth. The poison had been neutralizedâ€”this she knew with clarity. Bai Ye had administered the antidote, and in those moments, she had briefly entertained the thought of an eternal slumber, free from pain, as they say, a peaceful death. Now, she almost laughed at the notion, her mind surprisingly at peace. After all, she had the reassurance that Ye Sanshao was safe. The only regret, had death come, would have been for the childâ€”two lives, not just one, would have been claimed. Such a thought was far from comforting. A smile graced her lips as she turned to find Ye Sanshao asleep by her side, the warmth from the bedding seeping deep into her bones. It was as if the very pores of her skin had opened to welcome the comfort, a feeling so blissful it was akin to rebirth. Perhaps it was the psychological release from the knowledge that they were no longer carriers of the lethal virus. No longer did she have to fear passing it to innocents or causing the death of those dear to her. Despite maintaining a facade of normalcy in recent days, the weight of their plight had pressed heavily upon Cheng An Ya. Since Zhang Bo's death, it had been as though a heavy stone lay upon her chest, suffocating her in the stillness of the night. It was a malady of the heart, one that had driven her towards isolation, fearing the harm she might bring to others. Now, with the heavy stone shattered, her spirit felt light for the first time. It was truly the comfort of being unburdened, similar to being granted a new lease on life. Next to her, Ye Sanshao's gentle breathing was a soothing melody. The terrifying image of his twisted visage during the detoxification had faded into the past. All that mattered now was his tranquil slumber, a testament to his safety. All their trials seemed worthwhile. Cheng An Ya often reflected on the adage that those who survive great misfortune are destined for ensuing blessings. They had weathered countless dangersâ€”leaping from a plane over the desert, enduring days of entrapment, narrowly escaping death within a castle, and almost being blown to smithereens at sea. They had danced on the edge of life and death, not to mention the virus that had clung to them, yet here they were, unscathed. Could it be that their path forward would now be smooth sailing? One could only hope. Cheng An Ya was aware that Louis was still out there, the Mafia's movements were a mystery, and Dragon Gate had seen its fair share of turmoil recently. Someone was pulling the strings behind the scenes, aiming to unleash another wave of bloodshed and chaos. She didn't need to ask around; the pieces of information she gathered from Xiao Naibao's and Ye Wei's analysis were telling enough. After this round of detoxification, they would likely face even greater storms. She could only wish that Ye Sanshao, having tasted the full spectrum of life's bitterness, had reached the end of his tribulations. May his future be one of peace and smoothness. With a sigh, her hand reached out, gently tracing his eyebrowsâ€”thick, well-shaped, framing eyes shut tight with lashes that curled just so, casting delicate shadows beneath that were nothing short of beautiful. His nose, high and regal; his lips, a work of art. His features, chiseled as if by divine hand, were stunning to behold. Cheng An Ya was well aware of Ye Sanshao's extraordinary looks. Though he might not command the same awe as Su Man or Mo Jue, his was a rare beauty unlike any other. Her fingers slid across his lips, recalling their warmth. Cheng An Ya hesitated, then withdrew her hand, wondering what this man, so fond of himself, would think if he knew of her secret adoration. She seldom had the chance to study his face with such undivided attention. Memories of his domineering, angry, cunning, and at times pitiful expressions flitted across her mind, coaxing a smile onto her lips. Her laughter broke the silence. "Do I really look that funny to you?" A hoarse voice laced with displeasure sounded out. Cheng An Ya, startled, met the gaze of a pair of dark, irate eyes. Ye Sanshao's eyes, previously closed, now glared at her with indignation. A surge of relief washed over Cheng An Yaâ€”he was awake, and all was well. But when had he woken? Her face flushed as she remembered her fingers caressing his features. "Were you awake before?" "Why the laughter?" Ye Sanshao's gaze darkened, his grip tightening on her hand, jarring the wound on his wrist. He winced, pulling on the other side too, knitting his brows in pain. "Stop, don't move," Cheng An Ya insisted, helping him to sit up. Luckily, he hadn't pulled too hard, and the bandage held the blood at bay. She was about to remove it to apply fresh medicine, but Ye Sanshao stopped her. "It's merely a scratch," he said, glancing at his wrists and then at his ankles, recalling fragmented images that allowed him to piece together the recent events. He faintly remembered his own madness, the clanging of metal echoing in his ears. At the time, the pain seemed trivial and was now barely a memory. "Even scratches need tending," Cheng An Ya replied, fetching the medicine. She unwrapped the gauze and carefully reapplied it to his wounds. It was only then that he truly noticed how ghastly the cuts on his wrist were. A flash of alarm crossed his mind, and he quickly looked to Cheng An Ya's wrist. She was safe, and a question burst forth from Ye Sanshao, "What about the poison in you? Is it gone?" Cheng An Ya nodded, recounting the events, but she left out the matter of their unborn child. She was unsure how to broach the subject with Ye Sanshao. Once the medicine was applied, she bandaged his wounds anew. "You haven't yet answered my question," Ye Sanshao pressed, nudging her with his head. To laugh in his face as he sleptâ€”she must be chastised. Cheng An Ya rolled her eyes, "Is it wrong to be happy? The poison is gone; it's a cause for celebration. Why shouldn't I laugh?" "Liar," Ye Sanshao grunted, leaning forward to plant a kiss on Cheng An Ya, "How long have I been asleep?" "Nine days," she replied. Nine days of tension for Cheng An Ya. Especially today, during the detox, and the sensation of hovering on the edge of despair, had been indelibly etched into her heart. The agonizing wait, more torturous than any other moment, would be forever unforgettable. Ye Sanshao looked at her, his eyes deepening, and he suddenly said, "It's been so long, you owe me a kiss. You should take a page from those princes who kiss their sleeping beauties awake." Puckering his lips, he leaned toward her expectantly. Cheng An Ya pushed him away, laughing and scolding, "In what way do you resemble a princess?" Ye Sanshao laughed too. The previously heavy atmosphere dissipated instantly, replaced by light-heartedness and joy. Cheng An Ya glanced to see him smiling softly, lips curved in a slight smile. She moved closer, and Ye Sanshao tilted his head, naturally capturing her lips with his. Cheng An Ya extended her tongue, delicately tracing the contours of his lips. Suddenly, she found herself enveloped in his embrace, Ye Sanshao taking the lead. He plunged into the kiss, deep and thorough, exploring every inch of tender flesh within her mouth, his tongue twirling, nibbling, and savoring. He relished the joy of rebirth, the excitement of regaining what he had once lost. Everyone who falls asleep does so with the awareness that they may never awaken again, holding in their hearts a mÃ©lange of emotions about parting. To be alive in such a momentâ€”who would not be filled with joy? The treasure in his arms felt all the more precious. Cheng An Ya closed her eyes, savoring his kiss, surrounded by a familiar scent, a gentle breeze brushing her brows, filling the room with softness and affection. No amount of kissing seemed to satisfy. Ye Sanshao was insatiable. Just as he relented to allow her a breath, he was back again, dominant and devouring. His kisses, as imperious as his nature, were demanding and powerful. Moonlight bathed them in a soft, white glow, the beauty beside him like jade. Held in his arms, in the intimacy of their bed, it was only natural for them to gravitate closer. Cheng An Ya was lost in the intoxication of his kisses, only conscious of her earlobes being teased and sucked upon, the hot breath spiraling into her ear canal. This heat seemed to travel through the ear canal to her central nervous system, then plunge downwards. A restless heat awoke in her lower abdomen, embarrassingly intense. This sensation was somewhat unfamiliar, yet also known, a reminder of that day and night in the desert castle, where she had felt such heat countless times. Her fingertips seemed drained of strength, melting into a pool of spring water in his arms. Her cheeks were flushed like blooming roses, her eyes sultry as silk. Completely at his mercy. "An Ya..." His low, husky voice rose slowly, his breath scorching her delicate neck, painting her snowy skin with a blush of pink. Wet, hot kisses trailed lower, fingers clumsily undoing her clothing. When a wound was nudged, Ye Sanshao grunted, pausing briefly. Cheng An Ya, her mind clouded with desire, snapped to clarity, her gaze clearing as she stopped Ye Sanshao's head, "Ah Chen, stop, your hands and feet are still recovering." "It's nothing," Ye Sanshao dismissed her concern, indifferent to his own wounds. He was about to tear open Cheng An Ya's clothing when she quickly sat up, only to be held down by him, "Stay still." "Enough, we're not dead yet; there's no need to rush in the next day or two." Cheng An Ya mocked him. Both men and women, once they've tasted desire, find it hard to let goâ€”especially someone like Ye Sanshao, emblematic of passion. But even passion must be tempered with reason. "What if you take the lead?" Ye Sanshao, undeterred, suggestively blinked, his eyes alight with eager anticipation, looking forward to Cheng An Ya taking the initiative. Her face flushed even brighter red. She pushed against his shoulder, signaling for him to back down, "I wouldn't know where to begin." "I can guide you." "..." Cheng An Ya's face grew hotter. Ye Sanshao leaned in and whispered in her ear, causing her nearly to kick him off the bed, her face burning with embarrassment, "You... pervert, forget it." Ye Sanshao suddenly leaned in, kissing her deeply. Cheng An Ya struggled briefly, then heard the clatter of cups and plates. They both turned to see two figuresâ€”one larger, one smallerâ€”attempting a hasty retreat. Ye Wei and Xiao Naibao turned around slowly, Ye Wei taking in the sight of her sister-in-law with swollen, red lips and a face flushed with the bloom of spring, her eyes enchanting, and her brother, unsatisfied and fierce-eyed... It was the first time she truly understood the thrill of interrupting someone's private moment... Exhilarating. Xiao Naibao, the picture of propriety, waved cheerfully. Ye Wei chimed in, "Big brother, sister-in-law, your stamina is impressive, very impressive... Continue, continue, we'll come back later..." "Yeah, continue, continue..." Xiao Naibao parroted. Neither of them showed any sign of moving, instead holding a tray and innocently watching the scene unfold. Cheng An Ya, had she not been concerned about Ye Sanshao's injuries, might have kicked him off the bed by now. How embarrassing... Oh, to be struck down by lightning at this moment! This was the feeling of being caught in the act... "You two have no sense of decorum," Ye Sanshao snorted coldly, finally getting off Cheng An Ya. Fortunately, they hadn't progressed to the point of tearing off her clothes; otherwise, they would have been in for quite a show. Ye Wei remained silent. Big brother, you can't blame us for your eagerness. Who in their right mind would think of such things after lying down for so many days, with such severe injuries? It's your own fierce nature; you can't fault us. Originally, she and Ning Ning had carefully timed their visit. Neither had eaten all day, and Ye Wei had someone prepare a light, easily digestible meal to send over, out of consideration for her brother and sister-in-law's well-being, to save them the hassle of summoning someone. Who could have expected to walk in on such a scene? Xiao Naibao was equally taken aback. Though he clearly understood his father's prolonged hunger, he hadn't anticipated such ferocity. He even considered that if his father's hands and feet were incapacitated, he might let mommy take the lead, which was rather... corrupting to the pure hearts of minors, leaving Xiao Naibao somewhat conflicted. "Big brother, here, have some ice milk to cool down," Ye Wei offered, presenting the tray of drinks, porridge, and dishes with a mischievous smile, beckoning her brother to come and quench his fire. Indeed, a man left wanting can be a fearsome thing. Cheng An Ya overcame her embarrassment and thought little of it. With the Ye family, one needed a resilient heart, and such a minor incident wasn't enough to unsettle her. Thankfully, her clothes were not disheveled; otherwise, it would have been a true loss of face. "Mommy, I can finally hug my treasure." Ning Ning set down the tray, ignoring his father's jealous stare, and leaped into Cheng An Ya's arms, clinging to her without letting go, "Mommy..." "Such a good child." Cheng An Ya laughed, casually pinching Ning Ning's cheeks, planting a big kiss on his face, Ning Ning's smile radiating joy. "Mommy, you smell really nice, no wonder daddy always loves to nibble on you." Xiao Naibao rotated his head, and Cheng An Ya's embarrassment peaked, her hand coming down on the back of his head, "Are you looking for trouble?" "What a violent reaction." Xiao Naibao chuckled, pulling Cheng An Ya to the dining table, "Mommy, it's been a long time since you've tasted your baby's cooking, hasn't it? I prepared everything myself." Ye Sanshao had already begun to devour his meal voraciously. His hunger was profound, stemming from an emptiness beyond mere foodâ€”a deep-seated yearning for the closeness of his family after such a lengthy separation. Chapter 386: Parting Ways With the virus neutralized, it was time to discuss their departure from Riyadh. Bai Ye, Ye Wei, and Shi Yi had deliberated; they must return to Rome and escalate their efforts to swiftly resolve the grudge between Prince William and Chu Li. The primary objective was to tackle the Mafia. It seemed that Prince William was likely being manipulated by Louis to weaken the first terrorist organization and distract them. They couldn't afford a prolonged conflict with Prince Williamâ€”it would be counterproductive. Bai Ye had been in touch with Chu Li, who would mobilize the first terrorist organization's global influence after finalizing matters in Rome. They intended to exploit international dynamics to force Prince William into submission. At such a pivotal moment, Bai Ye doubted William would choose mutual destruction over a quarrel with Chu Li. This was the most expedient solution. Ye Wei and Shi Yi also had their missions. They needed to locate the whereabouts of the Mo Brothers and Louis. "Daddy, Mommy, may I go with Bai Ye this time?" Xiao Naibao inquired. He and Ye Wei had sought out his parents for this very request. If it hadn't been for the recent events, Xiao Naibao would have already endeavored to join the first terrorist organization. Presented with an ideal opportunity to hone his abilities, he was keen not to miss out. He was determined to follow this path to the end and knew he had much to learn, away from the protective embrace of his parents. Above all, he was driven by the need to avenge Nuo Nuo. He couldn't let Louis or Grey Wolf off the hook. Ye Sanshao had no objections, subtly nodding to suggest that Xiao Naibao needed to convince his mother, Cheng An Ya. "Mommy, what do you think?" Xiao Naibao turned to Cheng An Ya. "I know you've just recovered, and it may seem premature to discuss this, but please, grant me this one indulgence, okay?" Cheng An Ya leaned back, gazing deeply at Xiao Naibao, momentarily speechless. Xiao Naibao met her gaze with silent determination. Cheng An Ya sighed internally. What point was there in stopping him now? The decision to let her son spread his wings had been made during her own flight. She recognized that she couldn't equip him with the skills he needed for growth; that was a task for others. "If you're set on this, I have no objections." Cheng An Ya eventually yielded. Ye Wei breathed a sigh of relief. Convincing Cheng An Ya might have once been challenging, but now it seemed straightforward. She mused whether to thank Louis for imparting such a profound lesson on Cheng An Ya. "Mommy, you're the best." Xiao Naibao embraced Cheng An Ya tightly, "Thank you, Mommy." Cheng An Ya kissed her cherished son, "Do what you feel is right. You've matured, and Mommy trusts your judgment." The ordeal had prompted growth in both of them. It was the moment for her to release her grip. A son is akin to a kite in the sky; a mother is the string that anchors him. Without slack, he'll never explore beyond his current horizon. Only by loosening the string can he ascend higher and farther. The distance he covers is immaterial, as long as he does not fall. Should he drift far, she can always reel him back in. Ye Sanshao observed the mother and son duo, his expression softening with contentment. Meeting Cheng An Ya, loving her, and having such an exceptional son were the greatest blessings of his life. These were boons he had cultivated over multiple lifetimes, and he treasured them. "Dad, Mom, what about you two?" Xiao Naibao asked, concern lacing his voice, "Are you returning to City A?" Ye Sanshao nodded, "I need to head back. I've been away for a month. Lin Da and Tang Si are anxious. We three must strategize our offensive against the Mafia. Louis's next move might be to take over North America, with Dragon Gate squarely in his crosshairs." Xiao Naibao nodded, his grip on Cheng An Ya's hand tightening. He ventured, "Mommy, why not remain here in Riyadh? Su Man's residence is a sanctuary, a fortress. With Su Man here, you're out of harm's way. Once everything settles, you could then return to City A. Wouldn't that be wise?" Cheng An Ya shook her head, "No, I want to go back with you. There's no room for negotiation." Xiao Naibao recognized his mother's firm stance. He glanced at Ye Sanshao, who responded with a comforting smile. "This time, she'll be under my watch every second. We won't let history repeat itself." Moreover, Dragon Gate's assassins would be on a 24-hour vigil, ready to defend them. They wouldn't repeat their previous oversight. Louis would find it daunting to even get close to City A now. "It's a sound plan," Ye Wei analyzed calmly. "Staying with Third Brother or here with Su Man doesn't change much. City A is currently a haven, while Riyadh might prove riskier. Even if they fear Su Man, if Third Sister-in-law were alone, Louis might take a desperate gamble." "Exactly," Xiao Naibao agreed, holding Cheng An Ya's hand firmly. "Mommy, I won't let you be frightened again." Before Cheng An Ya could express her thanks, Ye Sanshao's punch connected with Xiao Naibao, who clutched his throbbing head, glaring at Ye Sanshao with a sense of injustice. "Dad, are you trying to dumb me down?" "Those are my words. When did you start stealing my lines?" Ye Sanshao glared, narrowing his eyes, "You little rascal, my wife doesn't need your protection." Xiao Naibao pouted subtly, repeating his earlier sentiment. Mom is the Most Important of All, and being her Guardian Deity is his duty. Who let Dad be absent for all these years? It's hardly fair to cut in line now. He wisely kept these thoughts to himself. Cheng An Ya rolled her eyes and playfully mirrored Xiao Naibao's earlier punch, "Be quiet." Ye Wei couldn't help but laugh. "Rebellious, aren't we?" Ye Sanshao feigned a striking pose, but Cheng An Ya was unfazed, ignoring him as she spoke to Ye Wei, "Wei Wei, I entrust Ning Ning to you. Look after him well, please." "Third Sister-in-law, don't worry. He's clever and cunning; he'll stay out of trouble." Xiao Naibao smiled humbly. "Now that we've decided, I'll make arrangements for the plane," Ye Wei said. "Third Sister-in-law, if you feel any discomfort, inform Su Man right away. He assured us there won't be any danger for now." "I understand, no worries," Cheng An Ya responded. "An Ya is detoxified, isn't she?" Ye Sanshao's voice wavered, his heart racing, as he locked his intense gaze on Cheng An Ya, a flicker of alarm crossing his features. "Didn't Third Sister-in-law tell you? She's cleared the toxins, but the little one inside hasn't shown any signs yet." Ye Wei spoke before Cheng An Ya could intervene. Ye Sanshao was shell-shocked. Chapter 387: A Father-Son Conversation Ye Sanshao required almost ten minutes to digest the implications of Ye Wei's words. By the time he collected himself, Ye Wei and Ning Ning had already left, affording him and Cheng An Ya a moment alone. As he returned to the present, Cheng An Ya had already consumed her second cup of hot tea. Was he stupefied with happiness, or with anger? Cheng An Ya mused with curiosity. Although the child's arrival was unexpected and not part of their initial plans, it filled her with immense joy. And what about him? Considering his deep affection for Xiao Naibao, Cheng An Ya surmised he would also be delighted about the child. Nonetheless, the future father's reaction time was remarkably delayed. She nearly nudged him to elicit some reaction, his unchanging expression having lasted too long; while his face might not tire, she grew weary of it. "Pregnant?" "Yes, from that night in the desert." Cheng An Ya stated with composure. Suddenly, her wrist was seized tightly, pulling her into his warm embrace. His large hand pressed her back against his chest as he bent down, his lips claiming hers in a commanding kiss. His kiss was possessive, his tongue prying her lips apart, delving deep into her mouth, almost reaching her throat, caressing every tender spot within, insatiable in his tasting and plundering. Amidst the stormy embrace, she naturally responded in kind, lacking any resistance to him. Ye Sanshao pinned her hands behind her back, angling them to better suit his fervent, vigorous kisses. Although not their first kiss, Ye Sanshao had never been one for gentleness. This level of forcefulness was unprecedented, and she could taste the faint hint of blood from their pressing embrace. She sighed inwardly; he would never learn gentleness. As he kissed her relentlessly, robbing her of breath, Cheng An Ya slightly turned her head to escape his scorching kiss. Unappeased, he continued to kiss her cheek and earlobe, his breath hot on her neck, igniting a warmth within her belly that unsettled her. Her cheeks flushed with a light pink hue. Then, Ye Sanshao turned her face back to his and kissed her again, this time with considerably more tenderness. As her gaze swept across the room, the soft white light outlined the man whose eyebrows now seemed to harbor a softness like gentle water. In that moment, she felt an overwhelming tranquility, as if eternal. Content, she acknowledged they expressed joy differently, but she secretly admitted she liked Ye Sanshao's direct approach. Her heart brimmed with sweetness, clearly delighted about the child. If only they could keep it, how wonderful that would be, she thought. She couldn't help but wonder about Ye Sanshao's reaction seven years ago if he'd known about Xiao Naibao. Likely, he would have coldly commanded an abortion, the difference between emotional warmth and coldness was stark. "An Ya, I'm very happy," Ye Sanshao eventually spoke after a long pause, his chin resting atop her head, his voice a soft murmur. Cheng An Ya smiled, her heart echoing his happiness. In Xiao Naibao's room. During the day, Xiao Naibao closely monitored the situation with Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and others, strategizing with Chu Li. The rest of his time was spent absorbed in computer technology. He had to admit, he was not yet on par with the Mo brothers. When facing a barrier, advancing further is exceedingly challenging. Scoring a perfect 100 on a test leaves no room for improvement; the only difference is the perfection of execution. Sometimes, one must exert extra effort. Xiao Naibao was luckier than most; a prodigy, destined to surpass others, overcoming challenges with ease. Though not yet at Mo Ye and Mo Jue's level, he could discern the veracity of their information. With more time, he was sure he could outmatch the brothers and become the ultimate king in this domain. Ye Sanshao found him still at work upon arrival. "Daddy?" Xiao Naibao paused his work, glancing at the clockâ€”it was past midnight. "Daddy, why aren't you asleep?" "What about you? You're also awake. What are you working on?" Ye Sanshao sat beside Xiao Naibao, quickly understanding the situation with a look at the computer screen, and gently ruffled his son's hair. "Don't push yourself too hard." "It's fine." Xiao Naibao smiled. "I'm sparring with the Mo brothers. I'm not tired; in fact, I'm invigorated. Daddy, I'll soon surpass them, and then taking down Louis will be easy." Plagued by insomnia, he was haunted by dreams of Xu Nuo, a fiery rose, her laughter unreachable. Awakening to desolate loneliness, he loathed this sensation and barely slept, relying on sedatives. This provided ample time to challenge the Mo brothers. Ye Sanshao smiled. "Daddy believes in you." "Why aren't you with Mommy?" "She's asleep," Ye Sanshao replied, glancing at his son who smiled knowingly. "Daddy, do you want to talk?" Otherwise, why would Daddy seek him out so late? "Be cautious in everything as you leave us this time, understand? Regarding Louis, I know you despise him, but don't let vengeance blind you, or else you'll lose direction," Ye Sanshao cautioned. He always harbored unease; Cheng An Ya felt their son's change, and he too perceived it. Despite Xiao Naibao's innocence and charm, his nature had altered. He worried that the boy's deep-seated hatred would ultimately injure himself. How profound his current hatred for Louis was and how intense his desire to kill matched the potential satisfaction upon achieving his goal and the subsequent confusion that would ensue. Obsession always has its consequences. Once his mission was complete, what would sustain him? Xu Nuo wouldn't return to life, and his heartache wouldn't heal. He feared his son might wander too far down the path of vengeance and suffer for it. This was a lesson from his life. "Daddy, I don't understand what you're saying." Xiao Naibao chuckled with mature grace, his youthful fingers rhythmically tapping the keyboard, his gaze drifting outside, away from Ye Sanshao's. How could he not understand? Yet, his inner turmoil was something no one else could comprehend. Without experiencing loss, one cannot fathom such heart-wrenching despair. Sometimes, he would stand on the balcony, staring at the Riyadh sky, pondering if destroying the Mafia would diminish the hatred in his heart. His heart had toughened. "Do you truly not understand?" Ye Sanshao questioned, his voice laden with concern. His son was too clever, too mature for his age. Their father-son relationship had always been akin to friends and family. He had never spoken so seriously with Xiao Naibao before, nor had he ever been angry with him. This son was impeccable. He wouldn't provoke anger, was obedient and affectionate, intelligent and charming. He had no faults to correct; his thoughts were more meticulous than anyone's, careful and understanding. Because of his extreme intelligence, his stubbornness was all the more alarming. Xiao Naibao remained silent; his young face had shed its childlike innocence, his profile enshrouded in darkness, lacking the gentle elegance of daylight or the sweet charm he showed Cheng An Ya. His presence was cold and intimidating, his thoughts swirling in his eyes like a fierce spirit lurking within. The room fell silent. The moon over Riyadh rarely appeared full, always missing a piece, its light casting a chill that penetrated the soul. "Xiao Naibao, have you grown so much that you no longer heed my words?" Ye Sanshao's voice contained a hint of repressed anger. His son's silence confirmed his suspicions. "Daddy, I'm aware of my boundaries." Xiao Naibao spoke softly, his voice carrying a heavy undertone. Too much malice was detrimental. He did intend to unleash his fury. What did it matter if he was merciless? But... "If you're punishing yourself, Xu Nuo's death becomes meaningless," Ye Sanshao spoke solemnly. "If it were your mommy, she wouldn't want me to become a man only capable of hate, without knowing love." Unfamiliar with love? Perhaps. They say that long-held hatred can make one forget how to love. Even Louis' death might not quench his thirst for vengeance. But after that, whom would he hate? For the first time, Xiao Naibao saw Ye Chen in a new light, his image towering in his heart. That hand on his shoulder felt immensely supportive. "Daddy, I understand." Ye Sanshao patted Xiao Naibao's shoulder, his words filled with earnest hope. "I truly hope you understand and swiftly emerge from the shadows." With that, he stood and left. Xiao Naibao watched Ye Sanshao's retreating figure vanish at the door, his thoughts a whirlwind. Since Xu Nuo's passing, this was the first time someone had conversed with him like this. His feelings were a mix of shock and anger, but that man was his father, and anger could not be sustained. Slightly shocked, it turned out his father had always seen right through him, comprehending his inner turmoil without a word. And somewhat moved, because he realized that no matter how old or smart a child is, in their parents' eyes, they remain transparent, with every emotion laid bare. Previously, he thought the absence of a father didn't matter; he could ensure Cheng An Ya's lifelong contentment. After getting to know Ye Chen, he had come to like this father. He had strived to unite them, seeking a complete family. In truth, for Xiao Naibao, a father meant having one more person to cherish and one more person to care for. At that moment, he didn't grasp the warmth filling his heart. It wasn't until years later, reflecting on the past, that he recognized the significant role a father plays in a son's life. Subconsciously, he heeded his father's words, avoiding a misguided path.
