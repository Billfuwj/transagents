Chapter 805: The Final Story 'At the East School?' Zhou Tu hesitated for a brief moment. Warnings from both seniors and teachers about nearing the East Campus had not been scarce. They had skirted around giving explicit reasons, yet their tones spelled out clear danger—it was a place teeming with unseen threats. 'Your understanding of the East School is marred by misconceptions. In reality, it's hardly different from here. It's the methodologies in managing the two campuses that diverge. Students there are immersed in tangible horrors, while you are cocooned within a facade of bliss,' Chen Ge clarified, his gaze piercing into Zhou Tu. 'In a way, they might be closer to hope than you are—they know who they are and have glimpsed ways to liberation.' Chen Ge was not deceiving Zhou Tu. Every student, regardless of whether they were from the East or West School, was ensnared by the school’s confines. Students of the West School were trapped in a cycle of altered memories, endlessly reliving a life fabricated by the puppeteers behind the curtain. Conversely, the East School's students, aware of their dire circumstances, were desperately seeking scapegoats to facilitate their escape. 'The students of the East School are closer to hope? I've been led to believe that it's the rejected scraps of the West School that end up there,' Zhou Tu expressed, still not entirely convinced. 'An institution that sees its students as disposable is fundamentally flawed,' Chen Ge countered, his finger gesturing towards the daunting wall separating the campuses. 'Do you know why that wall was erected?' 'Why indeed?' 'The wall exists because the school fears the unpredictable. They've tried to sculpt human nature, forgetting that it's the most intricate thing in this world. Trauma leaves its mark, and forgetting doesn't erase the scars. The school’s plans are fated to fail because you cannot obliterate what has been.' The profoundness of Chen Ge's words left the club members in a state of confusion, their understanding teetering on the edge of realization. The truths he spoke of seemed just beyond their grasp. Youthful curiosity, once ignited, is difficult to extinguish. Chen Ge's stark unveiling of their school's grim realities further fanned the flames of the club members' fascination. 'Should we make our way to the East School now? To be honest, I find it hard to believe that my dreamt-of art studio would be there,' Zhou Tu voiced his doubt in a low murmur. 'The timing is not yet favorable,' Chen Ge replied, throwing a backward glance at his shadow. The dark shadow in Dormitory 413 lay dormant, and yet, it was undergoing a subtle transformation. One could notice, with a careful look, that Chen Ge's shadow was unlike any other's—black as pitch, seemingly swallowing any light that dared to approach. This enigmatic shadow, burgeoning with potential, was a harbinger of strength for Chen Ge. Once it woke, he planned to lead the students back to the East School, their sights set on the isolated apparitions that wandered its grounds. This strategy would bolster his own forces and muddy the stagnant waters of the school, shielding the movements of another 'assailant' within the academy. 'We are currently gathering our strength. Before the overseer of the school notices this insignificant speck, I must prepare an arsenal of defenses.' Chen Ge's gaze then shifted to Wang Yicheng, whose backstory was still shrouded in mystery to the club members. 'Our next destination shall be Wang Yicheng's dormitory.' 'My dormitory?' Wang Yicheng responded with an odd mix of reticence and dismissal. 'There's no need; there's nothing of interest in my dorm.' 'Your voice rises, speech accelerates, and eyes wander as you speak—you're not adept at deception,' Chen Ge observed, his hand resting on Wang Yicheng's shoulder. 'What's causing your hesitation? What is it that you dread we might uncover?' 'I...' Wang Yicheng fumbled for words, ultimately averting his gaze. 'Never mind. Let's go then.' 'Alright.' Wang Yicheng's quarters were located in Dormitory 413 of the West School, sharing the same number as Lin Sisi's accommodations in the East School. Though the dorm numbers were identical, the occupancy was not: in the West School, all beds but the fourth were filled, while in the East School, only the fourth bed was claimed, the others left vacant. 'Keep the secrets of our society to yourselves, and tread carefully. This school houses benevolent teachers like myself and those who are less forgiving,' Chen Ge advised, a constant undercurrent of vigilance in his voice. The commotion they had caused in the Laboratory Building had not gone unnoticed; the school authorities were most likely conducting their investigation. 'Time is of the essence. Once we've inspected Dormitory 413, we must lay low to elude attention.' The West School boasted four male dormitory buildings, vastly outnumbering the student population of the East School. The halls were alive with the bustle of peak hours—sounds of washing, tumbling basins, and conversations melded into a cacophony. 'This building resembles the one in the East School quite closely.' Chen Ge projected an air of nonchalance, trailing behind the four students into the structure. The dormitory supervisor's quarters were shut, yet a woman in her fifties hummed contentedly from within, her demeanor seemingly cheery. Next to the window, a notice was displayed, clearly prohibiting the use of high-power electrical devices in the dormitories and barring students from cooking on their own. 'I recall the notice in the East School's dormitory—it warned of recent violent incidents and strictly forbade students from exiting their rooms after lights out.' A mere wall apart, yet the two sides were worlds apart, akin to the realms divided by the 'door.' Crossing the corridor, Chen Ge and the club members reached the entrance to Dormitory 413. 'This room is no different from the others,' Wang Yicheng insisted as he unlocked the door. Once inside, his presence seemed to dissolve; his dorm mates continued their activities, paying him no heed. As Wang Yicheng advanced, the student sleeping by the door abruptly lifted his mosquito net and glared. 'How many times must I repeat myself? Shut the door behind you. Has your hearing failed alongside your leg?' The student's voice was tinged with contempt, his animosity towards Wang Yicheng palpable. 'He refrained from closing the door because we were following. If you seek an apology, we can furnish one on his behalf. However, what kind of apology do you prefer?' Chen Ge interposed, holding the doorknob and entering. His eyes scanned the other occupants of the room. Confronted by Chen Ge, the Mosquito Net Man's defiance waned. He fell into silence, drawing his net down with a glower. 'Teacher Bai, this is the unoccupied fourth bed, relegated to storing luggage,' Wang Yicheng pointed out, where an assortment of bags was piled. In contrast to his dorm mates, Wang Yicheng's possessions were tidily stowed beneath his own bed, while the others had relegated their clutter to the vacant fourth bed. Chen Ge had a peculiar kinship with the fourth bed, having once occupied a similarly numbered berth in the East School. Nearing the bed, he noted that although it lay unclaimed, it was dressed with bedding and a comforter, now sullied by the scattered belongings and discarded items. Zhang Ya Extra Chapter: Let's Get Our Marriage Certificate (Free Birthday Special Chapter) Dark clouds shrouded the city, making the sky seem almost within reach. Li Man stood by the window, watching the rain trace its path down the glass. The clock on the wall ticked away, as the somber march of time quietly flowed within the small office. "5:30, time to wrap up for the day." Li Man stretched, moved the succulents from the windowsill indoors, and approached her desk. She stored the sign with 'Marriage Registration Office' into the drawer, casting a glance at the bold inscription on the wall—'Governed by Law, Civil in Service.' "With such heavy rain, it's unlikely anyone will come to register for marriage today." Humming, Li Man began to tidy the office. Alone in the quiet Marriage Registration Office, she noted that the staff next door at the Divorce Registration Office had already left early. "Hello, is this where marriage certificates are processed?" The door opened, and a mature, magnetic male voice echoed from the entrance. With such a nice voice, the man must be good-looking. Li Man looked up to see a man in a black raincoat at the Marriage Registration Office's entrance. He had an average look but carried an indescribable aura. "Yes, you... want to apply for a marriage certificate?" Li Man scrutinized the man. It was unusual to see someone in a raincoat, with a hefty climbing bag, applying for a marriage certificate. "Yes, I've booked an appointment online for today." "Let me check. What's your name?" "Chen Ge." Li Man found Chen Ge's appointment in the system: "I'm about to finish, so let's make this quick. Did you bring everything? Household registration books for both, ID cards, and proof that you two aren't related by direct lineage or within the third degree of collateral consanguinity?" "I've brought it all." The man opened his backpack, searching through it. Li Man faintly heard a cat's meow and curiously peeked into the man's bag. It was stuffed with a repeater, comic books, a rag doll, ballpoint pens, and a large white cat. "I appreciate your patience." Chen Ge handed over two household registration books and two ID cards to Li Man: "Everything's here. Her family approves of me." "You've prepared thoroughly." After registering Chen Ge's information, Li Man was ready to enter the woman's details. She noticed the ID card's magnetic strip was non-functional. She glanced at the name on the ID and realized something. Chen Ge had come to register for marriage, all documents prepared, even bringing a cat, but his girlfriend was missing. "Hold on, sir." Li Man paused: "You're here to marry, right?" "Yes." "Where is your girlfriend? You can't get married alone." Li Man forced a smile: "Both must be present to register." The clock ticked louder, the rain intensified, and Chen Ge slightly pursed his lips, looking at Li Man: "She's here, right behind me." The rain battered the window, the air inside turned heavy. "Sir, please don't joke. To marry, both must be present; I can't help you otherwise." Li Man clutched her chest, feeling suddenly breathless. "She is here. We are inseparable; where I am, she is." Chen Ge's eyes were clear, his tone insistent. Li Man held the demagnetized ID, considering a possibility. She flipped open the woman's household registration book to the page with her name, stamped with a death declaration from the police, dated years ago. "Sir... " Li Man hesitated, touched by Chen Ge's persistence. Her eyes swept over the items in Chen Ge's backpack. Were these the girl's belongings, treasured memories of their times together? Was the cat hers? In a moment, Li Man understood why Chen Ge brought so many things to the office and why he insisted she was with him. Her eyes stung. Holding the girl's ID, Li Man struggled to speak, to either console Chen Ge or reveal the cruel truth. Her lips parted, but the words wouldn't come. She looked at Chen Ge, childlike in his earnestness, her emotions tangled. She managed a smile: "Sir, you must have deeply loved her. How did you meet?" "She pursued me; her love letter was my first." Chen Ge's gaze became distant with memories: "Our first date was at an abandoned school." "An abandoned school? That's an unusual first date." "West City Private Academy, that's where her obsessions and past lie. I stood in the hall she once danced in, with my back to the mirror, my back to her, as we opened our hearts to each other." Li Man listened, envisioning the scene. A serene night, two souls in an empty school recalling the past; a once lively place reduced to echoes, where they shared a moment of solace, back to back—a love story so hauntingly beautiful. "Our second date was at a psychiatric hospital, she in a resplendent red dress, radiant and bold." "A psychiatric hospital?" "Due to my parents, that day I..." "I understand, sorry." Li Man apologized, not wanting to probe into his wounds, perhaps another hidden sorrow. "Our third date was in a building. I cornered a man who had wronged her in an elevator, teaching him a lesson he'd never forget." "You truly cherished your girlfriend. She must have been thrilled." "She was right there with me." Chen Ge's tone warmed, recalling the elevator wrapped in black hair within the Supernatural Tales Association Building. "That scene must have been romantic, heartwarming." Li Man now saw Chen Ge's devotion. "Our fourth date was in the Forensic Medicine Academy's Underground Morgue. She was injured but did not tell me. She sat quietly with me, even seemed to hug me secretly." Chen Ge's voice, attractive and mature, recounted the past, making Li Man overlook the unusual location. "Our fifth date was on the rooftop of a small town in a downpour, much like today." Compared to the previous locales, this setting seemed almost normal: "Did you confess to her then?" Chen Ge nodded: "At the town's pinnacle, I shouted my love to the world. Nothing is more romantic than vowing to never part." "Wow." Li Man had heard many stories, but none shook her as Chen Ge's did, knowing the ending from the death certificate: "What happened after?" "Then..." Chen Ge inhaled slowly: "She fell asleep, a long slumber before she awakes. So I wait for her." The death certificate's sting felt anew, tears brimming in Li Man's eyes. She lowered her head, pretending to search, wiping tears behind the computer. She knew the story's end. Silence fell, broken by Chen Ge's hand resting on an empty chair, as if his girlfriend were there: "Our sixth date..." What followed mattered little. Li Man understood Chen Ge had locked himself in a cage of love, believing his girlfriend remained. Because of love, he denied her departure. Hands clasped, white-knuckled, Li Man yearned to share the truth but couldn't. She hid behind the computer, filled out the form, wanting to grant Chen Ge his dream. But pressing 'confirm' yielded an error—no record of the girl. Reality chilled Li Man. She eyed Chen Ge's reminiscing face, biting her lip: "Sir, our data is incomplete, systems upgrading. I can't process this now. Please return in a week." Li Man wished to help, even to craft a symbolic, non-binding red book. "Alright, thank you." Chen Ge stood, collected his belongings, and walked out. At the door, he lifted his raincoat as if sheltering someone: "Zhang Ya, stay close; the rain's heavy." Li Man saw clearly—no one was under that raincoat with Chen Ge. Watching his retreating form, she wiped a tear: "Perhaps this is love—falling for you, staying true to you, heart bound to you, ending with you." Chapter 806: The Possible 'Door' "Why are all these things piled on the bed? If the student from bed four returns at night, where will he sleep?" Chen Ge murmured as if to himself: "Is he supposed to sleep in someone else's bed?" Since his arrival, the students in Dormitory 413 had cast curious glances his way, inevitably drawn to someone clad in the school's work attire. "Are you a faculty member?" inquired a lanky student from the bed across bed four. His thick glasses gave him a peculiar look: "Bed four is empty. We're just making efficient use of the space by storing our stuff there." "A bed all made up and you claim it's unoccupied?" Chen Ge responded with a sly grin: "Maybe you just can't see its occupant. Be mindful when you sleep; don't roll too much, or you might find an unexpected bedfellow." Standing by bed four, Chen Ge began moving all the belongings to the floor: "This is preposterous, taking liberties even with a ghost's bed." "Hey! Don't touch our things!" The Mosquito Net Man once again stuck his head through the doorway. "I'm doing you a favor. This bed has its own master, who has always lingered in this school." Chen Ge was intrigued by the discoveries in East Campus's Dormitory 413 and equally anticipated what West Campus's counterpart might hold. "You're aware of the legend of Dormitory 413's bed four?" The bespectacled student's face tensed: "That was just to spook Wang Yicheng. You're not taking it seriously, are you?" "Truth or myth, you'll know once you've had an encounter." After emptying the bed, Chen Ge stripped off the pillowcases and duvet cover to ensure nothing was concealed. "You say there's someone in bed four, and yet you casually handle their possessions?" The tall, skinny student adjusted his glasses, visibly annoyed with Chen Ge, perhaps because he had sided with Wang Yicheng, which was contrary to their dorm's vibe. "Doesn't bother me. I'm not lodging in this dorm. Should he take offense, you'll be his first port of call." Chen Ge's approach was a stark contrast to the students' idea of a teacher, but he was a fake and had no concerns about pretenses. Peeling back the mattress, he halted the quarrel, his gaze locking onto the bed plank. There, at the edge near the wall, were five bloodied fingerprints. "These aren't part of your prank, are they?" Chen Ge scraped a bit of the dried blood with his nail and sniffed it; it seemed to be coagulated blood. Why would there be fresh blood on bed four? "Teacher, what's that?" Wang Yicheng, who had only just spotted the blood fingerprints due to their concealed placement, spoke up. "Dried red paint. I've dabbled in painting; I'm quite familiar with this scent." Chen Ge shot a glance at the other dorm residents: "Someone here enjoys their pranks." Not dwelling on the topic, he pulled out Lin Sisi's phone for illumination and peered beneath the bed board. Much like a scene from East Campus, there was a message carved beneath this bed. Tiny letters, likely etched with a knife point by point. "Why does nobody speak to me?" "Why does everyone overlook me?" "I didn't deceive them! There truly are ghosts! I genuinely saw a ghost in the restroom!" "This place is perilous! Why will no one believe me?" The words triggered a sense of recognition in Chen Ge. He read on and encountered a name all too familiar. "I, Lin Sisi, swear on my life, the restroom is indeed haunted! It's true, they're watching me!" "I realize everyone despises me and wants to joke around. I'm delighted, I get it, but there are genuinely ghosts in the restroom! I wasn't lying this time!" Each character on the bed plank was etched with intense effort; some spots were even stained with blood, possibly from the carver's hand being cut by accident. "Were these also left by Lin Sisi? Yet, his narrative doesn't quite match the Ghost School Diary's account!" Chen Ge quickly picked up on the discrepancy. The diary described Lin Sisi as a troublemaker who enjoyed pranking others and was eventually frightened to death by his classmates in a restroom ruse. But the inscriptions told a different tale, suggesting Lin Sisi wasn't scared to death by his classmates but had indeed witnessed something in the restroom. Terrifying upon careful thought, Chen Ge's eyes narrowed as he questioned which account to trust. The owner of bed four was without a doubt Lin Sisi, in both East and West Campuses. "If this dorm has replicated everything from memory, then these carvings must be authentic. But Lin Sisi is dead; how could he return to inscribe these words?" He paused, surveying the room's occupants. The dorm, now with bed four vacant, mirrored the past. Lin Sisi met his end, leaving bed four empty, with five others still residing in the dorm. Aware of the restroom's genuine haunting, Lin Sisi returned postmortem to deliver a warning, leaving various signs unnoticed by all. "It's no surprise he etched such phrases. As a ghost, naturally, the living are blind to him." Chen Ge was uncertain whether these five were the same individuals who had lived with Lin Sisi. If not, they were deeply unfortunate. In East Campus, every new arrival was dubbed Lin Sisi, a harbinger of doom and a curse, targeted by all the fierce ghosts. Yet, from another perspective, for the fierce ghosts seeking graduation, a scapegoat was necessary, making the name Lin Sisi a beacon of hope. "The plot thickens. A living curse is a ghost's dream. What role did Lin Sisi play in this school?" Chen Ge was sure of Lin Sisi's deep ties to the school. Even if not the master, he was definitely linked to the real owner. "If only I could find him or the prior 'Lin Sisi'." He kept reading. The carvings grew more desperate, the carver's mindset shifting from anxiety to hopelessness. "I did see a ghost, just believe me this once?" "Hear my voice, I'm here, right here!" "Fine, I've given up on your belief. Just promise me you won't visit the restroom on the teaching building's top floor! Don't forget! Never go there!" "It's too late, they've escaped..." The message beneath the bed ended abruptly, and Chen Ge could sense the utter despair of the scribe. "The restroom on the teaching building's top floor? Was that Lin Sisi's end?" Chen Ge stood motionless, his thoughts racing. The Ghost School scenario was the most intricate, expansive, and challenging mission he had encountered, with threads of clues and enigmas woven like an impenetrable fog. Untangling it all in one go was an impossibility. Chen Ge had to start from the most fundamental detail. "A 'door' doesn't just materialize out of thin air; there must be a Door Pusher. If Lin Sisi is that individual, then the likeliest place for that door's emergence would be the restroom atop the teaching building!" Chapter 807: Black Leather Shoes Chen Ge's eyes gleamed with a sharp insight; he had unearthed a crucial clue. "The Psychic Ghost School is a four-star scenario; I've never dealt with a four-star level before. None of my past encounters are applicable here. To learn more, only a direct investigation will suffice." Chen Ge contemplated the overwhelming obsession required to fabricate such an extensive nightmare, a feat not even the collaborative efforts of Doctor Gao and Zhang Ya could achieve. "Perhaps there has always been a door within that restroom, one that was inadvertently opened during the students' malicious prank on Lin Sisi." In Chen Ge's own haunted house, there was a door he had always avoided. He speculated that Lin Sisi might have found herself in a similar predicament. However, where he had sidestepped the door, Lin Sisi had unlatched it. "No matter the actuality, the restroom at the pinnacle of the teaching building calls for an inspection!" It was uncertain whether the restroom was located in the East Campus or the West Campus. To err on the side of caution, Chen Ge decided to visit restrooms in both sectors. "Let's vacate this place; accompany me to the Laboratory Building," Chen Ge resolved, having acquired enough information from beneath the bunk of Dormitory 413. Lingering in Dormitory 413 was now pointless and risked drawing the dorm residents' attention. "The Laboratory Building? But we've just..." Before Wang Yicheng could articulate his objection, Zhang Ju interjected with a gentle tug on his arm. "Obey the club leader's commands—he leads, we follow." Referencing the Laboratory Building was a strategic feint by Chen Ge. The students from Dormitory 413 had been unwelcoming; they would likely inform the dormitory manager as soon as he left. "The lights-out bell is imminent; let's swiftly gather our belongings and reconvene." After restoring the bed to its former state, Chen Ge and the Supernatural Tales Association members departed from Dormitory 413. They exited without drawing notice. Beyond the confines of the male dormitory, Chen Ge noticed numerous individuals hastening toward the Laboratory Building—a signal that something was amiss. "Should Zhu Long's mere disruption of the Dissection Table have merited such a reaction? Wouldn't the duty teacher be sufficient to address it?" Chen Ge was intrigued by the events at the Laboratory Building, but discretion overrode curiosity. Approaching now would be akin to ensnaring oneself. The preferable strategy was to circumvent it. "Teacher, should we truly venture to the Laboratory Building? We've only just returned from there." "To Building One, and let's be swift. We need to investigate before the school authorities catch on," Chen Ge instructed, leading them away from the Laboratory Building. As they proceeded, the campus grew increasingly desolate. "Have you ever heard any strange tales involving the restrooms here?" Chen Ge inquired as they walked. "Has anyone been to the restroom at the uppermost level of the teaching building?" "No," the students unanimously responded. "This institution may seem conventional, but peril is omnipresent. Once we reach our destination, you must adhere to my instructions unequivocally." They reached the teaching building, a prominent feature of the East Campus, consisting of three four-storied edifices. "Your school appears to have a particular fondness for the number 'four.'" By now, the teaching building was devoid of students; classrooms were cloaked in darkness, with only the corridor lights piercing the gloom. "This is my inaugural visit to the teaching building at such a late hour. In the absence of the daytime crowd, I hadn't anticipated how menacing it could be." Wang Yicheng's pace slackened, his expression becoming tense as he drew closer to the teaching building, as if repelled by the place. Chen Ge noticed Wang Yicheng's altered demeanor; the lame boy must have suffered through some unpleasant experiences within these classrooms. "Stay within sight. We're ascending directly to the apex. Disregard anything you might observe in the other classrooms—do not investigate them." Before entering, Chen Ge surveyed the area. Each structure featured dual staircases, with restrooms situated near the left one. "Shall we advance?" Zhou Tu struggled to comprehend Chen Ge's maneuvers. Each action seemed meticulously planned, yet their interconnectedness was elusive. Chen Ge, however, exuded an aura of profound, inscrutable wisdom, as if harboring a secret within his mind. "Don't lag behind," Zhang Ju kindly advised Zhou Tu, then aided Wang Yicheng as they entered the stairwell. "Hurry, this is a club activity." Zhu Long, with eyes bloodshot, clutched a pink women's phone, an item that oddly didn't clash with his tall stature. "I must be mad, trailing you to a school restroom in pursuit of supernatural phenomena under the cloak of night." Zhou Tu entered the stairwell with marked reluctance, and the group ascended to the top floor without pausing. The night had transformed the teaching building into a realm of eerie silence, a stark contrast to its diurnal activity. "Zhang Ju and I will scout the interior first. Zhu Long, you provide support from the middle. Zhou Tu and Wang Yicheng, stand guard outside," Chen Ge directed, his hand poised on the restroom door handle. As he was about to press down, his arm was abruptly seized. "Teacher, perhaps it would be wise not to enter..." Wang Yicheng, his pallor ghostly and beaded with sweat, stood beside Chen Ge, his pupils flickering with trepidation. "I've just recollected something dreadful that transpired right here!" "What transpired?" Chen Ge had never seen Wang Yicheng so perturbed. "I have a remote memory of being implicated in that incident. They coerced me—I was the sole one who refrained from entering this restroom, and that's why I'm still alive. The others who entered... they're no longer with us." Wang Yicheng spoke in a tumult, his voice tinged with fear. "Everyone who entered this restroom perished?" Chen Ge's touch on Wang Yicheng's hand was light. "You're a newcomer; how could you possess memories linked to this restroom?" "I don't know, it was unintentional! They compelled me! Teacher, let's depart! Please, don't open that door!" Wang Yicheng pleaded with urgency. "Having journeyed this far, I cannot retreat." Chen Ge removed Wang Yicheng's hand and pushed the restroom door open with resolve. "No! Refrain from touching that door!" Amid Wang Yicheng's shrieks, Chen Ge swung open the door, his gaze piercing into the restroom's depths. Rubber ghost masks were strewn across the floor; the walls were smeared with oil-painted handprints and facial features in hues of blood, creating a palpable sense of being watched from every direction. "Lin Sisi was subjected to her ordeal here." Chen Ge retrieved a rubber mask from the ground, ensured it was harmless, and stowed it in his backpack. Moving cautiously, he paused by the first cubicle to capture several photographs with Lin Sisi's phone. The restroom lay silent, devoid of any interlopers. "The setting appears mundane, yet an unsettling feeling suggests otherwise." Chen Ge's gaze fell upon the sealed cubicle door, instinctively pushing against it, but it remained immovable. "Could there be someone within?" He stooped to peer through the crevice beneath the cubicle door, and there, resting with foreboding intent, lay a pair of black leather shoes. Chapter 808: Roommates 'There's someone in the stall!' Chen Ge's gaze fell upon the black leather shoes, a stark reminder of Teacher Bai from the East Campus, donned in similar footwear. 'Do not approach.' Retreating a few steps, Chen Ge manoeuvred Lin Sisi's phone into the narrow opening of the stall, hastily capturing a photo. Consulting the phone's display, Chen Ge's fears were not realized; the stall was occupied solely by a pair of shoes, devoid of any 'person'. 'Lin Sisi's phone is capable of photographing fierce ghosts and other peculiar entities. Absent any anomalies in the image, it is evident that the stall is merely home to this pair of shoes. However, if no one is present, how did the door come to be locked?' Restroom stall doors are designed to lock only from the interior, and the placement of the black leather shoes suggested the presence of an unseen individual, not simply thrown inside from the exterior. 'Teacher, could it be a misperception? Who in their right mind would seek the solitude of the teaching building's top-floor restroom in the dead of night? The thought alone is unsettling.' Memories within Zhu Long were beginning to stir, nebulous and fragmented, yet they wielded influence. Undetected by the others, these recollections prompted him to distance himself from his peers, gravitating instead towards Chen Ge's presence, a signal that perhaps they shared a common thread. 'Remain here and promptly alert me should others draw near.' Chen Ge exerted force upon the stall door, resorting to violence to thrust it open. Within the confines of the narrow space, countless ghostly visages were depicted in oil paint, giving the unnerving impression of being surveilled by an invisible multitude. 'Why would there be just a pair of shoes here?' Nothing out of the ordinary was discovered in the first stall. Proceeding to the second, Chen Ge deftly employed his phone to capture an image through the gap. The photo exposed another pair of shoes residing in the second stall, though these were not the black leather of the first, but rather tattered blue sneakers. 'The positioning is identical; might there be some underlying significance?' Stall after stall, Chen Ge inspected the first six, each hosting a pair of men's shoes of disparate styles and sizes, presumably belonging to different individuals. 'The black leather shoes in the initial stall bear a striking resemblance to those worn by Teacher Bai, likely an adult size, whereas the remaining five stalls contain footwear indicative of student ownership. Could each pair of shoes be representative of a distinct individual?' 'Might the proprietors of these shoes have been the ones most antagonistic towards Lin Sisi previously?' In the realm of the spectral, fierce ghosts are distinct from the living, their very essence woven from obsessions and negative emotions, foreign to concepts like forgiveness and kindness. Independent of Lin Sisi's disposition during his lifetime, his transformation into a fierce ghost was undoubtedly accompanied by a surge of spiteful resentment. This obsession stands as one of the fundamental pillars sustaining his existence as a fierce ghost. To imprison those who tormented oneself within stalls, forcing their companionship, is a deed within the realm of likelihood for a fierce ghost, as Chen Ge surmised. 'Teacher! People are advancing towards the teaching building!' Zhou Tu, lending support to Wang Yicheng, raised his voice from the threshold of the restroom: 'They seem to be originating from the direction of the laboratory building!' 'Are they targeting us?' In haste, Chen Ge approached the final stall, instinctively brandishing his phone for a snapshot, only to be met with astonishment as he observed the seventh stall's door dismantled. 'Where is the seventh door?' Chen Ge's mind raced with theories, the most plausible being that the door related to Lin Sisi would be situated within the confines of the restroom, yet his thorough search proved fruitless. 'Stay calm, no need for alarm.' A subtle bite to his tongue was Chen Ge's method of maintaining composure, aware that those on the lower level would require time to ascend: 'Each Blood Door is paired uniquely with its Door Pusher...' Fingers tracing the frame, Chen Ge detected that the hinge of the seventh stall had been forcefully broken: 'The door to this stall has been violently burst from within!' A glance within revealed the absence of shoes in this seventh stall, only the presence of two blood-red shoeprints. The shoeprints, aligned in succession, seemed to mimic the footsteps of someone departing the enclosure. 'If each pair of shoes is symbolic of an individual, did the occupant of this last stall manage to escape?' A swift turn by Chen Ge, as his survey of the enclosure was met with an uncanny sensation—the grotesque faces adorning the walls appeared to take on a life of their own, their expressions morphing from moments prior. 'All despair and negative emotions from the West Campus have been transferred to the East Campus. The authentic 'Blood Door' is presumed to reside within the restroom at the summit of the teaching building in the East School.' Confronted with one unresolved puzzle after another, Chen Ge's brow was marked by taut veins, and he bit down on his tongue with vigor, ensuring his clarity of thought: 'I proceed step by step, ever closer to the elusive truth.' 'Teacher! They've scaled the stairs! We must find a place of concealment!' The voice of Zhou Tu was laced with urgency; a sudden onset of panic gripped him: 'The figures who have infiltrated the teaching building do not appear to be faculty or students, and they move with an odd cadence!' 'An odd cadence?' A shiver of foreboding ran through Chen Ge; he motioned to Zhang Ju and Zhu Long to make their exit: 'Which route did they take to climb the floors?' 'The corridor by the restroom!' 'Very well! We shall make our descent via the alternative path! Exercise caution, and take care that we remain unseen!' Lacking any intention of a direct confrontation, Chen Ge made for the alternate corridor, yet as he passed by Wang Yicheng, he came to an abrupt halt. His pupils narrowed, fixating on the shoes Wang Yicheng wore. 'Blue sneakers?' Wang Yicheng's footwear was an exact replica of the sneakers in the second stall of the restroom! 'The footwear in the restroom stalls—exclusively men's shoes... 'Chen Ge's mind delved into recollection, as he unearthed an unsettling correlation: the shoes within the restroom mirrored those belonging to the residents of Dormitory 413. 'With six inhabitants in Dormitory 413, and seven stalls in the teaching building's top-floor restroom, six individuals correspond to six stalls, and one stall is graced by black leather shoes, indicative of a teacher—completing the count of seven.' A crease of consternation formed on Chen Ge's brow: 'What could drive Lin Sisi to harbor such intense rancor towards his own roommates? Was it not he who ventured back to the dormitory, expressly to warn his roommates to steer clear of the restroom?' Chen Ge's fingers pressed against his temples with fervor, besieged by a myriad of considerations: 'The East Campus is engulfed in chaos and disarray, whereas the West Campus presents itself as a relic preserved within a glass vessel, eternally fixed in the days encircling school enrollment, in perpetual repetition. To decipher the truth, one must compare and contrast the identical scenes present within both the East and West Campuses.' 'The West Campus exudes an air of perfection so ethereal, it might as well be a child's dream. By comparison, the East Campus emerges as a more palpable reality.' Chen Ge's focus shifted from Wang Yicheng's shoes; a resolute decision had been made—to shepherd everyone to the East Campus. 'At this juncture, devoid of other options, I am compelled to seek out memories within the realm of dreams, to chase after the essence of truth within the fabric of reality.' Chapter 809: They Forced Me! The individuals hurrying over from the Laboratory Building had already made their way into the corridor, heading straight for the Top Floor Restroom with a purposeful pace. "Quick, let's go!" Chen Ge didn't hesitate to lift Wang Yicheng onto his back as they all hastened through the hallway to its opposite side. They took refuge in the stairwell, muting their breaths. "Teacher Bai, why are we stopping here?" "Keep an eye on the third-floor entrance. I’ll take the fourth. After they've all climbed to this level, we'll go down," Chen Ge directed, positioning himself boldly at the corridor's edge. With the aid of his Shadow Pupil, he kept vigil over the restroom. "But..." "Just do as I say." Chen Ge remained at his post by the fourth-floor stairwell entrance on the right side, monitoring the opposite side. Shortly, he distinctly heard footsteps from the left stairwell, followed by the appearance of several figures donned in white on the fourth floor. "Their attire is peculiar... entirely in white? Even down to their shoes?" A trio had ascended the stairs, all uniformly dressed in white. Apart from their garb, they shared a disturbing similarity—their faces were marred by scars. Not just minor scratches, but like Zhang Ju, their visages were marked by severe burns, creating an unsettling sight. "Are these the school's Managers?" Chen Ge speculated as he observed them enter the restroom. He then led the students down, artfully avoiding any encounter. "Teacher, what do we do next?" "We must head to East Campus," Chen Ge replied with a sense of urgency, feeling the pressure from those clad in white. "Why the panic? It feels like we're doing something clandestine," Zhou Tu commented, perplexed by the tense atmosphere around Chen Ge and the club members. "We're students of the school, and Teacher Bai, you're on the faculty. Even if the school catches us, at most we'd get a reprimand, or we might have to compensate for the damage to the Laboratory Building's Dissection Table. It shouldn't be a big deal." "Do you truly believe that a mere reprimand from the school is all we'd face if we're caught?" Chen Ge locked eyes with Zhou Tu, who looked away, unable to maintain eye contact. "You'll see once we get to East Campus." Chen Ge guided the students away from the Teaching Building, along a less-traveled path that led to the sports equipment room nearby. "Teacher, shouldn't we be making for East Campus? Why stop at the sports equipment room?" "We're here for tools. Wang Yicheng, Zhou Tu, keep watch. Everyone else, come in and grab any ropes or similar equipment you find." Chen Ge forced the door of the sports equipment room and found an assortment of jump ropes. "Teacher! The ones in white seem to be heading this way!" Zhou Tu's voice came from the doorway. He had spotted several white figures emerging from the Teaching Building and heading straight for their location. "How did they find out we're here? If their arrival at the restroom was coincidental, how did they pinpoint our presence at the sports equipment room?" Chen Ge was seized by an ominous feeling. He zipped up the bulging backpack, now too cumbersome to wear, and carried it by hand. "The sports equipment room is large; it'll take them some time to search through it. Let's leave now." Chen Ge, backpack in hand, signaled to Wang Yicheng, "Come here, I'll carry you." Though Chen Ge meant well, Wang Yicheng resisted, his eyes filled with terror like someone waking from a nightmare: "Teacher, I'm scared. Someone is calling my name. Those coming after us, they're looking for me; I can hear them!" "Tell me, when did you start hearing your name? Keep talking as we walk," Chen Ge said, picking up Wang Yicheng without hesitation, as every second counted. "Teacher! They are coming for me! If I stay with you, they'll find us for certain!" Wang Yicheng's expression was twisted with fear, his entire frame quivering. "Stop talking. You're my student; just answer my questions," Chen Ge quickened his pace, intrigued by Wang Yicheng's claims. "When you brought me to the top floor of the Teaching Building, I felt an immediate discomfort, an overwhelming urge to cry, and that corridor... it seemed uncannily familiar as if I had witnessed a terrible event there long ago." Wang Yicheng's eyes were red and swollen, his breath as labored as a beached fish gasping for air. "You're a freshman, how could the corridor seem familiar to you?" "I can't explain it... sometimes you visit a place for the first time and it feels like you've been there before. That's the sensation I'm experiencing now." Wang Yicheng’s speech was intermittent, his face ashen with dread. "And the voice, when did it start speaking to you? What did it tell you?" Chen Ge probed softly. "The moment I saw the corridor, the discomfort began. As we stood by the restroom door, an image flashed through my mind." Wang Yicheng inhaled deeply, pausing before he continued: "I have this vague memory of being in this restroom before. I was meant to lead someone very important here. His slender figure was in the restroom, filled to the brim with a variety of demons and monsters! It's the recollection of these events that caused me to resist entering with you." "Wait!" Chen Ge zeroed in on an essential detail in Wang Yicheng's story: "You were meant to lead someone important into the restroom?" "Yes, it's as though he was my best friend. I know that feeling; few have ever wanted to be my friend, but he was an exception." Wang Yicheng began hitting his own head, his memory apparently loosening: "When we were outside the restroom, I heard his voice in my head, calling out. I'm sure it was him! Yet, I can't remember who he was." "Was his name Lin Sisi?" Chen Ge whispered the name Lin Sisi into Wang Yicheng's ear. At the sound of the name, Wang Yicheng's body shook uncontrollably, his grip on Chen Ge's neck tightening to the point of strangling. "I didn't mean to, they coerced me! I'm sorry! We were still best friends!" Wang Yicheng screamed with his eyes shut, his voice laden with harrowing desperation, as if awakening to find a ghostly figure standing at the bedside in the middle of the night. "Stay composed!" Wang Yicheng's sudden meltdown was unexpected and risked drawing more attention. Chen Ge quickly released him and delivered a sharp strike to his carotid artery. "Teacher Bai?" The other students were startled. "Be quiet! I'm trying to save him!" Chen Ge tested a few more points before Wang Yicheng finally fell into unconsciousness: "A mental breakdown can inflict serious harm on the brain; the best immediate solution I could think of was to stop his thoughts, if only for a brief moment." Chapter 810: Beyond the Wall Chen Ge watched over Wang Yicheng's unconscious form, unsettled by the critical insight drawn from Wang's earlier, disjointed words. The one who had deceitfully coaxed Lin Sisi into the restroom was none other than Wang Yicheng! 'To think that the pivotal figure was right beside me all this time.' Chen Ge was grateful that even after crossing through the Door, his essence remained uncorrupted. Initially, his interaction with Wang Yicheng was driven by simple compassion—seeing someone alone and wanting to make a difference. His good intentions paid off; Wang Yicheng now had a group of friends who would neither bully nor scorn him. Interpreting the story from Wang Yicheng's frantic speech, Chen Ge started unraveling the sequence of events. Both Wang Yicheng and Lin Sisi, roommates in Dormitory 413, were marginalized for various reasons. Their divergent personalities led to different approaches to coping with the cold violence from their peers. Wang Yicheng opted for endurance, bearing the brunt in stoic silence, while Lin Sisi sought ways to draw attention. Their relationship was not one of friendship but rather of convenience, a partnership formed in the face of shared adversity against exclusion and ridicule. The students' animosity toward Lin Sisi escalated into a vindictive prank: dressing up as ghosts to frighten him in the desolate restroom at the top of the Teaching Building. To bait Lin Sisi, they approached Wang Yicheng, who shared a comparably decent rapport with him. Chen Ge did not know the persuasion tactics they employed, but the outcome was clear—Wang Yicheng had been swayed. Though Wang Yicheng had his own struggles, he was the one who ultimately steered Lin Sisi toward the edge of danger. 'We must hasten! Before Wang Yicheng awakens, we need to elude our pursuers.' Chen Ge proceeded with extreme caution, visiting various spots to confirm the absence of the white-clad Managers. Only when he was certain they were alone, did he relax slightly. An eerie transformation was unfolding within the West Campus; the number of enigmatic figures dressed in white was proliferating. Without delay, Chen Ge led the club members to the Waste Disposal Center. 'Bai Teacher, are those in white also teachers here? Why haven't I seen them before? And why were they chasing us?' Zhu Long was laden with questions. 'They are not teachers, but Managers tasked with preserving order in the West Campus. Their persistent pursuit...' Chen Ge placed the unconscious Wang Yicheng on the grass, '...stems from him, and from all of you.' 'Us?' 'Correct. This school is far more complex than it appears. If it were to be compared to the human brain, then the West Campus would represent the center that processes all positive emotions, while the East Campus grapples with the negative and the discarded.' Chen Ge offered a straightforward analogy: 'The West Campus harbors only joyful memories, while all the 'trash' is exiled to the East Campus. Yet, how can anyone exist solely with joyful reminiscences?' 'Does that mean we've lost many memories?' Zhang Ju was quick to catch on, piecing together Chen Ge's implications before he finished speaking. 'Precisely. The memories you've lost are tainted with despair, labeled as trash by the West Campus. The moment these memories begin to resurface or awaken, the Managers will send you off to the East Campus.' Chen Ge's tone was grave: 'Armed with the truth, do you still wish to seek out your memories?' 'I do.' Zhu Long didn't hesitate, 'The sensation of knowing something happened but being unable to recall it is unbearable. I'd rather face all my memories than continue in this fragmented state.' 'I yearn to retrieve the memories I've lost. Lacking them, I feel incomplete, similar to... a monster.' Zhang Ju's fingers gently traced the scars on his face, his gaze filled with complexity as his thoughts wandered. 'You've all gone mad! Truly mad!' Zhou Tu's mutterings continued, as he paced to and fro like a rodent trapped in a cage. 'Silence implies consent.' Chen Ge helped Wang Yicheng to his feet: 'Our decision to enter the East Campus actually brings an unexpected advantage. The Managers who wish to take us there could never have anticipated our voluntary descent.' 'Does it make a difference?' 'Indeed. If we go willingly, we retain our humanity. But if they capture and transfer us, more memories might be erased.' Chen Ge comforted his club members: 'The East Campus is not as nightmarish as you imagine. With caution, we will be unharmed.' With Wang Yicheng slung over his back, Chen Ge opened the doors of the West Campus Waste Disposal Center, which was immaculate—a direct contrast to its Eastern counterpart. 'Do not disturb anything here, particularly the sorting doors.' Uncertain of surveillance within the center, Chen Ge handed out ropes to the students: 'On the second floor there's a small window. I'll climb out first to the wall's top. Observe and follow suit.' 'And Wang Yicheng?' 'Secure him with ropes. Once I'm atop the wall, you'll hand him through, and I'll pull him up.' Wang Yicheng's lean stature was a stroke of luck, lessening the burden for Chen Ge. 'Be vigilant. Upon reaching the second floor, act swiftly and follow my directives!' After outfitting the students with ropes, Chen Ge meticulously tied Wang Yicheng, and proceeded to the second floor. Once sure they were undisturbed, Chen Ge wasted no time and headed straight for the window. He opened the window wide and, with practiced ease, scaled to the wall's pinnacle: 'Why hesitate? Hand Wang Yicheng through.' He was connected to Wang Yicheng by a rope ready for the hand-off. 'Could Bai Teacher be a physical education instructor?' Zhang Ju, quick to action, began to guide Wang Yicheng toward the window. 'Remember, this is the second story. Exercise caution.' Zhu Long and Zhou Tu also pitched in, and together they managed to pass Wang Yicheng beyond the wall. The effort was considerable, but Chen Ge successfully maneuvered Wang Yicheng to the wall's apex. He was an indispensable figure in the night's events, and Chen Ge was resolute in not leaving him behind. Perched atop the wall, Chen Ge's demeanor shifted to one of resolve. He loosened the rope around him, inching along the wall, clearing space for his companions. 'Move quickly!' Chen Ge steadied Wang Yicheng, locating gaps between the bricks where he fastened the rope. Should they need to venture from the East to the West in the future, they wouldn't require passage through the Waste Disposal Center—they could use the rope he had secured. It took the group a tense quarter of an hour to transition into the East Campus. To the students of the West, the East presented itself as an alien landscape. Chapter 811: Zhang Ju's Memory "On the second day of orientation, being chased by a teacher and forced to leap over walls, I found myself far from the college life I had envisioned," Zhou Tu mused, dusting off his clothes and unwinding the rope from his waist. "What lies ahead may be even more inconceivable." Chen Ge ensured the rope he had affixed atop the wall was obscured by a curtain of ivy, nearly invisible unless scrutinized. "This rope is my contingency plan." Chen Ge had left the East Campus alone, but he returned as the leader of a club. "Teacher, have you discerned any anomalies?" Zhang Ju stood tall, his scar-shrouded eyes slowly opening wide. "What is it?" "Perhaps it's just my heightened senses, but the air on this side of the wall is unusually dense, saturated with moisture, and bears a peculiar scent, akin to that of blood." Zhang Ju's calm delivery juxtaposed the bizarre nature of his statement. He briefly licked the scar on his upper lip, a look of perplexity and uncertainty in his eyes: "This environment feels more familiar to me than the West Campus." "You're not serious, are you? Familiar with the scent of blood?" Initially, Zhou Tu was simply put off by Zhang Ju's disfigurement, but after hearing his recent remarks, Zhou Tu's view of him shifted. "I am serious—it's the truth." Zhang Ju locked eyes with Chen Ge, who remained motionless, the smile on his face not fully sincere. "Your senses do not deceive you. This land is fertile for nurturing dreams. In the world beyond the door, only with cadavers and blood can the most extraordinary flowers be cultivated." Chen Ge, carrying Wang Yicheng on his back, beckoned Zhang Ju to follow him quietly: "We're venturing to a vital location; it's crucial we remain silent." They maneuvered through the overgrown underbrush, enshrouded by the darkness of night. Reaching their destination without incident, Chen Ge brought Zhang Ju to the Tree Hollow Female Ghost's haunt. "Do you recognize this place?" He indicated the tree hollow housing the female ghost's skull and the surrounding trees. "I have a sense of déjà vu... Is this not the murder scene we saw in the West Campus? How is there an exact duplicate here in the East Campus?" Zhou Tu's eyes bulged, taken aback by the precise replication of the scenes, down to the hollows' positions. "The West Campus's crime scene is nothing but a shell. The real remains and the spirit of the deceased are enshrined here in the East Campus. You are now witnessing the authentic murder site." While Chen Ge explained, Zhang Ju appeared transfixed by the tree hollow, standing beside it, his shoulders quivering imperceptibly. "Zhang Ju?" He didn't seem to hear Chen Ge's voice, gradually kneeling by the tree hollow and extending his shaking hands into its darkness. "Why this madness? Recall, the girl’s head was found within that hollow! What are you searching for inside?" Zhou Tu tried to intervene, but Chen Ge halted him: "Do not disrupt him. His memories are entwined with that hollow; he alone must excavate them." "Excavate them? Have you both lost your minds?" Zhou Tu, overpowered by Chen Ge's strength, could only watch, frustrated and powerless. Zhang Ju knelt, his gaze locked on the abyss of the hollow, his arms burrowing deeper. His body shivered, sweat mingling with the scars on his face, resembling the trails of invisible tears. "Nothing? There must be something! It can't be!" Zhang Ju's voice was fraught with panic, breathless: "I saw it with my own eyes! I witnessed him hide it in the hollow! How can it be gone?" His fingers clawed the soil and bark, his nails bleeding, yet he felt no pain. His face twisted in anguish as he dug furiously at the hollow's foundation. "Zhang Ju, might you be seeking this?" Chen Ge took out a rust-stained kitchen knife from his backpack, the very knife that served as the Tree Hollow Female Ghost's Anchor Object (as per Chapter 787). Initially, Chen Ge had considered the knife merely for self-defense. A hush fell, and all eyes gravitated towards the knife. "This knife, found within the hollow, is infused with the victim's fractured soul." Chen Ge laid the knife before Zhang Ju: "If you hold it, could it stir up a memory of your past?" Zhang Ju's limbs vibrated with intensity, his pupils dilating. "Does it feel familiar? Have you previously encountered this blade? Who was its last holder, and whose neck did it slice?" Chen Ge's questions were like piercing nails driven into Zhang Ju's psyche. The moment his fingertips grazed the knife's handle, his face contorted in horror, pupils shrinking, mouth agape as though scorched by a searing iron. Before a scream could erupt, Chen Ge swiftly covered Zhang Ju's mouth: "It's alright; those events are but echoes of the past, mere fragments of your journey." While consoling Zhang Ju, Chen Ge's gaze was fixed on the hand that held the knife, prepared to subdue any aggressive motion. Zhang Ju's strength was greater than expected, and as his memories stirred, his might seemed to swell. He was no mere spirit. As Chen Ge struggled to restrain him, Zhang Ju's disquiet finally subsided. Chen Ge released his grasp, and Zhang Ju crumpled to the ground, his lips grazing the damp earth, the scars on his face stark against the mud. "I... I've remembered some things," Zhang Ju murmured, his eyes on his broken nails: "It was a senior's birthday. A girl wished to confess her feelings, but he had a girlfriend and asked me to reject her on his behalf. I was at the arranged place, but the girl never showed. Then, I heard a disturbance from the woods and stealthily approached. That's when I saw someone with this knife..." "The girl was resisting, but I was paralyzed with fear. I had never before seen so much blood." His nails dug into the ground, Zhang Ju's scarred face twisted in turmoil: "If I had intervened, maybe she wouldn't have died." Tormented by guilt, Zhang Ju clutched the knife: "By the time I decided to call the police, they were gone. I'm unsure if they were ever apprehended, but one... one silhouette was strikingly familiar." "The subsequent night, we indulged in excessive drinking, sang our hearts out, and then the fire broke out. I was rushed to the hospital, and thereafter... Zhang Ju abruptly began pounding his head: "What happened next? Why is there no memory of the events that followed?" "You were hospitalized with burn injuries; that is where your memory ceased." Chen Ge was already acquainted with the tragedy that had befallen Zhang Ju. Chapter 812: Portrait of the Doctor 'I could see the inferno spreading, its flames devouring everything with increasing ferocity, thick smoke billowing, screams and wails of agony filling the air. My eyes were sealed shut by the heat, and though I yearned to escape, the moment I flung the door open, I was greeted by a wall of fire.' Zhang Ju lay prostrate, his forehead streaked with protruding veins, his scars quivering slightly: 'I couldn’t identify the source of the pain as I struggled to break free, gasping for air, my vision nearly obliterated, until at last, I collapsed in the corridor.' 'In a daze, I felt someone lifting me, a sliver of consciousness still clinging to me.' Dirtied and bloodied fingers weaved through his hair, Zhang Ju propped himself up on his elbows: 'I must have been rushed to a hospital; I could faintly make out my parents and doctors exchanging words. I attempted to open my eyes, but upon doing so, I was met with a world engulfed in absolute darkness, as if everything had been scorched to nothingness.' Zhang Ju's voice steadied as he lay spent on the ground: 'I can recall the faces of my parents, the doctors and nurses who cared for me, but how I emerged from the coma, how I found myself at this school, that remains an enigma.' 'Could it be that you have yet to awaken, that this is the continuation of your comatose world?' Chen Ge's hypothesis startled Zhang Ju. 'I haven't awakened? This is the realm of my coma?' Zhang Ju muttered, echoing Chen Ge's words: 'So all of this is a dream? Are all of you mere figments of my imagination?' 'Delusions be damned, this is getting absurd. Can we remain grounded, please?' Zhou Tu snatched the kitchen knife from Zhang Ju's grip: 'I cannot speak for the others, but I am certainly not a figment of your dreams. I'll hold onto the knife, to prevent you from doing anything rash.' Zhou Tu considered himself the sole voice of reason within the club, feeling it prudent to keep the weapon in his possession. 'Zhang Ju's speculation holds water, but he has overlooked a crucial point. This world is not the dream of an individual but a collective nightmare, woven from the many negative emotions and harrowing experiences of numerous people,' Chen Ge stated, his gaze scanning the faces of the club members: 'You all find yourselves ensnared in this world, a world you have unwittingly created with your own hands.' After Chen Ge's words, the forest descended into a profound silence; the members' eyes were fixed on him, their expressions a mix of disbelief and intrigue. 'I know this may be difficult to accept at the moment, but fear not, we still have time.' Chen Ge glanced at the distant wall, with Wang Yicheng over his shoulder: 'The resurgence of Wang Yicheng's memories has drawn the Manager's scrutiny. Now, with your memories, Zhang Ju, beginning to unfurl, it's probable the Manager will soon appear. We must make haste and depart.' Turning, Chen Ge led the way out of the forest. 'Wait!' Zhang Ju clutched the blood-stained earth, slowly raising his head, his gaze locked on Chen Ge with unwavering resolve: 'Who are you, exactly? Why reveal these truths to us?' 'My identity is inconsequential; what matters is that I can aid you in escaping. Your loved ones in the world of the living have waited far too long.' Chen Ge's smile bore a hint of empathy: 'Our stories share similarities; I, too, have lost fragments of my childhood memories. Seeing you, I am reminded of my past self.' With a beckoning gesture, Chen Ge continued onward: 'Meeting me is a stroke of luck. When I was alone, with no one to guide me, I fumbled in the dark, losing so much...' Chen Ge, his voice tinged with a touch of sorrow, navigated the club members past the Laboratory Building and Faculty Apartment Building, towards a path beside the Teaching Building. 'The top-floor restroom in the Teaching Building harbors the answers I seek.' The Teaching Building in the West Campus was simply quiet and gloomy, but that of the East Campus exuded an aura of eeriness. Merely approaching it sent a chill snaking up one's spine, cold and unyielding. 'Keep silent; any misstep here could have dire repercussions.' Chen Ge cautioned in a hushed tone. 'What kind of repercussions?' Zhou Tu, sweat beading on his brow, clutched the kitchen knife he had retrieved from the tree hollow, his posture tense, eyes wide and alert. 'In the East Campus, we are the detritus, unwanted by the West. Reflect on how we dispose of our daily refuse.' Chen Ge's smile lingered, though his words sent a shudder through the club members: 'If apprehended, we will be stripped of anything deemed valuable, exploited to the last, and then discarded. Here, death is not an end but a coveted reprieve that remains tantalizingly elusive.' With no retreat, Chen Ge was the first to enter the Teaching Building of the East Campus. Was it an illusion, or did the darkness in the East Campus possess a depth more profound than that of its counterpart? Ascending the worn steps, the handrail bore the scars of scorching, and the empty classrooms echoed with the faint sound of shifting furniture. 'This place is unnerving. It's almost inconceivable that it's separated from us by just a wall.' Zhu Long's whisper trailed behind the group. 'Be quiet.' Zhou Tu, knife in hand, kept a watchful eye on Zhang Ju, wary that the boy with a face marred by scars might suddenly unravel and become a danger. Sometimes, the very things we fear come to pass most unexpectedly. Zhou Tu, focused on Zhang Ju, hadn't anticipated the boy's sudden halt. 'What's the matter?' 'I was just wondering. Why are there so many portraits of doctors adorning the corridors of the Teaching Building?' Zhang Ju looked up at the doctors on the wall: 'We're not a medical university, yet these doctors... they're obscure, many without even a basic profile, just a snapshot of them in white lab coats. Have you noticed? Each one of these doctors' portraits depicts them in their professional attire.' Zhang Ju's observations sparked Chen Ge's curiosity; the significance of the portraits had eluded him, but now, with Zhang Ju's comments, a notion began to crystallize. 'The world behind the door takes shape from the memories of those who push it open. This school is an anomaly, encapsulating the memories of all its students. These doctors' photos adorning the walls are likely projections of individuals the students have encountered in reality.' Chen Ge gently squeezed Zhang Ju's shoulder: 'Look closely at these portraits, see if you can recognize any of the doctors.' 'Doctors of such distinction to be featured on these walls are beyond my ken. How could I possibly recognize any?' 'Here, the term 'doctor' might carry a significance we've yet to unravel. Just trust in me, and do as I suggest.' Chen Ge escorted the club members further up, pausing abruptly on the third floor: 'Hold on, there's someone ahead.' The classroom door near the corridor on the third floor was unsecured, its low-quality wooden frame creaking ominously as the wind toyed with it. Chen Ge and his companions stood rooted in the corridor, enveloped in a tense silence. Moments later, a shadowy figure departed from the classroom. 'That silhouette seems familiar... Is that Chang Gu?' Chapter 813: Do You Dare? The dark shadow's movements closely resembled Chang Gu's, but with an agility that belied any impairment of sight. Chen Ge, reluctant to act rashly, opted to keep observing. The figure hastened to the far end of the corridor, apparently searching for something. 'Could that be Chang Gu? Has his vision been restored?' Even with the pitch darkness enveloping the East Campus teaching building, Chen Ge proceeded with extreme caution, his Shadow Pupil ability his only aid in the gloom. 'Teacher, is that figure someone you recognize? Shall we pursue?' 'Better to tread lightly; our path leads to the top floor.' Chen Ge's eyes remained fixed on the dark figure, which, rather than departing, slipped into another classroom. With the realization that they were not alone in the building, the uncertainty of their situation grew. Chen Ge couldn't determine if this was a fortuitous or ominous development. Upon reaching the fourth floor, they faced the challenge of crossing the long corridor to access the restroom. 'Ignore any sounds you hear, and avoid acknowledging anything you see—stay together at all costs. Do you understand?' With these words of caution, Chen Ge, with Wang Yicheng on his back, entered the corridor. He lowered his stance, scanning the classrooms on either side with a peripheral vigilance. The windows offered no secrets, shrouded as they were in darkness. The Supernatural Tales Club members followed Chen Ge's lead, struggling to keep their gazes fixed ahead, though their curiosity fought to divert their attention. 'What's that?' The classrooms, long neglected, were shrouded in filth. Passing by a window, Zhou Tu caught sight of strands of hair-like filaments beneath the window sill, suggesting the eerie presence of a girl sprawled across the window-facing desk. 'Might there truly be someone there?' Zhou Tu tiptoed, craning his neck to glimpse beneath the sill. 'Is the hair... moving?' Before Zhou Tu could discern the truth, he collided with an unexpected obstacle. Caught off guard and clutching a rusted kitchen knife, he dropped it, and the sound of metal clashing with tile reverberated unnervingly through the nocturnal silence of the teaching building. The group halted in their tracks as Chen Ge turned to Zhou Tu. 'What are you doing?' 'It was an accident—I bumped into Zhang Ju.' Zhou Tu, hand to his nose, gestured toward Zhang Ju, who stood motionless, his expression peculiar. 'Why did you suddenly stop?' Zhang Ju offered no reply. Instead, he gazed up at a portrait on the wall, his mouth agape, his pupils reduced to mere pinpricks. 'Zhang Ju?' Despite the others' calls, Zhang Ju remained transfixed by the portrait, his eyes reflecting a quiet sorrow. The breakdown he suffered upon discovering the murder weapon had now given way to a different kind of turmoil. Bereft of screams and self-mutilation, he stood in silence before the portrait. 'I've seen this doctor before.' His whisper was barely audible, meant only for the ears of those nearby. 'The fire consumed a fifth of my skin. I watched my own flesh smolder, smelled the stench of my burning body, until my eyes melted and my eyelids fused shut, plunging my world into darkness.' 'Rushed to the hospital, the pain was so intense it became numbness. My eyes sealed shut, my nose burned away, with two-thirds of one ear remaining and only a third of the other. I was transformed into a monster; blind, I knew I was no longer myself, and I could never return to living as a person.' 'Ever tried listening to your family with two-thirds of an ear?' 'Someone was trying to save me; I could feel life's pain drawing nearer, but how could I awaken? My eyes were sliced open by something cold, meticulously cleaned; my left eye removed, my right eye glimpsing a gray world.' 'I was blind to light, only shadows visible to my right eye. Tell me, should I have continued living?' The resurgence of memories altered Zhang Ju's appearance before their eyes. His fingertips rested on the portrait, his face beginning to bleed as minuscule blood vessels surfaced beneath his skin, resembling the threads of surgical stitches. 'I know this doctor; he was with me for a week, betting against Death for my life.' His voice grew raspy as if scorched by flames, his features morphing. Scars and blood vessels sprawled across his face; his ears began to shrivel like dying petals, his left eyelid slowly melting. 'I never uttered a word to him, but his presence left a lasting mark. During the final moments of my life, he was among the three who accompanied me.' The remorse for the departed unlocked the chains of memory within Zhang Ju's mind. The doctor who had once treated him now clarified the memories that had been shrouded in fog. Memory fragments coalesced, and blood seeped from beneath his skin as if freshly opened wounds were bleeding again. Droplets of blood formed and fell onto his coat, which gradually stained red: 'If you found yourselves in my predicament, would you choose life or death?' 'Half-Red Garment? Does the return of memories restore a fierce ghost to its true form? Could it be that the Tree Hollow Female Ghost's failure to retain a human appearance stems from incomplete memory erasure?' Chen Ge's eyelids flickered with realization, though he maintained far greater composure than the other club members. Zhou Tu, abandoning the knife, seized Zhu Long's arm, and without realizing, the pair retreated a full three meters. Unanswered, Zhang Ju's gaze shifted from the portrait to Chen Ge. 'Now that I recall who I am, can you tell me who you are?' They stood in the dim corridor, scrutinizing each other. 'You've posed this question before, and I've given you my response.' Chen Ge stood firm, not yielding an inch. 'We are akin; I am in search of the memories I've lost. In helping you, I am aiding myself.' 'You're lying!' Zhang Ju reached out to Chen Ge, halting just shy of contact. 'Why hesitate?' Chen Ge advanced, his expression a hair's breadth from Zhang Ju's face, now a visage of despair and horror. 'Does the prospect of another 'me' rising from my corpse petrify you? Are you terrified of the me clad in red?' His hands clasped Zhang Ju's shoulders, his expression reaching the epitome of madness. His fingers traversed Zhang Ju's shoulders, cradling his face, his touch coming to rest lightly on his forehead. 'To kill me—do you dare?' The shock was not limited to Zhang Ju; Zhou Tu and Zhu Long, lurking behind, felt the same terror. Silence enveloped the corridor; moments that felt like eternities later, Chen Ge released Zhang Ju, his gaze sweeping over the other Supernatural Tales Club members: 'My sole quest is to reclaim the memories I've lost. By aiding me, you assist yourselves, and vice versa.' Chapter 814: The Movable 'Door' Zhang Ju had long realized that Chen Ge was extraordinary; his eyes remained placid regardless of the horrors they witnessed—as if nothing in the world could faze him. Admittedly, he feared such a person, but it was precisely this fear that compelled him to comply and follow. Standing before the photograph, Zhang Ju opened his sole remaining right eye, silently observing Chen Ge’s visage. A countenance so ordinary it could blend into a crowd, yet it was this very individual who had recently revealed a visage that struck terror in Zhang Ju. It's difficult to describe; it seemed a confluence of a fierce ghost’s deep vengeance with the derangement of a psychotic. In that expression, there was madness, pathology, cruelty, but no trace of fear or dread. Zhang Ju was aware of his own monstrous appearance; he had always viewed himself as a horrifying entity. But Chen Ge's recent behavior showed him that there were 'monsters' in the world far more terrifying than he. "Yes, we are probably akin," he affirmed. He believed Chen Ge's words, for such expressions are only worn by those who have survived hell—those like him who had lost their pasts. "My apologies, Teacher Bai. Some distressing memories resurfaced, causing me to lose control," expressed Zhang Ju, his voice harsh yet noticeably more amiable. "It's alright, would a teacher genuinely reprimand a student?" Teacher Bai's face bore a gentle smile, exuding warmth and kindness, making it hard to believe he was the same person who had just addressed Zhang Ju with severity: "What do you recall? Please, spare no detail, tell me everything." "They’re merely some painful memories." Zhang Ju’s wounds continued to bleed, his attire increasingly stained crimson: "I remembered feeling powerless and frightened at a murder scene; the sensation of being scorched by flames, as if countless needles penetrated the flesh until the pain ceased; I also recollected my desperate struggle in the sterile ward, as despair took root and grew within me. I didn't wish to die, yet I was at a loss on how to go on living." "During your life’s final moments, did anything out of the ordinary transpire either to you or in your vicinity?" Teacher Bai was curious about how Zhang Ju arrived at the school, as understanding the entry method might provide clues to an escape route. In a three-star scenario, the 'door' is the only ingress and egress, but the rules seem to differ in a four-star scenario. "The ultimate phase of existence... " Zhang Ju caressed his face: "I appeared to slip into a coma, yet I was faintly aware of the external world; unable to distinguish between reality and nightmare. But, I distinctly remember one thing—every night in the ward, a door would emerge." "A door?" "I spent a week in the hospital, and nightly, that door materialized, drawing incrementally nearer until it finally stationed beside my bed," Zhang Ju gazed upward, his countenance smeared with blood: "It was a door that shifted autonomously; the more dread and despondency I felt, the nearer it approached. Unable to summon aid, on the eighth night, the door swung open from within, and hands emerged through the crevice, dragging me through." Zhang Ju's account mirrored Chang Gu's—they both encountered a self-propelling 'door' that, come midnight, would gravitate towards the sleeping individual, eventually positioning itself bedside and spiriting away the living once opened. "Did this school lie beyond that door?" Teacher Bai was even more intrigued about the subsequent events. He yearned to understand Zhang Ju's amnesia, how this student, disfigured by the inferno, transformed into the 'Half-Red Garment.' Zhang Ju shook his head: "I found myself ensnared in a dream, an incredibly lucid dream. Therein, everyone called me Lin Sisi. I repeatedly asserted my name was Zhang Ju, that they were mistaken, but they believed I was jesting." "No one credited my words, so I had to live under the moniker Lin Sisi in the dream, enduring all she faced. Over time, I even started to question my identity—was I truly not Lin Sisi?" "Being bullied, subjected to cold violence, ignored—such experiences aren't pleasant. Yet, on second thought, given the monstrosity I became in reality, existing within the dream was relatively comforting." He recounted with a sense of detachment as if speaking of another's life: "Friendless, despised by the world, the dual torment of mind and body gradually numbed me until one day, a girl entered my dream." "It was a rainy day. A frog had been covertly placed in my deskmate's bag, and she suspected me. But why would I commit such a trivial act?" "Unheeded by all, I was expelled from the classroom. Met with peculiar stares in the corridor, I had no choice but to seek solace on the rooftop of the teaching building, alone." "There, I met her." "Even aware it was a dream, I sensed the girl was unique." Zhang Ju's tone shifted: "Her name was Chang Wenyu, the sole individual who didn't overlook me." "I confided my plight to her, and she empathized." "Later, I divulged my past to her, asserting that I was not Lin Sisi." "She took great interest in my tales, and I relished her company, for only with her I could remember myself, resist assimilation by the dream." "We convened on the rooftop every evening, and I increasingly sensed my dependence on her." "As life seemed to regain color, she posed a sudden query—did I wish to behold the scenery beyond the school?" "At that juncture, I failed to grasp the question's gravity. I simply yearned for her company, thus I nodded in agreement." "That night, past midnight, she escorted me to the library." "The library's doors were perennially locked, yet we entered through a window and came upon a mirror sequestered behind a shelf on the third floor." "The mirror was vast; the girl claimed it had a few uses left and implored me to keep its existence clandestine." "I trusted her implicitly, and a realization dawned—it was my inaugural encounter with a mirror in the dream!" "I inquired about my next steps." "She instructed to simply gaze into the mirror in silence." "I stood before the mirror, her presence behind me. Amid the night's stillness, I beheld my reflection." "The more I stared, the more the mirror's inhabitant seemed unlike me. Gradually, the reflection commenced bleeding, scars manifesting upon the mirrored visage." "His ears shriveled, his left eye sealed shut, his visage a blur of mangled flesh!" "I recoiled from the sight, but when I sought to withdraw, the mirror's monster seized me!" "Blood cascaded down the glass, eventually tinting the entire mirror red!" "I bellowed for rescue, turning to Chang Wenyu, but she remained impassive. Her final words to me are etched in my memory—why fear? The you in the mirror, that's the genuine you." "Her slender fingers pressed upon my left eye, slowly extracting it." "The world abruptly became colorless, and I was hauled into the mirror by the creature. All hopes of beauty became the most malevolent of curses in that instant." Chapter 815: This Is But A Conjecture "Chang Wenyu removed my left eye, rendering me an exact likeness of the monster in the mirror," Zhang Ju lamented. "She crushed all my illusions. I am not Lin Sisi; I am Zhang Ju. The terrifying creature reflected in the mirror is none other than myself." Blood oozed from his wounds, staining much of Zhang Ju's attire a deep red. More unsettling was the pattern of blood veins on his clothing that intertwined and multiplied. Initially, Chen Ge believed Zhang Ju to be clad in the Half-Red Garment, but he quickly realized that he had underestimated him. As memories continued to resurface, the bloodstains on Zhang Ju's body proliferated, almost engulfing him entirely in crimson. "I was dragged into the mirror, and on the other side was Chang Wenyu, clutching my left eye. Her lips parted as if to say—'just one more.'" "In her grasp, my left eye transformed, and the entirety of my life's experiences flashed within its pupil. As she took my left eye, she stripped away all that was good and hopeful from me." Drip, drop, drip, drop... Zhang Ju's blood fell to the corridor floor, accompanying the faint echo of footsteps within the teaching building. Yet, no matter where they looked, no one appeared. "What lies beyond the mirror?" Chen Ge inquired softly. "Red. Everything is red there. It's a world saturated in red," Zhang Ju described. His words reminded Chen Ge of the eerie scene beyond the Three-Star Trial's door. "How did you manage to return from that place?" "The mirror concealed another version of myself, bathed in blood red, yearning to consume me. Without time to think, escape was my only recourse. After an eternity of running, I discovered that the mirror's other side was also a school, seemingly deserted." "And what happened afterward?" "I didn't survive the first night. The other me from the mirror's world captured me." Confusion flickered in Zhang Ju's gaze. "I remember him killing me, yet when I next opened my eyes, I was back in this school, bereft of most my memories, assimilated as one of its own." "So, your memories were tampered with post-mortem?" "That's a way to interpret it. I'm unaware of the actual events that transpired. If you seek clarity, perhaps the blood-red world behind the mirror holds your answers." Though Zhang Ju's appearance was grotesque, his expression was one of grave sincerity. "I think I'm beginning to understand," Chen Ge murmured. Chen Ge listened intently, a chill running down his spine as he realized their fates were intertwined through the mirror's reflection. "Normally, the 'Door' is the sole gateway into the blood-red world, but here lies a specter beyond our comprehension, likely a being surpassing even the Red Specters. This entity has used the mirror as a conduit, carving out an additional realm within the blood-red world—the school we now occupy. Do you follow?" The club members present shook their heads, unable to fathom his explanation. "Let me simplify it. Imagine this: opening this Door leads us to the blood-red world. Within it, we find another mirror. Touching the mirror, we enter the world within it." "Consider it akin to dreaming. In our waking state, we exist in reality. In slumber, our consciousness enters the dream realm. But what happens if we dream within that dream? Our consciousness shifts to a dream within a dream." "The world behind the mirror is akin to a 'dream' forged by the Door Pusher from the despair and negative emotions that constitute the blood-red world." Despite his efforts, Chen Ge's explanation eluded the students' comprehension, but he had pieced together an essential puzzle. Since awakening, he had lost all contact with his staff, and his black cellphone was nowhere to be found, plunging him into a perilous predicament. He couldn't grasp how the school's true master had accomplished this. Setting aside the black cellphone, Zhang Ya was meant to be concealed within his shadow. Yet now, his shadow was inexplicably ordinary, devoid of her presence. This suggested that his physical self hadn't truly entered the school. Just as Zhang Ju had recounted, when he peered into the mirror, he saw another self inside. One kind and gentle, the other vicious and bloodthirsty—the amalgamation of both constituted the real Zhang Ju. "I seem to have encountered the same predicament as Zhang Ju; pieces of my personality reside inside the mirror, while others remain outside." Chen Ge's conjectures were not guaranteed to be correct. It was akin to navigating a fog, his presence the only light in the murky world. "The mirror Chang Wenyu employed is located in the library. After inspecting the restroom, that's our next destination." Chen Ge revealed his plans. "Why would you go there when everyone avoids it?" Zhang Ju, unable to understand Chen Ge's rationale, was just regaining his memories, his vision clouded with the surfacing recollections. "Compared to this place, I find the blood-red world somewhat more authentic." Chen Ge's words hinted at his uncommon nature. After contemplating, Zhang Ju refrained from objecting: "As it happens, I too desire to untangle what has transpired to me. By all accounts, shouldn't I have perished?" Once Zhang Ju expressed his agreement, Chen Ge appeared more at ease, now accompanied by an invaluable ally. "Let's proceed to the restroom and investigate." They had already spent considerable time in the corridor, and fortunately, no anomalies had arisen in the teaching building. Zhang Ju's blood trailed behind them, its dripping sound blending with the gradually approaching footsteps. Though the footsteps resonated ominously, no one was in sight. "Zhu Long, have you observed Zhang Ju's transformation? His countenance is... horrific." Zhou Tu maintained his distance from Zhang Ju and Chen Ge, convinced they were both madmen. "At this juncture, we can only place our trust in Chen Ge. Does not the change in Zhang Ju validate that he hasn't deceived us? We are in the midst of reclaiming our forgotten memories." Zhu Long's complexion was pale. Clenching his teeth, his grip on the cellphone turned his knuckles white. "Very well." Zhou Tu glanced back and, feeling utterly terrified, could not muster the courage to return alone: "I must be out of my mind to have joined such a club." With determination, he stooped to retrieve the kitchen knife from the ground. However, in the moment he lowered his gaze, his world upended, and he saw rows of inverted heads in the corridor behind him—all fixated on Wang Yicheng, carried on the backs of Zhang Ju and Chen Ge! Zhou Tu nearly collapsed in terror, steadied just in time by Zhu Long's support. "What's wrong?" "There are people behind us! We are being followed by a multitude!" Zhou Tu's voice quivered with fear. "Where?" Zhu Long turned back to find the corridor empty, clearly inhabited only by their small group: "Are you suffering from an illusion?" "No, they are there!" Zhou Tu insisted, but as he spoke, he came to realize that the dread that seized him was all too real. Chapter 816: The Faceless Boy Zhu Long clutched Zhou Tu's arm, and both looked back at the enveloping darkness. They could barely make out the sound of footsteps, yet no visible soul was present. "Is there anyone there?" "I saw them when I reached for the kitchen knife. They were all upside down, trailing behind us, as if residing in a world inverted from ours." Zhou Tu was still shaken: "Those people kept their gaze fixed on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. Should we inform Teacher Bai?" "That might be wise." Zhu Long cast a doubtful glance behind, Zhou Tu didn't appear to be lying. Caught up in their hesitation, Chen Ge and Zhang Ju had already advanced to the corridor's midpoint. As they approached the restroom, their nervousness intensified. "Teacher Bai, Zhou Tu just spotted someone following us, all of them upside down. I'm not sure how to explain it; perhaps it's best you ask Zhou Tu." Zhu Long tugged Zhou Tu to Chen Ge's side. "As I stooped to retrieve the kitchen knife, I saw a crowd behind us, their heads downward, hovering in the air. No, they seemed to be traversing the ceiling, those entities presumably drawn to Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. My own eyes witnessed those inverted monstrosities fixating on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng." Zhou Tu felt an instinctual revulsion to getting close to Zhang Ju. "Inverted people?" Chen Ge had encountered such figures in the Laboratory Building: "Let's first inspect the restroom, to verify the existence of 'the Door.' If the restroom yields no clues, we'll depart at once." This school's eerie nature, even under the protection of the red garment, could not provide Chen Ge with a sense of security. They quickened their pace, and mere steps from the restroom, Chen Ge's neck was suddenly seized by a pair of hands. Chilly and skeletal, the arms constricted around his neck, the grip tightening slowly, constricting Chen Ge's breath. "Wang Yicheng? Have you come to?" Chen Ge twisted to see Wang Yicheng's head resting heavily on his shoulder, his eyes ridden with bloodshot streaks of black and red, as though locked in a perpetual struggle with an inner torment. "Don't enter, they are within." The voice that emanated from Wang Yicheng was drastically different from his usual tone, evoking the image of a battered stray dog fiercely guarding the corpse of a comrade, then resigning to the beatings of others. "Who are 'they'?" "Classmates, seniors, all who despise you are in there, don't approach, I've secretly informed the teacher already." Wang Yicheng attempted a smile, but it eluded him. "Did you hit this kid into delirium? He's spouting nonsense." Zhu Long, gripping a pink cellphone, discreetly approached Chen Ge, feeling a semblance of solace only when near Chen Ge amidst the oppressive aura of the teaching building. "Wang Yicheng, have you recalled something?" Wang Yicheng's memory had been stirred at the West Campus restroom entrance. Initially, Chen Ge, wary of exposure, had incapacitated him. Now awake, Wang Yicheng seemed slightly disoriented. "They sent me to deceive you into entering, I refused, so they beat me, compelled me to crawl up the stairs with a crippled leg. I obeyed them, yet they're still unwilling to spare you. Remember, irrespective of who urges you to venture to the top-floor restroom of the teaching building, you must not go! Never!" The weakness in Wang Yicheng's voice and his body's extreme tremors suggested he was on the brink. "Did they also approach others to entice Lin Sisi?" "I don't know, but I've disclosed everything to the teacher, why hasn't he arrived yet!" Wang Yicheng grew anxious, his sole hope for salvation being that teacher, who seemed absent, perhaps sharing the aversion towards Lin Sisi. "It's fine, I only intend to look." "Don't! Please, don't go in!" Wang Yicheng mistook Chen Ge for Lin Sisi, revealing his heartfelt guilt and desire for atonement. With the door within reach, it was unthinkable for Chen Ge to retreat, particularly with Zhang Ju's assistance. This increasingly potent half-red garment was Chen Ge's steadfast support. Wang Yicheng's arms tightened, veins bulging with exertion, desperately trying to prevent Chen Ge's entry, likely to avoid witnessing a replay of past tragedy. The restroom at the teaching building's pinnacle lay at the corridor's far end, the air tainted with the acrid scent of disinfectant, wall tiles marred by age-old yellowish-brown stains, the floor speckled with lingering water stains and an array of numerous and distinct shoe prints. The restroom door was bolted; Chen Ge forced it open. Slowly pushing open the creaking wooden door, Chen Ge retreated a step, warily eyeing the interior. The East Campus restroom appeared entirely unlike its West Campus counterpart – grimy and chaotic, as if forsaken by the school authorities, untouched by cleaning or visitation. "Has this restroom remained sealed since Lin Sisi's incident?" Chen Ge inquired, turning to Wang Yicheng, who by then had become speechless, his body convulsing as though stricken with illness. In comparison to the West Campus, this restroom imparted an even more authentic sensation to Chen Ge, who entered with Wang Yicheng on his back. Upon entry, Wang Yicheng instantly shut his eyes, neither wishing to witness nor recollect. "This chamber emits a different aura than the others." Zhang Ju surveyed the surroundings; the walls were veined with blood-like filaments, entwining the entire restroom in their web. The murals of ghostly visages on the walls had blurred, akin to memories on the brink of being forsaken. Those withered blood veins traversed every image on the walls, shrouding them, as if yearning to forget their existence. Chen Ge reached the first cubicle and extended Lin Sisi's cellphone into the slit, the screen revealing several figures in motion. "Who lurks within?" Chen Ge yanked open the cubicle door, the ensuing tableau defying his expectations. Within lay a mannequin, donned in black leather shoes and aged between thirty and forty, bearing a striking resemblance to Teacher Bai whom Chen Ge had previously encountered. "A pair of shoes adorned the West Campus restroom, whereas an actual mannequin occupies the first cubicle of the East Campus – why this discrepancy?" The cubicle's Teacher Bai mannequin was posed with head bowed, hands clasped behind its head, standing erect as if acknowledging a misdeed. No anomalies detected through his shadow pupil, Chen Ge lastly aimed Lin Sisi's phone at the cubicle for a snapshot. The captured image on the screen brought him astonishment. While the mannequin stood as Teacher Bai, the cellphone portrayed a faceless boy, hands behind his head, mirroring Teacher Bai's posture. "Could this faceless boy be Lin Sisi? Had Teacher Bai once punished him in this manner? Could he now be employing a similar method of retribution against Teacher Bai?" Chapter 817: Will You Be My Friend? When Chen Ge pushed open the second cubicle, he found a slender male mannequin inside, its posture contorted and deformed, surrounded by mud and refuse. 'It bears a striking resemblance to Wang Yicheng.' The mannequin in the second cubicle and the Wang Yicheng that Chen Ge was carrying both donned blue sneakers, indicating the mannequin represented Wang Yicheng. Chen Ge raised his phone to capture the second cubicle; the image on the screen was harrowing. The scapegoat was cornered into the cubicle by a mob, who threw garbage at him without mercy. The scapegoat in the image offered no resistance, suffering the abuse in silence. In the third cubicle, the mannequin wore glasses and was doused in red paint, standing blankly against the cubicle wall. This mannequin shared a resemblance with the tall, slender boy Chen Ge had encountered in Dormitory 413. With the lessons from his previous experiences, Chen Ge directed his phone camera at the cubicle. A boy with no facial features appeared on the screen, isolated in the cubicle, as anonymous aggressors doused him with paint. His once-clean clothes were now tainted, with the paint trailing down. The boy kept his head down, uttering not a word. 'These bullies have completely lost their sense of humanity,' Chen Ge observed as he opened the fourth cubicle, which was devoid of any clothing; wet garments were discarded next to the squat toilet. Chen Ge took out his phone and filmed the fourth cubicle, the screen displaying the scapegoat as he slowly stripped off his paint-smeared clothes under a deluge of water. The fifth cubicle, the sixth cubicle... Each unveiled a scene more distressing than the last, showcasing the depth of cruelty people can reach in their frenzy, as they cast out all their negative emotions onto a single individual. Initially, Chen Ge's sole intent upon opening the first cubicle was to uncover the truth; to him, everything here was unrelated, and he was merely a bystander, wishing only to free himself from victimhood. However, after witnessing the scenes within six cubicles, his heart had imperceptibly changed; his expression darkened, an expression that would surely surprise those who knew him, for it was rare to see such an emotion on this man. The transformation of expression is a sign of emotional tumult. When feelings surface, vulnerabilities become exposed. Hence, Chen Ge always maintained a facade of calm during his quests with the black cellphone. 'Are these still children?' Chen Ge looked up at the seventh cubicle, the sole one without a mannequin or a door panel. The hinge was savagely destroyed, leaving behind wood shavings. The door to the seventh cubicle had been forcibly opened. The door panel had disappeared, and the interior of the cubicle was overrun with those blood-vein-like stains. Indeed, these stains that had defiled the restroom originated from this cubicle; the seventh was the source of all the bloodshed. 'Was this where Lin Sisi was confined initially?' The black and crimson blood veins, which resembled desiccated vines, climbed the walls as if obscuring something. Chen Ge took out Lin Sisi's phone, maximized the screen brightness, and started recording the cubicle. Clutching his drenched clothing, the scapegoat was covered in sewage and paint that flowed down his body in a macabre array of colors, evoking the visage of a monster latched onto his skin. The door of the restroom cubicle seemed to be blocked from the outside, and the boy with no face was seen stooping over, embracing his garments, and repeatedly slamming against the door panel. Without a face, his emotions were hidden; his cries silent. It was unknown whether he wept or called out for help. All that was visible was the relentless assault on the door until it broke open. Barefoot, he stood at the entrance of the cubicle, his attire soaked with paint and sewage. His arms drooped, the same ones that had battered the door now lacerated by wood splinters, with blood tracing lines across his skin while paint infiltrated the wounds. An oppressive, unbearable constriction surrounded him, making it difficult to breathe. His neck twisted, and the face devoid of features scanned the vacant restroom. The tormentors had left, but their venomous words seemed to still echo within. The boy lingered at the doorway for a long while before slowly lifting his hands, putting on his sodden clothes one piece at a time. Aside from his arms, his body bore no injuries, yet he shivered with pain. His trousers were split down the middle, and there was a large hole in the back of his shirt. Once fully clothed, his reflection on the wet floor mirrored a terrifying monster too dreadful to behold. He wiped his face, attempting to take a step toward the restroom door. The light from the corridor flooded the restroom; the exit was so bright that it laid bare the boy's present state, so bright there was no place to hide. The step he took forward was retracted. Wearing his stained clothes, the boy retreated back into the seventh cubicle. Leaning against the cubicle wall, his body slid down to the ground, curling up in the corner. The face lacking features faced the restroom door as if waiting for the lights to go out. The story on the cellphone screen did not conclude there; the child watched for a long time, then slowly raised his head. The face without features turned towards Chen Ge, as if aware of his observer. 'Will you be my friend?' This question echoed in Chen Ge's ears, clear and distinct. However, when he looked towards the source of the voice, there was nothing. 'Could it have come from the cellphone? Impossible.' The recording stopped at the last scene, the scapegoat curled up in the corner of the cubicle with his face directed at Chen Ge, as if expecting his response. 'I am willing to be your friend, although your plea sounds akin to a curse.' Curses did not intimidate Chen Ge; it was a cursed love letter that had altered his life. Without that letter, he would have perished at Wang Qi's hands during his first assignment. Chen Ge accepted, but the scapegoat on the cellphone screen remained in the same posture. Besides the phone, the seventh cubicle was empty, yet through the camera of the phone, the scapegoat could be clearly seen. 'Can you hear me?' Chen Ge attempted to communicate, but without success. He waited for a while, and then the image on the cellphone screen changed once more. The door of the seventh cubicle swung open, and a blood-red hand stretched inside. This hand gently grabbed the scapegoat, as if whispering something to him. The boy nodded slightly in response. After that, the scapegoat was led by the hand, walking towards 'the other side of the door,' disappearing from sight. 'That bloodied hand, did it reach out from 'the door'? What was whispered to the boy?' Chen Ge wondered. 'The phrase spoken by the owner of the bloodied hand to the scapegoat—was it not *Will you be my friend?*' 'The scapegoat consented, and then, he was gone?' Chen Ge pondered meticulously. The scapegoat was Lin Sisi; he had shown no intention of pushing the door, yet the bloodied hand had emerged from within. This indicated that a door had always been part of the restroom cubicle. The owner of the bloodied hand extended an invitation to Lin Sisi, and ultimately, Lin Sisi accepted, implying that the bloodied hand was indeed the Door Pusher. Chapter 818: He and I May Not Be Enemies After a labyrinthine quest, Chen Ge at last uncovered the true master of the Ghost School—though it was merely a glimpse of a hand, it signified a substantial advance for Chen Ge. "I just heard someone whisper in my ear—'Would you like to be my friend?'" "That voice didn't emanate from the phone; I'm convinced it came directly from beside my ear." "Maybe that inquiry wasn't intended for Lin Sisi but for me instead." Chen Ge glanced back to witness the restroom stalls where the ominous black and crimson blood veins had begun to drop off massively, akin to autumn leaves, utterly devoid of life. "Did you accept his proposition?" Wang Yicheng, whose eyes remained firmly shut on Chen Ge's back, unexpectedly broke the silence. He laid his head on Chen Ge's shoulder, his voice so subdued it was almost inaudible. "I suppose, he appeared quite pitiable." Chen Ge could feel Wang Yicheng's body temperature steadily declining as their bodies remained entwined in the dimly lit restroom. "All his friends... they're all deceased, every single one!" The sound of dripping water echoed from behind Chen Ge, his shoulder growing damp. When he turned, his left shoulder was soaked in blood. The brilliance of the red was somewhat blinding. "You..." Chen Ge dislodged Wang Yicheng from his back. The youth's hands flailed helplessly, clawing at the void, as tears of blood seeped from his sealed eyes: "Do you remember anything?" Revisiting this place had triggered Wang Yicheng’s memory. Without opening his eyes, merely by hearing Chen Ge's words, he realized what had unfolded. "There's no escape now. You've given your word to him. He will come for you, no matter where you try to hide, he will find you!" Wang Yicheng's voice had undergone a drastic change, a stark contrast to his earlier cowardice. "If he doesn't come seeking me, I shall seek him out. I've always been keen on making friends, in every conceivable way." Chen Ge had numerous friends, though currently none were in proximity, hence his eagerness to form new bonds. The blood streaming from Wang Yicheng's eyes cascaded down his face, staining his jacket crimson; the vivid blood on his skin blossomed like petals. This seemingly fragile boy bore the potential to ascend to the ranks of the Red Garment. "My curiosity about the school's owner intensifies—how did he manage to entice each of you through the door?" Chen Ge had not anticipated the club members he had encountered by chance to be as extraordinary. Luck was a factor, but it also accentuated the dread that pervaded the Ghost School. A mere half-Red Garment was sufficient to support an ordinary two-star scenario, yet within the Ghost School, Chen Ge had already encountered several Red Garments and potential aspirants. "Are your humorous quips a facade for the fear within?" Upon hearing Wang Yicheng's suggestion, Chen Ge was further convinced that the other had regained his memory. Wang Yicheng of the past was submissive and compliant, never one to voice dissent. "I am not jesting. To hold the despair necessary to open the 'Door' also implies having once harbored hope, no matter how shattered it may now be. I genuinely wish to assist him, and befriending him is merely the first step." Chen Ge, bearing Wang Yicheng on his back, made his way towards the restroom exit. "Have you observed that most children here have distorted childhoods, burdened by physical anomalies or personalities deformed by external influences? Each harbors memories too excruciating to revisit." "What are you getting at?" "I am fascinated by the school owner's background. What kind of experiences might have propelled a Door Pusher to pry open this 'Door'?" "To accept being his friend is to be forever retained. The school wasn't always this vast; it expanded as despair and agony were amassed." After Wang Yicheng's confession, his eyes ceased to bleed, but his body persisted in shuddering. "You appear to be privy to a great deal." Chen Ge noted the parallels between this school and his Haunted House; the Ghost School ceaselessly sought out students rife with despair, luring those who radiated desolation, in contrast to Chen Ge's Haunted House which welcomed all comers: "This school has stood for many years, hasn't it?" "The only memory I have is of being here as soon as I opened my eyes. I lack Zhang Ju's experiences; I perished in this school and was reborn within these walls, forgetting much in the process. All I know is the school has been incessantly expanding." "Why are you present here? Was it Lin Sisi's retribution?" Chen Ge probed further. Wang Yicheng paused significantly before answering: "I am the sole individual Lin Sisi spared. My arrival here was because, after Lin Sisi vanished, I became his surrogate. The students' trepidation and unease transformed into violence inflicted upon me. On one night, as I neared the brink of collapse, that door found me." "So you simply entered? As Zhang Ju described, the door initially appeared far from one's resting place, then slowly approached day by day... Chen Ge didn't finish his thought before Wang Yicheng interrupted him. "He was entirely passive; conversely, I was proactive. I sought a hideaway; besides..." Wang Yicheng hesitated before revealing another secret: "The hand that extended from the door was daubed in various hues; it was Lin Sisi's hand, inviting me. And I desired to offer him an apology in person. That day, I had indeed alerted a teacher, yet they failed to appear." "What else might you divulge about Lin Sisi and the door?" "Nothing further. Upon crossing the door's threshold, I never encountered Lin Sisi. Even to this day, I have not seen him." Wang Yicheng released his grip: "You can let me down now." "Are you certain you've spoken no falsehoods?" Chen Ge set Wang Yicheng down: "At the entrance of the West Campus restroom, as your memory began to fray, the school's manager swiftly emerged. Had I not rendered you unconscious, we would undoubtedly have been apprehended. Your circumstances diverge significantly from those of Zhang Ju and Zhu Long." "Perhaps it's because Lin Sisi was his friend, and I was a friend to Lin Sisi." They passed seven cubicles in sequence, each chronicling an ordeal Lin Sisi had suffered. The phone had likely captured only a portion. "It's unfathomable to consider what the Door Pusher had endured previously." As they were about to exit the restroom, Chen Ge glanced at the seventh cubicle: "It is confirmed, the door resides within the seventh cubicle. To comprehend the school's proprietor, one need only investigate all events that transpired within the school's restrooms." Equipped with the clues at hand, Chen Ge charted his next steps—to visit the school archives, the library, and as vowed to Zhou Tu, the oil painting room in the laboratory building. Chapter 819: They Have Arrived The school's Archives Room might contain information about the mysterious school owner, while the Library could be harboring a mirror that leads to the Blood-Red World. The Oil Painting Room in the Laboratory Building is where Chen Ge promised to take Zhou Tu. 'Where should we start?' Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu. 'I know the Art Club's location, and I've seen the scenes from your dreams. I can take you there anytime, but are you truly prepared for the awakening of your memories?' Zhou Tu had limited interactions with Chen Ge, and he was momentarily disconcerted by the sudden question. Before regaining his memory, he was curious about what he had lost, but after witnessing the fates of Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng, he hesitated. 'Are you prepared to confront your past? Without your memories, you're nothing more than an inconsequential student in this place; you can live contentedly, endlessly reliving a peaceful, beautiful day. Once your memories awaken, you'll be hunted by the School Managers, with no escape.' Chen Ge's probing of Zhou Tu was deliberate. Among all the club members, Zhou Tu had the most resolve. 'I've thought it over, and I've decided it's better to reclaim my memories. Without my past, any comfort is just self-deception.' Zhou Tu's gaze turned toward Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. 'I wonder if my true self will be so terrifying that I'll scare myself to tears.' 'Maybe you should give it some more thought,' Zhang Ju said with a raspy voice, turning away his charred face. 'Your aura gives off a discomforting feeling. The real you must be a frightening entity.' Zhou Tu was speechless, his gaze wavering, his determination seemingly faltering once again. 'Let's go to the Archives Room first. You still have ample time to think it over.' Chen Ge patted Zhou Tu on the shoulder. 'Don't feel pressured; I respect whatever choice you make.' 'Thank you.' Zhou Tu bowed his head in contemplation. Zhang Ju nudged Chen Ge. 'His true form must be intimidating. If he regains his memory, whatever we plan to do next will likely be easier.' 'Everyone has their own path; I won't interfere.' 'Isn't the purpose of your help in recovering our memories to make us remember our pasts, increase our strength, and then assist you with your goals?' Zhang Ju was perplexed, recalling Chen Ge's past statements about their mutual benefit. 'I once read a line in a book: 'The rose doesn't question why; it blooms without seeking any reward.' Although I may not be as selfless, I've endured the same pain as you, and seeing you reminds me of myself.' Chen Ge looked seriously at the other club members. 'Also, let me be clear once more, our relationship isn't about using each other; it's about achieving success together. Mutual respect is fundamental.' Hearing Chen Ge's words, all the fierce spirits seemed to momentarily forget that the man before them was merely human. Perhaps he had yet to recover his own memories. Zhang Ju and Zhu Long nodded, following Chen Ge's footsteps. Wang Yicheng, with tears of blood in his eyes, seemed to endorse Chen Ge even more. Trailing behind, Zhou Tu looked pensive, his eyes slowly firming with resolve. Returning to the corridor, Chen Ge hadn't walked far when he sensed something was wrong. The air was thick with a foul odor, reminiscent of the one he had encountered in the Laboratory Building. An ominous premonition crept over him. The further he advanced, the more suffocating the atmosphere became, as if walking at the bottom of a frigid lake, with a chill seeping in from all around. 'Have the Inverted Monsters returned?' Chen Ge chose not to look down; acknowledging the situation would only disrupt his judgment. His priority was to evacuate the Teaching Building as quickly as possible. Standing beside Zhang Ju, Chen Ge's eyes narrowed, and he whispered, 'Do you see those creatures in the corridor?' 'Creatures?' Zhang Ju focused on the corridor, blood dripping from his coat. 'There seems to be something there, but they don't seem capable of harming us.' Before he could finish, Zhang Ju's hair began to float upward, as if pulled by an invisible infant in the darkness. Small cuts started to appear on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng, attracted by those beings. 'I can't see them; how are they causing me harm?' Blood oozed from the scars on Zhang Ju's face, and his blood vessels danced under his skin. Although his memory had returned, he still hadn't mastered how to wield this newfound power. 'If we look at things upside down, they become visible, but I don't recommend doing that.' 'Why not?' 'Because once you see them, you'll be plunged into even greater despair.' Chen Ge gestured for everyone to leave the building quickly. It was unclear whether the monsters were attacking out of instinct or if someone was directing them. If it was the latter, the situation was dire. The stench grew stronger, and more wounds appeared on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. Notably, with each new injury, a thin black thread would burrow into their bodies, resembling a curse. By the time they reached the third-floor corner, Wang Yicheng couldn't continue. His steps grew weaker. 'I feel like many things are tearing at my flesh, and my memory is blurring again.' 'Mr. Bai, the situation is bleak. There's an overwhelming amount of filth downstairs,' Zhou Tu said softly. Upon reaching the third floor, a pungent stench assaulted them, strangely emanating from their proximity. Looking down, Zhou Tu, much like when he picked up the Kitchen Knife, peered upward from below at the source of the stench. Between him and Wang Yicheng, an inverted face lay on the ground. The creature's clothes clung to its flesh as if it had no skin, with blood vessels pulsating beneath the fabric, blood mingling with the garment, dyeing the entire outfit a deep red. 'Wang, Wang Yicheng, that thing is right in front of you!' Zhou Tu screamed, his memory still dormant. The sudden sight nearly made him fall down the stairs. 'I told you not to look. Out of sight, out of mind.' Chen Ge picked up Wang Yicheng and stepped on the most fetid spot before dashing downstairs. Zhou Tu clutched his chest; where Chen Ge had stepped was precisely where the monster's head was. 'Got it, I won't forget.' As they descended to the second floor, the stench filled the hallway, and Zhu Long, with his memory fading, also became a target for the creatures. Zhang Ju could still resist, but Zhu Long and Wang Yicheng were faltering. They could only continue with the assistance of Chen Ge and Zhou Tu. Chapter 820: Archives Room The situation continued to spiral downwards, and now Zhou Tu found himself under the malevolent gaze of the monsters, as the first laceration appeared on his fingers. 'Mr. Bai, what do we do now?' With no alternatives left, Chen Ge gritted his teeth, determined to evacuate everyone, even if it meant dragging their mangled bodies, devoid of any capacity to move. The reek that filled the air was almost suffocating. As Chen Ge, burdened with Wang Yicheng, neared the first-floor corner, a sharp pain suddenly pierced his chest. Stumbling, he nearly fell to the ground. Looking down, he noticed a sharp nail had punctured his chest. 'The curse of Dormitory 413?' He instantly made the connection, his gaze shifting to his Shadow Pupil. What was once a normal shadow now twisted unnaturally, as if the 'person' within writhed in excruciating pain. 'Is he too being targeted?' The club members were at their breaking point, their bodies covered in grotesque wounds that painted a terrifying picture. 'The exit is within sight, don't stop!' Chen Ge's resolve was unyielding; pain was an old companion to him. Removing the nail, he forced himself to run, knowing each step brought him closer to the glimmer of hope. 'Thud!' Zhou Tu, carrying Zhu Long, fell on the stairs. His right hand was marred with deep cuts that seemed on the brink of tearing apart. 'My hand for drawing is...' For Chen Ge, leading just one person out was challenging enough; additional burdens were simply unthinkable. 'Persevere! We're almost at the first floor!' Their legs felt as if filled with lead, their movements increasingly heavy. The stench on the first floor was even more potent than above, with more Fierce Ghosts lying in ambush. While all hope seemed forsaken for everyone but Chen Ge, the stench in the air suddenly lightened, as if some unknown force had drawn the monsters away. 'Now's our chance!' Seizing Zhou Tu and shouldering Wang Yicheng, Chen Ge raced with all his might. Upon reaching the ground floor, he spotted an ominous dark figure standing at the other end of the corridor. The figure's stature closely resembled that of Chang Gu, with a Shadow Pupil emitting a sinister crimson gleam in his left eye and his coat drenched in blood, clutching something in his hand. 'Chang Gu?' Chen Ge shouted, but the figure did not respond, instead turning and leaving, causing the foul odor to dissipate further. 'Was it he who drew the monsters away?' The Chang Gu in Chen Ge's recollections was weak and timid, a far cry from the shadow he'd just seen. 'What has happened to him since entering the 'door' mere seconds before me?' With the shadow drawing away most of the monsters, Chen Ge hurriedly led the club members out of the Teaching Building. 'Mr. Bai, what was with those monsters earlier? Why could they only be seen when looking upside down? And why did they attack only Wang Yicheng and Zhang Ju, not you?' Zhou Tu collapsed on the ground, feeling as if the stench had seeped into his core. 'Those entities are probably tools for punishing students used by the school authorities. It's even possible that they were once students who broke the school's rules.' Chen Ge didn't expect that the entities would not fear even the Red Garments; they had lost all reason, becoming complete lunatics. 'The school's master wants to create a perfect 'paradise' behind the 'door.' Remembering your past goes against his wishes, so naturally, he will target you.' Chen Ge checked Wang Yicheng and Zhang Ju's wounds; the black tendrils had burrowed into their flesh. Near their wounds, a faint stench could still be detected: 'Be very careful; those monsters might be trying to turn you into one of their own kind.' Standing outside the Teaching Building, Chen Ge used his Shadow Pupil to scan the area, but the shadow that had saved them was nowhere to be seen. 'If it really is Chang Gu, why hasn't he sought me out? Is it not the right time for our meeting yet? Or has he already become a target?' Chen Ge had little interaction with Chang Gu, requiring him to guess at Chang Gu's thoughts before making the right decision. 'It's beneficial to have someone distracting them.' Chen Ge helped Wang Yicheng to his feet. 'Let's head to the office building now; that's where the archives should be.' ... The office building on the West Campus was situated close to the perimeter wall. From its highest point, one could overlook both the East and West Campuses. 'The monsters I've seen in this school can be grouped into several categories: ordinary Fierce Ghosts and Obsessions, the Red Garments, the West Campus's white-coated managers with burn injuries, and the East Campus's upside-down, stench-emitting monsters. Apart from these, the most dangerous are the school's teachers and dormitory supervisors. We're about to enter the office building, and there's a high chance we'll encounter them, so everyone must be on high alert.' Knowing the dangers yet proceeding, Chen Ge was no stranger to such ventures; however, for the other club members, this was a formidable challenge. 'Mr. Bai, aren't you a teacher too?' 'Do you consider me harmless?' Chen Ge responded offhandedly without looking back, leading the way into the office building. He had been to the office building on the West Campus before, but he was taken aback by the stark contrast in the interior design of the East Campus's office building. The West Campus's office was pristine and orderly; the East Campus's version was dominated by an oppressive quiet and gloom. The floors were dirty, littered with mud-stained footprints, the walls scratched and stained, the once white paintwork now a dingy yellow with large patches of mold. 'Do the East Campus teachers really work in this place?' Zhou Tu was incredulous. 'Here, the teachers' duty is not to educate but to manage you. They spend most of their time with students; the office building is more of a symbolic fixture.' Chen Ge tried an office door, which opened easily without a lock. The room was filled with decrepit furnishings that seemed to date back many years. 'I've been here before; I know where the archives are.' Zhang Ju's voice was cold, his demeanor having grown increasingly somber since the return of his memories. 'When did you come here?' Zhou Tu, slightly wary of the current Zhang Ju, inadvertently lowered his voice. 'Before Chang Wenyu deceived me, I came here in secret to understand what this school really was,' Zhang Ju led the way. 'Stay close; this place makes me uneasy, there might be something extremely dangerous lurking.' Whether the building's entities had sensed Zhang Ju's presence, or for some other reason, they faced no dangers along the way and safely reached the third floor. 'This is the archives. Let's quickly find what we need and leave without delay. Don't linger too long; I have a feeling that we're not alone here.' Zhang Ju opened the archive room's door to reveal several rusted metal cabinets and four rows of wooden bookshelves. Chapter 821: The Great Fire! The archive room was steeped in a musty miasma, with Chen Ge being the first to brave its confines, shielding his mouth and nose with the crook of his arm. The wooden bookshelves, relics of a bygone era, stood in stark contrast to the rusty metal cabinets beside them. 'These bookshelves and metal cabinets appear to be relics from different schools,' Chen Ge mused, as he gingerly withdrew a document from the wooden shelf, only for it to crumble slightly under his touch—a victim of neglect, woodworm, and dampness. Unfolding the damaged file with care, Chen Ge's eyes fell upon content that ignited his curiosity: 'A Donor Appreciation List? This seems eerily familiar...' A memory of a similar list in the Principal's office at Sunset Middle School flickered in his mind. 'An exact match! I've encountered this very list in the Principal's office at Sunset Middle School!' His visits to Sunset Middle School had been numerous in his quest to uncover the whereabouts of its old Principal. The school had become an enigma, a two-star horror scene that even a thorough search had failed to unravel. 'The world behind the door is shaped by the memories of the Door Pusher; this school is peculiar, seemingly a tapestry woven from the collective memories of all those trapped within its domain.' Chen Ge pondered. 'With the exception of the old Principal, everyone from Sunset Middle School has taken up residence in my haunted house. Could the presence of the Donor Appreciation List from Sunset Middle School here suggest that the old Principal is among us in this school as well?' As he scrutinized the musty shelves, a realization dawned upon him, 'Could these articles have been transplanted here from Sunset Middle School? Is a fragment of that two-star scenario concealed within this very room? It appears that my ties with the old Principal are destined to be profound.' Placing the document back in its original spot, Chen Ge's expression was one of enigmatic thoughtfulness. 'Before unlocking the Psychic Ghost School Trial Task, there were nine prerequisite tasks. Might all nine bear a special connection to the Psychic Ghost School?' 'Chen Ge, what have you unearthed?' Zhu Long inquired, approaching with a clutch of wrinkled newspapers rescued from a hidden corner. He indicated a prominent article, 'Examine this headline.' 'The Teaching Building was engulfed by an inexplicable blaze, with several students trapped in the restroom, heroically rescued by firefighters.' The article commanded the newspaper's focal point, demanding attention. 'From the layout and prose, the reporter behind this seems quite youthful.' Handling the newspaper, now blemished with mold and stained beyond clarity, Chen Ge surmised, 'It must be the school's newspaper.' Sunset Middle School, a private welfare entity, had neither the resources nor the capacity to produce a school newspaper. Sifting through the assortment of newspapers, Chen Ge's gaze continually returned to one recurring name—West City Private Academy. This institution featured prominently across multiple reports. 'West City Private Academy—that's where Zhang Ya was a student, wasn't it?' He recalled his first 'encounter' with the lady in red at the forsaken academy, and how he had ultimately penetrated Zhang Ya's heart. 'Was there a conflagration in the teaching building of West City Private Academy?' Memories of his past visit surfaced; the image of charred stairway handrails was particularly vivid. 'Curious. Not only West City Private Academy but every derelict school I've stepped foot in shows signs of having been kissed by flames.' Revisiting the newspaper offered by Zhu Long, he noted the account of six individuals being saved from the top-floor restroom. While lauded as heroes, the firefighters' bravery was overshadowed by a minor report in the corner that subtly referenced the fire and the tragic death of a student. 'How could a fire erupt in a restroom, and moreover, why would those children linger in the school's top-floor restroom after the day had ended?' Connecting the fragmented reports, Chen Ge's acute perception homed in on the crux of the matter, 'The blaze raged on the fourth floor, its flames confined to the restroom with students inside. The firefighters rescued six, but one was lost to the inferno, suggesting that seven souls were present in that restroom!' The catalyst of the blaze had vanished into the annals of the past, with not a trace in any document or archive. The child claimed by the flames had become an unspeakable taboo. 'Such a catastrophe also befell West City Private Academy? Yet, during my visit, there was no inkling of the 'abnormal'?' Puzzlement etched Chen Ge's features, 'If the Door Pusher was the child who perished in the fire, then he must be West City Private Academy's very own. However, the academy's ascension to a three-star scenario was entirely due to Zhang Ya!' With West City Private Academy now an integral component of the haunted house scene, Chen Ge was convinced of Zhang Ya's position as the most formidable specter within its walls. 'Each three-star scenario is anchored by a door, yet West City Private Academy stands as an exception—despite its three-star status, it lacks a door.' His contemplative gaze fell upon his shadow as he silently uttered a name, but the silence persisted, unanswered. 'The classification of West City Private Academy as a three-star scenario by the black cellphone owes entirely to Zhang Ya. To my knowledge, Zhang Ya has never opened any door, nor did I encounter one during my visit to West City Private Academy...' As his grasp on the newspaper relaxed, an image of a red dress materialized in his thoughts. 'Zhang Ya, the door that ought to exist yet remains absent, the Door Pusher...' These notions interwove within Chen Ge's mind, forging a startling hypothesis. His eyes widened as a chill coursed through him, 'Has Zhang Ya, perchance, consumed West City Private Academy's Door Pusher?' Such conjecture could illuminate why Zhang Ya was an anomaly, her power unfathomably immense. 'What transformation might befall a door once its Door Pusher has been devoured?' Chen Ge entertained a myriad of possibilities, 'Bound by her Obsession, Zhang Ya did not become a 'Door Pusher'. A door orphaned of its Door Pusher should spiral into chaos, akin to the one in Liwan Town, yet no such calamity has ensued. Rather, the door manifests solely beside those children steeped in desperation... Hold on! Is it in pursuit of a new 'Door Pusher'? Chapter 822: The Endless Pursuit of Despondent Children Chen Ge was startled by his own speculation—an ownerless door, relentlessly seeking children trapped in despair, expending years to evolve into a four-star scenario? This idea seemed preposterous, compelling Chen Ge to calm his racing thoughts. 'Thirteen easels occupy the Laboratory Building's art room, each one used by an individual privy to the school's sinister secrets, painting with strokes that seem to bleed in reverse. They likely represent the door's chosen thirteen.' A single entity would scarcely sustain a four-star scene unless they transcended the Red Specters. But what of a union of Red Specters? The outcome would be unpredictable, for he had never witnessed so many congregate. 'Thirteen, a number fraught with ominous connotations.' Chen Ge glanced at Zhou Tu, who had been searching for the Art Club and had dreamt of the art room's scenes. Zhou Tu must be one of those thirteen artists. 'The door must have its selection criteria. Zhang Ju clearly doesn't qualify, but Zhou Tu appears to have met them.' Initially, Chen Ge had little expectation for the art room, but after analyzing the situation, his perspective shifted: 'Zhou Tu's memory is the key.' Among the club members, Zhou Tu was the most enigmatic, and Chen Ge had to prepare for two possibilities. Either Zhou Tu would regain his memory and divulge everything, or upon awakening, become an adversary. 'This is a significant catch; have I been too casual with him?' Chen Ge's gaze fixed on Zhou Tu, causing him to tremble. 'Teacher Bai, I'm going to investigate over there.' Zhou Tu hastily fabricated an excuse and hurried to the archives room's deepest section. 'Why the rush? The one who should be apprehensive is me.' Chen Ge resumed his search of the room, convinced that the archive room harbored additional revelations. Soon, Chen Ge unearthed several reports related to fires. Fire seemed to hold a special significance in this school—symbolizing both annihilation and rebirth. 'A fire occurred at Sunset Middle School, the stairways bear scorch marks, the school's original site was a crematorium, and now I've discovered that West City Private Academy also experienced a fire. Are these mere coincidences, or do they suggest a deeper link?' In addition to the fire reports, Chen Ge discovered several well-preserved student files at the bottom of a metal cabinet; two in particular were noteworthy. One file bore the name Lin Sisi, complete with evaluations from teachers and peers. His classmates shunned him, and teachers rarely intervened. An orphan without a mother and with a father convicted of murder, Lin Sisi had been adopted but repeatedly ran away from foster homes, causing much frustration. For Lin Sisi, the sole figure of genuine support was an intern from the Hanjiang Welfare Home. This recent graduate had funded Lin Sisi's elementary education and even attended his parent-teacher conferences, despite their own precarious future. The teacher's notes suggested that only in the intern's presence would Lin Sisi's 'hyperactivity' improve. Absent from the file were Lin Sisi's photograph and detailed information; however, one element was immaculately preserved—a handwritten signature: Gu Youjia. The document was frayed and riddled with holes, yet the section with the guardian's signature remained untouched. 'Gu Youjia, Hanjiang Welfare Home—if I make it out alive, a visit might be in order.' Chen Ge murmured as if to himself, yet with an undertone that suggested he might be speaking to someone else. He then examined another file, older than the rest. It lacked a name or any official records, featuring only a poignant sentence. 'Just endure a little longer, and all will be well. They can't torment me forever; eventually, I will grow up, too.' The writing, twisted and uneven, seemed not the hand of a teacher but that of a child, penned perhaps while nursing an injury. 'Endless forbearance only emboldens the tormentor. In any context, those who derive pleasure from inflicting pain will neither empathize nor reflect.' Chen Ge captured the records with Lin Sisi's mobile phone before meticulously returning them to their original place. 'The earliest file likely belongs to the true Door Pusher. After opening the door, it's possible his nature underwent a drastic transformation.' 'If the Door Pusher consumed by Zhang Ya is indeed the same individual, then even post-mortem, his door might persist in fulfilling his intentions. To improve my odds of enduring beyond the door, it would be prudent to act in accord with his will.' Chen Ge had never been a victim of school violence himself. His nearest brush occurred in elementary school when the teacher prompted students to donate their unused toys to a welfare institution. When everyone else had contributed, Chen Ge remained silent, clutching his backpack. The classroom bullies lunged for his bag, and in the scuffle, the zipper gave way, unveiling an array of horror props—fake bloodied appendages. The lifelike fingers rolled chaotically across the classroom like sticks of chalk, and the plastic intestine convulsed atop a desk, petrifying the students and the oncoming teacher. Upon the deputy principal's arrival, they inquired about Chen Ge's family background. That evening, the police summoned Chen Ge's parents to the school and interrogated them for hours. Ironically, Chen Ge may have been the only student whose bullying incident resulted in his parents facing a police inquiry. Nonetheless, the ordeal had a fortunate repercussion—no peer dared to bully Chen Ge again. 'One must never capitulate to school violence.' His statement bore additional significance—in this institution, some victims had become the new instigators of aggression. The Psychic Ghost School continued to expand, with the sinister, unblemished door approaching every despondent child, assimilating them into its fold, reenacting their nightmares beyond, using their souls as bricks to construct a mausoleum over reality. After an extensive search in the archive room, a familiar stench prompted Chen Ge to promptly lead the club members out of the office building. 'Teacher, we're fortunate; those foul-smelling entities only pursued us at the very end,' Zhu Long murmured. 'It's not fortune; someone lured those entities away from us.' While Chen Ge couldn't confirm if Chang Gu was their benefactor, he sensed something momentous transpiring within the school, likely tied to the Chang siblings. 'Let's proceed to the Laboratory Building.' Chen Ge's gaze settled on Zhou Tu: 'You've made your decision, have you not?' Chapter 823: The Red Garment Club Memory is an enigmatic force—akin to snow that never thaws or a fleeting beam of light, elusive when sought and persistent when desired to be forgotten. Zhou Tu had been haunted by a dream for an extended period, cognizant of his distinctiveness yet hesitant to accept it, eventually plunging into profound self-doubt. That was until he encountered Chen Ge. This individual was the first to validate Zhou Tu; the dreams he experienced were not mere illusions but tangible realities—indelible marks seared deep into his psyche. Zhou Tu obtained the clarity he sought, yet it drew him into a dangerous vortex. He was at a crossroads, unsure if trailing Chen Ge would lead to his ruin or salvation. 'Have you made up your mind?' Chen Ge stood before Zhou Tu, inquiring once again. 'I...' 'If you find it challenging to decide, perhaps consider his situation.' Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng unexpectedly joined them, flanking Zhou Tu: 'Zhu Long, come here.' Lagging behind, Zhu Long bore an unsettling gaze, as if flames were alight within, on the brink of a breakdown. 'What did you do to him?' Chen Ge fixated on Zhu Long's left hand, where the veins around his grasp on the black cellphone were pronounced. 'We discovered a fragment of an incomplete news report in the archives room. A courier, frequently sighted around the university, vanished on campus. After several days of police investigation, his mutilated corpse was found in the dissection room's storage area,' Zhang Ju handed Chen Ge a few tattered newspapers: 'The disfigured body they found—it was him, Zhu Long.' The shattered illusions triggered a flood of recollection in Zhu Long upon viewing the paper. His aspirations of scholarly success and university admission were merely a dream, strikingly remote from the grim reality he faced. The girl he admired excelled academically, securing a place at the prestigious Hanjiang Medical College, while he struggled to afford even the fees for repeating a semester. Poverty plagued his home, and his sole remaining relative was battling a severe illness, their health deteriorating steadily. Despite life's relentless onslaught, he persisted; he learned to tend to others and became the pillar of his household. In his job search, he was judged for his lackluster appearance, so he sheared off his unkempt hair; his tattoos scared potential customers, so he meticulously excised layers of skin with a blade. Unyielding, he eventually landed a job—a deliveryman. Diligent and amiable, with resilience in his eyes and a smile on his lips, he embraced life, his endeavors bringing him respect and stability. After a laborious summer, he grew familiar with his work, laboring late into the nights. His sole pleasure was fulfilling orders for Hanjiang Medical College. Each foray into the campus carried a sliver of hope; the knowledge that she was there was sufficient. Even a distant, surreptitious glance could buoy his spirits for the entire day. The campus was neither too large nor too small, but when they might cross paths was uncertain. He had fantasized about their encounter countless times, yet when she truly appeared, all his rehearsals proved futile. He was so nervous he couldn't speak, like a child whose secret had been unveiled. After that encounter, they exchanged contact details. The girl's unexpected initiative took him by surprise; she thrived on control, and Zhu Long mistook it for adoration. His compliance led to psychological abuse. The girl took pleasure in tormenting Zhu Long, incessantly asserting his insignificance. The self-respect he had fought so hard to build was gradually trampled upon, transforming Zhu Long into the girl's puppet, and most terrifyingly, he was oblivious to it. This straightforward, foolish boy was no match for the girl versed in anatomy and criminal psychology. He was the lamb, denuded and laid bare on her platter, helpless under her dominion. The torment extended from psychological to physical, and only at death's doorstep did Zhu Long realize the truth—alas, too late to alter his destiny. As blood drained from his wounds, clutching the pink cellphone, his gaze locked onto the newspaper in Chen Ge's hands—a mute testament to his fragmented memories. The dam holding back his memories, under incessant pressure, finally burst. 'Do you know what part of the human body is pink?' Veins stitched his skin as Zhu Long advanced toward Chen Ge: 'The flesh is most tender as a wound nears healing; she had a fondness for pink.' Zhu Long's body started to distort, his skin marred by suture marks, a testament to the atrocities he suffered post-mortem. 'Yet another victim to the half-red.' Chen Ge's expression remained unsettlingly serene. As Zhu Long came within a mere two steps, Chen Ge raised his arms, enveloping him in a gentle embrace: 'I want you to understand, no matter the circumstance or rationale, any harm inflicted upon you is inexcusable, even if cloaked in the guise of love.' Observing the boy before him, Chen Ge felt a twinge of compassion, patting Zhu Long's shoulder: 'Regardless of your present thoughts, I assure you, if we can escape this school, you shall have the opportunity to confront that girl once more.' As Chen Ge spoke, the bloodline threading through Zhu Long's form hesitated momentarily. Zhu Long peered into Chen Ge's eyes, then slowly bowed his head: 'A promise is a promise.' Clutching the pink cellphone tightly, Zhu Long silently retreated to Chen Ge's rear. As Zhu Long and Zhang Ju's garments increasingly reddened, they stood distinguished not as red garments but as the elite of the half-reds. With Wang Yicheng at their side, Chen Ge felt bolstered against the common red garments. 'It's time to proceed to the laboratory building.' Chen Ge refrained from further questioning Zhou Tu; the answer was apparent in his expression. The youth, having witnessed Zhu Long's plight, had embedded his nails into his flesh, harboring an unresolved desire, its essence now forgotten. Navigating through the thicket, Chen Ge guided the students toward the laboratory building, marking his second visit that night. 'The red garment likely remains within the duty room. Should we encounter him, it will be fitting to return his garment.' With newfound resolve, Chen Ge addressed the students gathered outside the edifice. 'This structure serves as the lair for the inverted monsters. We aim for the art club, located on the fourth floor. Upon inspection of that chamber, irrespective of Zhou Tu's memory resurgence, we must evacuate posthaste.' Chen Ge advanced first, nearing a window on the ground floor: 'Now, ascend with me.' The students exchanged wary glances before witnessing Chen Ge scale effortlessly to the second floor. 'I asserted he must be the physical education instructor.' For Zhang Ju, Zhu Long, and Wang Yicheng, with their recollections rekindled, scaling was inconsequential for specters. Only Zhou Tu confronted the climb with apprehension.
