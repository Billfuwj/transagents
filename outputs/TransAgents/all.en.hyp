Prologue: The Curtain Falls on a Legend Dark clouds enshrouded the sky above the Dragon Soul Continent, casting the battlefield below into a chaotic wasteland devoid of light. The spiraling staircase, flanked by bloodstained corpses, discarded armor, and weapons, bore silent witness to the desolation, the scent of death and danger hanging heavy in the air. Rhode Alante drew a sharp breath, though the bone-chilling cold and the copper tang of blood were absent; this was, after all, a virtual game. A wry smile crossed his face as he surveyed his comrades. They sat in meditative silence, gathering their strength and repairing their gear. To the untrained eye, it might seem like any other day, but Rhode knew this battle was unlike any they had faced before. "How many remain?" he asked, his voice carrying the weight of command. Muted exchanges passed among the group until a gaunt mage stood. "Ninety-six, Commander. The Void Dragon's lair has proven more perilous than we anticipated. Many have fallen to its cunning traps. Nevertheless, our core group remains intact, with a balance of essential classes." "That's good to hear." Rhode nodded, his stoic face betraying none of the concern he felt as silence reclaimed the group. In any ordinary team, panic would have already set in—they were about to face the most formidable, the most feared boss to date: the Void Dragon, the apex predator of 'Dragon Soul Continent's' third chapter, a being of unparalleled dread. Against such a foe, conventional guilds would marshal tenfold their number before daring an attempt. But Rhode's contingent numbered only ninety-six—a figure shy of a full brigade. And yet, in their eyes was no trace of panic, only unwavering calm, steely confidence, and deep-seated trust borne of countless battles. The man they trusted with their lives stood just ahead, his gaze piercing through the tempest above, his visage a mask of determination. A stark scar bisected his brow, a symbol of battles fought and won. The armor he donned, aglow with powerful enchantments, seemed to fortify his presence like an impregnable bastion. Their faith was not in his imposing appearance—that was but a facade, a character design within the game. That scar bore no true tale of suffering; it was nothing more than a cosmetic option during character creation. What truly commanded respect was the litany of accolades and triumphs that followed in his wake: The first to reach the zenith of his profession. The first to master the complex role of Summoner Swordsman and forge a path to glory. From the moment the 'Descent of Darkness' began to unfurl across the 'Dragon Soul Continent', he had led with a level of skill and strategic acumen that was nothing short of legendary. He had dominated three content seasons, seizing every first kill, every accolade within reach. He was the vanguard, the exemplar—Rhode Alante, the guild leader who set the benchmark for all players in 'Dragon Soul Continent', whose battle strategies were studied and emulated by countless others. He had vanquished the 'Descent of Darkness', weathered the 'Era of Turbulence', and now stood poised on the precipice of 'Void Judgment'. Now, he was ready to draw the curtain on 'Void Judgment', though the dawn of the next era would unfold without his guiding hand. How many years had it been? Rhode's gaze drifted from the distant maelstrom of Thunder Serpents back to the present. Seven years had passed since he had first set foot in the 'Dragon Soul Continent', seeking solace from the anguish of his sister's passing. In those years, he had set himself relentless challenges to escape the torment of memory, finding solace in victory and the glory it brought, each success dulling the persistent ache of loss. But now, an end was in sight. A month prior, another tragedy had struck—his parents, claimed by a hurricane while abroad. The news had left him reeling, but now, resolution had taken root. He would depart from this digital realm and reclaim the life that awaited beyond its borders. This departure was not solely for his parents; Rhode also recognized the need for change. "Guild Leader?" A hesitant voice broke his reverie, drawing his attention to a mage with her hand raised, her eyes wide and filled with concern. "Are you truly leaving us?" "Yes," Rhode confirmed, then composed the tumult of his emotions, meeting the eyes of those who had stood beside him through countless battles. These were the bonds forged over seven arduous years: the camaraderie, the shared trials, the collective victories. Yet now, he was poised to leave them behind. In the game, the merest gesture was enough to convey volumes, but once the virtual reality headset came off, they would be strangers. "I sent out my resume yesterday; I hope it finds its way to a company that will welcome me." "If your resume came across my desk, I'd appoint you to a managerial position on the spot—rest assured!" a knight declared, raising his great sword, his words breaking the gravity of the moment and drawing a collective chuckle from the group. "I appreciate the offer, but I left out such details on purpose. Our guild has made its fair share of enemies—if it fell into the wrong hands, I'd find myself in a difficult position," Rhode replied with a smile, then his expression turned serious once more. "I trust you all remember how we got here." His words hushed the group, every eye now fixed upon him. "The forums, the internet—they're filled with accusations. We're blamed for disrupting the game's balance, for hoarding first kills, for making competition meaningless... And there's truth to that. However..." Rhode's fist clenched, his voice rising with fervor. "But what does that matter to us! We are the paramount guild, the preeminent force! Our strength is our right to claim victory! If other guilds fall short, that's on them. If they were stronger, they might challenge our dominance. Our dominance over first kills wasn't due to rules, status, or flattery—it was earned by our strength, our never-say-die spirit, our unyielding drive. And so we hold our accolades, our triumphs—they are ours by right, plain and simple." Rhode paused, letting his gaze sweep across the faces of his guildmates, before continuing. "I love this guild, and I cherish the seven years we've shared. But all feasts must end, and it's time I sought the life that's calling me beyond these digital horizons. Yet, I will always carry with me the memories of every trial, every joy we've experienced. They will live on, here." He tapped his temple. "Some say the guild will crumble without me. No doubt, our rivals are sharpening their knives, waiting for my departure, eager to dethrone us, to wipe our records clean. But they underestimate us. 'Dragon Soul' isn't just my story. I couldn't have built this guild alone, commanded these forces alone, vanquished these bosses alone. So, when I'm gone, show them the might that is Starlight Guild. Show them why we stand unbeaten at the pinnacle of 'Dragon Soul Continent'!" "Yes!" "We will not falter, Leader!" "The mantle is ours; we'll give those pretenders a response they'll never forget!" "Very well." Rhode surveyed the group, then turned his attention to a figure on the right. "Old Liu." The slender mage stepped forward, coming to stand by Rhode's side. They exchanged a look of mutual respect before Rhode solemnly handed over the guild badge he'd removed from his chest. "The next era belongs to you." He relinquished his hold, his voice unwavering, a testament to the resolve within. "Therefore, I pass the mantle of command for this battle to you." "Understood, Rhode," the mage nodded, then with firm resolve, he added, "And as the guild leader, as the commander, I order you to lead us." "Old Liu?" Rhode's brow furrowed in a mixture of surprise and contemplation. The mage offered a faint smile, clapping Rhode on the shoulder. "You opened this era; it's only fitting you bring it to its rightful close. This is the final chapter of your saga." ".................." At those words, Rhode fell silent. He lifted his gaze to his comrades, now arrayed before him, their readiness palpable, their eyes fixed upon him in unwavering expectation. He gripped his sword with renewed purpose, turning to face the looming platform ahead, where the tempest of lightning raged, casting the world in stark relief. Then, Rhode raised his blade, its point directed at the heart of the storm. His journey had begun in the most unassuming of ways; let it also end with quiet resolve. "Initiate the boss encounter!" The might of the Void Dragon was as formidable as the tales foretold. Rhode had clashed with the most formidable bosses within 'Dragon Soul Continent', including those storied beings beyond official chronicles, but none presented the challenge that the Void Dragon now posed. Its attack patterns were intricate, inscrutable, its damage far exceeding that of any standard adversary. Speed, reflexes, defense—all were of a caliber beyond compare. Indeed, this was an adversary beyond conquest. Rhode wielded his longsword with fierce determination, his teeth gritted against the enormity of the beast before him. The battle had reached its climax, and he alone remained to confront the colossus. His health dwindled to a mere sliver, the glaring red warnings signaling that the end was near. Yet, had the Void Dragon not also been pushed to its breaking point? Gazing into the dragon's baleful, crimson eyes, Rhode experienced an uncanny sense of kinship. He could almost sense the Void Dragon's outrage—as the most indomitable boss within the game, never before bested, now teetering on the brink of defeat. It must find the prospect intolerable. If this was to be its end, then let them end it together. With that, Rhode lifted his left hand. With a clarion call, he summoned the Blazing Phoenix, and flames erupted along his blade, coalescing into the form of the fiery avian that soared skyward. The Phoenix charged at the Void Dragon, which, in response, unleashed a roar and lashed out with its claw in a defiant strike. "!!!" A tremor coursed through Rhode's frame as an opposing force met his own. The Blazing Phoenix was snuffed out in a wail of despair, yet in its final moment, it forced the Void Dragon's claw to falter, its attack diverted. An opening was revealed. Rhode bit back the pain, the world around him bathed in an ever-deepening crimson, signaling injuries of a critical nature. Yet, in this moment, such concerns were cast aside—it was the moment of truth, victory or annihilation. He thrust his longsword with all the strength his fading vitality could muster. The Void Dragon, having weathered the fiery onslaught, bellowed in defiance and struck once more with its claw. But as its talons descended, Rhode let go of his sword. Thunderstrike was unleashed. The blade became a beacon of light, slicing through the storm, finding the narrow gap between the dragon's claws and tearing through its armored hide. "———!!!" The dragon's roar shattered the heavens, its claw descending upon Rhode with the weight of finality. The world was engulfed in red, blurring into oblivion. Yet, on the periphery, the system's prompt emerged, its message clear and unyielding. The end had come. As the message etched itself into his vision, a contented smile graced Rhode's lips. In that instant, a brilliant column of light descended from above, enveloping the platform in its radiance. The pure light dispelled the darkness, scattering the oppressive clouds. And there, as others hastened from the graveyard toward the platform, they halted in their tracks, the world channel that had buzzed with news of the Starlight Guild's latest victory falling silent. A solitary message lingered, a system announcement for all to witness. The legend of Rhode Alante, who had reigned over three eras of Dragon Soul Continent, had reached its epic conclusion. Chapter One: A New Journey Gusts of wind carved through the canyon, stirring the grassland into undulating waves. Grazing bison lifted their heads, their attention drawn skyward by a marvel of human ingenuity: a wooden merchant ship, hovering in midair, its sails billowing as the Wind Tide propelled it forward with deliberate grace. 'The Wind Tide never fails to inspire awe, no matter how often one beholds it,' remarked a middle-aged man clad in leather armor, standing at the deck's edge, his gaze sweeping over the vast prairie below. 'It's more than a spectacle—it represents a golden opportunity for traders like us.' Next to him stood a portly merchant with an unusual tuft of curly hair, robed in a manner befitting his profession. His small eyes narrowed, surveying the landscape as though he could gauge its value in coin. 'Without this phenomenon, our goods would never reach the central regions so swiftly.' 'Indeed, I faced opposition when I initially planned to explore this market. But now, it's clear my decision was wise.' The merchant's tone shifted as he added, 'However, pardon my frankness, by steering clear of the major trade routes and opting for this shortcut, we're also upping the ante. There have been troubling reports from the other side. And, as the captain mentioned, Wind Serpents have been sighted nearby. Should misfortune strike...' His voice trailed off as he glanced at the mountain range, their peaks acting as sentinels, obscuring what lay beyond. A tinge of darkness marred the distant sky—a realm forbidden to them. 'Do not fret,' the merchant reassured, 'fortune favors the brave, and I've invested heavily in your expertise. A few serpents are nothing to worry over.' He patted the man's shoulder, asking, 'How is the young man we rescued faring?' 'He's alive, if that's what concerns you. Lijie Noelle has seen to his wounds. He's unconscious at the moment but largely out of danger.' The merchant nodded, content, although soon after, his forehead furrowed with thought. 'The nature of his injuries is baffling. They resemble the work of a large reptile—yet do such beasts roam the northern expanses of Pafield?' 'I cannot say, sir. But the creature that inflicted such wounds must be formidable. Let us hope our paths do not cross.' The man cast a cautious glance toward the cabin entrance before allowing his gaze to return to the horizon. Rhode Alante's eyes flickered open. What had occurred? His mind was foggy as he stared at the ceiling. He recalled leading his team on the Ruins Plateau, locked in combat with the formidable Void Dragon—one of the most fearsome bosses in the Dragon Soul Continent—and achieving the first kill. He remembered the system notification, the dragon's final assault... and then, blackness. Wasn't he supposed to resurrect at the graveyard and log off according to plan? Yet, when the Void Dragon's claws brought death, the world went dark, severed from reality, and consciousness eluded him. Could there have been a glitch in the game? Struggling to orient himself, Rhode caught sight of the blue sky and white clouds through the window. Where was he? What was this place? What had transpired? Could this still be a dream, or was he somehow entrapped within the game? This certainly wasn't his cramped rental apartment; he was sure of that much. Confusion swelled within him. Attempting to sit up, he was met with excruciating pain that lanced through his chest, ceasing his movements. It was then that he noticed his left shoulder and chest, ensconced in bandages. Although unsure of the events that led to this state, the blood seeping through suggested his injuries were far from minor. This was no game—of that, Rhode was certain. Dragon Soul Continent, the first immersive online game, was founded on cutting-edge technology, yet pain was intentionally omitted from its design. To distinguish reality from the virtual and to lower the entry barrier for players, sensations of pain were replaced with indicators such as reduced movement speed and a red haze over the player's vision to signal danger. The controversy over such sensory simulations had been intense when holographic technology first surfaced. The developers of Dragon Soul Continent could not have been oblivious to it. Rhode glanced at his right hand—not the muscular, savage physique he had crafted in-game, but a slender, frail arm, its pallor revealing a lack of sunlight. This was undoubtedly his real body. How had he come to be injured? And this place bore no resemblance to a hospital. His surroundings were that of a cabin, spare in furnishing and devoid of modern amenities—a wooden table, two chairs, and a cupboard affixed to the wall constituted the room's entirety. It felt oddly familiar, as though he had seen this setting before. While Rhode was absorbing his surroundings, the door swung open, and a blonde-haired young woman in a white robe stepped inside. She seemed surprised to see Rhode propped up. 'You're awake? How marvelous!' she exclaimed. She spoke neither Chinese nor English, yet Rhode understood her effortlessly. This language was Nim, one of the official languages of Dragon Soul Continent. 'How do you feel? Are you well?' she inquired, her voice laden with concern as she checked his bandages. 'Your injuries were severe. I feared you might not pull through...' Rhode, puzzled, glanced at the mirror on the wall, his reflection staring back. His face was familiar, yet it felt out of place here. 'Have you forgotten?' the young woman asked, her azure eyes mirroring her bewilderment. 'Two days ago, you were discovered in the Pafield Highlands, grievously wounded. If not for the Silver Libra merchant ship passing by, your situation would have been dire. The injuries to your left side were significant—it was a narrow escape.' The mention of his 'left side' sparked a memory—hadn't his character been struck there by the Void Dragon's final blow? But now, it was he who bore the injury. The enigma of his current predicament was confounding, yet Rhode's instincts for survival, refined through years as a top player and guild leader, prevailed. From the young woman, he gleaned that he had been found injured on the plains of Pafield and rescued by the Silver Libra skyship. Despite a grim initial outlook, his recuperation was on the right track. 'I am Lijie Noelle, a Spirit Master of the Star Moon Mercenary Corps. You can call me Lijie,' she introduced herself cheerfully. 'I'm Rhode Alante,' he replied after a brief pause, using the name and identity he knew from the game. 'An adventurer hailing from the Eastern Highlands.' Lijie accepted his explanation without question; it was not uncommon for adventurers on the continent to explore alone, making Rhode's claimed identity plausible. 'What were you battling? What inflicted such severe wounds upon you? This plain is not known for dangerous creatures.' Rhode offered a wry smile in response to her questions. Could he truly tell her that he had been engaged in combat with the Void Dragon, one of the genesis creators of this realm? 'I was assaulted in the darkness of night and could not discern my attackers. They were legion, swift. Perhaps they emerged from 'that place',' he said ambiguously. Lijie nodded, indicating her understanding, though much remained unsaid. After ensuring his wounds were tended to, she rose to her feet. 'After two days without nourishment, you must be ravenous. Please await here; I will fetch you something to eat,' she said, heading toward the door. 'Oh, and I must inform the Leader of your awakening. He is likely to come by to see you shortly.' With a polite nod, she exited the room, leaving Rhode alone with his thoughts and the deepening enigma that surrounded him. Chapter Two: The Holy Sword Deck *Sigh...* Rhode finally exhaled a long sigh and laid back down. After his conversation with the young girl, Rhode had his suspicions confirmed: this was indeed the world of the Dragon Soul Continent. Furthermore, it was not the era he had previously known but a much more ancient time—the Twilight Years, which in the game's timeline, corresponded to the nascent public testing phase of the Dragon Soul Continent game. How did I come to be here? Rhode sighed and decided to put aside these perplexing and mysterious thoughts. The fact was that he had arrived here, and that was the reality he had to accept. Now, what should be his next move? First, Rhode resolved to figure out what he was currently capable of doing. With just a thought, a familiar system prompt appeared before his eyes, displaying his current status and attributes: Rhode Level 1 Race: Half-blood (??) Talent: Unsealed Racial Bonus: Unsealed Racial Traits: Unsealed++ Profession: Summoner Swordsman (Heroic Profession) Professional Skills: Spirit Summoning Art (Proficiency Rank E) Owned Swordsmanship: Moonshadow Swordsmanship (Proficiency Rank E) (Usable Skill—Shattered Blade) Secondary Profession: Alchemist (Arcane Crafting Expertise) Owned Skills: Focused Shaping (Proficiency Rank E) This character sheet seemed both normal and unusual at the same time. Rhode almost let out a cry of surprise at the term 'Half-blood'. On the Dragon Soul Continent, 'half-blood' didn't imply human racial intermarriage but referred to the offspring of unions between humans and other races. Rhode knew he was human, and even as a player, he had not chosen any race other than human. So why did his character sheet now describe him as a 'half-blood'? The question marks indicated a bloodline that hadn't fully awakened, thus sealing the racial bonuses and traits. This meant Rhode had to uncover the secrets of his own bloodline and awaken the dormant powers within to access these bonuses and traits. This was a challenge because racial bonuses are typically provided at character creation. For instance, humans receive bonuses like reduced skill learning time, with additional benefits such as poison resistance or reputation enhancements based on their subtype. Now, these bonuses and traits were tantalizingly out of reach for Rhode. However, not all hope was lost. In the sections for swordsmanship and alchemy, Rhode noticed that in addition to his Level 1 skills, the numerous swordsmanship and alchemy skills he had learned as a player remained listed, albeit dimmed. This indicated his current abilities and level were insufficient to use them. Rhode wasn't overly concerned; it was the origin of the skills, not the proficiency levels, that mattered to him. Many sword techniques were notoriously difficult to master, requiring not just higher levels or specific attributes, but also the completion of challenging quests, reputation enhancements, or even the chance discovery of hidden relics. Acquiring such skills required significant investments of money, time, and sometimes, a stroke of luck. In the game, Rhode had fully perfected his character only in the last year of his journey on the Dragon Soul Continent, which had given him the confidence to challenge the Void Dragon. Unfortunately, while the swordsmanship issue had been addressed, Rhode soon realized that more than just his experience and proficiency levels had reset to zero. The essence of a Summoner Swordsman—the summoned spirits—had also vanished. In the game world of Dragon Soul Continent, the Summoner Swordsman was a profession steeped in controversy. Initially touted as an official profession exclusive to players, it garnered widespread attention. However, it was later criticized for its blend of magic and martial arts, the necessity of spirit summons for attacks, and the disproportionate consumption of experience points for leveling, earning it a reputation as one of the most vexing professions. At first glance, a Summoner Swordsman's Spirit Summoning Art seemed no different from a mage's summoning. However, they were fundamentally distinct. Mages summoned creatures from subspace dimensions by tearing through the fabric of reality, binding them with magical force to serve. Summoner Swordsmen, on the other hand, lacked the power to rend planar space. Their summons originated from the present world, enabled by the unique 'Spirit Summoning Art' of the Summoner Swordsman, which could awaken the souls of ancient, mystical relics imbued with historical and spiritual essence. These souls were then resealed through contracts for use. The concept was intriguing, but the reality was rife with complications. Many players had been lured by the skill and chose the Summoner Swordsman, hoping to procure ancient relics from ruins or merchants, awaken the spirits of the weapons, and effortlessly acquire a divine weapon. The dream was enchanting, but reality was unforgiving. Not to mention that awakening the dormant souls of ancient weapons required a high-level Spirit Summoning Art, and since they had lost their physical form, their power was significantly diminished. Consider the semi-divine weapon 'Dragon King's Fury' that Rhode had wielded in the game. He could only extract its soul after reaching the highest levels. Yet, even then, the strength of the weapon was not superior to that of a similar tier crafted by a master blacksmith. It had taken Rhode another two years of perilous adventures across the Dragon Soul Continent to reactivate the fragmented souls of the weapon and restore it to its former state. The sheer danger of the quest was enough to deter many from attempting such feats. Furthermore, spirit weapons required soul power to maintain, and the summoned spirits required soul power for sustenance. Given that Summoner Swordsmen's innate soul power was significantly less than that of mages, many preferred to wield ordinary weapons over aesthetically pleasing but impractical spirit weapons. Beyond this, there were three additional methods for a Summoner Swordsman to obtain spirits. One could awaken the soul core that formed after the death of a magical creature, turning it into a summoned spirit. However, the outcome could be influenced by the holder's attributes, the environment, and other factors. For instance, if a Summoner Swordsman acquired a soul core from a Blazing Phoenix but awakened it in an icy environment or while wearing dark-attribute gear, the resulting creature could be entirely unpredictable. If it turned out to be a nine-headed serpent with dark power, that would be manageable. However, if it was a common demon weakened by conflicting attributes, then all hope was lost. Another method to acquire summoned spirits involved defeating non-human entities. Upon meeting specific conditions, one could forge contracts with these beings, sealing them as personal summoned spirits. This approach was popular among Summoner Swordsmen but had the drawback of the summoned being's strong autonomy. In the game, this autonomy could lead to the being acting against their summoner's commands based on their judgment. Understandably, such unpredictability was unwelcome. No one wanted an ally that caused more trouble than assistance. The final technique, unlocked after reaching level 10, was the Attribute Adjustment Talent. By fusing several summoned spirits, one could create a higher-order spirit. This method offered some control over the unpredictability of summoned spirits. If one understood the characteristics, races, and attributes of the spirits, they could predict what the fusion would result in. Yet, this method had its own vexing flaw—the uncertain level of the new spirit. It was possible to merge two high-level summoned spirits only to create a level 1 newcomer, or conversely, a spirit of such a high level that it surpassed the summoner's own, making it unusable. If it were the latter, it was simply a matter of leveling up. But if it were the former, account deletion might be the only recourse. The experience of summoned spirits was deducted from the holder's own pool, explaining why Summoner Swordsmen leveled up slower than other professions. They had to divide their experience between themselves and their summoned spirits, a difficult balance to master. Allocating experience to summoned spirits could ensure their advancement in levels and evolution upon reaching certain stages. However, as previously mentioned, the evolution could be influenced by the factors present at the time, resulting in evolved spirits that may not match the summoner's intentions. These 'vexing' traits led to Summoner Swordsmen being 'unanimously' crowned as the 'Top Vexing Profession' on the official forums of the Dragon Soul Continent. The community vividly described those who chose Summoner Swordsmen: they were either novices misled by introductions and CG promotions, casual players without aspirations, gamblers eager to take a chance, or... Rhode. From a simple name to a symbol of a gaming phenomenon, Rhode's game ID reflected the thoughts of players when he achieved unparalleled success with the Summoner Swordsman, a profession recognized worldwide for its challenges. He attained numerous server-firsts and even conquered three new eras. Typically, players disliked randomness as it gave them a sense of losing control. But Rhode thrived on it. The allure of the unknown offered a challenge, which is precisely why he had chosen the Summoner Swordsman profession. Throughout his extensive gaming career, he had encountered almost every 'vexing' aspect of Summoner Swordsmen, yet he remained undaunted, for conquering such adversities brought him immense satisfaction. But now, after seven years of nurturing an array of top-tier summoned spirits, they had all been erased. The mysterious summoning circle on the back of his right hand remained, but within it, Rhode could no longer sense any spirits. It was not a surprising realization. After all, this body was not the same as his in-game avatar, and it was unreasonable to expect too much. But... With this thought, a spark of curiosity ignited within Rhode. He reached into his chest pocket, and his fingers soon brushed against a card. It was a card with a pristine white background, bearing the image of a sword entwined with thorns, its surface unblemished and resplendent. Intricate inscriptions adorned the blade, while the crossguard featured a pair of exquisitely converging wings that delighted the eye. Distinct markings graced each corner of the card; in the upper right, a white semicircle, and in the upper left, a small 'X'. In the lower corners lay two modest numbers—'3'. Flipping the card over, mysterious and elegant script began to emerge against the backdrop. [Eternal Holy Sword No.10: Star Scar, Attribute-less, Fusion Compatible—Even the dust of history cannot obscure its dazzling brilliance.] Still here? Holding the card, Rhode experienced a surge of surprise. This was the emblem of a Summoner Swordsman, a summoning card. And this one was particularly familiar—it was the rare card memento presented by the game's officials during an event. In recognition of his guild's consecutive championship victories across two quarters, the game company had crafted this unique card to honor the formidable player. Though similar collectible cards were abundant, Rhode had never been one to waste money on items that were merely ornamental and served no actual purpose. Therefore, he only kept this award card, regarding it as a talisman since it hardly took up any space at all. Originally, it was nothing more than an ordinary commemorative card, unique only by being the sole one of its kind in the world. But now, Rhode watched as it emitted a faint glow, shimmering in his hand. Should I give it a try? Rhode hesitated for only a second before tightly gripping the card. The arcane circle on the back of his right hand suddenly came to life, and lines of deep azure magic spread outward, reaching every fingertip. The white card burst into dazzling light and then disintegrated into sparkling motes, vanishing into thin air. At that moment, a system prompt appeared before Rhode. [You have obtained 1/10 of the Eternal Deck, Eternal Holy Sword No.10—Star Scar] *Sigh...* Staring at the system prompt, Rhode exhaled, a tumult of emotions roiling within him as he grappled with the surreal reality he faced. Is this a game? Or is it reality? If this is reality, then what path should I take? *Knock, knock.* As these thoughts swirled in his mind, a knock sounded at the door. Rhode looked up to see a middle-aged man entering. The man was dressed in the leather armor typical of adventurers, his fiery red hair casually swept back. Spotting Rhode, the man offered a modest smile. "Hello, sir. I am Carter, the leader of the Star Moon Mercenary Corps." Chapter 3: Ambushed 'Hello, Mr. Carter,' Rhode raised his head, greeting the man before him with a polite nod and a smile of appreciation. 'Thank you for your assistance.' 'Don't mention it. It was nothing.' The man's robust build and towering presence, set against the backdrop of untamed, crimson locks, marked his heritage from the sandy expanses of the northwest, the land of the Laikate People. Two swords, one distinctly longer than the other, hung silently by his side. His sharp, well-defined features conveyed a sense of determination and scrutiny, clear indicators of a man far from ordinary. While Rhode observed him, Carter was also quietly sizing up the man in his presence. At first glance, one might easily mistake Rhode for some effete, indolent noble's progeny. His lithe build, pallid complexion, and almost feminine visage, coupled with his attire, hardly painted the picture of a seasoned adventurer. Instead, he looked more like a thrill-seeking scion, out for a lark rather than braving the unknown. However, Carter intuited that there was more to this young man, especially given the arcane sigil etched upon his right hand. Lijie, with her attunement as a Spirit Master, could sense the magic emanating from it, suggesting its authenticity. Carter, with his years of experience, rarely came across someone who wore such a mark so openly. This hinted at an unusual and complex identity. From their brief conversation, Carter noted Rhode's demeanor—calm and measured, without a hint of arrogance or subservience. Even after awakening from unconsciousness just minutes ago, he maintained a remarkable level of composure, far exceeding the often haughty ignorance of the bluebloods. 'I understand you're from the Eastern Highlands?' 'Yes, that's correct.' Rhode responded with a slight nod. 'So, where are you headed?' 'Nowhere in particular. I'm just traveling.' Rhode's shoulders lifted in a nonchalant shrug. 'I'm an adventurer. To roam freely and explore is my way of life. Rest assured, I won't cause any trouble for you and your company.' 'Good to hear.' With Rhode being so cooperative, there was little more for Carter to question. They were in the midst of a mission and did not welcome distractions. After a few more exchanges and assurances that Rhode would take care of his injuries, Carter excused himself. As the leader of a mercenary band, he had many responsibilities and could not afford to stay any longer than necessary. For Rhode, the following hours were uneventful, though the simple fare of coarse bread and dried meat Lijie provided did catch his interest. The items he had consumed countless times within the game, designed only to replenish health and mana, offered no real flavor or sustenance. Now, he had the opportunity to truly experience the taste described in the game's flavor text, a novelty for sure. But, in reality, the actual taste fell short of the tantalizing descriptions he remembered. 'How are you feeling? Is the wound still painful?' Lijie, with her golden hair and an air of concern, sat close to Rhode, her attention fixed on him. Her gaze, softened by a touch of sorrow, lingered on his shoulder, reflecting a quiet empathy. 'I feel much better now.' Rhode replied while flexing his hand. The sharp pain in his sternum had subsided, a testament to his character's rapid health regeneration. 'That's good to hear.' Relief lightened Lijie's previously anxious expression as she listened to Rhode. 'Still, you should rest more. When we reach Deepstone City, we'll have better facilities. Perhaps your wounds will heal quicker there.' Her tone was earnest, showing genuine concern for someone she had only just met. 'Thank you.' 'You're welcome. It's my duty to help.' Lijie then stood up, her ponytail bouncing with her movements, giving her a lively and spirited aura. 'Well then...' Her words were interrupted by a sudden lurch of the ship, sending a tremor through the cabin. The jolt nearly caused her to fall onto the bed, but she managed to stabilize herself using the bedpost just in time. The two exchanged a look, each recognizing the same uncertainty in the other's eyes. Though skyships sailed on the powerful winds of the Wind Tide and the sky held no perilous reefs or whirlpools, dangers still lurked. The current situation was clearly abnormal. 'I'll go check it out. You stay here and rest easy, alright?' Lijie whispered, then quickly turned and left the room, closing the door behind her. Watching her departure, Rhode offered a faint, wry smile. Was it truly necessary for her to speak to him as if he were a child? But then, the silhouette of a creature passing by the window caught his attention, and his expression turned serious. He shifted his gaze slightly, peering intently through the window. Moments later, more green shapes zipped past, followed by a sequence of low, sinister hisses. 'Sssss—' The sound sent a chill through Rhode. They were in grave danger! On the deck, chaos had erupted. 'I never imagined we'd run into these damned creatures.' The red-haired mercenary captain, with swords in hand, stood steadfast at the forefront, his gaze locked on the green figures circling the skyship. They looked like serpents with bat wings, each about a meter long. Despite their fragile appearance, the sharp fangs visible within their open jaws suggested a deadly nature. Wind Serpents, a notorious airborne predator known for their territorial aggression in the Dragon Soul Continent game. 'It seems we've stumbled into Wind Serpent territory.' The portly merchant, huddled next to the mercenary captain, was pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from his brow with a kerchief. 'Blast it, that treacherous Bick. I should've known it was a setup when he offered such a route for so little coin! This is murder, plain and simple! When I get back, he'll pay dearly for this!' 'Let's focus on getting out of this mess first!' Carter interjected, cutting off the merchant's frenzied tirade. Surrounded by hundreds of Wind Serpents, they were in a dire predicament. At first, he had ordered his men to use crossbow bolts to deter the creatures, hoping to drive them off. But the Wind Serpents' reckless abandon had taken them by surprise. Far from retreating, their comrades' deaths only seemed to embolden them. Now, they had seized the perimeter of the deck, ready to strike from all sides. The mercenaries had discarded their ranged weapons for blades, engaging the serpents in dire close-quarters combat. 'Take cover inside, and tell the Captain we need to leave immediately!' Carter shoved the merchant towards the safety of the Captain's Quarters, then stepped forward, his swords flashing like rays of sunlight breaking through storm clouds as they sliced through an attacking Wind Serpent. The creature fell to the deck with a thud, but another quickly took its place. They were outnumbered and outmatched. Carter frowned, concern etched on his face as he surveyed the deck. He had taken only a handful of men on this mission, and they were all that remained. The merchant ship's guards, though present, lacked combat experience, which was evident. A third had fallen in the initial assault, and only half remained, their panicked actions signaling they couldn't hold out much longer. Facing the menacing serpents, Carter's demeanor became grave. He had faced Wind Serpents before but never in such staggering numbers. The unprecedented scale of this encounter sent a surge of anxiety through him. He stepped forward, his body moving with practiced grace as he spun, his swords tracing deadly arcs through the air and striking a Wind Serpent mid-flight. The creature plummeted to the deck, its lifeblood spilling out, and after a few defiant hisses, it lay motionless. Carter looked up, scanning the tumultuous scene, when his heart skipped a beat. 'Lijie! Watch out!' The girl was slow to react. She had just finished healing a mercenary's poison wound and was still reeling from the exertion. Though she had been on deck for only a short time, the injured were numerous, and as the only one with healing powers, Lijie had selflessly taken on the responsibility. At Carter's warning, she turned around, only to be met with the gaping maw of a Wind Serpent, its fangs poised to strike. In that moment, time seemed to stand still for Lijie. She stared into the face of danger, her mind blank, unable to move or react. She could see every horrific detail—the fangs' lethal glint, the maw's grotesque pink flesh, even the fetid stench that assaulted her senses. Just as fear overwhelmed her, a hand reached out from behind, gripping her collar and pulling her back just in time to avoid the serpent's deadly bite. Chapter Four: The Heat of Battle The Wind Serpent snapped at empty air, almost securing its prey if not for Mr. Rhode's timely intervention from behind. 'Mr. Rhode?' Lijie, who had narrowly escaped death, looked up to find Mr. Rhode standing protectively behind her, her body limp and powerless from the shock. She tried to stand but collapsed back to the ground as her knees gave way. 'Lijie!' Carter sighed in relief at her narrow escape but quickly tensed as the Wind Serpent, having missed, prepared to strike again. Cursing, he held his twin swords and sprinted toward them, though it seemed he would be too late. As the Wind Serpent reared again, Lijie, unsure of what to do, held her breath. As a Spirit Master, reliant on her spiritual arts, she carried no weapon. What was she to do? 'Leave it to me.' Amidst her panic, Mr. Rhode's calm voice reached Lijie's ears. He stepped forward, shielding her with his presence. Would he really face the Wind Serpent unarmed? While Lijie was still trying to grasp the situation, she noticed Mr. Rhode raising his right hand. An intricate, luminous magic circle formed on the back of his hand, radiating lines that extended to each fingertip. From his palm's center, a translucent, card-like object emerged. Mr. Rhode gripped it, and a blinding white light erupted. The seal of unseen magic was lifted, releasing a tangible shockwave that buffeted the Wind Serpent, struggling to maintain its balance. Before it could strike again, a burst of radiance cleaved through the air, striking the serpent and sending it tumbling away. Mr. Rhode exhaled softly as the glow faded, revealing an immaculate white longsword, the Stardust Sword, materialized in his hand. He swung the Stardust Sword, and light motes drifted down from the blade, creating an enchanting scene. He was oblivious to the others, who were rendered speechless by the sight. Lijie sat on the ground, stunned, while Carter slowed his approach, his eyes filled with disbelief and awe. Though he had surmised that Mr. Rhode was no ordinary man, he had not imagined the extent of his 'uncommonness.' Even as she sat immobilized, Lijie couldn't help but admire the sword's pristine blade, ancient patterns softly glowed, and light dust around it was visibly magical. The wings on the hilt were so finely detailed that each feather was discernible. While women often showed little interest in weapons, this sword transcended its function, nearing artistry. Lijie admired it purely, but Carter's gaze held a different weight. As a seasoned adventurer, Carter had never encountered such a phenomenon. He had seen mages summon with crystals, chanting cryptic incantations to summon grotesque creatures—a common sight. But a summoned weapon? This was a spectacle he had never witnessed. While the true nature of the object in Mr. Rhode's hand was a mystery, Carter knew that such magical weapons were not common. Only those of noble standing or special heritage were entitled to wield such arms. Observing the lifelike wings on the sword's hilt, Carter furrowed his brow. He was well aware that angels on this continent were revered, often pivotal figures in powerful organizations or factions. Like the recently ascended ruler of the Moon Kingdom, Leticia Pafield Mila Franrika—an angel. Even though Mr. Rhode's true identity was still a mystery, the sword alone linked him to that distinguished lineage. This realization passed through Carter's mind as he reached the pair. 'Are you alright?' 'I—I'm okay.' Lijie's face was pale, not from cowardice but from the ordeal of nearly being claimed by death—a sensation unfamiliar to the uninitiated. After confirming Lijie's safety, Carter's attention shifted to Mr. Rhode. 'Mr. Rhode, are you unharmed?' Mr. Rhode shook his head, indicating he was fine. Despite the throbbing in his left side, it had little impact on his combat readiness. Instead of his well-being, his focus was on the next move. 'What's your plan?' The number of Wind Serpents was growing. The skyship's full speed was failing to shake off the serpents' relentless chase. Their situation was worsening. 'We're trying to push beyond their territory. Until then, we have no choice but to endure.' On the ground, Carter might have had other strategies, but in the sky, this was all he could propose. Yet as he spoke, Mr. Rhode's expression conveyed doubt. 'We won't make it in time, Mr. Carter.' 'Oh?' 'The Wind Serpents hold the advantage on these plains. Even at full speed, we can't escape before the skyship falls apart.' 'Really?' Carter was quick-witted. Unfamiliar with the terrain, he had made his decision. Grasping the gravity of Mr. Rhode's words, he understood the urgency of their situation. 'So, what should we do?' 'We descend immediately.' Without hesitation, Mr. Rhode responded, pointing to a nearby location. 'Then we head there.' Carter looked where Mr. Rhode pointed, his eyes widening at the realization. 'You're suggesting we plunge into the Twilight Forest?' 'To escape the Wind Serpents' harassment, it's our only option. Besides...' Mr. Rhode glanced around. 'Our time is running short.' The situation indeed grew dire. The Wind Serpents' threat was not limited to their fangs—their venom was equally lethal. Agile and slender, they switched targets swiftly if a frontal assault failed. Several had already shattered the glass and infiltrated the cabin; there seemed no stopping them. The confined space of the cabin hindered the serpents, yet their danger persisted. Thus, the cabin was in disarray, and the plumes of smoke wafting from the breaches signaled the dire state of affairs. Carter no longer hesitated, turning to leave at once. Mr. Rhode, with Star Scar in hand, defended the gap. 'Hiss!' A Wind Serpent swooped from the right, its maw wide open in attack. As it dove, Mr. Rhode dodged deftly to the left, his white sword flicking upward to strike the serpent's chin, repelling the venom sprayed in haste. He spun around, his silver-white blade drawing a luminous arc in the air, finding its mark in another serpent attempting a stealth attack from behind. With its balance lost and a swift follow-up strike, Mr. Rhode ended its life. The Wind Serpents' offensive did not cease. The scent of carnage drove them into a frenzy. As Mr. Rhode drew his sword from the now lifeless serpent, a multitude descended upon him. They resembled a green cloud, a monstrous maw, ready to devour its prey in a single gulp. 'Mr. Rhode!' Lijie, having just rid another mercenary of poison, turned to witness the scene, her cry escaping involuntarily. Jets of corrosive venom shot forth, aiming a deluge at Mr. Rhode. Should it make contact, it would maim, if not kill. But at that critical moment, Mr. Rhode swiftly retreated. The venom, reeking of decay, missed him by a hair's breadth, eating away at the deck as it landed. Almost at the same time, the Wind Serpent horde closed in on Mr. Rhode, poised to tear apart the troublesome human before them. To ordinary foes, such a sight would likely induce paralysis. But Mr. Rhode remained composed, confronting the swarm intent on rending him to pieces. His only action was to lift his sword and thrust forward. Shattered Blade technique, activate. The white blade's energy erupted amidst the serpents, splitting and multiplying. Blades flew, piercing through serpent after serpent, a powerful gust pulling those fortunate enough to escape, mercilessly shredding their forms. In an instant, the green cloud was dispersed by the blinding light, leaving only remnants of flesh. Every onlooker held their breath in that fleeting moment of awe. Chapter Five: Critical Emergency The relentless assault of the Wind Serpent Swarm momentarily subsided, and an eerie silence fell upon the deck, a stark contrast to the previous cacophony of battle cries and screams. All eyes were transfixed on the young swordsman, their faces a tapestry of disbelief and silence. Just moments prior, they had all but resigned themselves to his inevitable demise, for none had ever seen someone withstand such an aggressive onslaught of numerous Wind Serpents. Perhaps a high-level warrior encased in full armor could withstand such an attack. Yet here stood a youth, his sole defense the white sword he brandished—his body unadorned with armor. And yet, he stood triumphant. Both mercenaries and comrades, including Lijie and Carter, were rendered speechless, their minds abuzz with questions. Who could this mysterious warrior be? The Wind Serpents, perhaps daunted by Rhode's valor, had withdrawn, leaving a silence so profound that only the wind's lament could be discerned. While the mercenaries were astounded by Rhode's feat, he paid little mind to their accolades. His attention was solely on the corpses at his feet and the close call he had just survived. Wind Serpents, while not the most formidable monsters, found their strength in numbers. Rhode, a Summoner Swordsman, excelled in individual combat. Large-scale battles, however, were not where he shined. It was the '+3 initial' attribute of his 'Star Scar' blade that tipped the scales, elevating his attributes by three points and reducing a monster's threat level from red to green—a factor that made the Wind Serpent Swarm's defeat less remarkable for Rhode. Yet, when taking into account his human attributes, not even the 'Star Scar' should have granted such a sweeping triumph. Rhode had braced himself for the likelihood of merely leaving the Wind Serpents grievously wounded, ready to deliver the coup de grâce. However, to his bewilderment, his Shattered Blade had far exceeded his expectations, felling the Wind Serpents in a single blow. Could it be that his attributes did not align with those of a human? Compelled by this thought, Rhode tried to access his attribute panel, but to his frustration, his attributes remained veiled until his race could be ascertained. Nonetheless, the battle had yielded him an unexpected windfall of 1900 experience points. These reflections occupied but a brief moment for Rhode. To the bystanders, he seemed to contemplate the fallen only momentarily before raising his gaze once more. It was at this juncture that Rhode became cognizant of the foreboding quiet. It wasn't the astonishment of his allies that stilled the deck, but the imminent threat of a far more lethal nature. What had become of the Wind Serpent Swarm? A flicker of concern crossed Rhode's mind. Then, as if connecting the dots, he spun around and bellowed a warning. 'Everyone, brace yourselves...!' Without warning, the Skyship lurched violently. The sudden upheaval hurled the crew to the timeworn deck planks, and two unfortunate souls, unable to steady themselves, fell into the abyss below. Concurrently, a sharp crack echoed from the foredeck, and from the splintered timbers, an immense serpent's head thrust forth. 'To arms! It's the Wind Serpent Sovereign!' Carter's voice finally broke through the chaos, his directive clear as he drew his twin swords and raced toward the gargantuan Wind Serpent. The mercenaries, though wounded, rose quickly. Clenching their teeth against their injuries, they rallied behind their Leader, preparing to engage the colossal adversary. But Rhode was faster. He crouched, witnessing a stream of system prompts before his eyes. [Experience Points 1900/200, Level Up, gain 1 Skill Point, Level 2] [Experience Points 1700/400, Level Up, gain 2 Skill Points, Level 3] [Experience Points 1300/600, gain 3 Skill Points, Level 4] [Experience Points 800/1000, gain 4 Skill Points, Level 5] [Use 1 Skill Point to raise Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 1/3, Proficiency E] [Use 1 Skill Point to raise Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 2/3, Proficiency E] [Use 1 Skill Point to raise Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 3/3, Proficiency E] [Use 1 Skill Point to raise Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 1/4, Proficiency D—Unlocked Shadow Flash] Activation underway. Rhode surged upwards. To the onlookers, he was a fleeting shadow, a spectral figure that cleaved through the air directly toward the Wind Serpent Sovereign, taking the colossal beast by surprise. As Rhode ascended to its eye level, the beast's bewildered gaze was evident—it had never before seen prey leap willingly into its clutches. Rhode readied his sword, the radiance of Stardust coalescing on the blade as if drawn by an unseen magnetism. He targeted the Wind Serpent Sovereign's massive eyes and thrust downward with lethal precision. 'Shattered Blade!' The Wind Serpent Sovereign, confronted with the barrage of gleaming sword light, instinctively tried to evade. Rhode's mastery of Moonshadow Swordsmanship had exponentially increased the power of Shattered Blade, unleashing a volley of silvery blades that spun and surged forward. One after another, initially, the Wind Serpent Sovereign's armored scales resisted the sword beams. But by the twentieth, its defenses crumbled. The subsequent blades cut through with ease, impaling the creature. Despite the Wind Serpent Sovereign's daunting size, Rhode astutely focused on a single point of attack. Under his command, the blades converged and targeted the beast's neck, breaching its defenses. With a piercing shriek, the Wind Serpent Sovereign plummeted, undeterred in its agony. Despite the disfigurement of its neck, the Wind Serpent Sovereign lifted its head with a deathly resolve, fixing its gaze on Rhode before its jaws gaped wide. Rhode's form flickered, retreating into a wraith-like silhouette just in time to dodge a spurt of toxic venom. The poisonous spray narrowly missed his afterimage, drenching the mast behind him. Within moments, the venom devoured the mast, which then collapsed with a resounding crash. A BOSS is a BOSS for good reason. Drawing from his in-game experience, Rhode knew Wind Serpents typically averaged level three, with their leaders around ten. This BOSS was expected not to exceed that level. Though a formidable level, with the support of Carter and the mercenaries, defeating this BOSS wasn't the primary challenge. It was the realization that this was no ordinary Lord-level monster, but an Elite. An ordinary Lord would have succumbed to Rhode's initial assault, its wings severed. The mere fact that the strike had left a bone-exposing gash was evidence of its Elite status. 'Strike its wings, avoid its maw! Attack from its flank!' Rhode directed Carter and the others, all the while entangled with the Wind Serpent Sovereign. As a Summoner Swordsman, he wasn't the main tank, but it seemed none of the others had previous experience battling the Wind Serpent Sovereign. In the game, a team wipe meant a reset, but here, Rhode wasn't willing to take that gamble. The wound on his left chest, which had been healing, was now ablaze with pain as if torn anew. To perish here would be a lamentable tale without tears. Moreover, at level 5, and bereft of any gear, Rhode felt confident confronting an adversary not more than 15 levels his senior. In the Dragon Soul Continent, three classes were celebrated for their prowess against higher-level monsters: Mage, Ranger, and Summoner Swordsman. Mages commanded arcane spells, Rangers were adept in long-range 'kiting,' and Summoner Swordsmen excelled in outnumbering their foes. For these classes, overcoming a five-level differential was trivial, effortlessly taking down non-Elite BOSSes up to ten levels their superior with deft ease. Yet, each class had its pitfalls—Mages were powerless without mana, easy prey for even the weakest of sprites; Rangers were doomed if cornered; Summoner Swordsmen's gameplay was randomized and complex, lacking a straightforward strategy. This explained why these classes hadn't dominated the game. It also mirrored the reality of the Dragon Soul Continent—choosing the unconventional path or the steady, cautious advance. Players had the liberty to carve out their destiny and future. Now, facing the Raven Night Sovereign, a level 10 Elite BOSS, Rhode discerned the true challenge. With 'Star Scar' enhancing his might, the creature's defense seemed no stronger than that of a level six or seven opponent. Rhode's concern wasn't about the effectiveness of his blows but the strategy of his offense... 'Whoosh!' A fierce gust of wind burst forth. Rhode danced away swiftly, his figure blurring into a ghostly streak, evading the sweeping attack from the beast's wing. The wing, missing its target, struck the deck with tremendous force, leaving behind a gaping chasm. The strength of a level 10 Elite was unmistakable. Rhode wiped the sweat from his brow. At his current level, without any protective gear, a blow like that would have been a fatal blow, beyond any hope of recovery. While he was concerned for Carter and the others, it was fortunate that the Wind Serpent Sovereign seemed to have directed all its enmity towards him due to the damage he had caused. The unfortunate reality of being targeted by a BOSS with such ruinous power was a significant burden for those not suited for the tank role... His soul power had dwindled to a mere third, and Rhode could feel the fatigue setting in. He had anticipated a tough battle upon encountering the Wind Serpent Sovereign, but the pressure now was insurmountable. He relied on Shadow Flash to dodge the relentless onslaught, as evading the Wind Serpent Sovereign's attacks at his current speed was virtually impossible. On the other hand, he also relied on Shattered Blade to deal damage, aiming to bring down this formidable foe as swiftly as possible. But it was proving to be a daunting task. The Skyship, though descending, was being battered by the Wind Serpent Sovereign's attacks, swaying like a fragile vessel amidst a tempest, causing hearts to race with apprehension. Two mercenaries had already been cast overboard, their fates sealed. Carter continued his valiant efforts to fend off the Wind Serpent Sovereign. His twin swords danced before him, striking at the creature's flank, but to little effect. If not for Lijie's timely cast of Healing Light, sustaining the mercenaries, they might not have held out this long. An immediate solution was necessary; otherwise, the Skyship would be torn apart by the cursed serpent before it could make landfall. With resolve, Rhode bit his lip. The Wind Serpent Sovereign's assault showed no signs of abating. Its wings outstretched, its talons clung to the bow's edge. Despite the substantial damage Rhode had inflicted, the Lord-level monster was not inclined to retreat. Instead, the cunning Wind Serpent Sovereign seemed to realize its adversaries' vulnerability. Its talons gripped the Skyship's outer wall, shaking and tugging at its quarry with unrestrained vigor. The hull of the Skyship, though sturdy, had been battered in the skirmish with the Wind Serpent Swarm. Now, the howling gales buffeted the ship, causing it to twist and warp. Cracks spread across the deck, emitting harrowing sounds of splintering. 'My God! My God!' In the Captain's Cabin, the portly merchant trembled as he watched the dreadful Wind Serpent Sovereign outside. His voice quivered with fear and anger. 'That damnable Richard! If I ever lay hands on him, his life will be forfeit! To send me down such a perilous path—it's murder!' He shuddered, then turned his ire to the Captain beside him. 'And you! With such a monstrous creature at our helm, why didn't you warn me sooner?' The Captain ignored the merchant's tirade. His hands were steadfast on the helm, his focus unyielding. Internally, he cursed the fool. He had warned the merchant that this season's route might attract the Wind Serpent Swarm, but the man had scoffed at the warning. Now, with doom at hand, the gall to cast blame! Had he known it would come to this, he would have never embarked on this ill-fated voyage! Chapter Six: The Fall The situation was dire. Both Rhode and Carter, amid the tumult of battle, understood the formidable challenge presented by the Wind Serpent Lord. As the skyship plummeted, the forest canopy below came sharply into focus. However, at this rate, the vessel would likely disintegrate in the sky before ever reaching the ground. 'Haah!' Carter lunged forward, his twin swords drawing chilling arcs of light through the air, aiming for the colossal claws of the Wind Serpent Lord. But just as victory seemed within reach, an unexpected snarl and a gust of foul breath forced Carter to evade the serpent's lethal jaws, marking his attack a failure. Taken by surprise when the serpent suddenly released the ship, Carter was momentarily disoriented. Instinctively raising his swords in defense, he was still flung aside. Skidding across the deck, he finally came to a painful halt against the mast. This could not continue. Rhode's brow furrowed, as he turned his attention to the girl behind him, whose face was etched with anxiety. 'Lijie, I need your help!' 'Eh?' 'I'll distract it. When it attacks, cast a Guardian Shield for me!' 'Understood!' Lijie nodded without hesitation. Her hands tightly clasped, she summoned a serene, glowing light around her. Seeing this, Rhode wasted no further words. He turned, his sword at the ready, and charged with renewed vigor. Shattered Blade. The gleaming Blade of Light once again cut through the air, striking the Wind Serpent Lord with unyielding force. Though Rhode had not focused the Blade of Light as before, allowing its power to disperse, its might was still formidable. Unable to pierce the serpent's scales, it nonetheless ripped several distinct, bloody gashes in the creature's wing membranes, eliciting an agonized howl from the beast, 'Sss!' The Wind Serpent Lord's advance stalled as it jerked its head back, its baleful, crimson eyes aflame with rage, fixed on the defiant young human on the deck. Then, with its gaping maw wide open, it dove at Rhode once more. The serpent's speed was undeniable; in the blink of an eye, Rhode saw its gaping, blood-red jaws above him, bracing for the crucial moment. He deliberately refrained from using Shadow Flash, opting instead for a slower advance to entice the serpent into making a move. Though the risk was high, it was precisely when an adversary launched a full-on assault that its weaknesses were most exposed—and that was the opportunity Rhode was waiting for. As the jaws of the Wind Serpent Lord loomed, mere seconds from potentially sealing his fate, it still couldn't claim its prey. At that critical moment, a subtle, white, egg-shaped barrier materialized around Rhode, repelling the serpent's razor-sharp teeth. Though the barrier was shattered by the next blow, the serpent caught nothing but air. For as the Guardian Shield enveloped him, Rhode had already activated Shadow Flash. He glided past the serpent's bite like a wraith, his pristine white sword raised high, delivering a devastating strike to its unprotected throat. This was the Wind Serpent Lord's most critical weakness, previously guarded by caution. Now, driven to recklessness by Rhode's provocation, it had no time to shield its most vulnerable point. '———!!!' A shrill cry of agony pierced the air as the serpent recoiled, dark blood spurting from its throat and drenching the deck. Its massive body then slumped onto the deck, lifeless. At that moment, Rhode's vision was filled with a deep green expanse. 'Boom!' The ship jolted violently, his body cast into a moment of weightlessness. Then darkness enveloped Rhode's vision, and consciousness slipped from his grasp. As he came to, the chill of the twilight forest was the first sensation to greet him. 'Where am I...?' Opening his eyes, the first sight to grace him was a night sky alight with unnatural brilliance. This night was different, with gentle moonbeams casting precise shadows of each leaf upon the earth. Above, not only did stars twinkle, but bands of light intertwined, forming a web of luminescence that stretched in all directions. This was a hallmark of the Dragon Soul Continent—according to ancient lore, this was once an expanse riddled with chaos and danger. Then came five dragons, who sculpted the world and all life within this void from their own bodies. To quell the malevolent chaos, after shaping the world, they infused their souls into it to restrain the forces of darkness and maintain the world's order. Each dragon soul manifested uniquely, as seen in the sky above Rhode now. It signified the protective presence of the Light Dragon Soul. Its trait was to ensure that even in night's darkness, light would still shine. Contrasting this was the realm of the Dark Dragon Soul, where even at noon, darkness prevailed, devoid of light's touch. Consequently, the distribution of life on the continent followed this dichotomy. Verdant flora flourished under the watchful gaze of the Light Dragon Soul. But in the Dark Dragon Soul's domain, only bioluminescent plants could be seen. There were no gods over this land, only the five primordial dragons worshipped as creators. And the bearers of their souls. Every soul has its core, and for the world-shaping dragons, these cores resided within chosen individuals. These bearers could wield this power to adjust the dragon souls' guardianship over the land. To liken chaos to a virus and the dragon soul's power to a firewall, then the keeper of the soul core would be the CPU. As long as the CPU operates, the firewall remains robust, repelling all chaotic forces from the world. These soul core custodians were revered as the true heirs to the dragon souls. But for Rhode at the moment, such lore held little relevance. He rose, his body wracked by intense pain, particularly from the severe wound on his left chest. Previously, he could barely move his left hand, but now even the slightest movement brought searing pain, as if his entire arm was submerged in flames. Yet this pain confirmed that his arm was still attached—for numbness would signal a far more serious issue. Looking up, the moonlight revealed the skyship's wreckage among the towering trees of Silvermoon Forest, bathed in the forest's ethereal glow. With that, the sequence of events became clear. Though Rhode had slain the Wind Serpent Lord, the skyship, already teetering on the brink of collapse, had succumbed to the violent impact of its descent, now shattered amidst the trees. The forest was eerily silent, devoid of even the softest insect chirp. Rhode's gaze swept over the surroundings, noting the bloodstains and bodies scattered across the ground, vestiges of both Wind Serpents and humans. A short distance away, a small figure lay motionless. 'Lijie!' Rhode rushed to the girl's side, leaning down to check her condition. Fortunately, though she appeared pallid and held her hands tightly, her breathing was steady. Moments after Rhode's call, her eyes fluttered open. 'I... What has happened to me...?' Lijie's eyes opened, unfocused at first, then settled on the man before her. After a moment, she began to regain her composure, a testament to the brutality of their crash. 'I'm still alive?' 'Yes.' Relieved by Lijie's response, Rhode watched as she slowly stood, shaking her head and biting her lip, her full recovery yet to come. Yet, there were more pressing concerns for her now. 'Where are the others? What of the leader? How do they fare?' '...............' Rhode offered no response, for Lijie required none—the scene around them spoke volumes. The young girl's already pale face tightened with shock. 'How could this be... Crite! Xar! Leader!' She dashed to the mercenaries' bodies, desperately calling out their names, but there was no reply. Lijie did not abandon hope; she knelt, meticulously checking each mercenary. After confirming his death, she did not succumb to tears but clenched her teeth and moved to the next. Her efforts, however, bore no fruit. Before those lifeless forms, cold and rigid, she was powerless. Though Lijie persisted, when she came upon Carter's body, her legs gave way, and she collapsed to the ground. The mercenary leader, once brimming with vitality, was now just a lifeless husk. Half of his body was wedged into a crevice on the deck, his abdomen impaled by a broken wooden stake. 'Lea... Leader...' As Lijie processed this, she sat on the damp earth, stunned, the flame of hope now extinguished from her eyes, leaving only the cold ashes of despair behind. Eventually, the girl bowed her head, her quiet sobs reaching Rhode's ears as they were carried by the night breeze. Observing the girl's trembling shoulders, Rhode could only stand in silence behind her, at a loss for words. In the heat of battle, the immediacy of life and death had overshadowed everything else. But now, with the conflict concluded and surrounded by the fallen, Rhode's feelings were a jumble. He had seen death before, but those had been simulations within the realm of a game. In the game, the dead could be revived with spells, or their souls could make their way back to life at a graveyard. But this was not a game. Here, there was no return for the departed. Death was final. In that moment, Rhode's mind drifted back to that night seven years ago when he could only watch helplessly—death passed by unwaveringly, and he was powerless to intervene. As he contemplated words of comfort for the girl before him, a faint plea for help broke the silence. 'Hey... Is there anyone? Help...' Chapter Seven: After the Catastrophe Meis sat by the campfire, his plump face a canvas of resignation and frustration. He was eager to vent his anger but found no suitable target for his vexation. Across the campfire, Rhode leaned against a tree trunk, eyes closed in repose. Lijie quietly prepared their meal, her calm exterior barely concealing the swollen eyes that spoke volumes of her silent sorrow. Fate had it that the portly merchant was the only other survivor apart from Rhode and Lijie. As a seasoned trader, Meis had accumulated various magical artifacts for protection. When the skyship took its fatal dive, his guardian amulet showcased its value, shielding him from the gravest injuries— Rhode, who had been tending to earlier wounds, found his condition worsen after the intense combat and subsequent crash. Lijie's situation was scarcely better. Initially, adrenaline masked her injuries, but as calm returned, the truth of her dislocated right arm and wounded foot became undeniable. Aside from superficial cuts and a throbbing headache from the impact, Meis was relatively unharmed. Normally, such injuries would have bedridden a person for months, but they were fortunate. Lijie, a bona fide Spirit Master, possessed healing magic. Through her intervention, they saw improvements in their condition, though Rhode required more time for full recuperation. Considering the battle's ferocity and his severe injuries, Rhode's near-miraculous state could have left him dead or permanently disabled. Yet, he stood with all limbs intact, his mobility only mildly impeded by his wounds—nearly as good as new. This astonished even Lijie, who had cared for him since his rescue and was well aware of the extent of his injuries. She had not foreseen such remarkable resilience in Rhode's physique. Rhode himself was inwardly amazed. In the heat of battle, he recognized that his body was not constrained by human limits, yet he hadn't anticipated such an extraordinary level of endurance—to remain mobile after severe trauma and a violent crash. Could his mixed heritage be a factor? But Rhode harbored another secret. He was keenly aware of his body's supernatural attributes, even if the specifics remained a mystery. Clearly, he was not merely human. The survival of the golden-haired girl, Lijie, was even more baffling. As a fragile Spirit Master, she should have had minimal odds of survival. Rhode's resilience was due to his non-human traits, but what about hers? It surely couldn't be just luck. The puzzle persisted until Rhode noticed a hint of gold in Lijie's deep azure eyes. Suddenly, it made sense—her survival was not just a stroke of luck. 'Mr. Rhode?' Meis inquired tentatively, an ingratiating smile forming on his chubby face. 'What should our next move be?' After rescuing Meis, the trio revisited the skyship's debris, confirming there were no other survivors. To prevent their fallen comrades from becoming forest predators' prey, Lijie proposed cremation. Meis, hesitant to watch his valuable goods consumed by fire, was persuaded by Lijie's somber expression and Rhode's indifference. Wincing, he watched the skyship burn— He looked as though he had suffered the most grievous injury. The amulet, costly as it was, had indeed saved his life. Now shattered, having absorbed the impact's brunt, it was reduced to scrap. Meis's loss was significant. They took a day to rest in the forest. Although no further troubles arose, the merchant, still shaken by the Wind Serpent assault, had become exceedingly cautious. He had previously dismissed Wind Serpent encounters as too improbable to worry about. Now, his stance was completely reversed; the once distant rumors now felt all too real— 'They said this route might be home to Wind Serpents, and indeed, we encountered them! I've also heard stories of man-eating wolves and formidable birds within Silvermoon Forest. We're not going to encounter them too, are we?' Once bitten, twice shy, as the saying goes. Meis was tormented by such thoughts, his forehead slick with sweat. Despite his experience as a merchant, he lacked genuine adventuring knowledge. The dense underbrush and towering trees made his legs quiver. Idle talk of venomous snakes and wolves from his guards now haunted him, rendering him nearly paranoid with fear. With his sole protective artifact now useless, Meis had no choice but to rely on others for safety. He did not consider Lijie as a viable option. Having met her during the hiring process, he noticed her obedience and pleasant nature but also her lack of decisiveness. And as a non-combatant, she would likely be of little help in a real emergency. Thus, Meis's dependence fell on Rhode. Though no warrior himself, Rhode had previously demonstrated significant capabilities, suggesting his strength was more than adequate. While Meis could not compare Rhode's adventuring experience to that of seasoned mercenaries, he assumed the gap was not profound. As for Lijie, she seemed still enveloped in her sorrow over her companions' loss, disinterested in such practical matters. 'Do not worry, Mr. Meis,' Rhode reassured, observing the merchant's anxious demeanor. Though the man was somewhat unrefined, Rhode bore him no resentment. If not for Meis's command to halt the ship, Rhode may not have been rescued. He felt goodwill toward the merchant. 'I am intimately familiar with Silvermoon Forest. Given our current location, it is unlikely we will encounter any serious threats. Rest assured.' Rhode's assurance was grounded in experience. In the game, the northern plains of Pafield were a novice player's sanctuary, and he knew the local monster distributions well. On the plains, the Wind Serpent swarm posed a significant threat, especially to melee-oriented classes and solo adventurers. In Silvermoon Forest, the primary hazard came from Silver Wolves. Unlike the serpents that relied on numbers, wolves typically hunted alone, making them easier to handle. Moreover, after defeating the Wind Serpent Lord, Rhode had gained 3000 experience points, reaching level eight. With the novice zone capped at level ten, Rhode felt confident of his ability to navigate the area. Unless he, like some inexperienced player, neglected the map and stumbled into a deadly lair—a scenario virtually impossible for the 'Walking Library.' 'That is indeed comforting to hear,' Meis responded, visibly relieved as he wiped the sweat from his brow. Exhausted from the day's stress and lack of sleep, even the slightest rustling had sounded like wolf howls to him. Now, with his nerves finally easing, he curled up contentedly by the fire, closed his eyes, and quickly succumbed to deep slumber. Assured that Meis was deep in sleep, Rhode, who had been sitting silently by the fire, rose. Turning away from the campsite, he ventured deeper into the forest. Chapter 8: The Ten Great Primordials, Card of Wind Rhode Alante certainly had no intention of abandoning the portly merchant. His departure was solely to inspect the loot he had acquired. Throughout the recent battle, Rhode had amassed an impressive amount of experience, though tangible rewards were scarce. For players, the crashed skyship was a treasure trove, and the numerous deceased aboard were likely to have considerable wealth. Nonetheless, Rhode ultimately decided against salvaging. It would be distasteful to plunder the belongings of those who had saved his life after their demise. While experience points were invaluable, Rhode felt that a more significant gain was the black original stone in his hand. According to the lore of Dragon Soul Continent, such a stone is the crystallized soul core of a powerful magical creature at death. Its uses varied: it could be set as a jewel in weapons, melted to forge soul weapons, or used by spellcasters as an excellent material for crafting magical tools. Due to the rarity of soul cores, their price was exorbitantly high in the continent's world. To a Summoner Swordsman, their value was unparalleled, as they were essential for awakening summoned spirits. Now, Rhode stood in the quiet embrace of the forest, his right hand revealing the soul core. It lay tranquil in his palm, dark as the void, the size of a nucleus. Surrounded by silence, the gentle forest bathed in soft moonlight that filtered through the leaves, dappling the ground and underbrush with specks of light. The summoning circle on the back of Rhode's hand glowed anew, its serpentine magical light swiftly expanding. A system prompt materialized before Rhode: [Contaminated Soul Core detected. Would you like to purify it?] "Purify." Instantly, the summoning circle on Rhode's right hand erupted with pristine radiance, flowing like water down his fingers, encircling the soul core in his palm. As the divine power infiltrated, the black miasma entwining the soul core vanished as swiftly as snow under sunlight, leaving no trace. With the dark fog cleared, the soul core finally revealed its true form—a transparent gem, trembling gently, radiating an azure glow as if an imprisoned soul yearned for release. [Soul Core purification complete. Would you like to proceed with awakening?] "Awaken." Upon Rhode's command, the azure gem's trembling intensified. Then, with a soft 'pop', the gem shattered, and streams of blue, water-like energy burst forth. They spiraled and intertwined, eventually forming a card, which then came to rest quietly in Rhode's hand. A refreshing coolness spread through him, prompting an involuntary shiver of comfort. At that moment, Rhode understood the entity with which he had forged a contract. He examined the card; its face depicted a verdant spirit bird soaring across the sky, with a teal half-moon in the upper-right corner indicating the card's Wind Elemental attribute, and a 'V' in the top-left. Two small numbers—2—were displayed at the card's bottom corners. Flipping the card over, the back revealed text shimmering with arcane light: [Soaring Spirit Bird (Wind Elemental Attribute): A flight-capable, fusion-compatible spirit. Attacks have a 10% chance of inflicting paralysis and piercing effects, bypassing magical defenses— Innate Skill: Spectral Wind Mirage (Children of the wind soaring the heavens, a wide-range skill.)] [You have obtained 1/10 of the Sky Deck, the Soaring Spirit Bird] Rhode couldn't suppress a grin. Aerial spirits were essential for early-stage Summoner Swordsmen, and the Wind Elemental Attribute allowed it to pass effortlessly through barriers without magical properties, making ordinary defenses futile. Coupled with a 30-meter effective range and special effects, Rhode felt assured of his safety from most dangers. Should he encounter a mutated Boss, he was confident in his capacity to contend. Yet, Rhode's vexation stemmed from the enigma of his attributes. To date, his strength, constitution, agility, and willpower remained obscured, a fact that left him with an unsettling sense of unease. Though in his own body, its current capabilities far exceeded the potential he should possess as a regular human. He was certain his attributes surpassed those of a human, but the inability to grasp the specifics of his condition was disconcerting. Believing you would die and then surviving is a fortunate mistake. However, assuming you would live, only to die, is a nightmarish reality. With his attributes concealed, Rhode could only speculate based on his accumulated experiences. His battle with the Wind Serpent Lord had provided him with some clues. An adversary he had once meticulously researched as a Boss. Given his performance in that battle, his strength appeared on par with that of a standard swordsman, while his constitution was notably formidable. Since his arrival in this world, despite numerous perils, Rhode's body seemed to have withstood the trials, never once reaching a critical condition, only ever alert. His speed appeared no different from that of an average human. As for willpower, Rhode found himself without a means to gauge it—he certainly couldn't solicit a mage to cast mental spells on him to test his resistance. At that moment, a subtle rustling came from the underbrush. Rhode arched an eyebrow, and the radiance of the summoning circle on the back of his hand dimmed in an instant, while the card turned into motes of magical dust, vanishing from sight. Once sealed as a card and bound to a holder, sealed cards no longer manifested physically. They would slumber quietly within the 'Ten Great Primordials,' the summoning circle on the Summoner Swordsman's hand, awaiting their master's call to action. Only two cards currently resided within—the attribute-less 'Star Scar' and the Wind Elemental 'Spirit Bird,' both nestled in the 'Kingdom' ring of the Outer Six Rings. Rhode had no desire to reveal his capabilities overly in the presence of others. The game's lore might introduce Summoner Swordsmen as a player-exclusive class from the continent's ancient past, with players as the lone inheritors on a quest to rediscover and relive the glory of this heroic class. But these were mere pleasantries from the game's introduction. Judging by the expressions of Lijie and Meis, Rhode surmised that these people were likely wholly unaware of such a profession. It was therefore imprudent for him to divulge more. Moreover, maintaining an aura of mystery bore its own advantages. As Rhode turned, he spotted Lijie emerging from the woods. "Lijie? What brings you here?" "Ah... No, it's nothing, Mr. Rhode." Lijie shook her head, her countenance reflecting a trace of disquiet. "I just wanted to check on your wounds, see if there's anything I can do..." Her voice tapered off, her fingers tightly clutching the hem of her robe, betraying a fragile visage. Rhode had taken note of Lijie's abnormal behavior. Meis's ability to discern her traits was borne of his experience as a merchant traversing the continent, necessitating a sharp eye to avoid misfortune. Rhode's insight into her character, however, stemmed from his tenure as the leader of Dragon Soul Continent's preeminent guild. Hidden behind their avatars, players often masked their true selves more readily online than in reality. In such a digital realm, coalescing the strength of a collective was vital—most players sought pleasure, not labor, in the game. Compelling them to adhere to schedules, participate in raids, and chase records and achievements demanded a delicate balance and keen oversight. Therefore, discerning the mood and inner thoughts of his companions was of paramount importance for a guild leader like Rhode. Now, Lijie's demeanor unequivocally signaled a dire need for support, casting her into a profound state of unease. Rhode could see that the loss of her companions had dealt her a severe blow, not merely from the departure of familiar faces but from the trepidation and uncertainty about the future. Rhode had observed the girl amidst the tumult of battle. Back then, she had performed admirably, casting healing spells on her comrades with alacrity, swiftly dispelling toxins, and the protective shield she conjured for Rhode was a feat of precision timing—an impressive display for a support role. She had been full of confidence then, decisive and undaunted in the face of peril. Now, the quivering girl before him bore no trace of that earlier assurance. There was but one explanation. Chapter Nine: Departure Rhode Alante cast a contemplative glance at the young woman before him and sighed softly. "Lijie Noelle, you are the one who should be burdened with worry. Since the ordeal of last night, you've scarcely had a moment's repose," he remarked with concern. The words 'last night' sent a shiver through Lijie, as if the shadows of past events were once again enveloping her. Despite this, she stubbornly bit her lip and shook her head. "No... I..." 'Slap!' Her protest was cut off when Rhode delivered a swift, disciplinary slap to her cheek. What was the meaning of this? Holding her reddened cheek, Lijie's eyes were wide with disbelief. She stared at the enigmatic Rhode, who simply returned her gaze with a quiet intensity before speaking up. "I understand what you're feeling right now." His voice was calm, almost devoid of emotion, igniting a flicker of anger within Lijie. She lowered her hand, fists clenched as though she was about to refute Rhode's presumptuous words, yet his next sentence drained her of any strength to argue. "Feeling guilty for surviving merely because you're different is not fitting for a half-blood," he said. '!!' At those words, Lijie recoiled in shock, instinctively crossing her arms and retreating until her back met a tree. Despite this, her focus remained fixed on the man before her, mouth agape, unable to utter a word. How did he know? That was impossible. She hadn't told him, and within the Star Moon Mercenary Corps, only a select few were privy to her secret. "How did you..." "Your eyes," Rhode interjected. "Under the light, they reflect a golden sheen, the hallmark of the 'Light Guardians'—the angels. Unlike those of purebloods, the luster in your eyes is subdued, a veil cast by your human lineage—is that not so?" She remained silent. Though she did not confirm, Rhode's assessment proved accurate. The girl before him was indeed a half-blood. He had been observing Lijie for some time, and as a top player, he was accustomed to discerning attributes through equipment and traits—a skill critical in both boss battles and PvP confrontations, a finesse mastered by veteran players. After their rescue, Rhode had watched the girl intentionally, quickly deducing her true nature. Her mixed heritage did not diminish the potent healing and damage resistance of angels, the likely reason why Lijie survived the skyship's demise. She must have been acutely aware of this—hence her despondency. "So I said I can understand your thoughts," Rhode continued, his shoulders lifting in a slight shrug. "You know why you lived, but it's not luck—it's the result of differences that set you apart from others. And you can't accept that... If possible, you'd rather be an ordinary human, facing death with your comrades, not surviving by chance." '.....................' Her head bowed, Lijie's hands clutched her skirt tightly. "But it's not for you to decide." As he watched Lijie's tremulous shoulders, Rhode's tone grew tender. "You cannot choose your birth nor stop what comes to pass. These are matters beyond your reach; never regret what you cannot control." "Then... what should I do?" Lijie finally ventured, her voice faint. "That path is yours to choose," Rhode advised. After a moment of silence, Lijie lifted her head, a look of clarity in her eyes. "I understand now. Thank you, Mr. Rhode Alante." "No need for thanks." '...... However, that slap really did sting...' Though the method may have been brusque, Lijie had stepped out from the shadow of grief and self-reproach. By the next day's sunrise, her golden locks shone without a trace of previous sorrow, replaced by her familiar, gentle smile. This unexpected transformation left Meis, who had awoken completely unaware of the night's events, quite perplexed. He cast curious glances between the two, eventually directing a meaningful smirk at Rhode— The meaning behind it, known only to him. Before the merchant could satisfy his curiosity, Rhode's statement plunged him into contemplation. "It is time we set forth." Set forth? The word sent a jolt through the merchant, who had just enjoyed a filling breakfast. He suddenly remembered they were not nestled in his cozy room, but rather in the vast, perilous expanse of the Silvermoon Forest... They weren't here for leisure; that cursed Wind Serpent, the damnable captain... Enough of that, such memories were pointless now. The pressing concern was—how would they escape this forest of death? At this thought, Meis looked eagerly at Rhode. If the young man claimed to have a plan, surely it must be a well-devised one. They were in the wilderness, where one wrong step could mean death, not to mention the predators lurking within—these were essential survival skills. He had to pay close attention, lest a moment's oversight lead to a fatal end here. With that thought, Meis patted his cheeks, dispelling the last vestiges of sleep. He watched intently as Rhode stood up, dusting the earth from his legs, flexing his wrists, and finally stated, "Let us proceed." ....................................... '...... Wait, hold on, Mr. Rhode Alante!' The merchant, as rotund as he was, sprang up as if seated on a chair studded with nails. "To where do we head?" "To the northeast, there is a town. Once we reach it, the road ahead will be much easier." "Is there nothing we should be wary of?" "Nothing in particular." Rhode's response was expected; the Pafield region, being the novice area for Dragon Soul Continent, had been thoroughly explored by players, particularly those influenced by fantasy novels. In the early days of the game, many players ventured into uncharted and perilous territories in search of legendary artifacts that could grant them dominion over the game world. They dreamed of wielding divine weapons, conquering foes, and establishing mighty empires to rule the continent... But reality is often cruel. Despite players' relentless efforts, while they did find some rare and powerful equipment, none met the dream of holding an artifact that would proclaim 'with this, the world is mine.' The expectations were simply too high. For Meis, the region was fraught with danger, each step potentially his last. But for Rhode, it was as familiar as his own backyard. In the game, as a guild leader, he had often led novices here to level up. He knew every monster-infested spot, the optimal quests for each class, the best training locations—Rhode could navigate this terrain blindfolded. So, to him, there was nothing particularly worth mentioning. Meis? The task of escorting merchants was routine for Rhode, undertaken countless times within the game; how could it possibly concern him? Upon hearing Rhode's answer, Meis's face drooped, resembling a wilted flower. He couldn't fathom Rhode's thoughts, but the dismissal seemed quite negligent. Reflecting on this, the merchant began to second-guess his decision. The young man had been severely injured in the mountains. If he had been unharmed, such casualness might be excusable. But now, with injuries, this nonchalance... Was it not akin to seeking death? Though regret was beginning to gnaw at him, Meis had no choice but to proceed. Resigned, he clenched his teeth and followed the pair deeper into the woods. Bathed in the bright sunlight, Silvermoon Forest seemed calm, the sun's rays filtering through the leafy canopy to dance upon the forest floor. Birdsong rang out crisply, and even a wild rabbit could be seen darting through the underbrush. The scene was so peaceful that the once-anxious merchant began to relax. No longer suspicious, he settled into the surroundings. Rhode was trailblazing, his agile figure weaving deftly through the forest's natural labyrinth. Vines and thorny underbrush proved no obstacle to his passage. Observing his nimble movements, it was hard to believe he had recently suffered grave injuries. Lijie, following close behind, kept pace with practiced ease. Clearly accustomed to the challenges of the wilderness, she navigated the terrain with assured grace despite her cumbersome robe, occasionally cautioning Meis to watch his step. The deeper they ventured, the more astonished Lijie became. To an observer, Rhode's chosen path might seem random; he did not travel in a straight line, often veering left or right, sometimes circling back. It would be easy to assume he roamed without purpose. Yet, few could perceive that under Rhode's guidance, a smooth trail revealed itself amidst the dense woodland, as if it had always existed, waiting to be discovered. Lijie had heard her leader mention such high-level skills. It was challenging for ordinary people to navigate forests; only elves, in harmony with nature, and rangers, steeped in the wilds, possessed this expertise. She had witnessed it once. Her team, lost in the woods, had been rescued by an elf who chose a direction opposite to established paths. At the time, Lijie was apprehensive, but they left the forest with ease. It was then that she learned of the technique from her leader. But... Watching Rhode's back, Lijie's head tilted in curiosity. According to her leader, only experienced elves and rangers could master such skill. Ordinary elves had the gift of communing with nature but could not achieve this level of navigation. But Rhode—so at ease, never once pausing to commune with the flora—was clearly not an elf, nor... Did he resemble a ranger? Though Lijie had limited interaction with rangers, she knew their primary weapon was the bow. Yet, Rhode had not once used a bow since they met... Who was he, really? With each passing moment, Lijie's curiosity deepened. Rhode halted his stride. Through the underbrush, he could see the clear waters of a lake, the very heart of Silvermoon Forest—Moonlight Lake. In the game, this was a respite for players, a haven for rest amid their journey. "How marvelous!" Admiring the clear waters, Meis subconsciously licked his dry lips. Though their journey had been brief, for a merchant accustomed to comfort, it felt like an eternity. Seeing such a tranquil spot ahead, the merchant quickened his steps toward the lake, eager for a moment of rest. But as he began to move, Rhode's hand pressed against his shoulder. The merchant looked at the young man in confusion, but Rhode remained silent, simply gesturing for silence with a finger to his lips before pointing ahead. Meis followed Rhode's indication to the lakeside, and his face turned ashen. In the shadows by the lake, a majestic white giant wolf lay in repose, its eyes closed as if in peaceful slumber. Chapter 10: Forest Pathfinding As a seasoned merchant, Meis had encountered his share of wolves. Yet, he could swear he had never seen one so immense. The beast before them, towering as tall as a man, was cloaked in a lustrous, thick fur, leisurely basking in the afternoon sun, its powerful tail swaying with deceptive ease. Lijie, too, had fallen silent; she trod cautiously behind Rhode, her breath held in suspense. As a mercenary, she was well aware of the dangers these formidable creatures posed. While not as visibly tense as Meis—who seemed to be holding his breath in dread—she, too, looked to Rhode, awaiting his directive with bated breath. Rhode was contemplating their predicament. Before them stood 'Moon Soul,' a Silver Wolf of level 10, an elite creature. Not a boss, but a far cry from a benign adversary. On the Dragon Soul Continent, creatures were sorted into beasts, giant beasts, and demonic beasts—the latter two representing the most formidable of adversaries. Beasts were the common denizens of the wilderness, while giant beasts had grown massive and ferocious through longevity or external stimuli. Upon awakening their soul power, they evolved into demonic beasts—far more cunning and formidable in combat. Although 'Moon Soul' wasn't as menacing as the Wind Serpent Lord they had previously encountered, Rhode recognized it as a significant challenge. Nonetheless, he remained composed. A cursory glance at their surroundings sufficed. In the game world, Rhode would have slain the wolf without a second thought for experience and loot. But this was not a game, and their party was small. Lijie, a Spirit Master, lacked self-defense capabilities, and Meis... Meis was not a combatant. In such circumstances, discretion was indeed the better part of valor. With a subtle hand gesture, Rhode signaled a tactical withdrawal, selecting an alternate route to avoid the Silver Wolf. Given the vastness of Moonlight Lake, a confrontation was unnecessary. Lijie and Meis exchanged a glance of mutual understanding and quickly followed Rhode's lead, eager to distance themselves from the impending danger. But, as fate would have it... 'Crack.' Meis's footing betrayed him, and he stumbled to the ground, the sound of a snapping twig shattering the forest's stillness. Rhode, leading the way, spun around swiftly, his right hand poised for action. With a crisp birdcall, a burst of verdant energy launched from his palm toward the looming threat. 'Boom!' The sound of impact reverberated through the woods, followed by a low, pained howl. Lijie and Meis turned just in time to see the black giant wolf, which had approached undetected, now sprawled on the ground, struck down by some invisible force. A shadow flitted past. Upon Meis's stumble, Rhode had sensed imminent danger. The giant wolves of Silvermoon Forest, known for their keen senses, were among the top predators of the realm. Fortunately, Rhode's experiences with similar situations in the game now served him well. Though his current senses weren't sharp enough to pinpoint the beasts, his familiarity with their behavior prompted swift action. The resting 'Moon Soul' might not launch an immediate attack, but it was certainly aware of their presence. This predator would likely stalk them silently, waiting until nightfall to strike. They could afford to wait; Rhode could not. To confront the beast now, to take control of the situation, was far more advantageous than to risk an ambush later. Rhode's judgment was swift and precise. The 'Moon Soul' had not anticipated such a prompt counterassault. It instinctively reacted, but a fraction too late. The spectral bird struck its target with unerring precision, the concussive force sending the giant wolf tumbling. As the beast lay dazed on the forest floor, Rhode, bolstered by 'Shadow Flash,' was already by its side. His focus was unwavering, his hand outstretched. 'Cage!' (Elven Tongue: Bind) The spectral bird returned to his hand, transforming back into its card form, its color shifting from green to white in an instant. Without a second glance, Rhode grasped the card tightly, then thrust it at the 'Moon Soul's hind leg with precision. A radiant beam of white light burst forth, piercing the wolf's limb and pinning it to the ground. In Rhode's grasp, the sword known as 'Star Scar' materialized. The Silver Wolf howled in torment, its eyes wide with a mix of fury and pain as it glared at its human adversary. It attempted to rise, only to falter again, its injury grievous. Rhode did not hesitate. With the wolf's every movement under his vigilant watch, he maintained his advantage. Creatures like 'Moon Soul' were renowned for their swiftness, and had he not swiftly neutralized that trait, the battle would have been arduous. Now, with its agility impaired, the Silver Wolf could no longer rely on speed for defense. What followed would be far less challenging. Despite its grave injury, the Silver Wolf did not descend into panic. It met Rhode's gaze, and as his blade descended, it raised its paw in defense. But Rhode had anticipated the counterstrike. His blade, a blazing arc of white, swept beneath the wolf's descending paw, drawing a stream of crimson. As the wolf recoiled in pain, all it could see was the blade's glare, outshining even the sun. Vital Strike! The 'Dancing Shattered Blade' cut through the wolf's massive frame with ease, its edge slicing through the tough hide as if it were mere parchment. With a cry of distress, the black giant wolf was hurled into the air, crashing against a sapling before tumbling to the earth. A gruesome wound gaped along its side, exposing stark white bone and the slow seep of its innards—a sight of visceral horror. Even Rhode, who had witnessed such scenes in his confrontations with the Wind Serpents, couldn't help but grimace. In the game, vital strikes were mere numbers, not the stark and visceral reality before him. The impact from the spectral bird, combined with Rhode's targeted assault, had pushed the giant wolf to its breaking point. Its once formidable growls now reduced to pitiful whimpers. It struggled to stand, to persist. But Rhode was resolute. With a swift motion, he drove 'Star Scar' into the wolf's skull, decisively ending its life. What seemed an extended encounter had, in truth, spanned only a few brief moments. To Lijie and Meis, it appeared Rhode had dispatched 'Moon Soul' with remarkable precision, felling it with a series of swift, accurate strikes. They stood in awe at the ease with which Rhode had vanquished such a formidable foe. It was a feat beyond their grasp; even a fully assembled mercenary corps would have found it challenging to defeat a giant wolf with such finesse. For Meis, the mix of awe and guilt was overwhelming. At the moment of his fall, his heart had plunged into cold dread, fearful of the wolf's detection. He had anticipated the process but not the outcome. The Silver Wolf had indeed noticed them, but before it could act on its predatory instincts, it had become a lifeless carcass... Though the immediate threat was neutralized, Meis remained disturbed, his gaze fixed on the young man who had saved them from peril. He knew his blunder was significant and the fear of being abandoned by Rhode loomed large. Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't have troubled him, as he would be surrounded by hired guards who would overlook minor missteps. But this was not the norm. Rhode was not a guard or a mercenary; he was an equal. If displeased, Rhode could easily abandon him to his fate. 'This... I... I didn't mean to...' Meis, grappling with his thoughts, felt a cold sweat bead his back. He licked his parched lips, at a loss for words. Then, Rhode stood. He turned, his expression composed, his eyes meeting Meis's anxious ones. 'Be more cautious in your steps.' In that moment, Meis realized that nodding was the only response left to him... Chapter Eleven: Lingering Shadows Rhode had initially intended to rest near Moonlight Lake for a while before resuming their journey. However, the encounter with the giant wolf made him reconsider. Fearing the scent of blood from the carcasses might attract unwanted trouble, he chose a relatively flat high ground upstream of Moonlight Lake to camp as the sun went down. After their meal, Rhode resumed his role as sentry, despite the strain on his body. Given his familiarity with the Silvermoon Forest and being the only one capable of combat, it was a necessary burden. The portly merchant Meis had offered to assist, but Rhode and Lijie’s expressions made their doubts clear without words. Therefore, Meis, with a sense of defeat, could do little but sit idly by the fire, sorting through their salvaged belongings from the skyship wreckage. Lijie, too, was not idle. At that moment, she knelt by Rhode's side, placing her hands upon his left shoulder. "AliyMia." (Dragon Language: Healing) Along with the girl’s clear chant, a gentle white glow rose from her palms, enveloping Rhode's form. In the Dragon Soul Continent, casters typically use Dragon Language to cast spells, as since the Genesis Era, nearly seventy percent of magic has been transmitted in this form, widely adopted by humans during the Great Magic Era. The remaining magics are composed of Angelic Tongue, Elven Language, Demonic Tongue, and Necrotic Tongue. As races originally created and guarded by the Progenitor Dragon, they inherited the magical talents and longevity of dragons. This has also become the division between the various strata on the continent. In the Kingdom of Night, the Kingdom of Light, and the Kingdom of Law, regardless of their political systems, the highest ranks are invariably those with the souls of the Five Great Dragons. Following them are non-humans like angels, elves, demons, and undead, with humans below. Each country's hierarchy varies due to differing political systems. The Kingdom of Night, ruled by Monarchic Rule, has a strict class system with no humans among its leaders. The Kingdom of Light, which practices Parliamentary Democracy, includes humans in half of its high council. In the Kingdom of Law, where Theocratic Centralism prevails, angels, elves, and humans are evenly distributed, each holding a third of the power, as they believe in the Path of Balance. Rhode was well-versed in the continent's affairs and what was to come. As a player in the game, one could simply quit. But now, as part of this world, he pondered his next move against the looming catastrophes. "Mr. Rhode... Mr. Rhode?" Lijie's voice pulled Rhode from his reverie. He looked up at the girl before him, who had regained her usual demeanor. Although worry occasionally crossed her brows, she seemed vastly better than the gloomy, near-suicidal look previously. "I felt something during the battle with the Wind Serpent Lord," she said cautiously, glancing at Meis, who sat nearby with a pained expression. "Oh?" Rhode raised an eyebrow. "A dark aura. Not strong, unlike what you'd expect from a creature of darkness... Mr. Rhode, Wind Serpents aren't creatures of darkness, are they?" Of course not, Wind Serpents are creatures of Wind Elementals, distant from Dark Elements. But... "Are you certain?" "Yes, absolutely." Rhode mulled over her confident reply. He knew of the Wind Serpent Swarm's persistent attacks on Wind Tide Trade Route ships, causing significant losses. The Kingdom of Light claimed nomadic tribes from Pafield’s southern disputed region, under the Kingdom of Darkness’s control, were responsible. Later, the Kingdom of Light attacked, expelling and massacring the inhabitants. Then the Kingdom of Night retaliated, reclaiming their claimed land and initiating a full-scale invasion of the Kingdom of Light. This history unfolded during the public beta, where Rhode and other players were occupied with new systems and leveling, paying little attention to the backstory. By the time the game officially launched, war had already broken out. Players speculated differently about the cause. Some saw it as the Kingdom of Light’s failure to reclaim territory, while others suggested deliberate provocation by the Kingdom of Night. Many believed the Kingdom of Night had long coveted the Kingdom of Light, exploiting mismanagement to initiate war. Rhode saw truth in each theory. The disputed lands were rich in Crystal Mines, valuable to any nation, and the Kingdom of Light had no reason to relent. The current Night Dragon Eon, a formidable ruler, proved difficult for even the craftiest players. There were even rumors he was not an NPC, but a game company employee in disguise. Given the Kingdom of Light's parliamentary performance during the war, many players, frustrated with absurd orders, defected to fight against them, highlighting the tragic circumstances. Now it seemed the conspiracy theorists were closer to the truth. Lijie’s senses were unlikely to be wrong. As creatures of the Light Element, angels are sensitive to Dark Elements, and her half-blood heritage should align. Could the Wind Serpent Swarm’s attacks on the Wind Tide Trade Route be a premeditated move by the Kingdom of Night, foreshadowing a full-scale assault on the Kingdom of Light? The situation was more complex than it appeared. "Lijie, mention this to no one." "Understood, Mr. Rhode." She nodded, retracting her hands after another careful check of his wounds, smiling faintly. "Your wounds have healed significantly. Another five or six days should see full recovery." "Thank you." Rhode nodded his gratitude, then focused on the system information before him. His health was visibly improving. Soon, he would regain full mobility. Now, a long list of tasks awaited him. Rhode furrowed his brow, pondering his next move... Meanwhile, at the skyship crash site, two figures emerged from the forest. "Is this the vessel you spoke of?" The lead man asked coldly, his white, streamlined armor marked with glowing golden insignia, identifying him as an officer of the Kingdom of Light’s Frontier Defense. His companion, wrapped in a black cloak obscuring his face, nodded in confirmation. "They killed my envoy." The hoarse voice felt chilling under the night sky. "To think such a filthy, incompetent band of mercenaries could slay it. Your pet was truly ineffectual." "That's your fault, too!" The cloaked figure's voice spiked with anger. "Had you provided a higher-level creature... Dominion Tier, no, Mastery Tier Overlord, I wouldn't have had to use such an inferior being!" "Dominion Tier?" The man scoffed. "What do you believe we are? We supply resources, not handle your tasks. If we could do everything, what need would we have for you?" After a pause, he softened slightly. "How long until you can act again?" "At least half a month. It's not easy to find a malleable Wind Serpent Swarm." "You have ten days. The reward will be doubled." Annoyed by the grumbles, the man's face darkened. He drew a purse from within his armor and tossed it over. "In ten days, you will act again." The purse thudded on the ground, its sound heavy with coin. The figure in the cloak picked it up, peeked inside, then snapped it shut. "Fine, ten days. I will honor the agreement." "Remember, no third party shall know of this." "I understand... By the way, some rats seem to have escaped from the vessel. Shall I deal with them?" "No need." The man waved dismissively. "I have my own methods." At his response, the cloaked figure laughed coldly. "I look forward to seeing your methods." Shadows coalesced and enveloped the figure, who then disappeared. Watching the vanishing point, the man's face showed clear distaste. "Avaricious undead. One day, even your bones will be ash!" With a huff, he turned, his gaze sweeping through the forest. He placed a hand on his sword hilt and whistled sharply. A griffin descended, circling to land before him. Simultaneously, three figures emerged silently from the woods. "Find those rats, deal with them," he ordered coldly as he mounted the griffin. Chapter 12: Ring of Will Stealthy silhouettes darted between the dense trees, parting ways only to reunite with practiced precision. "Discovered anything?" "Eastward, residual traces point to our target, seemingly a day old at most." "Their pace is notable. We must proceed with care; we're trailing the one who vanquished the Wind Serpent Sovereign. Underestimation is not an option." "Acknowledged!" With their exchange complete, the trio of shadows dissolved back into the forest's depth, leaving no trace, not even disturbing the slumbering birds above. As the shadows receded, a serene azure Soul Bird perched silently on a branch took flight, ascending to the heavens. "Are we being shadowed?" Rhode's visage grew somber as the Soul Bird relayed its surveillance. Resting on his shoulder, the translucent azure Soul Bird appeared deceptively similar to an ordinary bird, occasionally tilting its head and fluttering its wings. Its spectral form and the elemental light that enveloped it were the only signs of its true, ethereal nature. Rhode had summoned the Soul Bird for reconnaissance, an ingenious solution forged out of necessity. In the absence of scouts or rangers, he relied on his summoned spirits for guidance. The Soul Bird's elevated vantage and innate soul-sensing abilities afforded Rhode a semblance of security. Initially, Rhode had sent the Soul Bird to monitor their trail for dangers following their battle with a formidable level-ten Moon Soul wolf. However, it inadvertently uncovered a more pressing threat. Although soul sensing offered no visual detail, only gauging presence through the intensity of aura glows, the entities' swift, orderly movements through the forest were indicative of no mere wanderers—likely rangers or spies, professions that thrived in secrecy. Was this a chance encounter? Or were they the quarry of a deliberate hunt? Rhode could not afford to speculate. An open clash was one thing, but adversaries who thrived in the shadows posed a far more insidious challenge. Coupled with Lijie Noelle's prior warnings, Rhode sensed an undercurrent of intrigue. If these mysterious pursuers harbored hostility, the ramifications could be severe. However, upon observing Lijie, a spark of strategy ignited within Rhode. "Mr. Rhode, what shall we do next?" Lijie offered the canteen to the fat merchant beside her, his complexion flushed and sweat-drenched from the exertion. While Rhode had kept his plans close to his chest, Lijie had assumed the role of the merchant's caretaker. As she explained, the Star Moon Mercenary Corps had undertaken the task of safeguarding this man, and she was intent on fulfilling that duty to the end, even as the last member standing. Meis, the merchant, was endlessly grateful, but his labored breathing hinted that his endurance might soon falter on their journey. "Mr. Rhode... I'm exhausted... May we... rest for a moment?" As Rhode paused, the merchant had already collapsed to the ground, clutching his bag as though it were a treasure beyond measure. He fetched a handkerchief, mopping the sweat from his luminous face, which under the sun's glare, shone as brightly as a beacon. "By the grace of the Spirit, it's been... years since I've... embarked on... such a journey... cough, cough...!!" His breath hitched, erupting into a violent cough, his cheeks quivering with each bout. After a moment, he regained composure and bemoaned. "I feel... as though death's doorstep is nigh!" "Five minutes to rest." Rhode scanned the sky, swiftly calculating the time and distance that lay ahead, and then decreed a brief respite. At his word, the merchant on the ground let out a wail and fully relinquished himself to the earth's embrace. Lijie breathed out gently and settled onto a stone nearby. No further dangers had assailed them since that encounter. With the Soul Bird leading, Rhode had adeptly navigated them away from many perils. This cautious approach meant forgoing the chance of uncovering rare equipment, but Rhode harbored no regrets. In this world, lacking the teeming multitudes of players found in games, and where ordinary adventurers seldom tread, those treasures would remain untouched until his return. Yet... Rhode's eyes lifted to the mountain range before him, and he stood with resolve. "Lijie." "Yes, Mr. Rhode, what are your orders?" "I'll head forward to scout. After your break, lead Mr. Meis up to that white stone. There, amidst the shadows, you will find a hidden path. Wait for me there; I will follow shortly." Lijie's gaze followed the direction of Rhode's finger, her eyes settling on the white stone upon the mountainside. Her expression, a blend of bewilderment and reliance, turned to Rhode. Without voicing her questions, she nodded, her trust in him having solidified over their shared journey, and she watched as he set off. Rhode had his purpose. The stone marked the gateway to the Zenar Mountain Path, once a thriving trade conduit carved by the hands of northern ancestors. It was a path that had once glimmered with the promise of prosperity. But as the Wind Tide offered a safer passage, the skies clear and unobstructed compared to the treacherous forests, the ancient route fell into disuse. Those who had once depended upon it had long departed in search of better prospects, leaving their homeland to the embrace of the wilderness. The relentless march of civilization often rendered yesterday's miracles obsolete, a universal truth across all worlds. However, Rhode was not there to dwell on history or to ponder philosophical musings. He halted before a scene of desolation and death. Bleached skeletons, half-buried in dust, lay amid decayed leathers and rusted weapons—the last vestiges of the mercenary band "Tiger Fang," caught in an ambush by bandits, their mutual destruction their final legacy. In the game, Rhode would've embarked on a quest from the Mercenary Guild, followed a trail of clues to their last contract, and discovered this grave site before returning with their insignia and treasures to claim his reward. But this was no longer a game, and rigid adherence to such procedures was no longer required. Many seasoned players would circumvent the formalities, simply taking the insignia and reporting directly back to the guild. It was a shortcut that saved time and avoided unnecessary steps. Why not adopt the same approach when the opportunity arose? Yet Rhode's presence here was not driven by a desire to skip a few steps. He moved to stand before the captain's skeletal remains, garbed in tattered steel, lying beside a blackened, rust-streaked sword. That was Rhode's objective—the fallen leader of Tiger Fang. Bending down before the skeleton, Rhode cast a glance at it, then reached out, retrieving a mercenary badge from the bones—a token of "Tiger Fang," and a crucial item for completing their mission. He carefully secured the badge in his pocket, then his eyes narrowed, focusing on his true target. A ring, tarnished and unremarkable, clung to a skeletal finger. Rhode removed the ring with care, which to any casual observer would appear as nothing more than a trinket amidst refuse. The system prompt that emerged, however, revealed a different tale. [Black Iron Ring, Unidentified, Magical Fluctuations Detected] "Resonance." Rhode closed his eyes, gripping the ring in his right hand, and softly commanded. He infused the ring with his soul power, and it began to tremble, awakening its once-dormant magic. As he reopened his eyes, the object in his grasp had undergone a transformation. A black ring, its surface inscribed with archaic patterns, rested quietly in his palm. [Ring of Will, Identified, Activates Mental Barrier, Five Minutes of Immunity to Mental Attacks, Recharge Time—Three Days] The deed was done. Rhode placed the ring upon his finger and released a breath of relief, his eyes scanning the surroundings to ensure nothing of value was overlooked. He then returned to the mountainside. There, he could see Lijie and Meis toiling toward the white stone. The merchant, entirely unversed in the art of climbing, followed Lijie with evident discomfort. His behavior suggested that if not for societal norms, he might have already pleaded for Lijie to bear his weight up the incline. An utter waste. With a dismissive shake of his head, Rhode steeled himself to descend and regroup with them. Yet at that moment, an urgent warning from the Soul Bird echoed within him. "———!" Rhode's pulse quickened as he gazed toward the forest. It wasn't long before he spotted three figures darting out from between the trees. Imminent danger was upon them! Chapter Thirteen: Mist Ruins Three silhouettes ceased their search as two figures perched conspicuously halfway up the mountainside. With unspoken consensus, they charged toward the oblivious duo. Rhode reacted with equal haste. He descended the slope in a swift glide, his sharp whistle summoning the circling Summoned Spirit in the sky. The Spirit Bird plummeted toward the veiled assailants with the ferocity of a released arrow. “—!” The shrouded figures, unshaken by the Spirit Bird’s sudden onslaught, quickly arranged themselves into a defensive formation. One brandished twin swords and surged forward, while the remaining two, undeterred, continued their pursuit of Lijie and Meis. Their precision and clarity of purpose were unmistakable; mere distractions, even those as extraordinary as a Spirit Bird, would not divert them from their target. As the swords clashed with the ethereal bird, a fleeting gleam of triumph illuminated their eyes, only to be replaced by sheer terror—the bird phased right through the blades, its relentless attack unabated! An elemental creature! Caught off guard, one of the figures in black contorted his body in a desperate attempt to evade, narrowly missing the bird’s chilling caress. It grazed his shoulder, sending a numbing cold coursing through him. Balance forsaken, he plummeted to the rocky terrain below, his sword cast aside. The other two fared no better. Their neglect to acknowledge the Spirit Bird’s passage sealed their fate. An icy gale trailed in its wake, rendering their limbs numb and rigid, compelling them to a standstill. Although the numbing chill swiftly faded, the momentary delay was sufficient. Lijie and Meis had reached the sanctuary of the white stone. The lead figure’s frown deepened, and with a strategic hand gesture, he retrieved a crossbow from his belt. “What calamity befalls us?!” The breathless merchant, having labored to reach the midpoint of the ascent, clambered to the white stone at Lijie's behest. Panting heavily, he barely caught his breath before shadows flitted by, crossbow bolts embedding into the stone wall beside him. “Ah!” Meis instinctively ducked, clutching his head, while Lijie, quick to act, reeled the merchant into the shadows, narrowly evading further assault. “We must hasten.” Rhode, who had closely followed, spared a glance at the shadows down below, his tone urgent and commanding. “Who are they, and what has transpired? Why do they assail us?” The merchant's mix of bewilderment and dread filled the air. “Likely spies.” Rhode’s gaze sharpened, recognizing the attire characteristic of spies under the mandate of the Guardian of the Light Dragon Soul's Bearer. Their national allegiance would be unveiled only upon their defeat. Yet, at this moment, Rhode was at a disadvantage. The Spirit Bird’s ephemeral stalling of the foes was testament to his own constraints. Their resistance to elemental strikes was not the issue; rather, it was his insufficient level that muted his offensive efficacy. Delay would serve them no benefit. “As for why they attack us, perhaps you might inquire directly—should they be inclined to enlighten a man in his final moments.” Rhode’s attempt at levity did little to allay the merchant's burgeoning panic, well aware of the spies’ infamous brutality. The mere thought of their merciless reputation spurred him onward, fatigue ignored, as he rose and followed Rhode toward the obscured path behind the white stone. Zenar Mountain Path, once a glorious trade route wide enough for two carriages to proceed side by side, now lay forsaken. Rockfall from the surrounding cliffs littered the path, transforming its once grand expanse into a treacherous maze. The trio navigated forward, stumbling yet undeterred. Rhode glanced back intermittently, their situation growing more dire by the moment—the echo of their pursuers’ footsteps growing ever more distinct. If not for the natural defenses of the terrain, they would have been surrounded long ago. “Mr. Rhode, there is no path ahead!” Lijie’s alarmed shout drew Rhode’s attention to a daunting blockade—a landslide had made the path ahead impassable. Predictable, indeed. Rhode shook his head, his earlier belief that such obstacles in the game were meant to funnel players along a pre-set path now challenged by the harsh reality before him— But such thoughts would have to wait. “Take the path to the right.” “Right?” Both Lijie and Meis cast doubtful glances toward the direction Rhode indicated, their steps momentarily hesitant. Though the main route was blocked, a narrow path shrouded in dense mist beckoned them. Despite the clarity of the skies above, this path was enshrouded in an otherworldly fog, creating an atmosphere of eerie foreboding. The sight alone was enough to suggest hidden dangers, and yet, it was into this unknown that Rhode now directed them. “Quickly, time is short.” His tone, brooking no opposition, spurred them into the mist, their figures soon swallowed by its opaque embrace. Once the two were veiled within, Rhode breathed a sigh of relief before confronting the imminent threat. Extending his hand, he summoned his arcane power. “Cage!” From his palm emerged the card, transitioning from green to white, and with it, the Stardust Sword materialized. Firmly grasping the weapon, he flung it towards the cliff face. The Blade of Radiance, unleashed from the sword, collided with a precarious boulder above. A thunderous rumble followed as fractured stones cascaded downwards in a tumultuous avalanche. By the time the black-clad figures caught up, Rhode had already disappeared into the fog’s enigmatic depths. “Cursed be the Dragon Soul!” One spat out, eyeing the devastated path ahead. Their route was thoroughly obstructed, utterly impassable. Rhode’s strike had triggered a chain reaction; the cliffs quivered ominously on either side—pressing forward now bordered on recklessness. “What is our next course?” “There is none to take.” Another figure in black fixated on the sealed path with a grim acceptance. “We must report back to the leader and keep watch over all nearby villages. They seek to slip away unnoticed, yet these cunning adversaries have outwitted us.” “An elemental creature? Could there be a mage in their midst?” “Should there be a mage, it would be less baffling, yet our observations suggest none such.” As the two exchanged conjectures, a third, until now silent, gazed intently upon the cliffside markings and declared, “Among them is a swordsman of considerable prowess.” With determination, he turned to leave. “Let us hasten. Our quarry is formidable, and the hunt is far from concluded. Send the orders to monitor the adjacent villages—they cannot remain concealed within these mountains indefinitely.” For Rhode and his companions, the perils had not subsided. “What place is this?” The merchant's voice, laden with awe and bewilderment, underscored the breadth of his ignorance. His travels had shown him much, but nothing had prepared him for the vast unknown now revealed. Beyond the mist lay a deserted town, its desolation enshrouded by a dense fog that blurred all lines of sight. The gray veil aloft had erased the clarity of the sky, as if they had stepped into a wholly different plane. “This is the Mist Ruins.” Rhode's explanation was succinct. “By traversing this place, we will reach the Alagak Mountain Pass, and thereafter, we can depart from this forlorn land.” “Is there peril here?” The merchant's inquiry, tinged with trepidation, was inevitable. “Danger is ever-present.” Rhode acknowledged bluntly. Within the game, the Mist Ruins were the inaugural ten-level instance for parties of five—an initial challenge for many. Not insurmountable, yet by no means trivial. For their group of three, the challenge was formidable. With Rhode at level eight, Lijie at merely level six, and the merchant's negligible combat prowess, they were effectively a level eight Summoner Swordsman and a support character embarking on a solo venture through a ten-level instance—an endeavor that, in the confines of the game, would be regarded as folly. Rhode was no simpleton; this strategy was spawned from necessity. Without Lijie's capabilities, he would not have chosen this route—now, it represented their safest avenue amidst the looming threats. “Nevertheless, if you comply with my directives, we can mitigate the risks. Therefore...” He paused, his gaze shifting to the golden-haired girl at his side. “Lijie, the onus falls upon you now.” Chapter Fourteen: Strategy for Two 'Me?' Lijie's eyes widened in surprise at Rhode's words, and even Mr. Meis gaped in astonishment beside her. It was common knowledge that on the Dragon Soul Continent, Spirit Masters were akin to pharmacists, doctors, and nurses, primarily serving in supportive roles within a team—healing wounds, casting protective spells, and dispelling toxins were their usual tasks. Taking to the front lines for combat? Such a notion was practically unheard of. 'Exactly,' Rhode nodded with affirmation, feeling once again like the seasoned commander who had led teams through dungeon raids. 'You will follow my commands shortly. It doesn't require complex techniques, but it does demand quick reflexes and awareness. It might take some getting used to, but I believe you'll manage... How well can you control energy? And how often are you able to use Sacred Radiance?' Rhode had a rough estimate of Lijie's level based on her previous healing spells but wanted to be certain. 'I am a qualified Spirit Master of the Seventh Outer Ring. As for Sacred Radiance... It can be cast once per day, and its effect lasts for a full day, provided my soul power isn't overly drained.' Unlike combat professionals, casters were classified by their mastery over soul power, segmented into the Outer, Middle, and Inner Rings, each with ten, seven, and three levels, respectively. Casters believed their strength stemmed from deep within their souls, imagined as three interlocking rings. The deeper a caster probed into their soul, the more potent their power became. Lijie's current level at the Seventh Outer Ring suggested she might soon break through the upper limit of Outer Ring casters and ascend to the Middle Rings—an impressive prospect for a sixth-tier Spirit Master. This insight gave Rhode further confidence. 'Good. Remember, don't cast Healing Light on me from now on, even if I get injured. Pay more attention to Mr. Meis and shield him if he's in danger... Understood?' 'That... Yes, Mr. Rhode.' Despite some of Rhode's phrases puzzling Lijie, she grasped his intent, nodding subtly to indicate her understanding. 'Mr. Meis, how long will our supplies last?' 'Three to four days at most,' Mr. Meis pondered, clutching his travel bag, then answered with a touch of stoicism. 'If we ration our food...' 'This could be a good opportunity to diet.' If Rhode had spoken with a trace of humor, Mr. Meis might have taken it as a joke. However, Rhode's expression was solemn, stirring further concern in Mr. Meis. As he held onto his bag, about to raise more issues, Rhode had already turned to issue Lijie her command. 'Cast Sacred Radiance.' 'Understood.' Following Mr. Rhode's order, Lijie nodded slightly, extended her hands, and closed her eyes. A gentle light began to emanate from the center of her palms, spreading a warm, white glow all around. Mr. Meis noticed the encroaching fog retreating before the light. After a double-take, the previously obscured surroundings had become much clearer. Ruins that were once shadowy outlines now revealed their fractured walls and structures. The newfound visibility was a welcome relief; visibility was, after all, a potential lifesaver. 'I'll take the lead, Lijie, follow me. Mr. Meis, stay in the rear but keep close. No matter what happens, don't act alone.' Silence enveloped the ruins as they progressed under Rhode's lead, pausing regularly to survey their surroundings before proceeding. It wasn't long before Rhode gestured for a halt. If his memory was correct, they were nearing the first wave of lesser creature spawns. As expected, a cluster of dim lights began to twinkle through the fog ahead, resembling eyes in the darkness. 'What are those?' Mr. Meis grew tense at the sight. 'Wraiths,' Rhode stated calmly as Star Scar materialized in his hand. 'Be vigilant—they tend to maintain their distance.' No sooner had he spoken than the fog surged, revealing three ethereal forms. They had human-like shapes but were entirely shrouded in a dense mist. Clustered together, their boundaries were indistinct; only their glowing eyes made it clear that these were more than mere mists—perhaps even more ominous. 'Lijie, cast Healing Light on the first one.' Healing Light? The command left Lijie briefly perplexed; it was a restorative spell, so why use it against such beings? However, her confusion was fleeting, and she raised her hand, casting the spell on the creature before her. As a Spirit Master, her skill was unquestionable. Healing Light was a mid-range healing spell, simple to cast with a clear target. For Lijie, it was particularly effortless, despite hesitating because her target was not an ally but a creature. Yet, she completed the spell swiftly. A stream of pure white light cascaded from above, enveloping the wraith. Normally, this light would heal wounds and revive spirits—a fundamental ability in a Spirit Master's skill set. But the wraith's reaction was entirely unexpected. As the white light shrouded it, the wraith let out a piercing cry that even Lijie could clearly hear. Its previously erect form bent over, wracked with convulsions. The mist that had cloaked its body began to disintegrate instantly, dissipating as ice does under the sun's rays. Lijie was taken aback, glancing at her hands in disbelief, unable to fathom how she had released such a destructive force. However, Rhode was unperturbed. Healing Light's inherent positive energy was the bane of negative energy entities like wraiths. Moreover, Lijie's angelic heritage amplified this effect—the positive energy she produced was naturally of a higher caliber than that of an average human. To a wraith, an ordinary person's positive energy was like boiling water, whereas Lijie's was akin to concentrated sulfuric acid. Fortunately for the wraiths, Lijie was only a half-angel. If she had been a pure angel, the wraith would have been extinguished instantly. Lijie didn't understand why a healing spell could have such an effect, but the players of the Dragon Soul Continent knew all too well. Healing Light, in essence, was a conduit of positive energy, thus named because it healed the living. But this did not mean it was restricted to mending wounds. In the game's early days, a Necromancer's tragic fate became a running joke among players: the misfortune of encountering an undead horde—since their spells of negative energy, when cast upon undead of similar composition, would heal rather than harm. This led many a Necromancer, who had once dreamt of dominating with an army of the dead, to begrudgingly learn elemental spells to maintain their advantage against undead foes. Sometimes, they even had to take on the role of healers. In truth, Necromancers and Spirit Masters weren't so different. They each thrived in environments where their powers were ineffective against their own kind, only coming into their element against opposing attributes. For Necromancers, encounters with the living were more common, while for Spirit Masters, such interactions were rare until the midpoint of the Dark Descent War when the undead became rampant, propelling them to the forefront as valiant fighters. Before then, the likelihood of a Spirit Master encountering an undead was minimal, and it was unsurprising that NPCs, unlike players, lacked such extensive knowledge and adhered to tradition. But now was not the time for tradition. 'Attack the remaining two!' Rhode, empowered by Shadow Flash, charged towards the nearest wraith while directing Lijie. 'Yes!' Perhaps inspired by the unfolding scene, Lijie's response was filled with newfound determination. Two more surges of abundant positive energy descended, each striking a different wraith. The gentle light halted their advance, and seizing the moment, Rhode—enhanced by Shadow Flash—faced the lead wraith. '———!' In torment from the radiant energy, the wraith shrieked in fury, marking Rhode as its foe. It lunged, ghostly claws swiping swiftly at him. Lijie's spell had weakened their defenses, yet their offensive capabilities had correspondingly increased. Any lapse in judgment could lead to a dire outcome. But Rhode would not allow such a misfortune to occur. He gracefully dodged the spectral claws, missing by mere inches, and his sword, aglow with purity, pivoted and thrust forward, landing a precise blow. Vital Strike! Star Scar accurately impaled the wraith's core, its semi-tangible Soul Condensate. Suffering under the celestial energy's assault, the wraith lifted its claws in one final act of defiance before its form, already on the edge of disintegration, collapsed entirely into a cloud of dissipating dust. At that moment, the other two wraiths launched their attack. Chapter Fififteen: Deep into the Ruins *Sigh...* Rhode surveyed the expanse of Ling Chen (spirit dust) at his feet and wiped the sweat from his brow, feeling the onset of fatigue. Their journey had been fraught with spectral confrontations—no fewer than fifteen wraiths had accosted them. Such numbers would be a trifle for a well-rounded party of five, but Rhode’s forces were scant, devoid of a tank to draw fire, leaving the tactic of a full-frontal assault, typical in dungeon crawls, out of the question. Instead, Rhode had to carefully lure each adversary, allowing Lijie Noelle to weaken the undead with her Healing Light so he could dispatch them with swift, precise strikes. Since wraiths were at the very least level ten elites, even those with reduced defenses posed a significant challenge. To maximize his damage output, Rhode not only took advantage of his Star Scar sword's attribute bonuses but also endeavored to target each enemy's vulnerabilities with every thrust and slash. Humans are not machines, immune to fatigue. Even in the realm of a game, such demanding combat could drain one's energy, and now Rhode was exerting his very flesh and blood. In the virtual world, one could simply respawn and retry, but here, failure could mean an inexorable fall into the maw of death. The gravity of his situation was nearly too much for Rhode to shoulder. He lifted his eyes to the mist-enshrouded ruins around him and, only after ensuring no further threats lingered, allowed himself a brief respite. "Mr. Rhode, should we rest for a moment?" The girl following him looked on with concern. As a Spirit Master, she might not understand the significance behind each of Rhode's actions, but she could sense the pressure mounting on him. "No... Not yet..." Rhode shook his head, dismissing the thought. They had cleared the area of lesser foes, yet a subtle sense of danger persisted. He scanned the ruins, shrouded in fog, but the source of this faint dread eluded him. By their current location, they should not have been near the boss's domain and thus not at immediate risk. Furthermore, Rhode was well-versed in the undead distribution of this area, which should have been cleared already. Whence, then, did this ominous feeling stem? Once more, Rhode's gaze swept the surroundings, finding nothing. It was then that the corpulent merchant beside them suddenly cried out. "Ah!" "What's wrong?" Rhode and Lijie Noelle turned swiftly, only to see Meis, ashen-faced, clutching his travel bag and pointing a trembling hand into the fog behind them. "There, a shadow... just now..." "A shadow?" Lijie Noelle's gaze followed Meis's direction, but within the mist, she could discern nothing beyond the dim sunlight. "I see nothing..." "Get down!" In that moment, Rhode's mind lit up with realization, and he finally understood the nature of the lurking danger. He shouted a warning while forcing Lijie Noelle's head down in one swift motion. *Whoosh!* Almost instantly, a dark silhouette streaked overhead. Rhode could feel the icy brush of the gargoyle's talons grazing his scalp, even causing a sharp sting. Cursed be the fates! In that moment, Rhode's heart sank; he recognized the harbinger of danger—a gargoyle! According to local lore, the Mist Ruins had once been a bustling settlement that fell into desolation with the decline of its trade routes. Later, a mage seeking to revive his beloved ventured into the forbidden necromantic arts within the now-abandoned town. The mage's experiments ended in tragedy, and with his death, the town succumbed to a miasma of death magic that spawned the thick mists and the legion of undead. Of all the creatures in the dungeon, the most perilous were the gargoyles left behind as guardians of the mage's relics—a rare elite of level fifteen! In the game world, Rhode would have welcomed such a rare encounter—a coveted prize often eluding even the most persistent parties through numerous dungeon attempts. But in this harsh reality, a chill clutched at Rhode's heart. Here was a level fifteen rare elite, and worse, a creature of flight. Its agility was daunting enough, but the gargoyle bore little resemblance to the intangible wraiths formed from negative energy. Lijie Noelle's holy magics would find no purchase against it. And with an obsidian shell nearly impenetrable, most physical attacks would barely scratch it. They were headed for a grueling battle! Rhode had navigated the Mist Ruins over thirty times in-game without ever crossing paths with a gargoyle. The possibility had slipped from his mind, but now, on his first venture into this world, fate had cruelly thrown such an adversary in his path—was this a stroke of luck or a twisted jest? The matter was of little consequence now. The shadow of death was upon them. A direct confrontation was out of the question. Not yet at level ten, Rhode was ill-prepared to face a level fifteen colossus. Even with Star Scar's enhancements, his attack power was limited. "Make haste!" Without a moment's hesitation, Rhode issued the command. Seizing Lijie Noelle's hand, he instructed, "Follow my lead, keep low, and do not look up!" Retreat was no longer an option. Their sole recourse was to locate the gargoyle's control core and destroy it. Though fleeing its attack radius was an alternative, a quick assessment of his current allies afforded little confidence in their ability to distract the fiend—a ranger or rogue would have been invaluable now. But there was no time for regrets. Under Rhode's guidance, Lijie Noelle and Meis pressed on, heads down, as the surrounding fog churned anew. Their movements had attracted notice; four or five wraiths emerged from the mist, converging on their position. "Lijie Noelle, cast your spells! Don't relent!" "Yes, sir!" Despite the challenge of spellcasting while in motion, Lijie Noelle persevered, extending her hand as successive bursts of purifying light descended upon the wraiths. Rhode then unsheathed his blade, its dance through the air silencing the advancing wraiths, reducing the obstructing specters to ash. Amid the tumult, a system alert flickered before Rhode's eyes. [Experience Points 1900/1800, Level Up Available, Level 8] Yet such trivialities were of no concern to Rhode now. The number of wraiths was multiplying, and though the sacred radiance slowed their advance, their sheer volume was overwhelming. In stark contrast to these sluggish phantoms, the gargoyle was utterly impervious to the divine light. A manifestation of negative energy it may be, but as the mage's sentinel, the gargoyle's obsidian shell was a bastion against the holy. Having missed its initial strike, the gargoyle marked the party as its quarry, shadowing their every move, biding its time to strike—a testament to the peril of foes endowed with a semblance of battle acumen. "Agh!" Amidst the chaos, Meis faltered, tumbling to the ground. The ever-vigilant gargoyle seized the moment, its talons descending like a bolt from the blue upon the prone merchant. As Meis turned, facing his end, all he saw was the looming shadow about to engulf him. "My God..." Swift though the gargoyle's assault was, and though Meis had resignedly shut his eyes to embrace the end, its attack was thwarted—a diaphanous shield aglow with golden light materialized, thwarting the gargoyle's talons. Then, a volley of luminous blades rained from the heavens, striking the gargoyle with force. Resounding 'smack' sounds echoed as the creature, caught off-guard, was flung backward into the throng of wraiths. In that moment, Lijie Noelle, with a blend of support and urgency, hoisted the merchant—who had nearly resigned to meet his kin in the afterlife—back to his feet, and together, they hastened onward. "This way!" Amid the wraiths' encirclement, Rhode at length outmaneuvered the majority of the undead. Raising his gaze, he quickly identified his target—a forsaken chapel, the mage's former sanctum, and, as Rhode recalled, the locus of the gargoyle's control core. But such a sanctum was not to be breached lightly. As Rhode neared the chapel's threshold, a shadow fell across his vision. On reflex, he invoked Shadow Flash, recoiling just as a gargoyle landed where he had stood mere moments prior, its talon smashing the flagstones to rubble. "To think it's come to this..." An inward curse escaped Rhode as he swiftly surveyed the scene only to confirm his suspicion: the statues that once graced the chapel's facade were now conspicuously absent. Their current whereabouts? Quite apparent. To have encountered not one, but two such guardians—fortune indeed had a twisted sense of humor. Perhaps he would find luck in the lottery, should he live to see another day. "Inside, find the control device!" Rhode's voice rang with command as he held the gargoyle's gaze. "The wraiths likely won't pursue you within. I'll handle these two; seize the chance to infiltrate and locate the control core. Destroy it, and be wary of traps." "But... Mr. Rhode..." "That's an order." Rhode's tone brooked no argument. Clutching Star Scar, he thrust forward, unleashing a blinding arc of light. The gargoyle screeched, taking to the air to evade his strike, inadvertently clearing the path to the chapel. "Now, go!" Chapter 16: Awakening the Talent Tree Shadows danced in the air, black and white intertwining, igniting brilliant sparks. "Whoa!" Rhode hastily retreated, his blade a quivering streak of white, as the force of the blow reverberated through it, leaving his upper body tingling with pain. True to Rhode's recollection, the level fifteen Gargoyles were formidable adversaries, more so when there were two. Their semblance of battle wisdom was a double-edged sword; it made them cautious but less of a threat, especially since the one that had tasted the sting of the Shattered Blade recoiled at the mere sight of the white glow on Rhode's sword. Its companion, unscathed but wary, mirrored the retreat, granting Rhode a precious moment to breathe. But this reprieve was fleeting. Gripping the Star Scar, Rhode braced himself, his gaze fixed on the Gargoyles circling above. They hesitated to engage directly, wary of his Shattered Blade, but Rhode knew they wouldn't relent easily. This standoff wouldn't last; it was a matter of when, not if, their assaults would resume. At level eight, Rhode had maxed out his Moonshadow Swordsmanship proficiency, and while the Shattered Blade now consumed less soul power, frequent use still risked depletion. He had to conserve energy, anticipating further unexpected trials ahead. He was the trio's sole combatant—if his strength waned here, dire straits would follow. The Gargoyles didn't just loom ominously; they dove and clawed, swiftly retreating before Rhode could counter. This relentless hit-and-run was a true test of endurance, trivial for magic-driven constructs but grueling for Rhode. Sweat trickled down his brow; fatigue crept in with each parry and dodge. Rhode couldn't afford to fall back. Tackling two Gargoyles alone was a fool's errand; his hopes lay with Lijie. After all, the church held no significant peril—or so he had assumed. Had he neglected to warn them about the protective magic circles? Shrugging off the thought, Rhode refocused on the imminent threat of the Gargoyles. Nobody would die, after all. "Aaargh!" Meis's 'agonizing' scream echoed as he collapsed, convulsing on the ground. "I'm dying! Save me! Save me!" "It's merely a shock! You haven't perished, Mr. Meis." Lijie, unfazed amidst the dust and cobwebs, cast a Healing Light over her shoulder without a glance, soothing Meis's pain. She then resumed her diligent search. Protective spells were common in a mage's sanctum, but with the church's long neglect and the passage of time, their potency had waned. Lijie's half-angelic nature lent her significant magic resistance; the once-lethal traps now fizzled out harmlessly under her touch. Poor Mr. Meis, lacking her resilience, restored some dignity to the traps with his reactions. "This accursed place..." Meis grumbled, dusting himself off and rising to his feet. The dim church was lit only by Lijie's Sacred Radiance, casting light on a world shrouded in darkness. Meis, heart racing, could see the eerie magic circles and bones strewn across the floor, while the bloodstains on the walls nearly sent him fleeing at their entrance. If not for Lijie's calm and his own fear of the dangers outside, he would have fled. Now, he reluctantly joined her in scouring the mess for the elusive 'Control Core.' How could they find anything in this chaos? Wiping off dust, Meis continued his hushed search alongside Lijie, who remained fixated on her task. Back with Rhode, the battle intensified. "———!" The Gargoyle's screech heralded its dive. Rhode pivoted, narrowly evading its talons, but this time, the Gargoyle didn't retreat. Instead, it spun, its muscular tail lashing out! Rhode's heart sank at the sound of the approaching strike. He spun, sword raised in defense. The impact was immediate and massive, bending the blade and hurtling him across the ground, his body tumbling before coming to a stop. "Whoa!" Rhode rose, his head spinning, his limbs numb. He nearly dropped his sword, fighting to steady his reeling senses. But the soft hiss from behind sent a surge of adrenaline through him. "Sss..." A cold breath touched his neck, and instinctively, he rolled away, narrowly avoiding the strike. When he looked up, three Wraiths loomed, creeping closer. The Gargoyle's strike had not harmed him, but it had cast him to the barrier's edge, where the Wraiths, hindered by the enchantment, couldn't approach the church. Yet, they hadn't dispersed, lurking near the invisible barrier, waiting. Now, they saw their chance. Rhode wouldn't oblige them. Gritting his teeth, he released his hold on conserving power. A brilliant white light erupted from his sword, streaking forward. The Blade of Light cut through the air, dispersing and striking a Wraith, shattering its defenses. Without hesitation, Rhode lunged forward, his sword tracing a perfect arc through the air, piercing the Wraith's core. As the doomed Wraith screamed and disintegrated, Rhode had already crossed through it, back within the safety of the barrier. What next? A system prompt before Rhode brought a moment of clarity. [Experience Points 4000/1800, level up available, Talent Tree unlocked, Level 8] I've attained level ten? But before entering the Mist Ruins, wasn't I only level eight? Rhode was momentarily stunned, then recalled the system prompt indicating enough experience to level up during the Gargoyle ambush, which he had disregarded in the heat of battle. It seems the Wraiths he had slain en route provided ample experience for another level. It was no surprise—this was a five-person instance, with Rhode reaping all the experience. His low level and the bonus for defeating higher-level monsters made reaching level ten plausible. The existence of experience points in this world was the real curiosity. But this was not the time for such musings. Rhode swiftly accessed his attributes and made his choice. It was his chance to gain an upper hand. [Experience Points 4000/1800, level up available, Talent Tree unlocked, Level 8] [Experience Points 2200/2000, level up available, Talent Tree unlocked, Skill Points gained: 1, Level 9] [Experience Points 200/2500, Talent Tree unlocked, Skill Points gained: 2, Level 10] [Activate Talent System?] "Activate!" With no hesitation, Rhode made his choice. In an instant, three distinct Talent Trees unfolded before him. In Dragon Soul Continent, each class is granted three talent paths upon reaching level ten. Players can specialize or mix and match talents for optimal synergy. Skill Points, scarce and valuable, dictate these choices. Players often struggle with this decision. Each level awards a single Skill Point, and even beyond Talent Trees, mastering swordplay or spellcraft demands a bounty of these points. But players in the mid-tier realm can supplement their Skill Points with 'Awakening Scrolls' and high-difficulty tasks. Rhode's Summoner Swordsman class offered three paths: 'Summoning Master,' 'Soul Messenger,' and 'Hell Lord.' 'Summoning Master' augments the number of spirits summoned. 'Soul Messenger' bolsters their power. 'Hell Lord' turns non-human foes into undead summoned spirits—a macabre but potent choice. To some, the decision was daunting, but Rhode had spent seven years mastering his class. His strategies were the gold standard, textbooks for his fellow Summoner Swordsmen. For many, the Talent Tree was a crossroads of possibilities. For Rhode, the path was clear the moment the tree appeared. Chapter Seventeen: Summoning Master Summoner Swordsman's First Principle—Never face the enemy alone at any time. [Expends 1 Skill Point to enhance Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 1/5, Proficiency C—Moon Splendor Unlocked] [Expends 1 Skill Point to select Talent—Summoning Master Awakening] [Summoning Master's First-Tier Talent Unlocked: Soul Resonance (character can summon additional spirits for every ten levels), Mind's Call (shares senses with summons, extending the duration of mental link), Structural Harmony (enables fusion of two spirits)] [Acquires permanent skill: Soul Resonance LV1 (character can summon +1 Spirit for every ten levels)] [Summoned Spirits +1] As the last system message faded, a massive shadow darted across Rhode's peripheral vision. Yet he did not retreat or show any fear. On the contrary, Rhode lifted his longsword and swung it mightily forward. 'Swish!' A verdant silhouette shot out rapidly from the blade, pouncing towards the swooping gargoyle. The Spirit Bird. [Note: 'Spirit Bird' refers to '灵魂之鸟' from the glossary] Rhode's predicament lay in his inability to summon more than one entity at a time, and the Star Scar, serving as his weapon, was one of the summons. Most Summoner Swordsmen, like their conventional counterparts, wield a 'standard' weapon. Rhode was an outlier, having pondered over using a more typical weapon, yet the allure of the Star Scar's attribute enhancements was too compelling to relinquish. Its unique properties allowed him to vanquish adversaries of comparable and even superior levels with ease, amassing an abundance of experience in the early stages. However, this also meant Rhode could not employ the characteristic combat style of Summoner Swordsmen, which involved simultaneous attacks with their summons. To an observer, he resembled more a classic swordsman than a summoner. This unfamiliarity was uncomfortable for Rhode, yet unavoidable. If he were to summon the Spirit Bird, he would have to forego the Star Scar, rendering him defenseless. As a swordsman and not a mage, Rhode couldn't simply stand back and do nothing. To wield the Star Scar meant to seal the Spirit Bird, which didn't bode well for him as engaging in combat like a regular swordsman wasn't ideal. Summoner Swordsmen faced a major disadvantage compared to traditional swordsmen—their occupational penalty: all sword techniques proficiency -1. This meant that while a traditional swordsman could reach SSS proficiency, the Summoner Swordsman, despite their diligence, could only reach SS. The starting point was also different for both. A traditional swordsman's initial proficiency levels were all D. In contrast, Rhode's proficiency as a Summoner Swordsman started at E. This was the disparity that had made his battles in this world toilsome. Without the Star Scar and his knowledge of the Dragon Soul Continent, he would have likely been in dire straits. His comfort in having a summon always at his side in battle was missing, and this new state brought considerable pressure. Now, having unlocked the 'Summoning Master' talent, Rhode felt the burden lift. It's true that Summoner Swordsmen lacked the solo offensive power of their traditional counterparts, but they never fought alone. When the Spirit Bird charged, the gargoyle hesitated, sensing the magic within but its rudimentary AI failed to identify the threat. It saw the Spirit Bird as a foe and lashed out. But this time, the gargoyle found nothing but air. As it thought it made contact, the once solid form dispersed like a snowball hit by a gust of wind, leaving only a trail of air slipping through its claws. Rhode, however, was quick to follow. With his sword, he unleashed a burst of silvery light. A crescent of moonlight, the third skill of Moonshadow Swordsmanship—Moon Splendor. Similar to the Shattered Blade in condensing sword energy, its effects differed—the Shattered Blade projected a Blade of Light forward, powerful and penetrating, yet its narrow scope made evasion simple. Moon Splendor's crescent sweep threatened a vast area, making it challenging to dodge. As expected, the gargoyle tried to dodge the incoming blade light by flapping its wings, but it was too slow. The silver arc struck its right wing, scattering pieces of stone as the gargoyle lost balance. But the fight wasn't over. As it tried to stabilize, Rhode advanced, gesturing with his left hand. The Spirit Bird, which had evaded the gargoyle by turning into a breeze, reappeared behind it. With a piercing cry, it slammed into the gargoyle's back, the wind's momentum sending the creature flying. Enraged yet unable to express its fury, the gargoyle was bombarded by a succession of gleaming blades. One, two, three. The spinning Shattered Blades precisely hit the gargoyle's wounded wing. Even obsidian couldn't endure the successive strikes, and as the gargoyle withstood the barrage, its wing cracked and shattered. With its wing destroyed, the gargoyle crashed, creating a crater in the stone floor. Outnumbering and overpowering, the merger of quantity and quality—such was a Summoner Swordsman's approach. Rhode had rediscovered his natural combat rhythm. If he held a standard weapon now, with 'Summoning Master' activated, controlling two summons at once would be possible, and not even Bosses would be safe from his relentless assault. Alas, the world offered no 'ifs', and Rhode lacked a second Soul Core to awaken another spirit. He reluctantly ceased his pursuit, retreating as another gargoyle dived at him. Angered by its ally's injury, this gargoyle attacked with vengeance. But Rhode, now able to summon the Spirit Bird, had no intention of a direct confrontation. Facing the shadow that once troubled him, he simply whistled. A gust of wind erupted, diverting the shadow's attack and leaving it to crash into the church wall in confusion. Rhode wouldn't waste such an advantageous moment. Under his command, an azure cyclone rose, and the bird took flight once more towards its foe. Roles reversed—those who lorded above were now like beaten hounds, and Rhode, once under duress, now sang victoriously, gaining the upper hand. He strategically coordinated with the Spirit Bird, keeping the gargoyles apart, ensuring a 'two-on-one' advantage at all times, preventing the other from aiding its companion. Though the tide had turned momentarily, Rhode couldn't press for a decisive victory. His energy was already spent, and unlike in the game where leveling up meant an instant revival, reality offered no such luxury. Leveling up to ten and unlocking talents only added to his existing soul power. With just this, defeating the gargoyles was out of reach. Controlling two summons further drained his soul power, and Rhode had to conserve energy or risk complete exhaustion. Given the level discrepancy and the gargoyles' formidable defenses, Rhode's attacks had only managed to shatter a wing, inflicting no severe damage. Going all out could eliminate one gargoyle, but then he'd face the other unarmed—a predictable outcome. Rhode's only option was to suppress the nuisances and await Lijie and Meis to locate the 'Control Core'. Otherwise, he'd revert to his prior predicament. '——!' Despite one wing down, the gargoyle remained a threat. On the ground, it was like a dark stone hound, its limbs propelling it forward like a spectral runner. This was the horror of alchemical creatures; mistaking them as mere aerial show-offs would prove costly. Fortunately, Rhode's knowledge ran deep. He wasn't naive to think that grounding them was enough to control them, but it eased his burden, no longer concerning himself with overhead threats. The dark figure lunged at Rhode from behind, its right claw aiming for his back. But Rhode sidestepped, his sword turning into a bolt of lightning, just deflecting the strike. Simultaneously, Rhode signaled with his left hand, and the circling Spirit Bird, heeding the gesture, blocked the other gargoyle's aerial attack. While the Spirit Bird couldn't harm the Rare Elite gargoyle significantly, as a pure elemental, it faced no great difficulty in obstructing. Time ticked on, and Rhode's anxiety mounted. He felt fatigue creeping in, a sign his soul power neared depletion. Inside the church, all was quiet—had they not found the Control Core? 'Whoo!' The piercing wind alarmed Rhode, who instinctively dodged, attempting to use Shadow Flash, but as he moved, he stumbled, and the skill failed to activate. His soul power was running dry! This realization sank Rhode's heart. Without time for further thought, he spun and thrust his sword. The stone claw clashed with the white blade, screeching on impact. The gargoyle, missing its mark, retreated, and Rhode couldn't give chase. Then, suddenly, a voice echoed from behind. 'Mr. Rhode! We've found it!!' Chapter Eighteen: Heart of the Gargoyle 'Mr. Rhode! We have found it!' Hearing this, Rhode turned around to see Meis standing at the church entrance, his face lit with excitement. He triumphantly held up a small statue, exquisitely carved to depict a gargoyle coiled in repose, its eyes—crafted from ruby fragments—emitting a faint dark red glow. That was the Gargoyle Control Core! Meis's shout caught the attention of the gargoyles. As alchemical creatures, they knew what he held, and two of them quickly changed direction, barreling toward Meis. 'Ah!' Seeing the monstrous creatures charge at him, Meis let out a frightened yelp. Instinctively, he was about to flee, but at that moment, Rhode's voice reached him. 'Throw it here!' Despite the terror wrought by the approaching gargoyles, Meis gathered his courage and tossed the ornate black statue. Regrettably, the merchant's aim was off. The object he hurled arced through the air, straying from its intended path and whizzing past the gargoyles. To an uninformed observer, it might seem as if the rotund merchant was in league with the stone beasts. The gargoyles, momentarily baffled by this unexpected delivery, nonetheless reached out reflexively to grasp the tiny statue. But just as one was about to seize it, a breeze whisked underneath it. The nearly insubstantial Soul Bird, leaving a series of half-transparent ripples in its wake, deftly intercepted the statue. This was Rhode's final reserve of strength. Completely drained, he had to sheathe his sword, and with his right hand, he snapped his fingers. Accompanying this gesture, the Soul Bird traced an elegant arc in the sky and then flew towards Rhode. Realizing their prize was escaping, the gargoyles abruptly ceased their chase and shifted their course. 'Swish!' The gargoyle skimming along the ground flipped over, its thick, muscular tail whipping out fiercely and striking the Soul Bird. Although the attack didn't inflict significant damage, the Wind Elemental Attribute enveloping the bird wavered slightly, causing the bird's trajectory to wobble. Unyielding, the Soul Bird continued to beat its wings, skimming rapidly over the ground, striving to reach its master. But its journey was cut short. A stony claw descended from on high, piercing through the Soul Bird's body. The Wind Elemental could no longer sustain the bird's form, and it immediately dissipated into its most primal state, vanishing into thin air. The black statue, which had been secured in the bird's beak, was now hurtling through the air. However, two dark figures swiftly gave chase, their claws outstretched and jaws agape, reaching for the statue—until it serenely and steadily settled into Rhode's awaiting hand. [Item Acquired: Gargoyle Control Core - Identification Complete] [Command——] 'Aig!' Though Rhode's voice was soft, almost a whisper, it carried a profound authority. The shadows that had been on the attack stopped instantly—their once glowing bodies dimming and becoming lifeless in the blink of an eye. Their outstretched limbs froze mid-air, and the ghoulish red glow that had once illuminated the gargoyle's faces flickered out. Then, the two shadows swept past Rhode, crashing heavily onto the ground behind him. 'Boom!!!' With the collision, the gargoyles, now devoid of momentum, reverted to their original statuesque forms. They lay in silence on the ground behind Rhode, still posed as if leaping forward. Without the support of magic, they were no longer as resilient as they had been. After the impact, the gargoyles crumbled, transforming from artistic sculptures into useless debris. 'Sigh...' Only then did Rhode allow himself a sigh of relief. He felt utterly drained, his legs weak, his fingers barely able to clench the statue. Despite his fatigue, Rhode maintained a calm exterior. He stood silently for a moment before stowing the statue away. 'Mr. Rhode!' At that moment, Lijie and Meis hastened to his side, their expressions filled with concern and anxiety. 'Are you alright?' 'I am fine.' Rhode took a deep breath, yearning for a moment of rest. The excessive use of soul power had left him feeling lightheaded, and even holding the statue was an effort. Fortunately, the thick fog that had enshrouded them seemed to have cleared, and the wraiths were nowhere to be seen. It appeared that after failing to draw close, they had decided to forsake this accursed place—at least for now. Rhode remained silent. His leadership had ingrained in him the importance of composure; a commander must not be shaken by adversity or become overly exuberant after a victory. This conduct would not foster a positive influence on his subordinates. Though no longer the guild leader of tens of thousands of players, the habits of leadership continued to shape him. Seeing his composed demeanor, Lijie and Meis felt a wave of relief wash over them. They had been anxious about the situation outside while searching for the statue. Lijie had been diligent, but it was Meis who had the fortune of discovering the statue tucked away in a corner. A bit more delay, and the outcome could have been entirely different. Rhode had initially intended to traverse the Mist Ruins swiftly, but the appearance of the gargoyles compelled him to alter his plan. The confrontation had nearly exhausted all his strength, and without adequate rest, future battles promised only increased danger. Thus, Rhode decided to rest in the church for the night and set out anew the next day. He harbored little concern for their safety in this place. In the game, this church had served as a haven for players to regroup and organize their spoils, so significant threats were unlikely. Although the dark, silent church with its eerie decorations made Meis's legs quake, as always... He had no voice in contesting Rhode's decision. As night deepened... The dense fog lingered outside the church, and through the windows, nothing could be seen but an expanse of white. The three sat at the center of the church. The decayed benches and tables, once used for worship, now served as kindling, offering their last bit of warmth in the burning fire. A chilly wind blew through the broken windows and crevices in the walls, carrying a slight chill. Cautiously, Lijie reached out and unwrapped the bandage from Rhode's left chest, her beautiful eyebrows furrowing slightly. 'It has opened up again, Mr. Rhode.' 'I'm aware.' Rhode nodded, sparing his words. This was not the first time. Throughout their journey, he had led every battle. Although he had tried to minimize the use of his injured left hand, in particularly troublesome situations, he could not afford such caution. This led to the wound reopening time and again. According to Lijie, what should have been a few days of rest to heal had now potentially become weeks of recovery due to their relentless journey. Yet the young woman had no complaints. After all, it was all done in their defense. All she could do was help Rhode change into a clean bandage each day to prevent the wound from getting infected. Fortunately, before they had left the Skyship, Lijie, as a Spirit Master, had made sure they were well-stocked with supplies. Upon removing the bandage, the sight of the wound under the firelight made everyone gasp. Meis even touched his own chest, a flicker of fear crossing his face as he looked at Rhode's wound. Three black claw marks, as thick as a small forearm, were etched across Rhode's chest. Surrounded by blackened scars from dried blood, many of the scars had been torn open again due to the ferocious battle with the gargoyles. Fresh blood seeped from them, mixing with the dark clots to create a chilling sight. Lijie took out a handkerchief, poured some clean water from a water bottle, and gently pressed it to Rhode's chest. He tensed up momentarily, and even Meis couldn't bear to look, turning his head away. 'I'm sorry, does it hurt?' 'It's bearable.' Rhode shook his head in response to Lijie's anxious query. It hurt, but not to an intolerable degree. Relieved by Rhode's response, Lijie continued to wipe his wound. Meanwhile, she couldn't help but stealthily observe the young man before her, slightly older than herself. To be honest, when she first met Rhode, her impression of him was quite average. His delicate features and pale skin had led her to categorize him as a noble's son. But unlike the arrogant young nobles she had encountered, Rhode's demeanor was different, and she found him bearable. At that time, she hadn't taken him seriously, as a man who resembled a woman often seemed weak. But over time, her perception changed. Unlike those effete young nobles, this young man possessed considerable strength, matching even her own leader. His temperament was reassuring, providing a sense of security even in danger. And contrary to his delicate appearance, he was a man of resilience. Lijie knew the pain such injuries could inflict. As a Spirit Master, she had treated many people, and she knew that many warriors who could withstand the battlefield would cry out in pain during treatment. But Rhode had remained stoically silent throughout the process, not to mention that he continued to fight with such severe injuries... Lijie hesitated for a moment. What was she thinking? These thoughts were absurd. The girl shook her head to dispel the strange notions and refocused on her task. Rhode, unaware of the girl's internal struggle, was focused on the item in his right hand—a pair of gems emitting a dark red glow. These were the spoils from their recent battle—the Gargoyle Control Core. Chapter 19: The Holy Sword's Upgrade As indispensable guardians for spellcasters, Gargoyles are cherished by mages for their unwavering protection. However, these creatures are far too valuable to be used merely as bodyguards. Many mages take advantage of Gargoyles' dual functionality: they act not only as stalwart defenders but also as living safes. This was precisely the case with the pair of Gargoyles that Rhode encountered. Within their fragmented remains, Rhode discovered an array of valuable items. True to their status as level 15 Rare Elites, the loot they 'dropped' was befitting. In addition to a variety of gems, crystals, and gold coins, Rhode unearthed three magical items. Frostguard Amulet [Elite Item]: Triggers a Frostguard Shield upon taking damage, absorbing 50~150 damage points and granting immunity to water attribute attacks. Oathkeeper's Guardian [Excellent Item]: Grants the bearer a +5 increase in spell potency and magical resistance. Mistveil Ring [Excellent Item]: Enables the wearer to activate 'Phantom Wraithform' for half an hour, with a recharge period of every ten days. These coveted accessories for casters would undoubtedly garner significant sums at any auction. Unfortunately, they were tailored for casters. Eventually, Rhode delegated these items among his companions. He bestowed the Frostguard Amulet and Oathkeeper's Guardian upon Lijie Noelle. As a Spirit Master, her role wasn't offensive, yet the items still offered her considerable benefits. Rhode retained the Mistveil Ring for himself. In the game world, the capabilities of such a ring were invaluable to those who ventured alone, compelling Rhode to claim it without hesitation. Lijie Noelle was perplexed by her sudden acquisition of two magical items, given without any effort on her part. In most mercenary groups, magical items from adventures were typically sold by the leader, the proceeds sustaining the group. The notion of directly distributing such treasures was virtually unheard of. This highlighted the disparity between NPCs and players. For mercenaries, the ultimate goal was straightforward: earning a livelihood. Therefore, rare equipment was often promptly sold. Many small mercenary groups shied away from high-risk tasks, content with menial assignments that players might find trivial, their aspirations limited to subsistence. Those deemed worthy of magical gear were only the most esteemed and skilled members within a group. The less capable? They could only dream of such treasures. Players, however, aspired to different heights: the relentless pursuit of betterment and might — superior gear, abundant experience, elevated prestige, and formidable personas. Thus, to players, magical equipment was not rare, and concerns about excess were non-existent — once better gear was found, the old could be sold just as easily. To Rhode, the three magical items were merely transitional gear, useful for levels 10~15, but soon to be outgrown. The Frostguard Amulet, though beneficial, was not indispensable to him. With a high-tier Water Elemental Summoned Spirit, he could achieve immunity to water attacks, making the distribution of such 'low-end' gear a negligible issue. Only the appearance of artifacts such as the 'Sword of the Sky' or 'Heart of the Saint' — legendary, pseudo-legendary, or ancient-level treasures — would truly capture his interest. For Lijie Noelle, however, these magical items represented 'high-end' gear. Even a medium-sized mercenary band leader might possess just a few such items. Mages might have more, but for a support role like a Spirit Master, this equipment was a rare boon. Considering their role and nature, they typically had little need for such items. Now, here she was, a Spirit Master in a humble group, suddenly endowed with two significant magical items. It felt almost dreamlike to Lijie Noelle. Meis, observing the exchange, discerned even deeper implications. As an experienced merchant, Meis was well aware of the value of magical items. These artifacts, if auctioned in the bustling port of Karag to the north, could fetch tens of thousands of gold coins. Yet Rhode parted with them as if giving away bread rather than treasures. His nonchalance was not an act of bravado before the fairer sex but stemmed from genuine indifference — Rhode truly placed little value on these magical items. Such an attitude was not commonplace. Meis, who had interacted with many, from mercenaries to nobles, knew that to them, these magical items were treasures, not to be given away lightly nor dismissed with indifference. What did this reveal about the young man? It suggested that, in his eyes, such magical items were trivial. This demeanor indicated that the young man might hail from an extraordinary background. If Meis had initially thought of Rhode as just another noble amongst the many on the continent, he now began to suspect his association with storied noble houses or even royalty. Only families of such stature possessed vast quantities of magical items and viewed them with such nonchalance — like a magnate who regards a small fortune as mere pocket change, although to the common folk, it could represent a lifetime's earnings. This realization excited the merchant. A modest trader like himself rarely had the chance to meet with the great noble families, as those nobles were served by powerful allies, leaving little room for a small merchant in their sight. Now, with this opportunity at hand, if he played his cards right, the possibilities were endless. However, this hopeful thought was fleeting, tempered by the acknowledgment of his own unremarkable performance thus far. Although the young man had spared him complaints, the merchant knew he had yet to demonstrate any worth that might capture the other's esteem, dampening his excitement. Indeed, Rhode was unconcerned with the three magical items. What captivated him now were the twin heart-shaped gems in his hands. Gargoyle's Heart. Artificial Soul Convergence. This term, although complex-sounding to players, essentially refers to a rare and highly sought-after core capable of imbuing inanimate forms with a semblance of life, much like the central processing unit within a robot. Their value was self-evident. In Dragon Soul Continent, the creation of alchemical creatures represented the apex of arcane craftsmanship. The divine prerogative of life creation was beyond mages, and artificial souls were the compromise they reluctantly accepted. As a result, intact artificial soul cores were exceedingly scarce, a privilege not every mage could attain. For mages, possessing an artificial alchemical life form was among their loftiest ambitions — akin to how a luxury car is a status symbol for the rich elite. These cores were coveted, with few in circulation, and produced in limited quantities, thus commanding exorbitant prices. At auction, they could fetch tens of thousands of gold coins, and in secret markets, even more. The most exquisite artificial soul cores could sell for millions, enough to purchase a significant estate. Mages were accustomed to affluence. But Rhode sought not wealth. His experience as a player had taught him that although money was always to be earned, it was never sufficient. Some things, however, were beyond the reach of wealth. For example, the additional ability of the Gargoyle's Heart. Forced Summoned Spirit Evolution +1. A summon's experience points were shared with its master. Normally, in combat, if Rhode earned 1000 experience points, only 700 would be his. The remaining 300 would go to the spirits engaged in battle. Though this division might seem inconsequential, it added up over time, which is why Summoner Swordsmen faced a steeper ascent to the pinnacle than other professions. By the game's rules, had Rhode been of any other profession, devouring a level 10 five-person instance at level eight would have likely propelled him to levels 12 or 13 by now. But due to the experience shared with the Azure Bird and Star Scar, he had only just surpassed level 10. As for his summons... [Eternal Holy Sword No.10: Star Scar, Attribute-less, Fusion Compatible — Not even the dust of history can obscure its dazzling radiance.] Level: 5, The glory of victory leads the charge, Blade Trait. A summon's level could reach up to ten, at which point they were eligible to evolve. Post-evolution, they would transform, and their level cap would increase by another ten levels, until the third evolution. The Gargoyle's Heart's power was to forcibly elevate a summon's level to 10, initiating evolution. This saved additional experience points and reduced the time needed for leveling. What remained elusive to wealth? Time remained elusive to wealth. Rhode was uncertain of Star Scar's level cap, but his extensive experience suggested that cards at the end of a deck rarely reached high levels, with three evolutions likely being the limit. If he invested both Gargoyle's Hearts, then, at least in battles against equals, the forcibly advanced Holy Sword would no longer vie for Rhode's experience points. But... Rhode fell into deep thought. This set of Holy Sword Cards was extraordinarily unique. When receiving the card from the CEO of B&M Company, he was explicitly told it was the only one in existence. At the time, Rhode didn't ponder the significance, but now, he found it curious. The only one? Hadn't the system prompt stated he had acquired only 1/10th of the Eternal Deck? How then did it become the only card? What of the nine remaining cards? Moreover, this was the tenth card, implying nine precedents. No such deck existed in the game, for it was merely a memento from the real world. In the lore of Dragon Soul Continent, no mention of a Holy Sword Deck existed. It couldn't be hidden within the game, as the deck's creation was inspired by his victory in the competitive arena and his guild named Starlight. The company crafted this card as a prize, a token of remembrance. Such a hastily produced item was not integrated into the game's system. Nonetheless, an attempt was warranted. With this in mind, Rhode extended his right hand, clasping the gem within. Instantly, a system prompt materialized before him. ['Gargoyle's Heart' (Magical Item) detected, would you like to use it?] Use. Rhode affirmed internally. Following Rhode's decision, the summoning circle on his palm shimmered with a delicate magical light. The dark red gem crumbled under the glow, disintegrating into dust that vanished without a trace. Shortly after, new insights appeared before Rhode. [Target?] Star Scar. Rhode's eyes lowered as he replied in his thoughts. [Target — Star Scar — Forced Evolution] [Level Upgrade Complete] [Evolve?] Yes. The immaculate card reappeared in Rhode's grasp, its radiance drawing the curious looks of Lijie Noelle and Meis nearby. At that moment, a succession of system prompts unfolded before Rhode. [Evolution Complete] [Eternal Holy Sword No.10: Star Scar, Attribute-less, Fusion Compatible — Not even the dust of history can conceal its resplendent radiance.] Level: 10, The glory of victory leads the charge, Blade Trait. Snow-white wings offer sanctuary to all life, Guardian Trait. The pure light dispels darkness, Piercing Trait.] [Attached Skills: Blade Technique, Wingguard, Star Beacon. Usable thrice per natural day] Satisfactory! Rhode nodded, content with the system's prompt. Star Scar possessed three exceptional skills, all inherent to the weapon, thus sparing Rhode's soul power for their activation. The provision of three daily uses was ample, and it was evident these abilities would play a significant role in combat. Nevertheless, the next system prompt gave Rhode pause. [Detecting Magic Condensation]
Chapter 70: Cave Lord of Donglai (Part 8) As bewilderment swept through the onlookers, Cave Lord Miao Yi took charge, his voice cutting through the silence, demanding answers. The others, struck by the sudden turn of events, could only exchange glances of confusion, equally clueless. Cave Lord Miao Yi, without hesitation, soared towards the origin of the deafening clamor with Yan Xiu and two disciples swiftly on his heels. Song Fu and his peers, after a brief exchange of looks, hastened after them, eager to uncover the truth. Arriving at the mountain gate, they were met with a sight that sent a wave of shock through them – the stone gateway bearing the proud inscription 'Donglai Cave' had been reduced to rubble under the moonlight. The sacred gate of Donglai Cave had been violated. Whirling around, Cave Lord Miao Yi’s eyes bore into Song Fu and his companions with a venomous sneer, 'Excellent! It seems someone is already eager to challenge my authority! Very well!' Song Fu and the others were momentarily speechless. The implication in his words was clear, yet they were innocent. They had been strategizing over a meal when they were startled by the noise and came out. Initially suspecting Cave Lord Miao Yi himself, they now realized that he had no reason to destroy his own symbol of authority – such a disgrace would be unbecoming of the new Cave Lord of Donglai. Clarity was essential. Song Fu, with a tone of sincerity, clasped his fists—an ancient gesture of respect and earnestness—and proclaimed, 'Cave Lord, this act was not of our doing!' The others, for the first time addressing Miao Yi with the proper deference due to a Cave Lord, echoed his sentiment. 'Excuses!' Cave Lord Miao Yi glared at Song Fu, contempt in his voice, 'Today, I appointed you guardian of the mountain gate, and now it's been destroyed. How could you not be aware? Surely this wasn’t a deliberate oversight?' '...' Speechless, Song Fu was forced to admit, 'Cave Lord, perhaps you are not yet informed. The servants from Donglai Town have yet to be assigned, and we fend for ourselves for sustenance. In a moment of necessity, I left briefly to secure food, never expecting such a calamity.' Wang Zifa and the rest also stepped forward, 'Cave Lord, we can vouch that Brother Song Fu was indeed with us at that time, breaking bread.' Cave Lord Miao Yi, gesturing towards the shattered arch, demanded sharply, 'Are you suggesting it collapsed without cause? Do not dare to tell me it was toppled by mere wind!' '...' At a loss for words, Song Fu could only raise his hand in oath, 'Cave Lord, I swear upon the honor of 蓝玉门, we are innocent. If I speak even a half-truth, may I, Song Fu, meet an untimely demise!' Cave Lord Miao Yi's eyes flickered suspiciously over the assembled disciples as he darkly suggested, 'Could it be that an intruder has dared to provoke chaos within my Donglai Cave?' A collective shudder of alarm prompted the disciples to scan their surroundings vigilantly. 'What are you waiting for? Do you wish to meet your end in your slumber? Disperse and search at once!' commanded Cave Lord Miao Yi, his fury palpable. 'Yes!' Yan Xiu alongside the others saluted and dispersed into the forest. 'Hmm?' Cave Lord Miao Yi snorted, his piercing gaze fixed on Song Fu and the others, questioning their inaction and possible foreknowledge. Now was the moment to demonstrate their innocence. Song Fu turned and barked, 'Why are you not obeying the Cave Lord's command to search?' With a collective bow to Cave Lord Miao Yi, they too scattered. However, Song Fu was stopped by Cave Lord Miao Yi, 'Song Fu, you shall accompany me!' Song Fu paused, then nodded in assent, following Cave Lord Miao Yi. After the others had departed, a figure emerged like a mirage upon the water – the enigmatic and peerless Lao Bai. Lao Bai, gazing upon the ruins, chuckled lightly, 'The game of life is akin to chess, and a true warrior must possess more than brute strength. I have always feared your inherent kindness would be your undoing... A man of valor must wield strategy as well as might; the simple brute does not ascend to the heavens. I can now set my worries aside.' With that, he vanished as silently as he appeared, like a ripple dissolving on the water's surface. Within the Donglai Grand Hall, where candlelight danced upon the ancient walls, casting a ghostly ballet of shadows, Song Fu followed Cave Lord Miao Yi, standing behind him as the latter contemplated his throne in heavy silence. The atmosphere between them was tense. After a while, Song Fu could no longer hold his silence, 'Cave Lord, for what purpose have you summoned me?' Cave Lord Miao Yi's voice was ominous, 'Song Fu, do you comprehend the gravity of your offense?' Song Fu, his lips curled into a sneer, glanced at the food and drink on the side table, 'This incident was not of our making. How, then, stands Song Fu accused?' 'I do not speak of that!' Cave Lord Miao Yi turned sharply, his gaze icy as he accused, 'I entrusted you with the duty of guarding the mountain gate. Why did you abandon your charge? Could it be that you hold my command in so little regard?' Song Fu thought to himself, 'Do you even need to ask?' But he answered with measured words, 'I have already informed you, Cave Lord. It was a matter of survival, a brief departure for nourishment. I had no wish for this unfortunate event to transpire.' Cave Lord Miao Yi inquired, 'Do you think if I report this matter, the Prefecture Head and the Mountain Lord will believe your explanation?' Song Fu's laughter was laced with scorn, 'A tongue can spin any tale. Should the Cave Lord of Donglai choose to accuse me falsely, then do as you must. Remember, Song Fu too has a voice for self-defense; I am no mute.' Cave Lord Miao Yi sneered, 'It seems you truly are beyond redemption.' With his words hanging in the air, Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun, in a silent accord, swiftly barred the hall doors, sealing Song Fu's fate. Startled by the noise, Song Fu spun around to face the descending axes of Yan Xiu, his fury unleashed. With a swift draw of his blade, a flash of cold steel met the raging attack. Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun joined the fray in an instant, their spears collaborating in a deadly dance that encircled Song Fu. Yan Xiu and Song Fu, both formidable in their cultivation, were well-matched. But with Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun adding their might, Song Fu’s situation quickly turned perilous. 'You contemptible traitors! How dare you conspire to...' Caught in their snare, unable to escape, Song Fu's anguished cry was cut short as he desperately clashed with Yan Xiu. Before he could finish, the relentless spears pierced his defenses, striking deep. Song Fu's eyes widened in shock as he struggled to look at Cave Lord Miao Yi, his lips trembling, the indignation in his gaze indescribable. He finally understood – it was all a trap. The fall of the mountain gate arch was not just meant to frame him but also to draw away his fellow disciples, preventing any united defense. The true aim was his life. Chapter 71: Master of Donglai Cave (IX) When else to strike, if not now? Yan Xiu's blade danced with lethal precision, and with one formidable swing, 'plop'—a head was sent aloft. Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun likewise withdrew their spears from Song Fu's body. With their hearts still pounding, the trio ceased their actions and immediately turned their gaze to Cave Lord Miao. Cave Lord Miao had refrained from intervening, instead casting a spell to shield the table of delicacies from the battle's stray energies. Now, lifting the spell, he stretched out his fingers and summoned a cup of wine toward him, emptying it in one gulp, his tone detached, "The curtain falls on this farce." The three saluted and swiftly disappeared towards the rear of the hall, vanishing from sight. It was then that Cave Lord Miao proceeded to the entrance, flung open the grand doors, and stepped across the threshold, affectionately stroking Black Charcoal's mane, while contemplating the moonlit sky. His gaze was icy, but his thoughts were consumed by the past—a younger self, leading his siblings against a mob of taunting adults, feeling a mix of rage and helplessness. In a moment of profound despair, he had stabbed his own thigh, blood pouring out... "My brothers, I've failed you, shouldn't have led you into such peril; it’s all my fault. Stay safe, my abilities are still limited, but give me a little more time..." Cave Lord Miao murmured, as the dark green bead at his neck flickered faintly. Black Charcoal shook its head and sneezed... The sounds of the fight and Song Fu's last screams had drawn his fellow sect members back. Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, both White Lotus Third Rank cultivators, arrived first, followed quickly by Shang Youlai, Hou Sheng, Wang Xiuqin, and Nan Sisi. Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun were the last to arrive, apparently alerted by the commotion. As they tried to enter the grand hall to see what had happened, they were blocked by Cave Lord Miao, who, astride his Dragon Steed and brandishing a silver lance, stood resolute on the steps before the grand hall, looking down upon them. The night sky outside the grand hall was adorned with stars, while inside, behind Cave Lord Miao, the flickering candlelight created a play of light and shadow that made it difficult to discern his expression, lending an air of mystery and authority. His aura of lethal intent was almost palpable. The Blue Jade Sect members exchanged wary looks before Wang Zifa proceeded with a bow to inquire, "Cave Lord, did we not hear the clash of battle and Brother Song Fu's pleas for aid? Is Brother Song Fu inside?" "He is! However, now headless," Cave Lord Miao disclosed bluntly, raising a hand that held a head by its hair, showing it to those gathered, then carelessly tossing it toward the crowd. The group instinctively stepped back, watching a severed head roll to a stop at their feet. Upon closer inspection, there was no doubt that it was Song Fu's. Yan Xiu's trio exchanged covert glances, while the rest were visibly shocked. Wang Zifa, fuelled by sudden anger, pointed at Cave Lord Miao on the steps and demanded, "Was it you who killed Brother Song Fu?" From his elevated position, Cave Lord Miao's voice, devoid of any warmth, stated coldly, "I commanded him to guard the mountain gate, yet he dared to desert his post, leading to the destruction of our Donglai Cave's gate. When questioned about his crime, he not only refused to accept guilt but even dared to disrespect me, the Cave Lord. For such a reckless fool, who treats the Cave Lord's orders as child's play, should he not deserve death?" At this, Wang Zifa and the others swiftly drew their swords, aiming them at Cave Lord Miao. Wang Zifa accused sharply, "You dare to execute a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect!" "How dare you!" Cave Lord Miao's thunderous voice served as a warning, "Regardless of your sects, having joined Donglai Cave, you should forsake prior allegiances and obey our rules. Do you really wish to challenge the Emissary of the Celestial Path's million-strong army? Such arrogance is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot!" He pointed his spear at them, "Song Fu is neither the first White Lotus Third Rank cultivator to fall by my hand nor will he be the last. Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, Qiu Shaoqun!" Yan Xiu and his companions, positioned behind the crowd, brandished their weapons, replying in unison, "Present!" "Should anyone dare to revolt against their superior!" Cave Lord Miao, looking down, his spear directed at Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, ordered, "I'll handle these two; the other four are yours to deal with!" "As commanded!" Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun, alongside axe-wielding Yan Xiu, responded with a roar, "Death to those who defy!" This had been their agreed strategy; they had resolved to execute Song Fu as an example to all. While Cave Lord Miao was unsure if he could singlehandedly defeat White Lotus Third Rank cultivators Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, with Black Charcoal's agility, he could certainly keep them occupied. The remaining four, of White Lotus Second Rank, would be evenly matched against White Lotus Third Rank Yan Xiu, with Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun as support. Should a conflict arise, once Yan Xiu and his comrades vanquished the four, they would immediately aid Cave Lord Miao against Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, greatly increasing their chances of victory. The Blue Jade Sect disciples glanced at Cave Lord Miao, steadfast with his lance at the hall's entrance, then back at the stern Yan Xiu and his group. They found themselves in a dilemma. Having witnessed the battle at Gleaming Light Cave from the sidelines, they knew that even with Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao joining forces, defeating Cave Lord Miao was not a certainty. If the fight dragged on, the four White Lotus Second Rank cultivators would likely fall against White Lotus Third Rank Yan Xiu and his two assailants. They stood no chance in this battle. Furthermore, they were unaware that Song Fu's death was a joint effort by Yan Xiu and the others, and Cave Lord Miao's swift execution of Song Fu only heightened their apprehension, filling them with unease. "I, Cave Lord Miao, stand here; who dares to challenge me?" Cave Lord Miao called out again, his voice echoing with authority. "You've killed a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect; be assured, they will demand an explanation," Wang Zifa declared, having already sheathed his sword, not daring to provoke further conflict. The others also slowly sheathed theirs. With the situation under control, Cave Lord Miao scoffed, "The affairs of the Blue Jade Sect do not concern me. I am solely focused on Donglai Cave. Should you be dissatisfied here, then leave; I will not stop you. However, if you choose to stay and heed my commands, you will be well compensated. Starting today, any member of Donglai Cave who obeys my command will be handsomely rewarded. Each White Lotus Third Rank cultivator shall receive three Grain of Rice Pearls annually—a type of valuable cultivation resource—and those of White Lotus Second Rank, two. Those unwilling to pledge their loyalty, leave at once!" The declaration left everyone present in a state of amazement, including Yan Xiu and his group, for Cave Lord Miao had not previously informed them of this. They quickly assessed the situation. Donglai Cave had roughly 120,000 followers, yielding nearly 120 Wish Power Pearls per year. After offering up eighty percent, only twenty percent remained—twenty-four pearls in total. With three White Lotus Third Rank cultivators claiming nine pearls and six White Lotus Second Rank cultivators another twelve, twenty-one pearls were already spoken for. Could it be that Cave Lord Miao, having strived so hard to attain his position, was content with a mere three pearls for himself? But could Cave Lord Miao's generous offer conceal a deeper stratagem? Chapter Seventy-Two: Cave Lord of Donglai (Part Ten) The disciples of the Blue Jade Sect had curried favor with Yang Qing for one singular purpose: the acquisition of Wish Power Pearls. With the issue of Song Fu momentarily set aside, the veracity of the Cave Lord's words demanded immediate verification. Wang Zifa, marked by hesitation, respectfully inquired, 'Cave Lord, are you not merely jesting with us? Should you proceed as stated, you would be left with merely three Wish Power Pearls. If we...' His voice tapered off, his unfinished thought swallowed as he and the others fixated on Miao Yi's hand. In the night's embrace, the Wish Power Pearl, modest in size yet potent in presence, glowed with an ethereal light, its allure irresistible. Held deftly between Miao Yi's fingers, it was as though it contained the collective hopes of thousands, its magnetism undeniable. Those gathered, blessed with sight far beyond ordinary men, immediately recognized the pearl's true essence—a Wish Power Pearl, charged with a year's worth of countless aspirations. 'Regarding Wish Power Pearls—whether two or three—the quantity is of little consequence,' Miao Yi pronounced, as he skillfully stowed the pearl within his Storage Bag. Overlooking the crowd with an authoritative gaze, he declared, 'Should you heed my command with unwavering loyalty, I possess the means to secure more. In due time, the pearls you receive annually may indeed surpass what I have pledged. Those who serve this Cave Lord with unwavering loyalty shall be rewarded generously!' Their hearts stirred with excitement, their eyes aglow with anticipation. The sight of the Donglai Cave Lord nonchalantly producing such a pearl dispelled any lingering doubts. Each disciple's heart raced; such a pearl was a rarity for a modest abode like Donglai, and it was improbable that even Yang Qing would grant such a gift without reservation. The prospect that Miao Yi might have alternative sources for Wish Power Pearls became a plausible consideration. For a domain such as Donglai Cave, irrespective of one's cultivation rank, a mere pearl per year was the standard for those who had fallen from the Cave Lord's grace—a predicament Yan Xiu knew all too well from his days in Gleaming Light Cave. Yet, should Miao Yi's promises come to fruition, and the supply of Wish Power Pearls were to double or triple, the implications were profound. For a White Lotus Third Rank cultivator, a century of cultivation could now equate to three centuries; for the Second Rank, two centuries. The potential to significantly reduce one's time in cultivation, to swiftly elevate one's prowess and status, was indeed tantalizing. Some entertained malevolent thoughts—of seizing the Wish Power Pearls from Miao Yi by force. Upon further contemplation, however, the impracticality of such an action became apparent. No single individual could confidently claim victory over Miao Yi, and if they did prevail, to whom would the prize belong? Even if one managed to secure the pearl, it would only equate to ten lesser Grain of Rice Pearls. According to Miao Yi's promise, such wealth could be amassed in just three years. For cultivators, three years was but a brief moment in the vast expanse of their cultivation journey. To take the pearl now would mean severing a potentially endless stream of future prosperity. Suppressing the impractical desires that promised more risk than reward, Wang Zifa, with resolve, clasped his fists and earnestly sought confirmation, 'Cave Lord, may we consider your word as a pledge most solemn?' Miao Yi cast a downward glance, his voice steady, 'You, disciples of the Blue Jade Sect, stand united. If my word were not my bond, what advantage would that afford me?' After exchanging a meaningful glance, Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, along with their expectant peers, nodded in agreement. Swords were sheathed in unison as the disciples aligned themselves in two orderly rows. Their voices echoed in unison, 'We pledge to heed the Cave Lord's command!' Miao Yi sat up straight, the scene before him reflecting his rightful dominion. This was the moment when Donglai Cave truly became his realm. However, mere words were insufficient. Miao Yi was not one to be appeased so easily. 'Words alone will not suffice; your commitment must be demonstrated through concrete actions.' The disciples glanced at one another, and once again, led by Wang Zifa, they sought guidance with clasped fists. 'Cave Lord, we await your directive.' With a detached air, Miao Yi asserted, 'Song Fu's insubordination has shown contempt for the edicts of Donglai Cave!' The message was clear; a stance must be taken, and allegiance proven to merit rewards. Wang Zifa exhaled deeply, conceding, 'We too disapproved of Senior Brother Song's conduct. Despite our repeated admonitions, he remained obstinate. He is, after all, our senior brother. Every nation has its laws, every mountain its rules. The Cave Lord’s execution as just punishment raises no doubts in us, and we hold no objections.' The others mirrored his gesture, bowing and clasping their fists, 'The Cave Lord’s execution as just punishment, we hold no objections.' Yan Xiu and his companions exchanged looks, their expressions a mix of annoyance and reluctant respect. These same disciples, who once made light of their suffering, were now models of obedience, quick to shift all blame onto Song Fu. Their gaze toward Miao Yi shifted, now tinged with a newfound respect, recognizing in the Cave Lord the skill to turn the tide with a mere flick of his wrist, upending the status quo of Donglai Cave. It was clear why Prefecture Head Yang Qing had so ardently advocated for his leadership. 'Song Fu, though deserving of his fate, remains a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect. At this juncture, when Nanxuan Prefecture and the Blue Jade Sect stand united, it would be imprudent to let the transgressions of one man tarnish the rapport between our two factions. This matter warrants reporting; we owe an explanation to our superiors,' Miao Yi articulated, pausing deliberately to scan the faces before him. He continued, 'A solitary testimony from me might invite skepticism within the Blue Jade Sect. If you, his fellow disciples, are willing to corroborate the account, it will surely alleviate any concerns within your sect. Are you prepared to record your testimonies and join me in informing the Mountain Lord?' Yan Xiu and the others barely contained their amusement, impressed by the Cave Lord’s bold strategy. Wang Zifa and the rest displayed discomfort as they grasped the extent of Miao Yi's stratagem. He had vanquished a Blue Jade Sect disciple and now sought to absolve himself of all responsibility, expecting the sect to sanction their disciple's demise as warranted. Was it not evident that he held no fear for their sect, that he did not regard them with due respect? As a weighty silence descended, Miao Yi sighed, 'If writing is not your wish, I shall not coerce you. Nevertheless, consider this: once the Blue Jade Sect begins its investigation and discovers the Wish Power Pearls you are to receive yearly, few will seek to fault me. The allure of the Wish Power Pearls overshadows the standing of a mere Cave Lord. Should another take my place as Cave Lord of Donglai, they may not show the same generosity. It is conceivable that your brethren might scheme to displace you, eager to take up your mantle. When that moment comes, I shall be powerless to stop them. What is your decision?' Miao Yi's words struck at their core, resonating with the grim certainty of a future where one's own brethren might indeed conspire to usurp their position, particularly those of the Blue Jade Sect relegated to the lowest ranks, vulnerable to the machinations of those with influence. Nan Sisi murmured, 'Brother Wang, Senior Brother Song's defiance led to the mountain gate's ruin. His culpability cannot be denied.' 'Certainly...' A chorus of agreement followed, subdued yet laden with implications, trusting in Brother Wang's understanding. Wang Zifa recognized the collective sentiment; none were willing to forfeit the advantages promised to them. Yet to yield to this impulse was to deceive their sect. Once aboard Miao Yi's vessel, there would be no retreat; they would be beholden to him, resigned to servitude indefinitely. Chapter 73: Master of Donglai Cave (Part 11) The allure of the Wish Power Pearls, those coveted tokens of spiritual fortitude, proved irresistible. What other reason would there be for these cultivators to willingly submit to another's command if not for these Pearls? Amidst the quiet murmurings of his fellow disciples, Wang Zifa set his resolve and approached the steps. With a sigh, he conceded, 'I am merely heeding the collective wish of our brethren; this decision was not mine alone to make.' 'Of course!' 'Certainly!' All around, nods were exchanged, a silent agreement that no single person should bear the weight of this decision alone. A shared responsibility was the only safeguard against any future discord that might arise from hidden resentments. United in accountability, they stood on firmer ground. With a consensus reached, they collectively bowed and declared, 'We shall heed the commands of Cave Lord Miao Yi!' Witnessing the transformative events, Yan Xiu and his companions could not help but look upon their Cave Lord with newfound respect. Miao Yi had, with remarkable ease, enlisted the allegiance of numerous Blue Jade Sect disciples. Their admiration for him knew no bounds. Upon reflection, they realized they were in a similar bind. It was their hands that had slain Song Fu, and should the truth surface, they would be equally culpable. It appeared that all were now bound to Cave Lord Miao Yi's 'ship of shared fate,' with no chance for retreat. 'Acceptable!' Miao Yi sheathed his silver spear and dismounted, standing with a casual air at the top of the steps. He now wore a smile, 'The hour is early. Why not scribe your statements now? Once I verify there are no discrepancies, they shall be dispatched to Zhenhai Mountain to inform Mountain Lord Qin Weiwei.' Between the lines, it was clear – Cave Lord Miao Yi was giving no quarter for second thoughts, not even a night's reprieve. Resigned to their fate, they all consented. Miao Yi wasted no time, 'Yan Xiu, distribute the Jade Slips.' One by one, the Jade Slips, used for recording in the cultivation world, were handed to each disciple. The disciples stood beneath the steps of the Grand Hall, each inscribing their testimony with mystical characters. Some faltered, their hands uneasy as they pondered the appropriateness of their actions towards their deceased comrade... Once scribed, they ascended the steps and presented their Jade Slips to Miao Yi for inspection. After reviewing a submission, Miao Yi would either nod in approval, 'This is satisfactory,' or offer guidance for improvements. If a script appeared too lenient, he would inquire, 'Is this not downplaying the severity of Song Fu's misdeeds?' With an apologetic smile, the disciple would reply, 'I shall redraft it immediately.' When the narrative was overly harsh, Miao Yi would advise, 'Moderation is key. Let us not ascribe undue malevolence – such portrayal would serve only to further shame the Blue Jade Sect. Please, revise it accordingly.' Yan Xiu and his companions also contributed their accounts. After all the Jade Slips were collected, Miao Yi prepared his own Petition. It described Song Fu's defiance and dereliction of duty, leading to the destruction of the Mountain Gate. His execution was justified as a deterrent to others. His own account was intentionally understated, aiming to reflect the magnanimity expected of a Cave Lord. With so many condemning Song Fu, Miao Yi's voice was but one among many. Once he affixed his signature dharma seal to the document, he gathered it along with the revised Petition from the Donglai Town Governor. Looking up, he called out, 'Shan Biaoyi!' Shan Biaoyi stepped forward promptly, 'At your service!' 'You must depart at once and ensure these are delivered to Zhenhai Mountain. Inform Mountain Lord Qin Weiwei without delay,' Miao Yi instructed as he passed the papers. 'As you wish!' Shan Biaoyi departed with haste. As his figure vanished, the crowd was left contemplating the Cave Lord's urgent dispatch, realizing there would be no delay, not even through the night. With the pressing matters addressed, Miao Yi allowed himself a moment's respite. He then turned to Yan Xiu, 'Have the Town Governor of Donglai come to see me on the morrow. He is to bring all necessary aides. We must not disrupt the daily lives and cultivation of our people.' The order was met with approval, the assembled disciples responding in chorus, 'The Cave Lord's acumen is unparalleled!' 'Yet, do not revel in relief too soon,' Miao Yi cautioned, his gaze sweeping over the Blue Jade Sect disciples. 'Do not presume I am oblivious to the machinations you once conspired with Song Fu. His failure to guard the Mountain Gate implicates you all. I expect to see Donglai Cave's reputation upheld by the arrival of tomorrow's guests. You shall quarry stone tonight and work diligently to rebuild the Gateway Arch. This is your opportunity to atone. Do not shirk this duty – it must be executed with both grace and grandeur.' No dissent was voiced; all acquiesced, knowing the Mountain Gate would be well-guarded through the night. Miao Yi signaled for the assembly to disperse and turned to Qiu Shaoqun, 'Tidy the Grand Hall.' Yan Xiu then escorted Miao Yi to the Rear Palace, the exclusive domain for the Cave Lord's cultivation and rest. Black Charcoal, unbound by the niceties of protocol, trailed behind. En route, Yan Xiu couldn't contain his query, 'Cave Lord, is the yearly distribution of Wish Power Pearls not too liberal?' He saw himself as a trusted confidant, voicing concern for the Cave Lord's affairs. Miao Yi arches an eyebrow, 'Do you not see why I hastened Shan Biaoyi to deliver the documents? It is to cement the matter. Should I choose to withhold the Pearls, what recourse would they have? They would not dare cross me, for fear of Blue Jade Sect's retribution. Let them try to defy me!' '......' Yan Xiu was left speechless. 'Do not overthink it. I merely posited a scenario. Should the annual harvest of Wish Power Pearls meet expectations, my promises will be honored,' Miao Yi clarified. Stroking Black Charcoal's side, Miao Yi shared a revelation, 'Dealing with outward affairs has led me to a realization – 'a horse ungrazed at night grows not in girth.' Relying solely on fixed stipends is unsustainable. We must seek alternative means to augment our revenue.' His words stemmed from earnest experience, not idle musing. Setting aside the Pearls gifted by the charming innkeeper and those obtained from the demise of Mo Shengtu and Zhang Shucheng, including the one seized from Huang Baolong, he had acquired a taste for prosperity. It was time to marshal his forces within Donglai Cave for larger endeavors. A singular strength was insufficient in the grand scheme of things. Slightly discontent, Black Charcoal made do with the courtyard between the front and rear palaces. Miao Yi's private quarters, designated for sleep and cultivation, were not suited for such a sizable beast. Reluctantly, the loyal creature lay down at the entrance, its laziness on full display. The courtyard was a sanctuary steeped in ethereal tranquility, with potted ancient trees, refined pavilions, and small towers encircling a picturesque pond – a far more elegant resting place than the outdoors. Miao Yi, entering his personal sanctum with a sense of ease, marveled at the Cave Lord's lavish accommodations. Thick carpets, ornate furnishings, and a blend of luxury and elegance unlike anything he had seen before, made a lasting impression on him. Meanwhile, Yan Xiu's mind was preoccupied not with the opulence but with the Cave Lord's mention of new income sources. He was curious about the origins of the powerful Wish Power Pearl and the potential it represented. He ventured, 'Cave Lord, may I inquire how we might pursue these new revenue streams?' With a knowing smile, Miao Yi replied, 'The optimal strategy would be to emulate the Prefecture Head and claim all of Nanxuan for our own.' Yan Xiu was taken aback, hastily gesturing in disapproval, 'That would be unwise. Our current strength is insufficient to annex the territories around us.' Chapter 74: Master of Donglai Cave (Part 12) "I am indeed aware of the potential consequences. If we attempt to seize another's territory now, we risk not only failing to secure it but also leaving our own domain vulnerable to invasion." With a hint of self-mockery, Miao Yi shook his head, turned, and seated himself on the thickly padded, ornately carved couch. "What are your thoughts on making a journey to the Stellar Sea?" "The Stellar Sea?" Yan Xiu's eyes widened in shock; he was the one who had first spoken of this place to Miao Yi. "Why would we venture to the Stellar Sea? That region falls within the Demon State ruled by Sorceress Saint Ji Huan! The Stellar Sea is teeming with demons, and human cultivators who dare enter rarely return." "Did you not mention that Fiend Pills not meeting the quality grade could be exchanged for Wish Power Pearls?" Miao Yi inquired. This piece of information had come from Yan Xiu after they had witnessed the fierce battle between Yang Qing and Lu Yu. Fiend and Yin Pills are integral in crafting Mystic Relics, which are the source of a relic's power. Since relics cannot be used for personal cultivation and lose energy with each use, replenishing their energy becomes essential. Thus, lower-grade Fiend Pills have become the preferred source for energy replenishment for relics, ensuring their market value, whether traded for currency or Wish Power Pearls. Yan Xiu, his heart pounding, responded with trepidation, "Cave Lord Miao, when you spoke of seeking alternative paths, you surely didn't envisage hunting in the Stellar Sea?" "Hehe, I merely made an offhand remark. Look how anxious you've become; I was merely jesting," Miao Yi replied with a dismissive chuckle. After Yan Xiu departed, Miao Yi walked into his private Meditation Chamber to inspect it. This was an underground space, substantial in size, with floors and walls lined with thick, polished stone slabs. Copper lamps cast a moderate glow throughout the chamber. In front of a stone couch designed for quiet meditation stood three large baths constructed of jade stones, each with sculpted animal heads that served as spouts. One bath drew from a mountain spring, another from a hot spring, and their waters merged into a third, creating a bath with the ideal temperature for relaxation. Miao Yi disrobed and eased into the bath, his sighs of contentment echoing softly... The next morning, as the sun rose, Miao Yi, flanked by his followers, inspected the new gateway arch at the entrance to Donglai Cave. He was immediately impressed by the sight. Throughout the night, he had faintly heard the sounds of chiseling from his chamber. The six cultivators who had toiled through the night had indeed created a remarkable edifice. The gateway featured four main pillars and three entrances. The primary entrance, over three zhang high (approximately 10 meters/33 feet), was adorned with lifelike reliefs of birds and beasts amidst cloud motifs, and the words 'Donglai Cave' were inscribed prominently above. Stone dragons and tigers, poised as guardians, flanked the inscription. The entire gateway arch was imposing and magnificent, evoking Miao Yi's admiration. "Excellent work. It seems that even if the people of Donglai Cave did not cultivate, they would still make fine stonemasons." Relieved by his approval, the Blue Jade Sect disciples, who had feared his unpredictable demands, breathed easier. They had devoted much effort to the arch's construction. The group's laughter and banter momentarily lightened the atmosphere. However, Miao Yi's attention soon shifted to their blue garments. "I find your attire rather jarring. Onlookers might mistake Donglai Cave for an extension of the Blue Jade Sect. You may wear your blue robes back at the Blue Jade Sect if you like, but here in Donglai Cave, we should have a unified dress code. Yan Xiu, arrange for the tailors in the city to make us black robes." "As you command, Cave Lord Miao," Yan Xiu responded, bowing respectfully. The Blue Jade Sect disciples exchanged uncertain glances at this directive. Disregarding their preferences, Miao Yi continued to inspect the gateway arch with a satisfied demeanor. As they admired the structure, Yan Xiu suddenly pointed toward the lakeside path, "Cave Lord, it appears that the Town Governor of Donglai Town is approaching." Looking in the direction indicated, they saw a procession weaving its way along the path, with numerous palanquins and a train of carts suggesting they brought many offerings. Miao Yi glanced at them briefly, his attention lingering longer on the great lake below. "Yan Xiu, ensure we stock the lake with more fish and shrimp for cultivation purposes." "Understood, Cave Lord Miao," Yan Xiu acknowledged, aware that the additions were likely for Black Charcoal, the Dragon Steed that favored fresh seafood and enjoyed frolicking in water. The large lake would serve as a perfect habitat. "Wang Zifa, assign someone to guard the gate. You will oversee the mountain gate from now on. If it is damaged again, you will answer to me. The rest of you, to the Grand Hall," commanded Miao Yi, then turned and left, deeming the Town Governor unworthy of a formal welcome. While Wang Zifa would not dare to assign someone like Yan Xiu, a confidant of Cave Lord Miao, to guard duty, he left Shang Youlai on watch. In the Grand Hall, after only a short wait, the portly Town Governor Xu Xinliang arrived at the mountain gate, dismounting courteously and seeking admission from Shang Youlai. No permission was needed; Cave Lord Miao was already aware of their arrival, and Shang Youlai allowed them to pass. The visitors respectfully left their mounts outside, with only the heavily laden carts following Xu Xinliang into the courtyard of the Grand Hall. Sixteen palanquins were set down gently; none dared to be careless, as they contained maids intended for the practitioners' service. A cultivator was traditionally entitled to two maids, a rule that the cultivation world strictly enforced. If every cultivator demanded more, given their elusive abilities, there wouldn't be enough women in the secular world to satisfy them. This would impact the followers and, consequently, the Wish Power. Therefore, restrictions were necessary. Until given permission, no one else was allowed to enter the Grand Hall, save for Xu Xinliang, who wiped the sweat from his brow and climbed the steps, a box held tight in his arms. His concern was not fear of the cultivators but the knowledge that his position was most vulnerable during the transition of the cave's leadership. If the new Cave Lord found him wanting, he could easily be replaced. Inside the Grand Hall, Yan Xiu and others stood at attention. Xu Xinliang, carrying the heavy box, did not dare meet their gaze directly. He knelt and bowed deeply, announcing, "Town Governor Xu Xinliang greets the Cave Lord!" Seated above, Miao Yi smiled, "Governor Xu, it is our destiny to cross paths once more." Xu Xinliang was startled, lifting his gaze to a face he recognized, then realization dawned — this was the immortal who had saved Lady Ji. He had not expected him to become the new Master of Donglai Cave, a leader so youthful in appearance! "Please rise and speak," Miao Yi beckoned with a gesture. Xu Xinliang quickly got to his feet, producing a smaller box from his sleeve and offering it along with the larger one. "Cave Lord Miao, these are tokens of esteem from the citizens of Donglai Town. We hope you will accept our humble offerings." Having previously dealt with Huang Baolong, Miao Yi did not need to inspect the offerings. He subtly nodded to Yan Xiu, who stepped forward to accept the gifts. Chapter 75: Qian'er and Xue'er Cave Lord Miao Yi did not put the Town Governor through any further difficulty. After an exchange that demonstrated the governor's familiarity with Donglai Town's civic matters, Miao Yi encouraged him and then allowed him to depart. There was little shared interest to continue their dialogue. Relieved, Governor Xu, along with his entourage, exited. Miao Yi then instructed Yan Xiu to present the gifts for examination. Indeed, nestled within the small box was a Grain of Rice Pearl, emitting a gentle glow. Miao Yi unhesitatingly secured it within his Storage Bag. The chest contained an impressive sum of five thousand Gold Crystals, the hard-earned sweat and toil of Donglai Town's residents. For Miao Yi, who hailed from humble beginnings, accepting such offerings was somewhat uncomfortable. However, decline was not an option—the well-being of Donglai Cave's many inhabitants depended on the town's faithful. Without keeping any for himself, Miao Yi directed Yan Xiu to distribute a portion of the Gold Crystals—two hundred to every White Lotus Third Rank, one hundred to the Second Rank, and placed the remainder into the Cave's treasury, entrusting Yan Xiu with its care. Yan Xiu, visibly pleased, had never experienced such a trusted role during his time in Gleaming Light Cave. Subsequently, the group left the Grand Hall to assemble in the Square, where sixteen maidens of exceptional allure stood apprehensively in a row, eager for the cultivators to make their choices. Particularly striking were the two at the forefront, standing gracefully, their heads bowed modestly, like bashful blossoms on the cusp of bloom, their freshness and charm captivating. Their only shortcoming was their youth; their figures not yet fully developed, lacking the curves and fullness of mature beauty. Yet, they held a unique charm, perhaps appealing to certain tastes. With Miao Yi leading, the men surveyed the maidens. Miao Yi himself was curious about the attendants Yan Xiu had picked out for him. Yan Xiu beckoned to the two in front, "You two, come here. This is the Cave Lord whom you will serve!" After a brief glance at Yan Xiu and Miao Yi, they cautiously approached, bowed, and greeted him with melodious voices, "Zhao Qian'er, Liu Xue, at your service, Cave Lord Miao Yi!" The other attendants couldn't help but sneak peeks, feeling a tinge of envy. Though all served as attendants to immortals, they understood that serving the master was inherently different from serving others. "Raise your heads," Yan Xiu ordered, allowing Miao Yi to appraise them. He added, "Both are fifteen years old. Zhao Qian'er, slightly the elder, excels in dance. Liu Xue specializes in musical instruments. They both exhibit potential for cultivation. Does Cave Lord Miao Yi approve?" A dancer and a musician? Miao Yi gave Yan Xiu an additional glance. No longer a naive newcomer, he recognized that finding attendants young, beautiful, skilled, and with cultivation potential was no easy feat. Yan Xiu had clearly expended considerable effort. Awaiting a response, Yan Xiu offered, "Should the Cave Lord be unsatisfied, we could seek others." Miao Yi pondered briefly. While any man naturally appreciated beauty, he had vowed not to entertain female company until he had found his two lost brothers. Imagining them possibly in distress while he indulged weighed heavily on him. Nonetheless, he consented, "No replacement is necessary. They will suffice." Having attendants would minimize distractions, facilitating his cultivation. After Miao Yi made his selections, others took their turn, including Shang Youlai, the Mountain Gate Guardian. Once everyone had made their choices, two maidens remained. Yan Xiu directed them to Qiu Shaoqun, stating, "These two will serve Shan Biaoyi." Qiu Shaoqun nodded in acknowledgment. It was then they noticed the absence of two attendants. Puzzled, since Yan Xiu had personally arranged the matter with Donglai Town, Miao Yi inquired, "Where is your attendant?" While the others might not have realized, Miao Yi sensed a momentary wave of melancholy pass through Yan Xiu's eyes. Yan Xiu put on a forced smile and bowed slightly, "Yan Xiu has aged; solitude has become a preferred companion." Wang Zifa and others jovially teased him, "Not at all aged, still fully capable of enjoying life's blossoms." Nan Sisi and Wang Xiuqin also smiled discreetly, their spirits lifted by the day's gains. Yan Xiu, reddening with embarrassment, clasped his hands and sought clemency from the group. Miao Yi was reminded of a woman who could not bear disgrace, took up arms to wash away her humiliation, and was ultimately beheaded... He studied Yan Xiu silently, then turned his gaze away, saying nothing more. He understood Yan Xiu's choice. Miao Yi, once resentful towards Yan Xiu due to Luo Zhen's death, seemed to now comprehend that some scars within a man so accustomed to flattery could never be erased. Qiu Shaoqun, also a former subordinate of Gleaming Light Cave, cast a contemplative look at Yan Xiu but remained silent. After each had taken their attendant, Yan Xiu called two to follow Miao Yi. Black Charcoal, full and dozing at the Rear Palace entrance, casually flicked his tail, enjoying his leisure. Roused by the commotion, he opened one eye, recognized Miao Yi's return, sneezed loudly, and closed his eyes again. In the courtyard, Zhao Qian'er and Liu Xue took in their surroundings, their initial curiosity tinged with apprehension. Miao Yi turned to Yan Xiu, "Since they are new here and unfamiliar with our ways, please assist them in settling in. I'll be taking Zhu Tianbiao for a Territorial Inspection." It was a necessary task for a new Cave Lord to become acquainted with his domain. Hearing of Miao Yi's departure, Black Charcoal's eyes sparkled, and he perked up. Before Miao Yi could exit, Yan Xiu interjected, indicating the girls, "Cave Lord Miao Yi, you have yet to confer upon them their new names." Miao Yi, momentarily puzzled, asked, "Do they not have names already?" Yan Xiu, with a gentle smile, explained, "Those were their former secular names. Now, as your attendants, it is customary for you to give them new names, symbolizing their elevation from the secular world and a new beginning in the path of cultivation. It is our established custom." "I see," said Miao Yi, scratching his head. Naming was not his forte, and after a moment's thought, he decided, "Zhao Qian'er, Liu Xue, henceforth you shall be known as Qian'er and Xue'er!" The names were straightforward, catching Yan Xiu off guard. He nudged the maidens, "Express your gratitude to the Cave Lord for your names." The two maidens promptly bowed, "Qian'er, Xue'er, we are honored by Cave Lord Miao Yi's gracious bestowal of our new names!" Chapter 76: Qin Weiwei in Disarray (Part I) Miao Yi waved his hand dismissively, sparing little concern for the two maids, and entrusted them to Yan Xiu's supervision. He departed with a determined stride, leaving the matters of discipline and order to his trusted subordinate. Outside the Grand Hall, Zhu Tianbiao, having been previously informed, stood ready in a fresh set of clothes. As Miao Yi emerged, Black Charcoal burst forth from behind, its teeth firmly latching onto Miao Yi's robe with a steadfast grip. Zhu Tianbiao's frown deepened at this display, deeming Black Charcoal's conduct somewhat excessive. Here was the Council Hall of Donglai Cave, and yet the beast conducted itself as if in a horse pen, a clear testament to the lax discipline instilled by its master. A few firm lashes might remedy such behavior. But Miao Yi held no inclination to use the whip on Black Charcoal. The beast had not only saved his life but also proved its worth through swiftness and utility, attributes best appreciated by those who had experienced them. He turned, patting Black Charcoal's head, 'I have urgent business to attend to and cannot take you along. Go play in the lake; there are fish and shrimp aplenty for you to feast on.' He gestured toward the expanse of water. Black Charcoal released the cloth from its jaws, shook its head vigorously, sneezed robustly, and galloped into the square, leaving a trail of dust in its wake. Inwardly disapproving of Black Charcoal's indiscipline yet outwardly polite, Zhu Tianbiao offered, 'The Cave Lord's mount exhibits a remarkable level of intelligence, responding to direct speech. Such understanding is rare among our steeds. This is undoubtedly a reflection of the Cave Lord's exemplary training.' Miao Yi chuckled, knowing full well the flattery was both hollow and clumsy. Black Charcoal's antics were not generally endearing, and even Qin Weiwei had once harbored ill feelings towards it. Nonetheless, the rare indulgence in such insincere praise was not entirely unpleasant. At the mountain gate, two spirited horses awaited them, courtesy of the Donglai Town Governor. Preferring subtlety over conspicuousness, Miao Yi chose not to mount a Dragon Steed for the journey into town, as it would draw undue attention and hinder his observations. He was also intent on evaluating Xu Xinliang, the Town Governor's ability to manage. Should Xu prove inadequate, especially in the collection of Wish Power Pearls, it could compromise Miao Yi's position as Cave Lord. In such a case, changes would be necessary, regardless of any gifts or bribes presented. With a signal, Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao set off, the horses breaking into a spirited gallop... Within the secluded confines of the Meditation Chamber atop Zhenhai Mountain, Qin Weiwei concluded her cultivation session. Pressing her palms to her Dantian, a six-petaled lotus flower of light blossomed at her brow, pulsating with life. Her eyes fluttered open to find her maids, Hong Mian and Lu Liu, bowing and beaming, 'Congratulations to the Mountain Lord for advancing yet another rank in cultivation.' Qin Weiwei retracted her spiritual energy and secured the Wish Power Pearl from her mouth. Descending from the stone couch, she offered a modest smile, 'It is but a breakthrough to White Lotus Sixth Rank.' Although she downplayed her achievement, the unmistakable elation on her face spoke volumes. The maids exchanged knowing smiles, assisting her to disrobe. Freed from the constraints of her attire, Qin Weiwei's figure, reminiscent of Mutton Fat Jade, was unveiled within the chamber—a sight that could stir the heart of any onlooker. Her pristine Jade Feet stepped gingerly into the warm waters of the pool. Submerging herself, the water level rose just enough to conceal her bountiful, blushing bosom—an image of pure enticement. Hong Mian and Lu Liu unfurled her hair, and together they began the tender task of cleansing her. As Hong Mian's hands, holding a soft towel, grazed over Qin Weiwei's full chest, she remarked playfully, 'The Mountain Lord's figure is indeed enviable. To forego seeking a companion for dual cultivation is a shame.' 'Indeed,' Lu Liu concurred with a mischievous grin, 'It's akin to hiding away a treasure bestowed by the heavens!' Qin Weiwei's cheeks bloomed with the delicate flush of a peach blossom at the maids' teasing words, and she chided, 'You two impudent girls!' She then playfully splashed water at them in jest. The sounds of mirth reverberated through the steaming sanctum of the cleansing chamber as the maids dodged and pleaded for mercy. Once the frolicking subsided, Hong Mian spoke with a touch of seriousness, 'Mountain Lord, we have a confidential matter to disclose. The Prefecture Head once summoned us to ask about a certain issue.' As Qin Weiwei permitted the maids to towel her dry, her curiosity peaked, 'What did the Prefecture Head inquire about?' Suppressing a giggle, Lu Liu revealed, 'He was curious if you had taken a liking to any man. He instructed us to inform him immediately should there be someone, promising to discreetly make arrangements on your behalf.' Qin Weiwei's cheeks burned with renewed color as she retorted, 'Father has truly lost all sense of propriety! With a myriad of pressing matters to attend to, he wastes his time on such frivolities. Should he inquire again, tell him I have no interest in such matters. I am perfectly content in solitude!' Hong Mian laughed softly, 'We wouldn't dare convey such a message to the Prefecture Head; he might think us the instigators. Perhaps it's best to wait until you find someone to your liking before we report back.' 'I have no intention of seeking!' Qin Weiwei declared firmly, 'What good are men? Not one is worth the trouble.' Glancing about, she added, 'You are better off serving me. Observe how men treat their maids—claiming them as servants, yet ultimately, they all become concubines. The mere thought is repulsive!' Lu Liu discreetly stuck out her tongue, wisely choosing silence over commentary, especially given the implied critique of the Prefecture Head. Hong Mian proposed, 'Perhaps, Mountain Lord, we should be patient. We'll keep watch for a man of appropriate stature who does not consign his maids to the bedchamber.' 'Indecent and shameless! Have you both succumbed to the whims of spring? Perhaps I should send you away to become concubines!' Qin Weiwei's voice carried the chill of a winter breeze as she issued a veiled reproof, before deftly steering the conversation elsewhere, 'Has there been any disturbance outside?' As the discussion turned to weightier matters, Hong Mian's expression grew serious, 'All is calm. The sole item of note is a petition delivered overnight from Donglai Cave. The messenger awaits within the mountain, ready to carry back the Mountain Lord's directive.' 'Donglai Cave? That man has scarcely departed, and already a petition has been submitted. He had better not be taking me lightly,' Qin Weiwei's ire flared at the thought of Miao Yi, and she commanded, 'Bring me the petition.' 'As you wish!' Lu Liu promptly rose, dried off, donned a robe, and hastened away. She returned shortly, presenting the sealed container which held the petition, unsealing it on the spot, and placing it beside the pool. Qin Weiwei let her raven hair drape elegantly over her shoulder, leaning back against the edge, and reached into the box... Why this multitude of petitions? Had the Cave Lord penned a treatise or an ode of considerable length? She extracted a Jade Slip, infusing it with her spiritual energy to peruse its content, and then swiftly moved to the next. Yet, the more she read, the more her expression betrayed confusion and disarray. After reviewing the contents, she doubted her own eyes, hastily re-examining each petition with careful attention. Still unconvinced after the second perusal, she scrutinized each Jade Slip once more, searching for any signs of tampering. Setting the Jade Slip aside, Qin Weiwei's brow furrowed deeply, her eyes flickered with bewilderment and uncertainty, while she muttered to herself, 'What could this man possibly be plotting...' Hong Mian and Lu Liu, cautious not to disrupt the Mountain Lord's official duties, sensed that something was amiss with Qin Weiwei. They couldn't grasp what Cave Lord Miao Yi had written to leave the Mountain Lord so perplexed. Yet, they did not perceive any anger in her demeanor. Exchanging glances, the maids took note of the extensive number of Jade Slip petitions. It appeared that a single submission from Donglai Cave held the collective weight of all the petitions submitted by the Cave Lords of Zhenhai Mountain combined. Chapter 77: Qin Weiwei became disordered (Part 2) After waiting in silence, with Qin Weiwei still deeply immersed in her thoughts and showing no sign of response, Hong Mian tentatively asked, 'Shan Zhu, could there be some trouble at Donglai Cave?' '......' Regaining her senses yet still entangled in her thoughts, Qin Weiwei struggled with what to say. She faintly gestured with her hand, 'Look at this and help me analyze what exactly is happening at Donglai Cave.' Due to their roles as attendants, they would normally not dare to scrutinize such matters without the Shan Zhu's express command. Qin Weiwei's unusual display of confusion had piqued their curiosity. With her permission, they eagerly examined the jade slip. To their astonishment, they too felt their thoughts become disordered after reading its contents. Exchanging glances and scrutinizing the slip multiple times, they shared Qin Weiwei's suspicions, questioning the authenticity of the documents. They checked and double-checked to be certain. The ten petitions were unmistakably inscribed by ten different individuals, each with a unique mana signature. The signature Dharma Seals, as unforgeable as fingerprints, served as irrefutable personal identifiers. Lu Liu, still clutching the jade slip, commented in awe, 'Cave Lord Miao is incredibly formidable! He has managed to subdue the entirety of Donglai Cave in just one night!' Qin Weiwei, deeply engrossed in thought, couldn't suppress an eye roll at the remark. She turned to her attendants and skeptically inquired, 'With his level of cultivation, do you truly deem that possible?' Hong Mian murmured, 'It is indeed exceedingly strange!' Both attendants, having served Qin Weiwei for some time, were well-versed in the affairs of Nanxuan Prefecture. For Prefecture Head Yang Qing, welcoming the Blue Jade Sect into his domain was akin to harboring a wolf in one's home. Initially, Yang Qing harbored no immediate ambitions for rebellion, preferring to accumulate power gradually. But the former Prefecture Head Lu Yu, unwilling to witness Yang Qing's rise, summoned him to serve closely, determined to neutralize his influence. Realizing that closeness to Lu Yu would spell the end of his rise, Yang Qing made a decisive move, allying with the Blue Jade Sect to overthrow Lu Yu and take control of Nanxuan Prefecture. Though Yang Qing and the Blue Jade Sect both benefited from the alliance, they were cognizant of the implications. The Blue Jade Sect recognized that Yang Qing was not one to be content in subordination and would inevitably seek to curtail their influence over Nanxuan. Yang Qing, on the other hand, was aware that the Blue Jade Sect's current hesitation was only a front; they would surely scheme to replace him once they established firm ties through this incursion. Yang Qing's daring rebellion was bolstered by the network he had cultivated within the system, with allies near the Fa Wang interceding on his behalf. Without the Fa Wang's endorsement, even if Yang Qing laid claim to Nanxuan, it would not be recognized, and he could potentially be accused of rebellion. The Blue Jade Sect's cautiousness stemmed from their lack of influential connections, which made them wary of confronting the formidable systemic power. Should they secure such ties, the Blue Jade Sect's adherents in Nanxuan Prefecture would outnumber Yang Qing's, posing a significant threat to his position. Both parties understood that their cooperation was provisional. In perhaps fifty years, their alliance might dissolve, and either the east or the west wind would prevail. Due to Yang Qing's shortage of allies, while key positions in Nanxuan Prefecture were held by his supporters, the Blue Jade Sect occupied nearly all other significant roles. Zhenhai Mountain faced a similar predicament; Qin Weiwei coped with the Blue Jade Sect disciples' facade of obedience and their covert defiance. Nevertheless, as Yang Qing's goddaughter, Qin Weiwei's direct subordinates from the Blue Jade Sect did not dare challenge her openly, showing some deference to Yang Qing. However, the Cave Lords under Qin Weiwei lacked this advantage. The petitions from nine Cave Lords were filled with grievances about the Blue Jade Sect disciples' duplicity, making their positions increasingly untenable. One Cave Lord, the weakest among them, sent the only beacon of good news. A White Lotus First Rank Cave Lord had executed a Blue Jade Sect disciple with White Lotus Third Rank cultivation. This could have been the catalyst for a conflict between the Blue Jade Sect and Yang Qing. Instead, the Blue Jade Sect collectively vilified Song Fu, asserting his fate was justified, listing his heinous actions, and unifying in condemnation and full support of the Cave Lord's actions, leaving the Blue Jade Sect little room for objection. Upon receiving this news, Qin Weiwei was not elated but filled with questions. How had that scoundrel, newly arrived, so swiftly taken control of Donglai Cave? And with Blue Jade Sect disciples staunchly rallying behind the formidable Cave Lord Miao... Was this not farcical? It was stomach-turning. What did this signify? Was it a slap to the nine Cave Lords, or to Qin Weiwei herself, the Shan Zhu? Were they all less capable than Cave Lord Miao? Was her initial reluctance to send Miao to assume the role of Donglai's Cave Lord misguided? Yet, if it were all a farce, how could the credibility of these testimonies be doubted? Was Song Fu truly that detestable? How odious must one be to unite all disciples of the Blue Jade Sect against him? Qin Weiwei shook her head slightly, finding the notion implausible. Even if Song Fu were that reprehensible, it seemed unlikely that all Blue Jade Sect disciples would issue petitions condemning him and pledging allegiance to the mighty Cave Lord Miao. The man had just arrived, and with such modest cultivation, from whence did he derive such immense influence? If anyone suggested that his mere presence commanded enough sway to convince them, Qin Weiwei would outright dismiss such a notion. Hong Mian and Lu Liu also furrowed their brows, equally perplexed by the unfolding events. 'No more bathing, help me get dressed, and summon that messenger!' Qin Weiwei ordered as she rose from the water and stepped onto the shore. Casting a spell, a mist of Mutton Fat Jade erupted, evaporating the water droplets on her skin. The attendants quickly clothed her and styled her hair into a bun, secured by six snow-white jade hairpins fashioned into butterflies. In the grand hall of Zhenhai Mountain, Shan Zhu Qin Weiwei sat with an air of imposing authority. Shan Biaoyi, standing below, felt his heart race with each of Qin Weiwei's questions. Despite her persistent probing, he insisted that Song Fu's insubordination led to the gate's destruction and his subsequent disrespect warranted his slaying by the Cave Lord as a just punishment and to serve as a deterrence. Qin Weiwei had little reason to question Miao Yi's ability to slay a White Lotus Third Rank cultivator. The clash at Gleaming Light Cave and Miao Yi's triumph over a Ghost Cultivator, with two White Lotus Third Rank cultivators perishing, made it plausible that Miao Yi could eliminate Song Fu. Nevertheless, she was no simpleton. Could it really be so straightforward to align all of Donglai Cave's Blue Jade Sect disciples behind Miao Yi and absolve him of any wrongdoing? 'Shan Biaoyi, are you absolutely certain there is nothing you are concealing from me?' Qin Weiwei's piercing gaze locked onto the man below as she uttered a cold rebuke. Those at the lower rungs were often oblivious to the power plays at the highest levels. Shan Biaoyi knew of his direct involvement in the demise of Song Fu. Admitting as much would not only alienate him from Donglai Cave but also provoke the Blue Jade Sect's vengeance, and risk forfeiting the opportunity to amass a bounty of Wish Power Pearls. As such, he adamantly clung to his narrative, leaving Qin Weiwei feeling somewhat helpless and leading her to suspect that Donglai Cave might truly have been united into a solid front overnight by that man. It seemed implausible to believe that the man had simply chanced upon a cohort of fiercely loyal supporters by mere good fortune. Such a tale was more fitting of a children's fable than the reality she faced. Chapter 78: Qin Weiwei's Disturbance (Part Three) 'You may leave us,' Qin Weiwei ordered coldly, sending Shan Biaoyi away. After his departure, Hong Mian cautiously ventured, 'Mountain Lord, should we make the Prefecture Head aware of this situation?' 'How can I report anything when the full picture is still so murky?' Qin Weiwei retorted, her head shaking in disapproval. She promptly instructed Lu Liu to bring forth a disciple from the Blue Jade Sect at random. Before long, a Blue Jade Sect disciple made his appearance, bowing before Qin Weiwei. 'Do you recognize your sect brother, Song Fu?' she inquired. 'Song Fu?' The disciple looked befuddled, unaware of the events that had unfolded, yet he affirmed, 'Yes, I am acquainted with him.' 'What can you tell me of his character?' Qin Weiwei pressed. The disciple, caught unawares by the line of questioning, respectfully responded, 'Brother Song is known for his honesty and simplicity, and he holds our teachings in high esteem. There is nothing to fault in his character.' Irrespective of the circumstances surrounding Song Fu or their personal rapport, it was imperative to endorse a fellow sect member when questioned by outsiders. In uncertain times, commending one's comrade was undeniably the correct approach. Upon the disciple's dismissal, Qin Weiwei, indicating the retreating figure, remarked to Hong Mian and Lu Liu, 'Did you witness that? That is how sect brothers should speak of one another, unlike the absurdity we've heard from Donglai Cave's ranks!' 'What do you intend to do, Mountain Lord?' Hong Mian inquired. Qin Weiwei stood, her intent clear. 'Seeing is believing. I will personally journey to Donglai Cave to ascertain whether they truly revere our 'illustrious' Cave Lord Miao as they profess. Should he dare cause any trouble or disrupt our plans, he will face my fury.' 'And if their allegiance is indeed sincere?' Lu Liu questioned. Qin Weiwei asserted with conviction, 'That's inconceivable. There is certainly some subterfuge at play. Were their loyalty genuine, I'd willingly relinquish my title as Mountain Lord to him. If he truly possesses such prowess, let him resolve the situation with the Blue Jade Sect disciples at Zhenhai Mountain and thus alleviate some of the Prefecture Head's burdens.' Hong Mian and Lu Liu exchanged a knowing glance, recognizing their Mountain Lord's exaggeration. However, arriving to inspect Donglai Cave so shortly after Miao Yi's appointment seemed somewhat impetuous... Having finally received a response, Shan Biaoyi was en route back to Donglai Cave. But his heart was fraught with anxiety, as Qin Weiwei, along with her attendants, had resolved to accompany him. The Cave Lord had barely taken office, and already the Mountain Lord was on her way. Shan Biaoyi sighed inwardly, silently praying for a flawless visit, hopeful that the Cave Lord had managed everything without a hitch. Once on board a ship of scoundrels, disembarking is rarely an option. Despite the vessel being riddled with leaks, those aboard must collaborate, rowing vigorously to stay afloat. To cease rowing is to succumb; to row is to cling to a sliver of hope. Ignorant of the intricate dynamics between Yang Qing and the Blue Jade Sect, Miao Yi, like many of his low-ranking peers, faced a common challenge. His recent pledge of loyalty to Yang Qing had not granted him much insight into the secretive workings of power. As the rightful Cave Lord of Donglai, Miao Yi expected absolute obedience. Immediate action against any defiance was not only his right but his obligation. Securing Donglai Cave firmly within his grasp was crucial; without such control, his tenure as Cave Lord would be rendered insignificant. Unaware of the upper echelons' trepidation over his swift and decisive takeover of Donglai Cave, Miao Yi relished the bliss of ignorance, sparing himself undue concern for the time being. Meanwhile, Miao Yi roamed the streets of Donglai Town, garbed in his finest. Zhu Tianbiao, the reticent sentinel, rarely initiated conversation. His attempts at flattery were clumsy at best, and he often remained silent, trailing Miao Yi with a sword at the ready, the very image of a faithful guardian. Miao Yi had intentionally brought Zhu Tianbiao along for his protection, as the company of a White Lotus Third Rank cultivator offered significant defense against potential threats. As they passed a pavilion adorned in red, they observed a large crowd. A noble family's young maiden was engaged in the traditional ritual of throwing the embroidered ball—a matchmaking event that momentarily captured Miao Yi's and Zhu Tianbiao's attention, though they chose not to stay. The maiden, shy yet eager, held the embroidered ball tightly, her eyes scouring the crowd for an ideal match. Her gaze swiftly settled on Miao Yi. His rise to Cave Lord at such a young age, along with the inherent vibrancy of a cultivator, distinguished him from the common folk. The guardian standing behind him clearly signaled his status. With determination, the maiden launched the embroidered ball towards Miao Yi. Her throw was robust and accurate, indicating she might have practiced for this exact moment—for attracting an unsuitable suitor would be quite the predicament. As the ball soared, the crowd stretched out their hands eagerly, only to watch it sail past them. Without sparing a glance, Miao Yi flicked his wrist, and the ball was sent flying back to the pavilion. Zhu Tianbiao glanced sideways and continued to accompany Miao Yi, passing the astounded crowd without a word. The maiden, clutching the returned ball, stood in disbelief. As she watched the two men depart without a care, she gnawed her lip in vexation. For a woman of her standing, such an event was unprecedented—the ball she had cast out being returned to her was unheard of. Beneath the pavilion, the crowd was flabbergasted, stretching on tiptoes to follow the retreating figures. They then turned to each other, erupting in urging cheers, 'Miss, throw again, throw again...' The maiden, her lip bitten in indignation, vanished from view into the pavilion... Within Donglai Town, a tranquil river cut across the landscape. After Zhu Tianbiao had inquired about the fare, both he and Miao Yi stepped onto a black-canopied boat moored at the bank. The boatman commenced rowing, guiding them along the river's gentle current. Miao Yi stood poised at the prow, hands clasped behind him, while Zhu Tianbiao, ever vigilant, stood at the stern with his sword at the ready. They hadn't traveled far when the rhythmic beat of hooves resounded from the riverbank. Glancing back, they spotted the maiden who had thrown the embroidered ball, now flanked by several stalwart men, hot on their trail. 'Halt!' she bellowed, gesturing at Miao Yi at the bow. Surveying his surroundings, Miao Yi subtly displayed the mystical lotus mirage on his forehead, aiming to discourage her from pursuing further. Yet, the maiden continued her chase, undeterred by the threat of immortals. Miao Yi then realized his oversight—he had applied spirit-concealing mud to his forehead, masking the mirage. His penchant for using the mud to hide his lower cultivation level had now backfired. As Cave Lord, the prospect of being ridiculed was intolerable, so he opted to conceal the hallmark of his spiritual prowess. With no other recourse, he covertly signaled Zhu Tianbiao. Zhu Tianbiao turned sharply, exposing the lotus mirage on his own forehead. The sight stunned the maiden and her entourage, arresting them in their pursuit and silencing their audacity. The maiden's fanciful dreams of spring promptly dissipated as she realized the reason for his indifference. She sensed the vast chasm between them and bit her lip in a silent admission of defeat... For Miao Yi, however, this was but a minor diversion. Chapter 79: Qin Weiwei's Disarray (Part 4) Willows draped green along the riverbanks, where women could occasionally be seen squatting at the water's edge, laundering clothes and rinsing vegetables. Brothels lined the way, with courtesans leaning on railings, waving handkerchiefs and calling out in sweet, coquettish voices to lure travelers passing by on the boats. Further on, where the river ran green, groups of young noblemen composed poems, hoping to draw the attention of maidens strolling in clusters, who cast shy glances towards the noble figures standing proudly at the bows of the black-canopied boats. On the flower boats that glided close by, heavily made-up madams called out loudly to the gentlemen on the boats, inviting them to come aboard and partake in the revelry of the floral wines. Above in the taverns, rowdy patrons called out to their friends, trading punches in jest and drinking heartily together. The riverbank was alive with the hustle and bustle of merchants and porters, while children chased one another, lost in their games. Living by the water is human instinct; the journey by boat revealed the full splendor of Donglai Town. Although the inhabitants must dedicate three hours each day to generating Wish Power and pay their taxes, they receive the protection of the cultivators in return, who ward off demons and evil spirits, safeguarding peace for all. The Six Saints of Heaven and Earth, too, rely on the collective effort of cultivators in all regions to amass vast amounts of Wish Power—without them, even their vast powers would be insufficient to cover such an expanse. It is the presence of these cultivators that ensures the local nobility and powers-that-be dare not overly oppress their followers, lest they disrupt the collection of Wish Power Pearls and invoke the ire of the cultivators first and foremost. While cultivators may not often show themselves openly, they nonetheless firmly establish the order of this world. Of course, not everyone living along the riverbank is bound to the same daily toil of generating Wish Power. Those with power and influence can outsource their tasks to places like 'Ciyuan Manor' or even hire others to fulfill their duties. And so, those who toil continue to toil, and those who indulge continue their indulgences—the immutable law of life. Regardless, for Miao Yi, standing at the prow of the boat surveying his domain, the sight of his followers living harmoniously eased his concerns about the annual contribution of Wish Power Pearls... As darkness fell, Shan Biaoyi rode his Longju under the moon and stars, his heart filled with anxiety. Drawing near to Donglai Cave, he pressed on with determination, slightly trailing behind Qin Weiwei, and respectfully addressed her, 'Mountain Lord, I shall immediately notify the residence to prepare for your arrival and welcome the Mountain Lord's Dharma Chariot.' His true aim was to alert the Cave Lord and the others, to mentally prepare them for what was to come. Qin Weiwei looked back at him with a piercing glance, her eyes icy as the winter moon, and replied curtly, 'No need.' Then she turned to the cultivators following her in swift pursuit, 'Keep a watch on him, ensure he sends no messages. I wish to see for myself what tricks Donglai Cave is up to!' Shan Biaoyi's heart skipped a beat as two 白莲三品修士 (White Lotus Third Rank cultivators) quickly closed in on him, trapping him in their midst. The party of five, under the silver light of the moon, raced toward the 山门 (Mountain Gate) of Donglai Cave with the speed of lightning. 商又来 (Shang Youlai), the guardian of the gate, emerged abruptly from the shadows, 提枪 (ti qiang) in hand, and bellowed a command, 'Halt and dismount!' His voice echoed, serving as a warning to the others within the dwelling. At the signal, figures from different corners of the estate appeared instantly, speeding toward 'Sleeping Dragon Valley.' Six silhouettes, weapons in hand, rode their Longju at breakneck speed to face the unexpected. Mountain Lord Qin Weiwei was not one to break protocol by storming the 山门 (Mountain Gate); she signaled her followers to halt. They reined in their mounts abruptly before the gate, narrowly avoiding being thrown off. Across the gate, another six fierce Longju approached with an air of menace. Qin Weiwei was somewhat surprised by Donglai Cave's swift response; their efficiency was not ordinary. For Miao Yi had made it clear—if the 山门 (Mountain Gate) were to be smashed again, it would be Wang Zifa who would answer for it. Furthermore, Miao Yi had warned that those who disobeyed would not receive a single Wish Power Pearl and would face expulsion. Where else could they find such favorable treatment in any other cave dwelling? Everyone was keen to do their utmost, lest they invite Miao Yi's questioning. Upon recognizing Mountain Lord Qin Weiwei, the gatekeeper 商又来 (Shang Youlai) immediately fell silent and saluted with a fist. 阎修 (Yan Xiu) and the others, who had rushed to the scene in anticipation of trouble, exchanged looks and quickly dismounted, advancing to the gate to offer their respectful greetings. Some glanced questioningly at Shan Biaoyi, who had accompanied Qin Weiwei, wondering why he hadn't signaled the Mountain Lord's approach in advance. Whispers and secret messages were exchanged among them, seeking to understand the situation. But Shan Biaoyi was in a predicament; the two cultivators at his side had prepared to thwart any attempts at communication, casting spells to disrupt his efforts. Qin Weiwei glanced at the 牌坊 (Gateway Arch) and snorted with disdain, 'This archway stands even more majestic than that of Nanxuan Prefecture!' The crowd caught the hint of disdain in her voice and were unsure of how to respond. After sweeping her gaze across the assembly, Qin Weiwei led her entourage into the cave, striding directly toward the 大殿 (Grand Hall) where she dismounted authoritatively. Shan Biaoyi was led in tow, entering the Grand Hall behind Qin Weiwei. Finding the Grand Hall deserted, Qin Weiwei proceeded to the rear courtyard where the Cave Lord resided. There, 黑炭 (Black Charcoal) lay sprawled by the doorway, idly swishing his tail against the ground. At the sight of Qin Weiwei, he shot up, eyes wide with alarm, seemingly unsure where to hide. With no other option, Black Charcoal leaped dozens of meters high, landing beyond the boundaries of the residence, and swiftly made his escape. That beast! Qin Weiwei was a mix of annoyance and amusement. Was she truly so terrifying? She might not be fond of Black Charcoal, but she was above resorting to petty vengeance by storming into a subordinate's home at night to slaughter their mount. Such a spiteful act would disgrace her, and she would not allow herself to be seen in such a light. Miao Yi was nowhere to be found outside, so Qin Weiwei boldly entered his private chambers unannounced, searching thoroughly but finding no trace. Emerging from the chambers, she noticed a side room lit from within. She marched over and, with a forceful kick, the door burst open. Inside, two beautiful maids, scantily clad, screamed in fright, clinging to each other, trembling before the intruding figure of Qin Weiwei. It was clear that these maids, who lived in the Cave Lord's private quarters, were Miao Yi's attendants. Qin Weiwei glanced at her own attendant, 红棉 (Hong Mian), with a look that carried a mocking edge—as if to comment on the predictable behavior of men. Hong Mian remained silent, her smile the only response. This time, she was the only one to accompany Qin Weiwei; 绿柳 (Lu Liu) had not come. After failing to find Miao Yi, Qin Weiwei fixed a cold stare on the two trembling maidservants and demanded, 'Where has your Cave Lord gone?' The maids remained silent, shaking their heads. With a contemptuous 'hmph,' Qin Weiwei did not bother to argue with the maids any further. She left the room and returned to the 大殿 (Grand Hall), ascending to the high seat that belonged to Miao Yi. Overlooking the entrance, she called out with authority, '阎修 (Yan Xiu)!' Yan Xiu, who had been standing among the crowd outside, rushed into the hall, bowing and scraping. Chapter 80: Drag Out and Behead Qin Weiwei inquired, 'Where has Miao Yi gone?' Yan Xiu, with a forced smile, responded, 'The Cave Lord is out inspecting the territories under his domain.' Qin Weiwei paused, surprised at how swiftly Miao Yi felt secure enough to delegate the cave's affairs and venture out. She probed further, 'When will he return?' 'That...' Yan Xiu faltered, 'I am not privy to the Cave Lord's schedule of return.' Qin Weiwei let out a cold snort, 'Then summon him back at once.' Yan Xiu's heart sank; the vastness of Donglai Cave's territory made the task daunting. He dared not voice his concern fully, yet the implication was clear. Qin Weiwei, realizing the undue hardship, refrained from persisting. Instead, she started interrogating individuals about the execution of Song Fu and the subsequent petitions of condemnation. 'Has Miao Yi coerced you in any manner?' 'Why would the Mountain Lord insinuate such? The Cave Lord has not resorted to threats. Song Fu's insolence was beyond tolerance; even as fellow sect members, we could no longer stand idly by...' Efforts to muzzle Shan Biaoyi proved futile; no matter how slyly Qin Weiwei inquired or how she threatened or tempted, the uniform response was of censure for Song Fu's faults and staunch support for the distinguished Cave Lord Miao Yi. This left Qin Weiwei gritting her teeth in vexation. If only all of Zhenhai Mountain were as united as Donglai Cave. Alas, Donglai stood alone in this regard. Something was clearly amiss, yet whether it was her own appointees like Yan Xiu or those from the Blue Jade Sect, all stood as one, tight-lipped and unyielding. Qin Weiwei resolved to settle accounts with Miao Yi upon his return. Yet, three days elapsed with no sign of Miao Yi, casting doubt on when he might return. The most irksome matter for her was the flawless order maintained in Donglai Cave, even without the Cave Lord's presence. While other Cave Lords lamented Blue Jade Sect disciples shunning gate-guarding and menial tasks, such complaints were non-existent in Donglai Cave. There, it was Miao Yi's loyal aides like Yan Xiu who were relieved from these duties, with Blue Jade Sect disciples fulfilling their obligations with zeal. Furthermore, Wang Zifa and others exhibited considerable deference towards Yan Xiu, indicative of their esteem for the formidable Cave Lord Miao. Consider the authority Miao Yi wielded; he had, in a single night, brought Donglai Cave to order, commanding high regard from his subordinates. Her own appointees grappled with their charges, incessantly presenting grievances, while Miao Yi, whom she had reluctantly appointed, managed everything impeccably. Was this not a rebuke to her own authority? Qin Weiwei, stewing in silent contemplation, nearly choked on the bitterness of her frustration. Was she misjudging Miao Yi with undue suspicion? In these times of strife, she could not linger indefinitely, and the whereabouts of Miao Yi remained a mystery. After a three-day vigil, she departed, taking Shan Biaoyi with her. The sight of Yan Xiu and the rest, their expressions fraught with anxiety as they bade farewell at the mountain gate, attested to the severity of the situation. Everyone was cognizant that if Shan Biaoyi crumbled and disclosed everything, the repercussions would extend beyond the acquisition of Wish Power Pearls from Cave Lord Miao. The ire of the Blue Jade Sect would be unavoidable. Yan Xiu and his comrades had slain a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect. And the Blue Jade Sect disciples had, in essence, committed treason. Amidst the current tumult, they were beset with fear and regret, cursing the day they had joined this ill-fated venture. Despite Qin Weiwei's lucrative overtures, they dared not desert, remaining steadfast with the sinking ship they had so unwisely embarked upon. Qin Weiwei, discerning the unease in their expressions, solidified her conviction that there was a conspiracy afoot. Attendant Hong Mian, observing her master's intense scrutiny, could barely suppress a smirk, realizing that regardless of any underlying machinations, the unity demonstrated was a clear affirmation of Cave Lord Miao Yi's leadership. It came as no surprise that he confidently left the cave's operations to others and roamed freely. If other Cave Lords possessed such capability, the governance of Zhenhai Mountain would be much less challenging. She wondered if the Mountain Lord's vow to relinquish her position to Cave Lord Miao Yi, should he genuinely secure the fealty of his subordinates, was uttered in earnest... Qin Weiwei, catching her attendant's inquisitive gaze, gave her a sharp look—were her impulsive words to be taken literally? Qin Weiwei, having rushed back to Zhenhai Mountain, wasted no time upon her return. After addressing pressing affairs, she proceeded with Shan Biaoyi to Nanxuan Prefecture. Miao Yi, whom she had appointed as the Cave Lord of Donglai Cave, appeared to have courted trouble. Concealment was futile; the incident was destined to come to light. Regardless of the Blue Jade Sect's reaction, they were bound to make inquiries. Qin Weiwei felt compelled to report the details personally, to keep Yang Qing abreast of the situation. Learning of their impending visit to Nanxuan Prefecture, Shan Biaoyi's anxiety intensified. Was the matter escalating unnecessarily? Those at the lower rungs were blind to the high-stakes chess game played by their superiors—the complex power struggles at play. Had they been apprised, they might have hesitated before acting so audaciously. Upon arriving at Nanxuan Prefecture, Qin Weiwei's status afforded her immediate audience with Yang Qing. Following Attendant Qingju, she ascended to the pavilion atop the highest peak of the rear mountain, finding Yang Qing deep in meditation. 'Qin Weiwei pays respects to the Prefecture Head!' Clad in a robe as white as snow, Qin Weiwei offered her salutations. In the presence of others, Qin Weiwei always adhered to the formalities due her superior, Yang Qing. Only in the most private moments would she address him as 'Father'. Yang Qing gently concluded his meditation, and as he opened his eyes, he expelled a Wish Power Pearl the size of a quail egg. He greeted her with a smile, 'Weiwei, what brings you here?' He arose and seated himself beside the tea table, gesturing for her to sit, 'What matters are at hand?' Qin Weiwei took her place opposite him, 'Prefecture Head, I fear the Cave Lord of Donglai Cave you personally selected may have caused you some trouble.' Yang Qing emitted a soft 'oh', his brow creasing slightly, 'Miao Yi? What trouble has he now stirred?' 'Prefecture Head, please review these documents.' Qin Weiwei presented the box containing the petitions before him. Yang Qing perused the contents, momentarily unsettled. Under the watchful eyes of Attendants Qingmei and Qingju, who exchanged knowing glances, Yang Qing meticulously re-examined each jade slip. A man of composure, his reaction was more subdued than Qin Weiwei's initial shock; he inquired with mild intrigue, 'Weiwei, what exactly is this about?' 'I am as perplexed as you. To verify the matter, I journeyed to Donglai Cave, only to discover that Miao Yi had departed on an inspection of his territory...' Qin Weiwei recounted the situation in detail. Yang Qing, fingers rhythmically tapping on the tabletop, mused for an extended period. Shaking his head, he found himself at an impasse, ultimately declaring, 'Bring forth the one you've brought. I shall question him myself.' Shan Biaoyi was promptly summoned. Now face-to-face with Yang Qing, a man of great stature, and burdened by his own secrets, he was overcome by trepidation. Nevertheless, he achieved one thing: regardless of how Yang Qing inquired, he repeated his established narrative. Yang Qing did not engage in roundabout questioning as Qin Weiwei had. Standing, he advanced slowly to the pavilion's railing, surveying the distant mountains, his hands casually clasped behind him, his expression serene, his voice firm, 'Take him away for execution.' Attendants Qingmei and Qingju sprang into action, swiftly securing Shan Biaoyi's shoulders, immobilizing him, and without delay, they dragged him away to meet his end. Chapter Eighty-One: The Admission This was no laughing matter. With Qingmei and Qingju both possessing the cultivation of White Lotus Seventh Rank (Bai Lian Qi Pin), they easily subdued Shan Biaoyi, whose inferior White Lotus Second Rank (Bai Lian Er Pin) afforded him no chance of resistance. He was apprehended so swiftly that he barely had time to react. Qin Weiwei spared only a brief glance for the dragged-away Shan Biaoyi. Miao Yi was Yang Qing's chosen appointee, and she had to acknowledge this, if not for Miao Yi's sake, then for Yang Qing's. It wouldn't do to execute one of Miao Yi's men without clear evidence, although Yang Qing had the authority to do so without facing any consequences. Caught off guard, Shan Biaoyi only started to comprehend his plight when he was already being dragged out of the pavilion, fear clawing at his very soul. He knew Yang Qing was likely trying to frighten him into spilling the truth. Yet he also knew that Yang Qing's word was final. If he couldn't satisfy Yang Qing with his answers, his life was as good as forfeit. For Yang Qing, eliminating him would be of little significance. "Prefecture Head, I have sinned, I will confess, please give me another opportunity, Prefecture Head, I'll speak..." Shan Biaoyi's cries and pleas for mercy echoed as he was pulled outside the pavilion, his face deathly pale. Yang Qing, who had been gazing at the distant mountain ridges, did not turn to face him but simply raised a hand in a quiet gesture. Qingmei and Qingju exchanged looks and released Shan Biaoyi. A dread-filled Shan Biaoyi stumbled into the pavilion, falling to his knees behind Yang Qing. "Prefecture Head, I will tell everything!" Without turning, Yang Qing's voice was calm yet carried the weight of authority. "Why did the Blue Jade Sect collectively accuse Song Fu?" "It was under the coercion of... the Master of Donglai Cave, Miao Yi!" Shan Biaoyi managed to get the words out, his expression filled with remorse. He worried that if Miao Yi remained as the Master of Donglai Cave after this, there'd be no place for him there. Qingmei and Qingju listened intently, while Qin Weiwei's gaze flickered, perhaps on the verge of unraveling the mystery. Anyone could guess that the Blue Jade Sect must have been pressured. The only question was what methods Miao Yi had used. "Explain everything, from start to finish," commanded Yang Qing, his voice as unruffled as a serene lake yet resonating with unspoken power. Knowing full well that any inconsistency in his story would spell his doom, Shan Biaoyi recounted the events, his voice heavy with the gravity of his situation. "To the Prefecture Head, it truly was the Blue Jade Sect who first acted without respect. Before Master Miao took over Donglai Cave, the Blue Jade Sect disciples openly defied the acting manager's orders and were confrontational at every turn. Despite their overwhelming numbers, we were at a loss. On the day Master Miao assumed his position, upon reaching the gates of Donglai Cave and finding them unattended, he let out a thunderous outcry..." Shan Biaoyi laid out the details with painstaking precision. From Yan Xiu and the others arriving at the gates after hearing the commotion to Miao Yi's scathing rebuke for the unguarded state of the esteemed Donglai Cave's entrance, and Yan Xiu's grievances about the Blue Jade Sect's misconduct. The Blue Jade Sect, with Song Fu leading them, arrived late and had the audacity to belittle Miao Yi. At this point, Yang Qing, still facing away from the crowd, narrowed his eyes, a cold gleam passing through. Miao Yi was his chosen envoy, and his brazen stance made it clear how the Blue Jade Sect would treat his other appointees. "What did your Cave Lord do in response?" Yang Qing asked, his tone deceptively mild. "Without a moment's delay, the Master of Donglai Cave ordered his subordinates to immediately proceed to Zhenhai Mountain and inform the Mountain Lord that the Blue Jade Sect had rebelled," replied Shan Biaoyi. "This shocked the Blue Jade Sect disciples, who then reluctantly greeted Master Miao. But Master Miao did not reciprocate their civility, immediately commanding Song Fu, of White Lotus Third Rank (Bai Lian San Pin), to guard the gate. Ignoring Song Fu's willingness, he drove his Dragon Steed (Long Ju) straight at them!" Yang Qing, who stood with clasped hands behind his back, allowed a faint smile to curl the corner of his lips. He could almost see Miao Yi's defiant and aggressive demeanor, not giving an inch and completely disregarding the Blue Jade Sect's disciples. This was exactly how he envisioned his own appointee to behave, a true source of pride. "And how did it come to pass that Song Fu was killed?" inquired Yang Qing. "In truth, it was not the Master of Donglai Cave who killed Song Fu, but rather myself, Yan Xiu, and Qiu Shaoqun, acting together..." Having already divulged so much, Shan Biaoyi did not see the point in withholding any further details. He narrated how Miao Yi had called them together, anticipated Song Fu's disobedience, and ordered Qiu Shaoqun to secretly destroy their own mountain gate to create a pretext for confronting Song Fu. Though they realized the gravity of the act, Miao Yi was adamant about making an example of Song Fu. Afterward, when Qiu Shaoqun shattered the gate, causing an uproar, Miao Yi took the opportunity to rage forth. While organizing a search for the enemy and dispersing the Blue Jade Sect disciples, he summoned Song Fu to the Donglai Grand Hall for questioning. Song Fu refused to admit any guilt, but the already concealed Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun, at Miao Yi's command, converged and cut down Song Fu inside the grand hall. Miao Yi then exerted pressure on the Blue Jade Sect disciples, forcing them to draft a petition under duress and to reconstruct the mountain gate overnight. They later banded together in a superficial effort to appease Qin Weiwei's subsequent inquiries, all of which Shan Biaoyi disclosed in full detail. After concluding, Shan Biaoyi bowed his head and said, "That is the entirety of the events." Qingmei and Qingju looked at each other, realizing they had underestimated the Master of Donglai Cave. Classifying him as endowed with both intellect and valor seemed an understatement. Within mere hours of his arrival, he had managed to bring the entire Donglai Cave under his control with decisive actions—a truly remarkable feat. Qin Weiwei bit her lip gently, the enigma now unraveled. She felt a pang of regret for having unearthed the truth, as it only served to highlight the young man's bravado, portraying him as the sole capable individual in all of Zhenhai Mountain, which irked her immensely. Yang Qing, who had been meditating with closed eyes, turned around to face the kneeling Shan Biaoyi. "Rise," he said simply. "Thank you, Master!" Shan Biaoyi stood, his face a mixture of relief and apprehension, wondering what lay ahead for him. Surprisingly, Yang Qing did not further torment him but offered, "Let not a word of today's conversation reach the ears of outsiders. Act as if this never happened. No one will hold you to account. Should any issue arise in Donglai Cave from now on, I grant you the privilege to report directly and covertly to the Mountain Lord of Zhenhai Mountain. Do you understand what I'm saying?" Shan Biaoyi, initially stunned, quickly lit up with joy, understanding Yang Qing's intent. He was being reassured that his confession would remain a secret, and he was now personally appointed as an informant within Donglai Cave—a sign that he had caught Yang Qing's favorable eye. Unexpectedly, what seemed like a dire situation had turned into a stroke of good fortune. "I understand and will obey," Shan Biaoyi replied with joy, clasping his hands in salute. The shock, fear, and subsequent relief were so intense they almost overwhelmed him; the reversal of his fortune was almost too much to grasp. Chapter 82: The Insightful Cave Lord 'Reward him!' Yang Qing commanded with a smile and an affirming nod. Qian'er quickly produced a softly luminescent Wish Power Pearl from her Storage Bag, presenting it to Shan Biaoyi. 'This humble one thanks the Cave Lord for his generous gift!' An overjoyed Shan Biaoyi bowed repeatedly in gratitude. 'You may leave,' Yang Qing dismissed with a casual wave. As Shan Biaoyi made his way down the mountain, Yang Qing chuckled and shook his head, 'To think he'd start his tenure by clandestinely smashing his own Mountain Gate, such audacity. His strategic acumen and valor mark him as an asset. As a Mountain Lord, he could relieve many of my concerns. His cultivation level is a bit low, though; being a Cave Lord is a stretch, let alone a higher position. I had placed him, a White Lotus First Rank, no less, in charge of Donglai Cave to test the waters in Nanxuan Prefecture, to see if my words carry weight, not out of whim. I wanted to identify any dissenters. Initially, I was apprehensive about entrusting Donglai Cave to him, worried if it was the right decision. But now, it appears the lad has quite the aptitude; my worries were unfounded.' Qian'er and Xue'er exchanged glances, recognizing Yang Qing's growing appreciation for Miao Yi. They knew he would be called upon again when the time was right and understood the need to treat Cave Lord Miao with due respect from now on. Meanwhile, Qin Weiwei's lips curled with a hint of annoyance. Yang Qing, still wearing a grin, playfully prodded her, 'Weiwei, the Donglai Cave Lord I handpicked for you didn't disappoint, did he?' He was fully aware of the friction between his daughter and Miao Yi. Qin Weiwei, clearly irritated, approached him and retorted, 'He seems to be enjoying himself now, but I'm curious if he'll remain so carefree when it's time to deliver those Wish Power Pearls he promised to his followers!' Yang Qing burst into hearty laughter, shaking his head, 'Oh, Weiwei! The man I've chosen for you, you find him so disagreeable? It was merely the loss of your mount; you're fixating too much. Consider this: his subordinates are all compromised, having even betrayed their own sect for him. If he reneges on his promises later, do you really think they'd dare to confront him?' Qin Weiwei fell silent, the realization dawning on her. Settling back into his chair, Yang Qing lamented, 'If only Nanxuan Prefecture had more like him, the Blue Jade Sect wouldn't stand a chance, and our affairs would be much easier to manage.' Qin Weiwei frowned, 'Prefecture Head, after this ordeal, don't you find his scheming too deep?' Yang Qing softly disagreed, 'If he were truly scheming, he wouldn't have confronted you directly upon arrival. He would've first secured his exit strategy, ensuring no responsibility before taking action. His direct approach after the fact indicates he sees his actions as justified, hence his nonchalance in inspecting the territory afterward.' Qin Weiwei still wasn't satisfied, mumbling, 'No matter how you slice it, I see him as somewhat despicable and shameless. It's only because you favor him that he seems so agreeable to you.' Yang Qing chuckled helplessly, 'Whether it's your disapproval or my admiration, it's inconsequential. The clash at Gleaming Light Cave, his willingness to face formidable foes with but a White Lotus First Rank and not retreat, speaks volumes of his valor; the two White Lotus Third Rank cultivators under Xiong Xiao fell in the Changfeng Territory, yet he alone returned, mission accomplished; and when I assigned him to Donglai Cave, he was the only one among the Cave and Mountain Lords of Zhenhai Mountain, within Nanxuan Prefecture, to quickly and decisively stabilize the situation, while others cowered before the Blue Jade Sect, merely whining without presenting a single viable solution. Is this how they justify their rule? Miao Yi has never disappointed me. Isn't his capability unequivocal? Weiwei, as a leader, you must sometimes set aside personal biases and appreciate the strengths of your subordinates. No one is perfect; to recognize and utilize the talents of others is the hallmark of true leadership.' Qin Weiwei remained silent, accepting the validity of Yang Qing's reasoning, yet unable to shake her aversion to Miao Yi. She simply found the man unbearable! A father knows his daughter best. Observing her demeanor, Yang Qing gently shook his head, realizing it would take time to alter her perspective... At the bustling docks of Donglai Town, seagulls circled above the boundless ocean. Miao Yi, having spent days touring, quietly returned to the city for a brief encounter with Ji Xiufang before reaching the seaside where his journey began. The pier was alive with activity, with fresh seafood unloaded from boats and sailboats docking from voyages afar. After making inquiries, Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao resumed their journey. 'We can retain Xu Xinliang as Town Governor; he's proven competent,' Miao Yi commented upon leaving the pier. Zhu Tianbiao was quick to praise, 'Cave Lord, your judgment is impeccable!' Miao Yi, unimpressed, rolled his eyes. What does it have to do with my judgment? It's about recognizing someone else's capable appointment. He found the flattery unwarranted. Riding along the shoreline, Miao Yi's decade on an island had made him intimately familiar with the sea. He could read the depths from the hues of the water. Reaching a rugged reef, they stopped. Miao Yi dismounted and leaped atop a boulder to survey the area. 'What are you looking for, Cave Lord?' Zhu Tianbiao inquired. 'Have you heard of sail-less ships in the cultivation world that voyage without human effort?' Miao Yi questioned. 'Indeed,' Zhu Tianbiao confirmed. He explained, 'Those capable of flight in the Red Lotus realm have no need for such vessels. It's the cultivators below that level who find them useful.' 'Is building one a challenge?' 'Not at all. They look much like ordinary ships, but with a spiral propeller at the stern, driven by an artisan-crafted mechanism. Some use Mystic Relics for power, while others employ the leg strength of a dragon steed on a stern treadmill, which is significantly faster than manual rowing. Cave Lord, why do you ask?' Ignoring the question, Miao Yi gestured to the spot, 'Here, we'll dig out a small dock and build a ship for Donglai Cave's exclusive use. Have Yan Xiu arrange for local labor from Donglai Town to start the construction.' Zhu Tianbiao bowed, 'Cave Lord, your foresight is remarkable!' Miao Yi thought to correct the sycophantic response but decided against it. Realizing the futility of discussion, he pounded the boulder with his silver spear, leaving a thunderous mark, and waved dismissively, 'We've been out for days; we've seen enough. Time to head back!' Chapter 83: The Abyss of Donglai (Part One) Wang Zifa was notably attentive to his fellow sect members, arranging for a rotation of four White Lotus Second Rank juniors to stand guard at the mountain gate—a sign of their prestigious status within the sect. This day, it was Nan Sisi’s turn for guard duty. As Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao descended from their mounts at the base of the Gateway Arch, she took their reins and, using a loudspeaker spell, announced, "The Cave Lord has returned!" Miao Yi cast an extra glance at Nan Sisi, his smile barely masking his skepticism toward the professed eagerness for his return; it seemed more likely that Nan Sisi was merely flattering him. Before reaching the Grand Hall, they were met by a flock of disciples, each one echoing, "The Cave Lord has returned." Miao Yi nodded in acknowledgment and led them into the Grand Hall. Once seated in his high seat, he inquired, "I trust there were no disturbances in my absence?" "There was indeed an incident!" came the near-unanimous outcry, anxiety evident on the faces of Wang Zifa and others. "An incident? But all seems well. What has occurred?" Miao Yi questioned, turning to Yan Xiu, who stood below—a figure whose loyalty was unquestioned. Yan Xiu, ever composed, bowed and reported, "Cave Lord, the day after your departure, Mountain Lord Qin Weiwei arrived with her retinue, intent on uncovering the truth behind Song Fu’s untimely end." The mere mention of Qin Weiwei darkened Miao Yi’s expression. It wasn't the exposure of Song Fu's death that concerned him, but the fact that she had come to inspect so soon after his appointment. What did she mean by that? Moreover, he had sent a Petition to her directly. Clearly, she doubted him. With a piercing gaze, Miao Yi asked sharply, "That troublesome woman didn’t come merely to nitpick, did she?" A hush fell over the group, expressions of concern replaced by shock as their Cave Lord openly disparaged the adopted daughter of Prefecture Head Yang Qing and the Mountain Lord of Zhenhai Mountain. Clearing his throat, Miao Yi realized his public lapse and softened his approach, "The Mountain Lord didn’t express any grievances, did she?" Wang Zifa and the rest exchanged covert glances. It seemed that Cave Lord Miao’s relationship with Prefecture Head Yang Qing was not as harmonious as they imagined. The disdain was evident, as shown by Miao Yi’s frank criticism of Yang Qing’s daughter. Members of the Blue Jade Sect had pledged loyalty to Yang Qing, often with underlying motives. Now, Miao Yi's leverage over them raised questions about future interactions with their sect. It appeared that Cave Lord Miao could potentially be swayed to side with the Blue Jade Sect. Turning Yang Qing's confidants into the Blue Jade Sect's secret agents within Yang Qing's inner circle could satisfy their sect’s expectations and might even be seen as a meritorious deed. Yan Xiu, less inclined to such machinations, simply reported, "The Mountain Lord voiced no specific accusations, merely persistently probing us for the truth behind our Petition." 'That’s it?' Miao Yi had braced for something more dire. As long as he could control the narratives of the Blue Jade Sect members here, what did it matter if Qin Weiwei learned the truth? He couldn’t imagine Yang Qing, having recently appointed him, would undo his title over such an incident, thus undermining his own judgment. He didn’t believe Yang Qing would compromise his prestige as Prefecture Head. Besides, what wrong had he committed? Donglai Cave was his domain; what harm was there in reorganizing his own territory? Yang Qing had appointed him to Donglai Cave; while he might not provide support, he shouldn’t hinder him. Unperturbed, Miao Yi asked, "You all kept mum, correct?" A chorus of affirmations echoed, "We’ve kept our lips sealed, but the real concern is with Shan Biaoyi, who was taken by the Mountain Lord. We're unsure if he withstood her questioning." Miao Yi chuckled, "No need to worry. I trust Shan Biaoyi wouldn’t have spoken out of turn." Unsaid was his knowledge of Shan Biaoyi's involvement in Song Fu's demise; it would be out of character for him to confess so readily. Indeed, Yan Xiu and Qiu Shaoqun shared similar thoughts. Their discussion was punctuated by the distant sound of Dragon Steeds galloping. A brief wait later, Shan Biaoyi, the subject of their conversation, briskly entered the Grand Hall. He greeted everyone energetically, bowed, and stated, "Cave Lord!" Before Shan Biaoyi could speak further, the crowd surrounded him, bombarding him with questions about whether he had revealed any secrets after being taken by the Mountain Lord. Shan Biaoyi assured them, bolstered by Yang Qing's earlier support, that he had not betrayed anyone’s trust. At his assertion, relief washed over the crowd as they patted his shoulder, praising his loyalty. From his elevated position, Miao Yi smiled at Shan Biaoyi’s words, crossing his legs and reveling in a smug sense of control—Donglai Cave was firmly in his grasp. "Let’s not be too quick to celebrate," Shan Biaoyi interjected, surveying the room before asking, "You’re familiar with Zheng Jinlong, aren’t you?" Wang Zifa nodded, "Certainly, he’s our esteemed senior brother, having joined the sect even before Song Fu." Curiosity was piqued as to why Zheng Jinlong was mentioned, and Shan Biaoyi gestured outside, "He accompanied me here and is currently awaiting the Cave Lord’s summons." The crowd sensed trouble brewing. Without delay, Wang Zifa inquired, "Why has Senior Brother Zheng come here?" Shan Biaoyi sighed deeply, "I withstood the interrogation, but our Petition has been scrutinized by your Blue Jade Sect. A sect elder, mediating in Nanxuan Prefecture, personally petitioned the Prefecture Head, asserting Song Fu’s death was justified due to his insolence and requested that the Prefecture Head allow another from the Blue Jade Sect to fill Song Fu’s vacancy to redeem the misdeed. Consequently, Zheng Jinlong has come with me. Gentlemen, to be forthright, your sect appears to be questioning the incident. Zheng Jinlong subtly probed throughout our journey, so prepare yourselves." He then turned to salute Miao Yi, "I deliberately left Zheng Jinlong outside to inform you beforehand, hoping the Cave Lord would prepare accordingly." Acknowledging the assembly from his high seat, Miao Yi asked, "Your thoughts on this matter?" After a moment of exchange, Wang Zifa spoke with solemnity, "Cave Lord, Senior Brother Zheng’s arrival likely confirms what Shan Biaoyi suggested—he’s here to verify the truth about Senior Brother Song’s demise." Miao Yi scoffed, "The persistence of the Blue Jade Sect is relentless, probing our integrity. Should he step out of line, join forces and take him down. We outnumber him and need not fear. What’s his level of cultivation?" The atmosphere tensed, and Wang Zifa quickly advised, "No, Cave Lord, we mustn’t take such measures against Senior Brother Zheng. That could only exacerbate our troubles. Even if Senior Brother Zheng could be easily handled, what if they send a cultivator of the Green Lotus rank to replace him? What then?" Observing from the sidelines, Yan Xiu, Qiu Shaoqun, and Shan Biaoyi exchanged knowing looks, their expressions twitching subtly. The Cave Lord was seriously discussing the elimination of a Blue Jade Sect disciple with its own members—a bizarre and unprecedented situation. Indeed, the Blue Jade Sect had gathered quite an 'exceptional' array of disciples. Chapter 84: The Abyss of Donglai (Part 2) Miao Yi posed the question with a tone of indifference, 'If neither advancing nor retreating is an option, what do you propose we do?' Wang Zifa, with due respect, cupped his fists and offered, 'Cave Lord, I believe I have a strategy that could persuade Brother Zheng to join our cause, but it would require your approval on a particular matter.' Could this be an attempt to ensnare his fellow sect brother in the scheme? Miao Yi pondered silently before replying, 'I am all ears for your suggestion.' Wang Zifa elaborated, 'Cave Lord, Brother Zheng has attained the cultivation of White Lotus Third Rank. If... if you could grant Brother Zheng the same entitlements in the allocation of the Wish Power Pearls as the rest of us, I am confident that I can sway him to our side.' Many in the assembly furrowed their brows, keenly watching Miao Yi's response. Such a demand seemed presumptuous; dividing the Wish Power Pearls even further meant leaving nothing for the Cave Lord, which would effectively nullify his leadership. Predictably, Miao Yi's expression grew stern as he leaned in slightly, 'Wang Zifa, are you jesting? Should all the Wish Power Pearls be claimed by you, what would be left of my stewardship? Let it be known that when the time comes for the harvest of the Wish Power Pearls at year's end, out of the twenty-four, a mere fourteen shall be yours. This is the utmost I can offer. As for their distribution—that is a matter for you to decide. Regarding Brother Zheng—if he can be pacified, by all means, do so. Otherwise, remove him without hesitation. I have no patience for those who covet what is mine.' He harbored no trepidation towards Brother Zheng or any other scheming disciple. With an array of loyal followers under his command, any White Lotus Third Rank cultivator on his territory was at his mercy—there was no cause for him to compromise. 'Cave Lord, you misconstrue my words,' interjected Wang Zifa quickly, his hands gesturing in defense. Miao Yi scoffed, 'Then, pray tell, what is your actual intent?' All present turned their attention to Wang Zifa, who cautiously ventured, 'Cave Lord, did you not mention alternative sources of Wish Power Pearls? My proposal is to provisionally divvy up three pearls from my junior brothers and sisters to Brother Zheng. Once the additional sources of Wish Power Pearls are secured, you can recompense them accordingly.' The countenances of Hou Sheng, Shang Youlai, and Wang Xiuqin shifted dramatically. Obviously, any redistribution would be to their detriment as White Lotus Second Rank cultivators. Furthermore, the Cave Lord's mentioned extra sources of Wish Power Pearls had not yet materialized, making immediate benefits the more prudent choice. Despite Wang Zifa taking the lead, their reluctance was kept to themselves, none daring to voice their objection. Nan Sisi, standing guard at the mountain gate and unaware of the deliberations within the hall, would undoubtedly share their discontent. 'I understand,' Miao Yi murmured, tapping the armrest thoughtfully before slowly nodding, 'Your request is reasonable. Nevertheless, when the time arrives to acquire these additional Wish Power Pearls, you must not waver. You are all obliged to join me in this endeavor!' A sense of foreboding washed over Yan Xiu, as a thought flashed through his mind—could the Cave Lord actually be considering a venture into the Stellar Sea? Wang Zifa affirmed with a smile, 'Of course. We shall heed the Cave Lord's commands and stand ready to accompany you wherever you lead.' His affirmation was cautiously phrased, implying their support was contingent on the Cave Lord's ability to lead them there. Miao Yi cast a glance over the Blue Jade Sect disciples, 'Are there any dissenting voices?' Wang Zifa sternly surveyed his juniors. Although Hou Sheng and the rest were inwardly hesitant, they mustered a smile and nodded in concurrence. 'Very well,' Miao Yi announced, slapping the armrest decisively. 'The matter of Zheng Jinlong shall be left to his sect brothers to resolve. Shan Biaoyi, bring him in.' Shan Biaoyi executed the order and promptly escorted in a stout man clad in blue robes, his face ever-present with a gentle smile, appearing even younger than Song Fu. Wang Zifa and his peers greeted their senior brother with salutes. The arrival reciprocated with a courteous gesture, then stood firm, grinning as he bowed to Miao Yi, who was seated in a place of honor, 'At your behest, I, Zheng Jinlong, have arrived to serve in Donglai Cave, greeting the Cave Lord!' His outward amiability was a refreshing change compared to Song Fu's demeanor, making Miao Yi somewhat less averse to him. Miao Yi responded by gesturing dismissively, 'Dispense with the formalities.' Following an exchange where Zheng Jinlong maintained a demeanor befitting a subordinate, the assembly dispersed from the Council Hall. At that moment, Miao Yi called out unexpectedly, 'Shan Biaoyi.' Shan Biaoyi, who was close to the exit, turned back and approached, 'What would you have me do, Cave Lord?' Descending from his seat with a sly smile, Miao Yi locked eyes with Shan Biaoyi, 'You have truly said nothing? And the... Mountain Lord just let you go, just like that?' A tremor of concern ran through Shan Biaoyi, but confident that he had not betrayed any secrets, he expressed surprise, 'Being complicit in Song Fu's downfall, speaking out would serve me no advantage. You surely do not question my loyalty, Cave Lord?' 'Not in the slightest, it was merely a casual question,' Miao Yi replied with a laugh, giving his shoulder a friendly pat before motioning to Yan Xiu to proceed towards the Rear Palace. In the courtyard of the Rear Palace, Black Charcoal, full and idle, was sprawled beside the doorway, idly flicking its tail as it dozed. On Miao Yi's entry, the creature opened one eye—sensing no danger, and with no sign of the woman who had once threatened its rear, it returned to its slumber. Yan Xiu broached the subject tentatively, 'Cave Lord, do you harbor suspicions that Shan Biaoyi may have divulged the truth?' 'Not really, I just find it hard to believe that that cunning Qin Weiwei would let matters rest so easily. She has always sought to pick a bone with me,' Miao Yi dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand. 'But no matter, it's of no consequence.' Qian'er and Xue'er, who had been stationed in the courtyard awaiting the Cave Lord's return, slightly inclined their heads and trailed behind the men as they walked inside. Settled in the Cave Lord's quarters, the two maids promptly presented tea, then stood silently to the side. Miao Yi gave them a brief glance before gesturing for them to withdraw; he was yet to foster any trust in the pair. Once they had departed, Miao Yi shared with Yan Xiu, 'I've marked a location along the shoreline. Later, coordinate with Donglai Town to commission some laborers...' He detailed his plans for constructing a wharf and ships, causing Yan Xiu to express his apprehension, 'Cave Lord, you surely do not intend to brave the trials of the Stellar Sea?' 'You are overly concerned; this is a necessity for my cultivation,' Miao Yi assured him. 'Cultivation?' 'The wages for the laborers must not be scrimped upon; this responsibility is yours to manage. I've been traveling for days; I desire to refresh myself with a bath.' Miao Yi concluded, leaving the room. Yan Xiu acknowledged with a bow, exiting the chamber. On his way out, he passed by Qian'er and Xue'er, casually remarking, 'The Cave Lord requires a bath.' Pausing as he brushed past them, he offered a word of advice, 'The honor of serving as maids to the Cave Lord is a rare privilege in Donglai Town. Those who cannot secure the Cave Lord's trust do not last long here...' Chapter 85: Bottomless Cave (Part Three) Within the Meditation Chamber of the Master of Donglai Cave, Miao Yi had just disrobed and submerged himself into the temperate waters of the bath. As he closed his eyes to relish the tranquility, the sound of approaching footsteps prompted him to look towards the chamber door. Who would dare to intrude in such a manner? The answer soon revealed itself as Qian'er and Xue'er entered, appearing slightly apprehensive. They had shed their outer garments, wearing only a tube top over their torsos and mesh sand shorts below. Their translucent shoulders, delicate collarbones, and limbs as supple as lotus stems were laid bare before the cool air. The two maidens, shy as unopened buds and dressed in minimal attire, approached with flushed faces, carrying bathing essentials. Miao Yi, struck dumb, was at a loss for words. His cheeks flushed with sudden understanding, and he hastily grabbed a nearby garment, plunging it into the water to cover his modesty, asking with evident alarm, "What brings you two here?" "We are here to attend to the Master of Donglai Cave's bathing needs," the two said in unison, their faces tinged with crimson. Miao Yi, clutching his garment tightly to his lower body, quickly protested, "No need, no need, I am quite capable of bathing myself." "It is our duty," they insisted, remembering Yan Xiu's prior instructions. Undeterred by Miao Yi's objection, they set down their supplies, delicately stepped into the bath, and without awaiting his consent, went about their tasks—one helping to untie Miao Yi's hair, the other scooping water to rinse his shoulders. Miao Yi was overwhelmed by embarrassment, his temperament flaring with vexation. Yet, some reactions are instinctive to man. As the maids entered the water, their sheer shorts clung to them, revealing more with each soak. The fragrance of their untouched skin caused Miao Yi's heart to race. He dared not let his gaze wander further, the words to send them away caught in his throat and ultimately unspoken. Forced to divert his eyes from their semi-revealed forms, he closed his eyes and secured his hands firmly over his loins, allowing their tender fingers to graze his skin. The trail of their touch caused involuntary shudders to ripple through him. Over time, he grew accustomed to their presence, and the resulting comfort was unspeakably pleasant, although his hands never left his loins. Donglai Town had selected these girls for the express purpose of pleasing cultivators, hence their skills in service were honed to perfection. The town would not dare offer such talents without confidence in their abilities... A cultivator's cave dwelling, commanding a region, is invariably a place of refinement. Amidst the dreamlike verdure of the mountains, with birds and beasts scattered amongst the stone paths and ridges, a group journeyed around remarkable peaks, taking in the endless forest and the babbling of spring water. Wang Zifa and his fellow junior cultivators were escorting Senior Brother Zheng Jinlong through the scenic vistas of Donglai Cave, acquainting him with its environs, all while showing due reverence. "The Six Saints reign supreme over the world, and the cave dwellings within their purview are blessed with lands of divine natural beauty—indeed, splendid places!" The group stepped into a pavilion nestled amidst the mountains while Zheng Jinlong, absorbing the narratives of his juniors, marveled at the beauty surrounding him, noting that even the humble Donglai Cave could rival the esteemed Blue Jade Sect. His expression remained amiable and serene, his true thoughts obscured from view. Beside him, Wang Zifa added, "Now our Blue Jade Sect has entered the picture, and there is much potential to be realized!" Zheng Jinlong merely 'Oh'-ed in response, then inquired pointedly, "Does our sect still hold a place in your eyes?" At this, the smiles on the faces of those present stiffened, the air thickening with tension, as they anticipated the long-avoided confrontation. "Brother, such words make us uneasy..." Before Wang Zifa could elaborate, Zheng Jinlong turned abruptly, his smile unwavering but now laced with an iciness, "Uneasy? Is your boldness not yet sufficient?" All eyes shifted to Wang Zifa, who had previously claimed to have a solution at hand. With feigned astonishment, Wang Zifa replied, "Brother, to what are you referring?" Zheng Jinlong's gaze softened with feigned amusement, "Junior brother, are you pretending to be confused with me? Aren't you going to provide the sect with an explanation for Song Fu's death?" Wang Zifa’s expression hardened as he declared, "Song Fu nearly sabotaged the Blue Jade Sect's endeavors; his death was warranted! Given another chance, we would act no differently!" Zheng Jinlong was momentarily taken aback, his gaze shifting as he slowly ventured, "Could there be more to the story? I am eager to hear the full account." Wang Zifa leaned in and whispered the altered facts to his brother, a mixture of truth and fabrication. "Three pearls? From where does he procure so many Wish Power Pearls to distribute among us?" Zheng Jinlong questioned with surprise. "We witnessed him in possession of a Wish Power Pearl that encompasses the collective wishes of ten thousand people over a year..." Wang Zifa confided further. "He has another source for Wish Power Pearls?" Zheng Jinlong's eyes gleamed with intrigue. Wang Zifa sighed, "Now, brother, you must see the predicament we face. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but despite your higher status within the sect, once this news reaches the sect, the once-insignificant Donglai Cave will become highly sought after. The elders are sure to send their most trusted kin to take our place. Our downfall is trivial, but should the news leak, and Miao Yi be called back by Yang Qing, wouldn't our efforts to discover the source of the Wish Power Pearls for the sect come to naught? That would be a loss for the sect. Therefore, Song Fu deserved his fate!" Zheng Jinlong doubted that these individuals truly sought to uncover the source of the Wish Power Pearls for the sect; it was more likely they sought the information for their own gain. Nonetheless, if Miao Yi were displaced from Donglai Cave, the annual three Wish Power Pearls would certainly be jeopardized. A different Cave Lord would not be so generous. Yet, the prospect of such gains was enticing. His juniors were sharing this information with him, hoping he would join them in mutual support and share in the spoils. The matter, however, had already raised the sect's suspicions, prompting them to send him. Zheng Jinlong furrowed his brow, "Junior brother, while I understand your loyalty to the sect, you must realize that failing to provide the sect with a reasonable explanation is unacceptable. How do you propose I address this with them?" Chapter 86: The Bottomless Cave (Part 4) Wang Zifa noticed the budding curiosity in his companion, a secret thrill bubbling within him, yet on the surface, he feigned astonishment, inquiring, 'Brother, did you not grasp the subtext of my earlier remarks?' Zheng Jinlong halted, his thoughts swirling, yet clarity eluded him. 'Elaborate for me, Junior Brother,' he implored. Wang Zifa's voice was hushed, 'Indeed, as you've mentioned, Miao Yi is perceived as Yang Qing's trusted aide. Yet, his vitriolic critique of Qin Weiwei uncovers his deeper discontent, indicating that his loyalty might be superficial. Remember, he chose resistance over capitulation, submitting to Yang Qing only when bereft of alternatives. The Blue Jade Sect stands to gain immensely from this scenario. If we could subtly turn Yang Qing's trusted figure into our planted agent... Brother, such a rationale might alleviate the concerns of our sect elders.' Zheng Jinlong descended into contemplation, the weight of the decision dawning on him. By siding with these conspirators, he risked binding their fates together; one misstep could ensnare them all in mutual downfall. Retreating to his secluded cultivation quarters, Zheng Jinlong wrestled with hesitation and inner turmoil. The fear of enraging the sect battled with the enticement of potential riches. Ultimately, the lure of the attainable spoils proved irresistible. After days of surveillance and consideration, further egged on by Wang Zifa and his associates' seductive incitements, Zheng Jinlong steeled his resolve and composed a covert memorial. The memorial wove a narrative of Song Fu's presumptuous and unruly conduct, arguing that his execution was warranted due to his blatant indifference to the common cause. When Miao Yi executed Song Fu, Wang Zifa and his allies were incensed, nearly succumbing to a violent clash with Miao Yi. But at that pivotal juncture, they inadvertently unearthed Miao Yi's veiled dissatisfaction with Yang Qing, his grudges simmering under a guise of subservience, even covertly reviling Yang Qing's adopted daughter. Considering the grand scheme, Wang Zifa and his confederates believed it unwise to sever ties with Yang Qing over a single individual. With Song Fu beyond salvation, they chose to capitalize on the situation. They resolved to suppress their ire, safeguard Miao Yi, earn his gratitude, and cultivate him into a secret asset for the Blue Jade Sect's future maneuvers. Moreover, Miao Yi's comparatively modest cultivation level rendered him an amenable pawn. Gaining his allegiance was tantamount to gaining sway over Donglai Cave. Ousting Miao Yi for a more formidable successor would only complicate the Blue Jade Sect's grip over the cave. In his final remarks, Zheng Jinlong expressed his belief in Wang Zifa and the others' noble intentions and pleaded with the sect to deliberate their course of action. In the courtyard, as Zheng Jinlong slipped the secret memorial into a goshawk's leg tube, he wavered, his conviction faltering. Nevertheless, with a firm set of his jaw, he released the goshawk into the skies. The goshawk messenger soared away, swiftly vanishing into the horizon... The saying goes, 'Even heroes struggle to resist the charm of beauty.' This might be an exaggeration, but following the intimate bath with the two attendants, Miao Yi's demeanor towards them had noticeably softened. He ceased to treat them with the indifferent detachment of mere subordinates. While Miao Yi had restrained himself from crossing that ultimate boundary, their close encounter had indelibly changed how he perceived them. For the first time, having been so close to women, he began to view them not just as servants, but as his own. His directives became more personal and relaxed. Qian'er and Xue'er, now less anxious in their master's company, even found humor in recalling the initial bath they assisted him with. The formidable Cave Lord had been more bashful and nervous than they had been—it seemed that immortals could indeed feel shy! Entering the back courtyard of Donglai Grand Hall—the esteemed seat of the Cave Lord's power—Yan Xiu couldn't help but smile faintly. Inside the pavilion, Xue'er's fingers danced over the zither strings, weaving an enchanting melody, while Qian'er's dance was a graceful display of celestial beauty. Miao Yi, holding a teacup, watched with serene appreciation, seemingly content with life's simple pleasures. Upon noticing Yan Xiu's approach, Miao Yi signaled, prompting Qian'er and Xue'er to cease their performance. Yan Xiu, stepping into the pavilion, glanced at the pair and inquired with a smile, 'Cave Lord, are these two attendants meeting your expectations? If not, I could have the Town Governor of Donglai Town supply alternatives.' Indeed, owing to the principle of followers, not everyone was afforded such preferential treatment. Once an attendant was selected, the decision was typically irrevocable. No cultivator could claim the right to treat all the women in the world as potential personal attendants—for that would invite anarchy. However, certain privileges were accorded to the Cave Lord. Only those within the system, under the Six Sages, were entitled to be assigned attendants. Rogue cultivators had no such luxuries. While frequenting brothels was permitted, if they dared disrupt the delicate balance by preying on followers, the system's cultivators would swiftly marshal forces to pursue and punish them, preserving their exclusive rights. This desire to join the system, with its array of privileges and entitlements far beyond what rogue cultivators could aspire to, was a driving force for many. Yan Xiu's words immediately alerted Qian'er and Xue'er, their eyes swiftly turning to Miao Yi with a mix of hope and trepidation. Before the prospect of serving immortals, Donglai Town had invested heavily in their grooming. They were pampered and protected, their untouchable status a reflection of their future service to immortals. To offend them was to risk future vengeance. Yet, if they were sent back, they would experience a fall from grace, losing the protection of immortals. No longer would anyone hold them in the same esteem, and the consequences of being returned were well understood—they had failed to satisfy the immortals, which would undoubtedly infuriate those who had painstakingly prepared them. Unsettled by the maids' imploring looks and the memories of their skin-to-skin contact, Miao Yi cleared his throat awkwardly, 'They will do, quite adept indeed. No replacement necessary.' He had no wish for the embarrassing details of his bath to become fodder for gossip. His affirmation implied that the maids had proven their worthiness, receiving the Cave Lord's formal approval. Their status was immediately elevated, now recognized as the personal attendants of the Cave Lord, shielded from arbitrary disrespect. Even Yan Xiu promptly saluted them, 'Eldest Aunt, Younger Aunt!' With an immortal bestowing such honorifics, the maids' eyes gleamed with delight. They understood that the Cave Lord had formally accepted them. Their status had ascended, now towering over many, especially their fellow maids selected to serve immortals, for they were the attendants of the Cave Lord. Unaware they were destined to serve the Cave Lord, their fortune was rare—found only in two out of a hundred thousand. In their excitement, tinged with modesty, their gaze towards Miao Yi transformed. They both subtly moved to stand at his sides. Miao Yi no longer shied away from them. Having chosen them, he was ready to involve them in certain affairs. Like Qingmei and Qingju who served Yang Qing, they would need to handle tasks for him. Without knowledge, they would be of little use. 'Has there been any response from Zheng Jinlong?' Miao Yi inquired. Yan Xiu responded, 'As of now, none. Zheng Jinlong remains secluded in his cultivation quarters, showing no inclination to step out. Wang Zifa and his group are growing impatient, pressing him persistently.' Chapter 87: The Abyss of Donglai (Part 5) As Zheng Jinlong, anxiously awaiting news in the courtyard, brought his pacing to a halt, he welcomed the dark speck descending from the sky. The goshawk messenger he had dispatched two days earlier finally returned, landing on his outstretched arm. Impatient for updates, Zheng Jinlong quickly extracted a slender jade slip from the bird's leg tube and infused it with qi to read the inscribed message: 'Wang Zifa and his companions have exerted commendable efforts; grant them your cooperation!' This directive from the Blue Jade Sect brought Zheng Jinlong a profound sense of relief. Uncertain of his sect's stance, he had been hesitant to offer full support to Wang Zifa's group, fearing repercussions if the sect's internal investigation implicated him. Now with the sect's stance unequivocally conveyed, Zheng Jinlong felt emboldened. After securing the goshawk back in its aviary, he retreated indoors and exchanged his blue robes for a black uniform, signaling his allegiance to the Donglai Cave Master's mandate for uniformity in attire. Now adorned in black, Zheng Jinlong was promptly approached by Wang Zifa and others, who seemed to materialize from the ether, pressing him with urgency, 'Senior Brother Zheng, what is your decision?' Their urgent desire for his cooperation was unmistakable; without Zheng Jinlong's support, they would be at the mercy of Miao Yi, potentially compelled to act against Zheng Jinlong himself. Despite the gravity of their situation, they were prepared to face the consequences of their choices. 'Recognizing the lengths you've gone for our sect, I have deliberated deeply on your behalf,' Zheng Jinlong sighed, presenting them with the jade slip—a secret missive—he had just received. After each man inspected the message with their qi, their faces lit up with relief. At Wang Zifa's silent cue, they lined up and bowed in unison, 'We are indebted to you, Senior Brother Zheng!' 'Having not received directives from our Cave Master for some time, might he have assignments for us?' Zheng Jinlong inquired, demonstrating his readiness to heed the Cave Master's commands. Their collective front was a testament to their commitment to reassure Miao Yi of their loyalty. They accompanied Zheng Jinlong, lavishing him with praise as they proceeded to present their unified allegiance. Informed of their arrival, Miao Yi, accompanied by Qian'er and Xue'er, emerged from the seclusion of the Rear Hall into the solemn Grand Hall. As he seated himself in a position of authority, Qian'er and Xue'er, a blend of excitement and apprehension evident in their demeanor, took their places at his sides, while Yan Xiu, who had followed them, assumed his designated spot below. 'Bring them in,' Miao Yi commanded, his voice imbued with an understated authority. Yan Xiu had briefed the attendants on the proper etiquette. Xue'er, the younger of the two maids, steadied her nerves. Taking a deep breath, she approached the Grand Hall's entrance and, her voice betraying a tremble, called out to the group awaiting below the lofty steps, 'The Cave Master invites you to enter the Grand Hall for discussion.' As the men entered the Grand Hall, the sight of Zheng Jinlong's black attire did not escape Miao Yi's notice. A knowing smile crossed his features, recognizing the implicit pledge of loyalty. Wang Zifa caught Miao Yi's discerning gaze and, without a word, confirmed, 'All has been settled.' 'Greetings, Cave Master!' they chorused, offering a respectful bow. With this assembly, Miao Yi felt his strength in numbers solidify, ready to face any challenges that lay ahead. Even a White Lotus Fourth Rank cultivator would now find a formidable opponent. 'There is no need for formalities,' Miao Yi responded, his smile tinged with a hint of satisfaction. Qian'er and Xue'er, witnessing the display of respect from the sect members, sneaked glances at Miao Yi. The Cave Master's authority was palpable, compelling many to heed his command. To the maids, who had rarely encountered such esteemed cultivators, the gathering was impressive. How would they feel, knowing their master, commanding the attention of all present, was the least cultivated among them? After everyone had found their place, Zheng Jinlong once again came forward, bowing, 'I, Zheng Jinlong, am new to Donglai Cave and have yet to prove my worth. Does the Cave Master have any instructions for me?' His question was a pledge of service. Miao Yi, with an amused smirk, suggested, 'A newcomer should make a positive impression. How about starting by guarding the Mountain Gate for a day?' The crowd hesitated, unsure of the implication. Was another White Lotus Third Rank cultivator to be relegated to mere gate duty? Could this be another of the Cave Master's strategies, or did he harbor ill will toward Zheng Jinlong? Zheng Jinlong was taken aback. His earlier polite offer had been taken at face value. He understood this to be the Cave Master's test of his genuine commitment. True allegiance required more than words—it demanded action. 'As the Cave Master wishes,' Zheng Jinlong affirmed, his salute both formal and determined. With that, Miao Yi saw no need for further circumspection. This was his domain, and matters would unfold according to his will. 'Now that we are gathered, let me introduce two individuals,' Miao Yi gestured towards the maids, 'This is Qian'er, and this is Xue'er.' With mutual respect, the group bowed in acknowledgment, 'We are honored to meet the Da Gugu and Xiao Gugu.' Qian'er and Xue'er, caught between nerves and pride, reciprocated the gesture. After the introductions, the group disbanded. Zheng Jinlong headed to the Mountain Gate to take over from the current guard, Wang Xiuqin, who hesitated to impose such a task on her Senior Brother. When told it was the Mountain Master's instruction, Wang Xiuqin stepped aside but whispered a warning, 'Senior Brother Zheng, as you're aware of Brother Song's ordeal, please exercise caution.' Zheng Jinlong nodded, appearing unconcerned on the surface but internally tightening his guard. He was acutely aware of the Cave Master's capacity for covert action. The recent incident at the Mountain Gate, resulting in Song Fu's demise, was still fresh in everyone's memory. They all suspected Miao Yi's hidden hand, recognizing it as a mere pretext for his rage. Resolved to guard his post, Zheng Jinlong vowed to remain vigilant at the Mountain Gate, determined not to share Song Fu's fate... News of Zheng Jinlong's submission swiftly reached Zhenhai Mountain. Qin Weiwei, donned in her pristine white cultivator's robe, lounged on her balcony, scanning the secret report with disdain. That man had once again swayed the Blue Jade Sect's envoy to his side—were they so easily influenced? Yang Qing, aware that Song Fu's end could not remain concealed, had taken a direct approach. There was no merit in secrecy, so he summoned the Blue Jade Sect's delegate and laid bare the stack of petitions. Without hesitation, the Blue Jade Sect's representative condemned Song Fu's actions and beseeched Yang Qing to allow another to 'redeem sins with merits.' The pretense of redemption was transparent, a guise to scrutinize the actual events. Nonetheless, Yang Qing acquiesced immediately. Later, when Qin Weiwei queried Yang Qing about his decision and its potential implications, he replied dismissively, 'If the truth comes to light, so be it. I'll stand by the youngster. I'm intrigued to see the Blue Jade Sect's response—to ascertain their limits. Besides, it's another chance to test that young Cave Master. Let's see if he can handle the pressure and not disappoint me.' The confidential report was promptly forwarded to Nanxuan Prefecture. Yang Qing, secluded in his mountain pavilion, chuckled softly to himself, 'Another has been drawn in. That young Cave Master truly has turned Donglai Cave into an insatiable abyss that devours all who enter. It appears the Blue Jade Sect is not as formidable as they claim, unable to deal with even a minor Cave Master under my command. Haha!' Qingmei and Qingju exchanged glances. Once again, the Cave Master had met the Prefecture Master's expectations. It was clear that Yang Qing's appreciation for Miao Yi was growing, particularly given Miao Yi's deft maneuvering of the Blue Jade Sect—a tactic that resonated with the Prefecture Master's own predilections. Chapter 88: Hatching the Nether Eggs (Part One) With the issue of Zheng Jinlong settled, and the Blue Jade Sect matter effectively resolved, Miao Yi could, at last, concentrate on his cultivation without any lingering concerns. Before he could dedicate himself fully to that pursuit, he had another task to address. Having recently taken control of Donglai Cave, he had been too preoccupied with its reorganization to do anything else. Now, with some time available, he decided to attempt the hatching of the Nether Mantis eggs that he and Lao Bai had procured from the endless Red Dust. On an early morning, as the sky began to brighten, Miao Yi instructed Qian'er and Xue'er to ensure that no one would disturb him. He secluded himself in the meditation chamber to begin his preparations, as the secret method he was about to employ could not be revealed to others, as per Lao Bai's instructions. The mass of eggs, once brought out, seemed to lower the temperature of the room; they were cold as ice to the touch. Miao Yi, feeling the chill, remarked, 'Truly bizarre creatures!' He carefully separated the eggs from the mucus, arranging a hundred quail-sized, dark eggs onto a jade plate. He then drew a small knife across the palm of his left hand, wincing as blood began to flow freely. He had to ensure his blood covered each egg thoroughly, leaving no part untouched. This was crucial to sever the connection between yin and yang using his essence blood and to allow the Nether Mantis within to be fully accustomed to his presence from the outset of their incubation. After ensuring each egg was coated in black and red, he loosed his hair bun, reluctantly plucking strands from his scalp. The hair, Lao Bai had explained, must remain intact, as continuity was essential in the hatching of Nether Eggs. With a hundred perfect strands in hand, each with its root, Miao Yi began the peculiar process. He dipped the roots in his blood, holding the tips together. At his command, the hairs stiffened, splaying outward like a porcupine's quills. Hovering his hand over the plate, he directed each hair into an egg, piercing the tough, slippery shells. This arcane technique, named 'Thread of Yin and Yang Connecting Two Realms,' was meant to bind the Yin of the Nether Eggs to his Yang. His hair served as the tether, ensuring that the hatched Nether Mantises would be in harmony with his will. As the strands penetrated the eggs, a bone-chilling sensation coursed through them, almost causing Miao Yi's spirit to falter—a feeling like being plunged into the netherworld, making one's soul quiver. Only Miao Yi's cultivation of the 'Starfire Technique' prevented his soul from straying, his Dharma Origin repelling the yin energy and restoring warmth to his body, an assertion of dominance that expelled the intrusion in an instant. Shivering, Miao Yi came back to his senses, observing the hair now coated with frost. 'What strange Nether Eggs, to have nearly ensnared my mind!' he marveled. With his mind composed, he recalled Lao Bai's mental technique. Grasping the hairs, he began funneling his mana through them into the eggs, weaving in the secret method. Less than half an hour later, Miao Yi ceased the infusion of mana. The previously cleared frost now crept back over the hair, starting at the roots. Unsure of the outcome, Miao Yi proceeded as instructed. He took out the Stellar Flora Immortal Herb and gently blew a wisp of star cloud onto the cut in his palm, which rapidly healed before his eyes. With the wound healed, he marveled at his good fortune in obtaining the herb from the Nether Mantis that day in the endless Red Dust. Without it, hatching the Nether Eggs would have been far more troublesome. Because, as Lao Bai's secret method prescribed, the eggs needed to be bathed in fresh blood daily for eighty-one days without pause, or the entire effort would be for naught. In other words, he would need to bleed eighty-one times, making continuous incisions for as many days. Had he not chanced upon the immortal herb, the constant bleeding would have been unbearable, even for a cultivator. After rinsing the blood from his hands in the warm spring pool, Miao Yi picked up the jade plate and exited the meditation chamber. Qian'er and Xue'er, standing guard outside, eyed the contents of the plate curiously. The black and red objects, furred in white, puzzled them. Xue'er reached out to help Miao Yi with the plate. Accustomed to their service, he handed it to her. But as he was about to offer guidance, Xue'er's face turned ashen. The plate shook in her trembling hands, nearly slipping from her grasp. Miao Yi's quick reflexes saved the plate and prevented Xue'er from collapsing. He realized he had been careless; the items on the plate were heavy with yin energy, which he had nearly succumbed to himself. It was too much for a mere mortal to withstand. His cultivation technique was especially effective against such yin energy. Casting a spell, he directed it into Xue'er's body, clearing the invasive yin energy in an instant. Xue'er, her eyes having rolled back, slowly regained consciousness. The yin energy had momentarily sapped her vitality, leaving her weak and pallid. Chapter 89: Incubating the Nether Egg (Part 2) 'Sorry, I forgot you two are mortals and shouldn't touch this.' Miao Yi asked, 'Xue'er, are you alright?' Qian'er and Xue'er looked at the Jade Slip with awe, realizing it was not intended for mortals. Xue'er shook her head and quickly apologized, 'This servant's carelessness nearly caused damage to the Mountain Lord's property.' 'It's fine,' Miao Yi chuckled. 'I have something for you to do; come with me!' They followed him out of the Grand Hall into the bright sunlight. The frost on the hair within the Jade Slip began to emit wisps of black smoke upon exposure to sunlight, and the white frost quickly vanished, revealing the hair's true color. Frost wouldn't melt so quickly in the sun, nor produce black smoke. Obviously, this frost was a manifestation of intense Yin energy, not a natural occurrence. The sight of the frost turning to hair and then emitting black smoke once again alarmed Qian'er and Xue'er. The feeling wasn't that of an immortal's aura, but rather a sinister one. Black Charcoal, who had been dozing at the entrance flicking his serpentine tail, suddenly sneezed. He opened his eyes wide, focusing on the object Miao Yi held, as if he sensed something unusual. However, seeing Miao Yi leading the two maids to the Star Observation Platform and realizing it had no effect on him, he went back to sleep, the epitome of laziness. The Star Observation Platform was designed for stargazing. Ascending, Miao Yi placed the Jade Slip on the ground, which, according to Lao Bai, must not touch the earth until the hatching is complete; it needed to be isolated, and the platform was perfectly suited for this. Under the harsh sunlight, Miao Yi crouched to observe for a while. The breeze rustled the strands of hair sticking out of the Nether Egg, leaving him to wonder if Lao Bai's claim about the hair helping the nether embryo adapt to the mortal realm was true. 'Qian'er, Xue'er!' Miao Yi stood up. 'Present!' The two attendants responded in unison. Miao Yi pointed to the item in the Jade Slip and instructed, 'Starting today, I will be in secluded cultivation. You two will take turns guarding this spot, making sure no one comes up here to touch this item. Neither of you should touch it, nor let it come into contact with the ground beneath the platform. Remember to summon me from the Meditation Chamber every evening before sunset or when it's cloudy or raining, and the sun is obscured, and also before sunrise each day!' 'We will remember,' the maids nodded in agreement. After descending from the Star Observation Platform to the pavilion, Miao Yi invited them to sit and asked, 'Can you both sew?' Both nodded, 'Yes, we're quite skilled.' 'I need a fitted vest...' Miao Yi began outlining the design he wanted them to create. Once they grasped his intention, they quickly fetched needle and thread. Upon their return, Qian'er began cutting the fabric, while Xue'er used a comb to tidy Miao Yi's hair, which had been disordered from the earlier plucking. At that moment, Yan Xiu entered the courtyard, reporting that the dock and shipbuilding at Donglai Town were set to commence immediately. 'Do not shortchange the craftsmen's pay,' Miao Yi reminded. He had mentioned this previously, and Yan Xiu assured him it would be adhered to. Noticing Xue'er's pallor, he inquired out of concern, 'Attendant Xue'er seems pale. Is she unwell?' Xue'er hastily shook her head, still shaken from the earlier experience. Miao Yi glanced back at Xue'er, noting her slightly pale complexion and knowing she had experienced a minor drain on her spiritual energy, but it wasn't serious. Turning to Yan Xiu, he mentioned, 'Regarding these two, I have a matter to discuss with you.' 'What does the Mountain Lord require?' Yan Xiu inquired. 'They possess aptitude for cultivation, do they not?' Yan Xiu immediately grasped Miao Yi's implication, 'Does the Mountain Lord intend for them to commence cultivation training?' Qian'er and Xue'er covertly glanced at Miao Yi, their curiosity piqued. Having been in his service long enough, they had heard enough about cultivation and had a rough idea of its significance. The prospect excited them. 'Indeed!' Miao Yi confirmed. He had indeed contemplated this, as the two women beside him seemed somewhat ineffective, especially for someone on the path of cultivation. Such attendants were a burden; even a simple journey to the back mountain for a consultation was arduous. They would return from the climb gasping for breath and visibly distressed—a situation that was unsustainable. For someone like Yang Qing, who had the benefit of two cultivator attendants, life was much more convenient. They were not only useful for tasks but could also serve as personal bodyguards. Especially after witnessing Xue'er's near mishap with the Jade Slip, Miao Yi was motivated to address the issue. 'Where can we obtain a set of cultivation techniques for them?' Miao Yi inquired. Yan Xiu pondered a moment before replying, 'Complete cultivation techniques are a sect's heritage, not to be shared lightly. To control their disciples, sects disseminate these teachings incrementally. Acquiring such knowledge is extremely difficult. If there's a chance to visit the Flowing Cloud Sand Sea, that place is a sanctuary for outlaws where laws do not apply. Rogue cultivators who have no place in the Six Saints' domain gather there. It's a melting pot of demons and spirits, where betrayal is commonplace. There, one might purchase such techniques at a high price. However, without prior cultivation experience, there is no guarantee the techniques are complete. Incorrect practice could lead to Qi deviation. Most cultivators commit these techniques to memory, and any tangible records they carry are usually encoded to prevent the unauthorized spread of their cultivation practices.' 'Flowing Cloud Sand Sea...' Miao Yi murmured, his thoughts momentarily drifting to the enchanting woman he had encountered at the Miao Fa Temple. Shaking off the distracting image of the innkeeper's charming mannerisms, he dismissed the idea, 'That place is too far and fraught with peril for a mere visit, and as you've said, it's not reliable. Surely there must be another solution.' Yan Xiu shook his head, 'It's a formidable challenge. The clandestine trade of cultivation techniques is sternly punished to prevent an influx of cultivators. Such transactions are mainly confined to lawless places like the Flowing Cloud Sand Sea.' He left unsaid who was enforcing this, but Miao Yi understood it to be the Six Saints. They were eager to avoid an excess of cultivators vying for the world's incense prayer power. Too many cultivators would lead to unrest, threatening the established order—a scenario the Six Saints would not allow. Miao Yi's brow furrowed, 'Where did the Prefecture Head's attendants learn their cultivation techniques?' 'The Prefecture Head would have imparted her own techniques. That's typically how it's done.' At this, Yan Xiu seemed puzzled, 'Mountain Lord, why not impart your own cultivation methods to them? You could teach them incrementally, based on their ability to comprehend.' His suggestion was well-intentioned, but the subtext was for Miao Yi to act like other sect leaders—impart his knowledge gradually, thus maintaining a hold over the attendants.
Chapter 189: The Affairs of the Supervisory Lord and the Dowager 64 Xiao Mo felt a profound sorrow seizing her heart for a moment. The Supervisory Lord... He appeared paralyzed by indecision. To move would be to face the truth, and with his sharp intellect, how could he not know that Bai Weiwei had departed from this world? Yet, he chose denial, convincing himself she was merely asleep and would soon awaken. Xiao Mo believed that only when Bai Weiwei's body began to decay would Supervisory Lord Mu Yanjun be forced to confront reality, recognizing that the person he was holding had long passed. Oddly, her body showed no signs of decomposition. Her pallor had even improved slightly, and though cold, she appeared to be in nothing more than a deep slumber, without any of the typical signs of a corpse. Mu Yanjun kept a silent vigil, his gaze ablaze with a desperate need for answers. Eventually, Elder Zao, the Divine Doctor, was brought before him. With a Heart-guarding Elixir on his tongue, he mused, 'Half my life is already behind me.' Five days had passed since Mu Yanjun had last slept, and although his exhaustion was evident, his mind was alarmingly lucid. 'She has been this way since I administered the Heart-guarding Elixir. I need to know when she will wake,' he stated. Elder Zao sighed and took Bai Weiwei's pulse. 'This condition is exceedingly rare; she requires no further treatment. However, there is one more crucial task...' Mu Yanjun listened with the intensity of a keen student, his eyes burning with the urgency of his need. Elder Zao's voice fell to a whisper, 'It's time I attended to another...' As Mu Yanjun leaned in, Elder Zao's hand moved with lightning speed, inserting a needle into his neck. His eyes shot open, betraying a flicker of the fierce spirit within, hand reaching for Elder Zao's crown of the head. Xiao Mo intercepted, stopping Mu Yanjun's retaliatory strike. In the ensuing scuffle, Mu Yanjun's strength ebbed away, and he slipped into unconsciousness. Elder Zao, relieved, touched his head, 'That was too close. My time may not be long, but if he wakes with his sanity intact, that's all we can hope for.' There was no hope of reviving Bai Weiwei. Mu Yanjun was a shell of himself, his heartbreak manifesting as physical decline. Without intervention, he might soon join Bai Weiwei in death. Xiao Mo faced Elder Zao with a stern warning, 'You hold the life of our Supervisory Lord in your hands. If you fail him again, I personally will end your life.' She then turned and left to accept her punishment in silence. Elder Zao exhaled, 'My master was right; selling sweet potatoes is better than being hailed as a Divine Doctor. Everyone expects miracles, but not even a god can make one who longs for death cling to life.' After only two hours, Mu Yanjun's eyes opened once more. Panic flickered across his face as he realized he was immobilized. 'I've administered acupuncture,' Elder Zao explained. 'Your spirit is greatly weakened. With some rest, you'll be on your way to meet King Yama, the mythological judge of the dead.' Mu Yanjun's eyes darkened, his visage gaunt and his aura menacing. Elder Zao prepared another needle, 'I had no intention of saving you, for someone with a heart as dark as yours might only bring about further chaos upon being revived.' Mu Yanjun's voice was soft yet unsettling, 'Release me.' Elder Zao shook his head, 'That I cannot do. Though I could not save your beloved, saving you is my atonement.' A bitter laugh escaped Mu Yanjun, 'Your atonement is meaningless. You could heal the entire world, and it would not equate to a single hair from her head.' Chapter 190: The Affairs of Supervisor Master and the Empress Dowager (Conclusion) Old Master Zao: "You're not foolish; you know very well that she's already dead." Mu Yanjun's body shook with uncontrollable tremors, the needles targeting his vitals unable to restrain him any longer. Seeing this, Old Master Zao had no choice but to insert a few more needles. "Her case was quite unique; you were too late, and the medicine didn't have time to take effect before she died. Thus, all the medicinal strength went into preserving her body, keeping it from decaying for years unless burned. Besides being cold, she looked no different from someone in a peaceful slumber." Old Master Zao sighed deeply at this point, "Upon hearing this, the Emperor had her body taken away to be cremated." Mu Yanjun, realizing the Emperor's intentions, uttered a series of 'good' in a cold and mocking tone, "Anyone who tries to take her away from me will not live to see another day." As he spoke, the needles burst from his body one by one, and blood surged from the punctures. Old Master Zao understood that his own end was approaching. From ancient times, the deepest wounds have always been inflicted by love. Free from the Divine Doctor's Acupuncture Shackles, Mu Yanjun leapt into action, heading straight for the exit. Old Master Zao braced for his end, but Mu Yanjun, preoccupied with a more pressing matter, vanished before inflicting a fatal blow. The elder shakily took a Heart-guarding Elixir, "My life won't be long. Such cruelty from Mu Yanjun... To not kill me instantly, does he intend to torture me slowly?" A massive pyre had been set up in front of the palace. Bai Weiwei lay amidst the firewood, her tranquility and softness akin to someone in a deep sleep. Xiao Mo, with eyes reddened from weeping, was filled with silent rage. He rasped out, "Commence the funeral rites for my mother, the Empress Dowager." Aside from Mu Yanjun, everyone inside the palace had accepted that it was time to bid Bai Weiwei farewell. Mu Yanjun's followers, believing their Supervisor Master had become obsessively infatuated, allowed the Emperor to proceed with burning Bai Weiwei's body. The fire blazed instantly. Xiao Mo, unable to bear the sight, fell to his knees, sobbing uncontrollably. But before the flames could reach Bai Weiwei's body, a shadowy figure hurtled toward the pyre, fearlessly diving into the flames. It emerged with Bai Weiwei's body in tow, leaping out of the fire. Upon recognizing the figure, Xiao Mo, filled with loathing, screamed, "Mu Yanjun, may you be cursed! You caused my mother's death, and now you even seek to tarnish her corpse. You're inhuman." Mu Yanjun, holding Bai Weiwei, his hair tips and clothes charred but her body unharmed, replied indifferently, "It appears the vermin dare to trample over me. It's time to cleanse the palace." With that declaration, Mu Yanjun descended into darkness, relinquishing any remaining shred of humanity, returning to his former self: sinister, merciless, the sovereign known as Nine Thousand Years. The Emperor was confined. Within the palace, those who were to be killed were executed, and the complicit were purged. Particularly those who had conspired to send Bai Weiwei's body to the flames, whether they were Mu Yanjun's confidants or not, were executed without exception. Mu Yanjun refused to show any more compassion; he treated the Emperor as a puppet and the world as a slaughterhouse. Murder became his sole pleasure. Mu Yanjun, gazing outside at the blood-drenched grounds, gently stroked Bai Weiwei, who lay in his embrace, his voice soft but ominous, "Weiwei, see how I've spilled blood again today. Will you not entreat me for mercy, and I might stop?" Bai Weiwei remained still as ever. Mu Yanjun's smile was a mask for his sorrow, "Your silence leaves me no choice but to continue." He had once vowed that if she dared to die, he would drag everyone to hell with her as her burial companions. Embracing her icy body, Mu Yanjun whispered enticingly, "I am indeed a wretched man, but if you were willing to teach me, perhaps I could change." Enveloped in grief, he rested his head against her cold neck, tears tracing a silent path down his cheeks. "Why do you refuse to give me a chance to become better?" Chapter 191: Reality 1 When Ye Yuxuan struggled to rise from his bed, he was soaked through with sweat. His body was wracked with shivers, and his face was ghostly pale. Succumbing to an unbearable urge, he hugged himself, teeth gritted as though trying to scream out someone's name. Yet, after many silent murmurs, he couldn't vocalize the name of the woman haunting his dreams. His heart raced; with closed eyes, he could see the spreading flames of his nightmares, threatening to consume him at any moment. He looked down at his hands as if still cradling her. The joy, sorrow, and anger he felt were slowly fading, but the love etched deep in his bones seemed to have been transmitted to him from a man named Mu Yanjun. Ye Yuxuan knew he had been off-kilter lately, and this disconcerting change was now stirring his emotions. For example, he was currently grappling with an unfamiliar sensation... was it sadness? His chest ached as if pierced through, yet after exhaustive examinations with every imaginable instrument, no physical ailments were found. Lost in thought, Ye Yuxuan lingered in bed a while longer before finally rising. As he did so, a servant approached and whispered, "Doctor Qin has arrived." Ye Yuxuan nodded slightly, requesting the servant brings him a glass of water, and then he descended the stairs, holding the glass. Upon reaching the bottom, he noticed the front door of his home was open; Qin Qiu was directing a team of medical personnel who were carrying medical equipment inside. Ye Yuxuan observed quietly, his dark eyes betraying no ripple of emotion. Qin Qiu, catching sight of Ye Yuxuan, was accustomed to his stoic façade and hurriedly greeted him, "My room is still available, right?" Ye Yuxuan nodded, "Isn't your room always reserved indefinitely?" Having many rooms in his residence, and Qin Qiu being a regular visitor, one had been permanently set aside for him. "I know," Qin Qiu replied, "which is why I'm making temporary use of it." Ye Yuxuan remained mute. Without prompting, Qin Qiu added, "You think I'm here to stay, but you'd be wrong. I'm swamped with hospital affairs; I couldn't possibly live here full-time." Ye Yuxuan couldn’t even muster a hum in response. Qin Qiu continued, "So, I've offered my room to your fiancée." Ye Yuxuan took a beat before responding evenly, "Bai Weiwei?" "Exactly," Qin Qiu confirmed, "I've already had her settled in. Old Master Zao suspects many problems within his household, particularly after Bai Weiwei's abduction from the hospital two days ago. He feels he can't trust anyone around him, so he's entrusted Bai Weiwei to you for the time being. You are her betrothed, aren't you?" Ye Yuxuan reflected for a moment, "I lack the time to tend to a patient." "She's your fiancée," Qin Qiu reminded him. Ye Yuxuan nodded, "Then I suppose I don't need a fiancée." Qin Qiu, clearly shocked, exclaimed, "What?" "If you wish to bring her here, that's fine, but you will have to look after her," Ye Yuxuan declared. Qin Qiu exploded, "She is not my fiancée!" With an air of nonchalance, Ye Yuxuan suggested, "Then I'll gift her to you." Qin Qiu felt a surge of frustration that threatened to spew forth like a fountain of old blood. Ye Yuxuan was not suited for a fiancée; he was more fit to be paired with a machine. Qin Qiu resolved to stop engaging with this emotionally stunted individual. He needed tranquility—no, he needed to arrange Bai Weiwei's accommodation. Given her delicate health and uninterrupted slumber, she required constant care and medical equipment to sustain her life. Efficient as ever, Qin Qiu set up the equipment, and after confirming Bai Weiwei's condition was stable, he instructed the caregiver to maintain a vigilant watch overnight. Exiting the room, Qin Qiu encountered Ye Yuxuan, who was still seated on the living room sofa with his water glass in hand, seemingly enshrouded in deep contemplation. Chapter 192: Reality 2 Qin Qiu's throat was parched, and after a servant brought him water, he took a large gulp before inquiring, 'Having trouble sleeping?' Ye Yuxuan gave a slight nod, 'There's something I need to mull over.' Qin Qiu settled onto the sofa across from him, sipping water as he asked, 'What's troubling you? Is the company in jeopardy?' Ye Yuxuan maintained a calmness that belied the gravity of his thoughts, 'I'm wrestling with the notion... Would I ever desecrate her remains?' Qin Qiu choked on his water, 'Desecrate her remains!' Ye Yuxuan, unaffected, continued, 'In the dream, I encountered that man, tormented by the urge to commit such an atrocity. It's unsettling.' Qin Qiu interjected, 'Hold on, what bizarre dream did you have this time?' A rare haze of confusion drifted across Ye Yuxuan's expression as he confided, 'I dreamt of her passing, yet her body remained as though she were merely sleeping, possessing a certain... charm.' Qin Qiu's voice took on a mockingly playful tone, 'Charm?' Ye Yuxuan describing someone as charming was as unlikely as the heavens collapsing. Ye Yuxuan emphasized, 'Exactly, charming,' before he resumed, 'And the man in my dream, he was repeatedly on the brink of defiling her. But each time, he was somehow restrained by her serene countenance.' — Sequel to 'Affairs of the Supervisor Master and the Empress Dowager': Mists rose from the hot springs, shrouding the area where a delicate and alluring figure lay quietly by the water, her black hair trailing in the pool, undulating like seaweed. Mu Yanjun's cheeks were flushed, his gaze burning with a frightening intensity. He fought with his self-control for a long while before finally releasing her, resisting the most heinous of impulses. He pondered over when this obsession had begun. Was it the sight of her unresponsive, lifeless body that had seen his mind fray, warp into something monstrous? He had tried every means to stop himself, yet in the end, he couldn't resist peeling away her clothes. Only when his skin met her cool flesh did he truly feel alive. Murder no longer stirred any emotion in him. She was dead. He was acutely aware of that fact. He also knew just how dark and terrifying he was for not laying her to rest. The moment the Little Emperor, at just six years old, preferred to incinerate her body rather than let him have it, could have been a premonition of the vile acts he was capable of. Several times he nearly yielded, but each time he gazed at her peaceful face, he refrained. He feared that if he went further, she might become enraged, might reject him. They were wed, except for the consummation. Still, he didn't dare to take the gamble. Mu Yanjun managed to quell the inferno within himself, avoiding the ultimate transgression. After washing and dressing her with meticulous care, he lifted her and left the chamber. The palace was empty, the servants scattered. When he discovered that the Little Emperor was amassing forces, ready to assert his autonomy, he didn't stand in his way. At times, he even lent his support. The Emperor had grown; Mu Yanjun figured he was now sixteen. Ten years had flown by, a decade he had spent guarding Bai Weiwei's cold remains. How swiftly time had passed, yet how painfully slow it seemed. Clutching Bai Weiwei, Mu Yanjun moved slowly towards the palace entrance, where he was met by a strikingly tall, armored young man wielding a sword, leading the imperial guards outside the palace. The youth's face was stern and handsome. Pointing his sword at Mu Yanjun, he declared fiercely, 'Traitor Mu, return my mother, the Empress, and I may yet allow you a dignified demise.' Chapter 193: Reality 3 The Little Emperor grew up swiftly, subsisting in a life of indignity beneath Mu Yanjun's oppressive presence. It was within this deep humiliation that he bloodily clawed his way up to power and authority, and now, he finally wielded a sword, ready for vengeance. Mu Yanjun's visage was the picture of calm as he tenderly smoothed a strand of Bai Weiwei's hair, tousled by the wind, tucking it behind her ear. His gaze was suffused with an ineffable softness, then he turned his eyes to the Little Emperor. 'Do you persist? She has been mine from the very beginning; what makes you think you have any right to her?' The Little Emperor's eyes blazed with fury, his every word heavy with vehemence, 'My mother has departed this world. Respect is due to the deceased. How can you—how dare you—cling to her remains, denying her spirit tranquility and rebirth?' The entire palace was aware of how Mu Yanjun had shared living quarters, even a bed, with the late Empress Mother. The Little Emperor, privy to Mu Yanjun's clandestine actions, loathed the vile thoughts this man had for his mother. 'You proclaim your love for my mother incessantly, yet your deeds only degrade her. How do you have the gall to profess love?' The Little Emperor's voice nearly broke under the weight of his grief, cursing his own powerlessness to shield Bai Weiwei and lamenting the cruel fate that denied her a funeral befitting her stature. Mu Yanjun regarded the Little Emperor with a gaze dark as the abyss, a smile then breaking the stillness, 'I did it purposefully. I have heard that by withholding a body's burial, the soul remains shackled to it.' The Little Emperor suddenly remembered that this traitor, Mu Yanjun, had once summoned high monks to the palace. As expected, he heard Mu Yanjun continue with a sinister chuckle, 'I had the monks cast the Soul-locking Talisman. If souls do persist post-mortem, she will be unable to escape me, eternally bound to remain by my side.' The Little Emperor shook with unchecked rage, his eyes red as blood, 'Mu Yanjun, is this your manner of loving someone? You are beyond deranged.' Mu Yanjun's smile widened grotesquely, his madness laid bare, 'I've been a madman for ages. Even in death, she shall not be free of me. I desire her to be entwined with me, life after life.' The Little Emperor commanded with fevered urgency, 'Break through and capture him!' He would find no peace until Mu Yanjun was torn asunder. Yet before anyone could move, flames surged forth. The palace, previously soaked in oil, ignited with a single spark, fanned by the wind, into a towering inferno. To escape the flames, all retreated. The Little Emperor beheld Mu Yanjun amidst the blaze, clutching Bai Weiwei, and impulsively, he surged toward the flames. His aides immediately grasped him, their urgency palpable, 'Your Majesty, you must not enter! The flames are insurmountable. If you enter, you will not survive!' The Little Emperor, driven by desperation and disregarding his own safety, screamed at Mu Yanjun, 'Mu Yanjun, unhand her, I implore you with all my being, release her!' The conflagration would persist, unquenched, until all was ash. Mu Yanjun held Bai Weiwei close; as the flames consumed them, they became inseparable. Upon hearing the Little Emperor's plea, Mu Yanjun glanced up and smiled. In the fire's glow, his smile was one of unspeakable release and relaxation, enhancing the vivid allure of the Tear Mole beneath his eye, a mark believed to be laden with sorrowful beauty. Then, cradling Bai Weiwei, he turned and resolutely stepped into the inferno's embrace. In life, they were separated, but in death, they would merge; their ashes inseparable. For ten years, he had yearned to become one with her, halting just before the final act. He knew that even if he possessed her body, it would be but an empty shell. If there were another life, and she learned of his depraved desires, she might never desire him again. Now, in death, they would burn together, unable to be torn apart, eternally united. Chapter 194: Reality 4 Mu Yanjun couldn't help but embrace her even more tightly as the flames began to consume their bodies. He gazed down at her, and resting his head against her neck, murmured softly, "I miss you so much, Weiwei." --- Qin Qiu held his throbbing head, perplexed by the absurdity. "Eventually, the Little Emperor became too frustrated to separate their ashes and had no choice but to inter them together in a single urn," Ye Yuxuan went on. Qin Qiu dismissed it with a wave of his hand, "You've definitely got issues lately." Ye Yuxuan conceded, "I know." Qin Qiu asserted, "You've become twisted from holding back, hence these twisted dreams. You’ve been dreaming about romance non-stop lately—no point in denying it. You're just love-starved." Ye Yuxuan looked at him silently. Qin Qiu slapped his hands together emphatically, "Why the look? If not for this, why else the weird dreams? You haven’t been near a woman in years, not to mention barely intimate. What man lives like that?" Ye Yuxuan spoke calmly, "It doesn’t seem like a dream, but rather like it's real." Qin Qiu blurted out, "Your delusions have gotten that bad? To the point where you mistake dreams for reality?" Ye Yuxuan, tired of persuading, stood up, "I’m going to the office." Qin Qiu grabbed him, "Why head to the office at 4 A.M.? You should be seeking a relationship, breaking this eternal bachelor spell. I’ve seen my share of guys like you, all pining for a woman to the point of insanity." Ye Yuxuan struggled to free his hand, but Qin Qiu's grip was firm. Qin Qiu went on, "You should meet your fiancée, start dating, and then naturally progress to the more intimate things. That way, you won’t constantly have these frustrated dreams." Ye Yuxuan commanded, "Let go." Qin Qiu encouraged, "Don’t be bashful, lad. I’ve been through it—I get the torment of never having been in love..." Ye Yuxuan interjected, "Eternal bachelor, let go." Qin Qiu stood shocked, as if electrocuted. With ease, Ye Yuxuan overcame his overbearing friend, turned without expression, and left for the company at dawn. Qin Qiu clutched his chest, "Ye Yuxuan, I shouldn’t have saved your future wife. You deserve to taste the bitterness of solitude." Once Ye Yuxuan had left, Qin Qiu sighed, feeling years older. He decided to check on Bai Weiwei, who was still asleep. But just as he opened the door, he heard the nurse’s voice, "Miss Bai, hold on, you can't remove the needle like that." Bai Weiwei was beyond caring; her current objective was to destroy the System. The accursed System had exchanged her month's worth of life points for a Life Extension Elixir, depleting an entire month's worth of her lifespan. This, on top of the Life Safety Subsidy from the previous Plane, meant a deduction of five days' worth of life points. She woke up to the reality of being in debt to the System for five days of life, which immediately triggered her heart condition. In a desperate move to keep her alive, the System automatically used the Life Extension Elixir, securing ten days of life. After more deductions, only five days were left. Following further deductions, a mere hour remained. From five days, or one hundred and twenty hours, it had dwindled to just one hour. She was determined to obliterate the System; it was clear who had played a hand in this. The System tried to soothe her, "Host, please stay calm." Bai Weiwei snapped, "Calm your own nerves." The System attempted consolation, "See the bigger picture. It's only a few life points. Don’t take it to heart." Bai Weiwei exploded, "Bigger picture? You’d better shut it, or I'll stuff you into a beer bottle and smash it with a hammer." Chapter 195: Reality 5 The System immediately fell silent. Bai Weiwei didn't have the luxury to inquire about what had specifically reduced her lifespan to a mere hour; she had more pressing matters at hand. She leapt from the bed and hurried to the door, only to find Qin Qiu staring at her in astonishment. Having met him a few times in his role as the hospital director, she didn't waste a moment and asked, "Qin Qiu, a pleasure to see you. Where are we?" Upon waking in a strange room, she speculated if this was some super VIP hospital ward. Qin Qiu immediately explained, "This is your fiancé’s house. Your father wishes for you both to cultivate a deeper bond... Good heavens, what are you undertaking?" Bai Weiwei's hand had shot out, snatching at his clothes with the urgency of a wolf cornering its prey. She couldn't spare a second for his words, and promptly fished out a mobile phone from his pocket, dialing her father with frantic urgency. As soon as the call connected, she blurted out, "Father, that wretched Bai Yaoyao is trying to kill me. My heart condition flared up, and she tampered with my medicine, aiming to usurp my fiancé, my position at the company, and everything I own. I narrowly survived; previously, she even had the audacity to get that scoundrel An Le to abduct me with the intent to drown me. You'd better get someone to restrain her, and then when I get back..." She halted briefly, then continued forcefully, "...when I return, I intend to slap her senseless, to hammer into her that a wild hen can never transform into a phoenix. Even if she somehow managed to become one, I would pluck her feathers and cook her in a stew." There was a long pause on the other end as her words were processed. Then, a soft giggle came through, "Sister, I'm at a loss as to what you're talking about. Could it be that your illness has taken a toll on your sanity?" A shiver ran down Bai Weiwei's spine—Bai Yaoyao? "Where's Father?" she asked sharply. "Our father? He's asleep. You shouldn't disturb him so late at night," Bai Yaoyao replied with a veneer of concern. Bai Weiwei's voice turned frosty, "What are you scheming?" "My scheme? I'll tell you plainly: I want you dead. Will you oblige by dying?" Bai Yaoyao sneered. Bai Weiwei took a deep breath, "He's your father too. Don't hurt him." "My father? Reflect on this—has Bai Changyan ever held me in anything but disregard? In his eyes, you are his precious gem, while I am nothing more than a weed. If you were in trouble, he'd be beside himself with worry, but if I died, would he even bat an eyelid?" Bai Yaoyao retorted bitterly. Bai Weiwei was now outside her room, facing the lavishness of an unfamiliar mansion—a vast living room crowned by an extravagant crystal chandelier. The butler maintained his nightly vigil, and the servants glided silently to and fro. The front door, apparently custom-designed, was impenetrable without permission. Could this be Ye Yuxuan's residence? It was only then she spared a thought for her distant and entirely ineffective fiancé—a man whose wealth rivalled that of nations. "Name your price. As long as you don't harm Father, I agree to anything," Bai Weiwei's voice revealed her Achilles' heel—her father. Despite Bai Changyan's youthful missteps, which had led to Bai Yaoyao's birth, he had lavished Bai Weiwei with all his affection. A gleeful chuckle came from Bai Yaoyao, "My sister, my always majestic and unapproachable sister, have you finally stooped to pleading with me? I'm at home right now, with our beloved father right beside me." As Bai Weiwei approached the formidable door, Bai Yaoyao's voice, still dripping with arrogance, continued to echo in her ear. "Father's strapped to a bomb, and now you must choose. Will you trade your life for his, or will you watch as he meets his fate?" Chapter 196: Reality 6 Bai Weiwei closed her eyes, mustering serenity amidst the storm of her emotions. When she reopened them, they were alight with a fierce resolve. 'I choose to trade my life for it.' Qin Qiu had just entered the room when he was struck by Bai Weiwei's solemn words. His face etched with confusion, he asked, 'What's going on?' Without turning, Bai Weiwei ordered, 'Open the gate; I require your automobile.' Sensing the gravity in Bai Weiwei's tone, Qin Qiu promptly instructed the servants to open the gate, then fetched his car. Bai Weiwei was quick on his heels. As Qin Qiu was about to open the car door, she pushed him aside, seized the driver's seat, slammed the door, and the vehicle lunged forward, a flurry of actions executed with a desperate precision. By the time Qin Qiu recovered, the car was but a speck in the distance. In disbelief, he chased after his car, shouting, 'Bai Weiwei, you owe me a phone!' Without it, how could he continue his battles in the world of 王者荣耀? --- Ye Yuxuan's dwelling lay about an hour's journey from her own. Bai Weiwei drove as if the reaper itself were at her heels. When she arrived, the System intoned, 'Ten minutes remain.' Was it too much to ask for a little more time in this world? What dark purposes did the System have for her life points? She had yet to live through an entire day. Bai Weiwei bypassed the need for keys with her fingerprint, and stepped into the silence of her home. The usual flurry of attendants was nowhere to be seen. Had Bai Yaoyao released them all? Bai Weiwei's heart raced. If not for the life points enhancing her physicality, she might have succumbed to a heart attack by now. Abruptly, Bai Yaoyao materialized at the stairway, 'Sister, you've returned.' Bai Weiwei's eyes were two chips of ice, 'Where is father?' Bai Yaoyao gazed at her with feigned tenderness, 'Father has succumbed to the lull of sleeping pills; his suspicion runs deep. It was only after much effort that I was able to coax him into slumber.' Bai Weiwei ascended, 'You crave my death; what do you intend to do? Would you have me leap from a window, or would you prefer to slash my face and stab me repeatedly until your fury is quenched?' Bai Yaoyao suddenly backed away, 'Please, no closer, sister. Your special abilities terrify me.' Immune to poison, cars that defy gravity. While she deemed these events ludicrous, she couldn't deny the fear they instilled. As Bai Weiwei paused, the System's cold voice cut through, 'Three steps remain, hurry, Weiwei, ascend.' Unanticipated guidance from the System left her puzzled. What did 'three steps remain' mean? In that moment of uncertainty, she chose to heed the System's urgency. Bai Yaoyao's expression contorted, 'Stop!' Only a few paces more and Bai Weiwei would be within arm's reach. But Bai Weiwei surged forward, and as she did, the System chimed, 'Ding, Lovey-Dovey Mode activation confirmed, effective for three minutes. Please revel in the blissful rapture.' Just as Bai Yaoyao was about to scream for An Le to end Bai Changyan's life, her consciousness was jolted by an imperceptible force, her pupils scattered. When she came to, her eyes shone with a disturbing adoration for Bai Weiwei. 'Sister, my love for you is boundless!' Bai Weiwei, momentarily stunned by the bizarre turn of events, watched as Bai Yaoyao lunged for an embrace. Startled, Bai Weiwei repelled her with a kick. As Bai Yaoyao crumpled to the floor in a heap, she looked up in a blissful daze, 'To strike is to love, to scold is to cherish; sister, please kick me again.' Bai Weiwei, obliging her warped wish, shoved her away with her foot. 'Be gone, you lunatic.' Chapter 197: Reality 7 As An Le emerged, he was met with the sight of Bai Weiwei expelling Bai Yaoyao with a forceful kick. He immediately drew out the remote control for the bomb. Rushing to Bai Yaoyao's side, he wrapped her in his arms and warned Bai Weiwei, 'I implore you to reconsider. With a mere press of this button...' Bai Weiwei, teeth clenched in anger, retorted, 'An Le, you ingrate, you know well the kindness my father has shown you. To stoop to such lows for this harlot...' Before An Le could articulate a defense, Bai Yaoyao, seething with fury, sprang to her feet and twisted An Le's cheek with a slap. 'You've vexed my sister; now feel the wrath of the Love Peach, a slap born from affection, just for you.' An Le: '...' Bai Weiwei: '...' With an affectionate gaze towards Bai Weiwei, Bai Yaoyao delivered another slap to An Le's other cheek. 'Sister, even my strikes are shaped by the love I bear for you.' Bai Weiwei felt an upsurge of blood in her throat, a premonition of an impending heart attack. She needed her medication, and soon. An Le, face a picture of confusion, touched his cheek and muttered, '...' The System interjected nonchalantly, 'Upon my return, I witnessed those two miscreants tampering with the Life Extension Elixir for your father. With only ten days of life granted by the elixir, and five days already expended, a mere one hundred and twenty hours remain. Fearing that you might be threatened by these scoundrels upon your awakening, I had to exchange your life points for the Lovey-Dovey Package.' Bai Weiwei grasped her chest, 'Wouldn't it have been simpler to send Bai Yaoyao off to meet King Yama? Why implement such an absurd package?' The System sighed, 'We systems are governed by laws; we cannot directly take lives. Additionally, your financial constraints meant that you couldn't afford any offensive items. It was only during a discount that we managed to secure three precious minutes of the Lovey-Dovey Package with your remaining 119 hours. During those minutes, Bai Yaoyao's love for you will be as vast as the universe, and she will fulfill any command you give her.' After a moment's pause, the System voiced its concern: 'Your life is hanging by a thread, and the bomb still needs disarming. Once we navigate past this danger, we must proceed to the next task to ensure your survival.' Conscious that every second mattered, Bai Weiwei did not waver. She instructed Bai Yaoyao, 'Dismantle the bomb on my father.' The bomb had to be neutralized before Bai Yaoyao's life could be addressed. An Le, having previously experienced surreal events and now witnessing Bai Yaoyao's radical change, realized Bai Weiwei must be responsible. He seized Bai Yaoyao with both hands, 'Young Mistress, what sorcery have you wrought upon Yaoyao?' Bai Weiwei's countenance grew frosty, 'Do as commanded and remove the bomb from my father.' Her directive struck Bai Yaoyao like the Fireworks of Love, igniting a surge of immense strength within her. She upturned An Le effortlessly. 'Yes, my esteemed sister. Even the disarming of the bomb is an act shaped by my love for you.' Bai Yaoyao's face beamed with blissful fervor as she formed a large heart with her hands. With a sudden ferocious turn, she grabbed An Le by the collar, her expression monstrous. 'Did you not heed the words of our esteemed sister? Remove the bomb from our father.' Dread painted An Le's features, his voice laced with despair, 'Yaoyao, what venom has seduced your senses? Come back to reality. If the bomb is disarmed, you'll lose all your standing within the Bai family.' They had reached a point of no return. With Bai Changyan's life in jeopardy and Bai Weiwei's frailty, Bai Yaoyao's chance to dominate the Bai household was within reach. Suddenly, Bai Yaoyao was struck with a realization. She forcefully extracted the Self-defense Gun from An Le, pressing it beneath her chin, 'Proceed with the dismantlement, you oafish cur. Would you dare to disregard the orders of our dear sister? If you hesitate, I shall end my life before your very eyes.' Chapter 198: Reality 8 An Le was utterly shocked. Bai Weiwei added insult to injury, 'If he doesn't dismantle the bomb's remote control, kill him then kill yourself.' Bai Yaoyao's eyes brimmed with adoration, 'Yes, esteemed sister. I will certainly fire heart-shaped bullets; both murder and suicide will be in the shape of my love for you.' Bai Weiwei felt emotionally drained: She had no desire to converse with this love-struck simpleton, feeling as though her intelligence had plummeted to the earth's core. An Le, though distressed, couldn't allow Bai Yaoyao, bewitched by evil, to commit suicide. He had done everything for the sake of Bai Yaoyao. Bai Changyan, sedated with a heart-protecting pill, was in a profound slumber. Seeing her weary father lying there nearly brought Bai Weiwei to tears. Despite An Le's movements slowing down, the disassembly of the bomb's remote control was straightforward, and, before long, the task was completed. Bai Yaoyao gleamed, 'Sister, the bomb's remote control has been neutralized.' Bai Weiwei nodded, 'Well done. Now take him with you to death, farewell.' Tears of passion streamed down Bai Yaoyao's face, 'Even the manner in which you decree my death is so beautiful; enamored with you, I wish to become fireworks, to explode in the sky as symbols of my love for you.' Bai Weiwei: She wished she could cover her ears, damn your sentimentality. Bai Yaoyao, with a mix of satisfaction and wantonness, pointed the gun at An Le, 'Sister has decreed our end, farewell.' She fired the gun at An Le. However, in a critical moment, An Le ducked and rolled, evading the bullet, and with swift precision, he advanced on her and wrested the gun from her hands. His skills far surpassed Bai Yaoyao's. When serious, she was no match for him—not in the slightest. Bai Weiwei's expression changed; she knew that if An Le knocked out Bai Yaoyao, she and Bai Changyan would not escape An Le's malevolent grasp. And then, she heard the familiar warning from the system. 【Countdown: ten seconds... nine...】 Time was running out. Bai Weiwei's gaze hardened, she commanded Bai Yaoyao with urgency: 'Jump from the building, immediately, right now!' An Le was so obsessed due to his love for Bai Yaoyao. If Bai Yaoyao jumped, An Le would have no choice but to follow. As expected, without hesitation, Bai Yaoyao dashed towards the exit, 'Even in jumping, I shall express my love for you.' An Le bellowed, 'Yaoyao, what's gotten into you? Come to your senses!' He could no longer heed anything else, chasing after her desperately. Bai Yaoyao looked back, intent on jumping. Bai Weiwei quickly dialed a trusted associate at the company to protect Bai Changyan. She had forgotten this wasn't her phone, and in her urgency, dialed a familiar shortcut, not noticing the incorrect call history. As soon as the call connected, she urgently said, 'Hurry over, my father is in danger, Bai Yaoyao is the assailant, conspiring with An Le to murder him...' She hadn't finished speaking. A voice, cold and calm, came through. 'Who is this?' Bai Weiwei, startled, glanced at the phone, realizing her mistake in the frantic rush. There was no time for idle chat; she hung up and attempted to call the right person, but time had run out. 【The system gifts a Newcomer's Gift Pack, ding, unlocked, endowing the host with three days of life in a vegetative state, please complete the next task swiftly to ensure survival.】 Bai Weiwei finally lost her cool and yelled, 'Is this all you've got aside from newcomer packs?' Has the system become so destitute that it has nothing to offer but these basic bundles? Chapter 199: Reality 9 Ye Yuxuan stared at his phone, the voice on the other end striking a chord of recognition. Yet, in a fleeting moment of confusion, he couldn't place whose voice it was. He resumed his work, only to later recall that the number belonged to Qin Qiu. Redialing, he was immediately met with a barrage of anger. Qin Qiu's furious voice filled the line, 'Ye Yuxuan, listen, your fiancée's sister intends to kill her, to take her fiancé, her company, her position, everything. She even tried to drown her, and now she's targeting Bai Changyan's life. I'm at the hospital right now, Bai Yaoyao is attempting to jump off a building, Bai Weiwei is unconscious, and Bai Changyan has awakened...' Ye Yuxuan ended the call with unsettling composure. Was he losing the ability to distinguish dreams from reality? The voice from before, it was eerily similar to that of the woman in his dreams. But... Looking down at his phone, it was clear this was not a dream; Qin Qiu had indeed called twice. Seized by sudden urgency, he stood, grabbed his suit coat from the chair, and made a beeline for the exit. --- Qin Qiu arrived at the Bai residence just in time to witness Bai Yaoyao, joyously and stumblingly ascending the staircase, 'Sister, I love you, I love you, I love you, I'd leap from this building for you.' An Le chased after her, pleading, 'Yaoyao, come to your senses, you've been poisoned, subjected to deep hypnosis, what on earth have you taken? Don't jump off the building.' What on earth? Dumbstruck, Qin Qiu watched them sprint toward the highest floor, then hurried to find Bai Weiwei. Bai Weiwei lay pale and motionless beside the bed. Alarm struck Qin Qiu as he rushed to lift her into his arms. Anticipating danger, he had preemptively called for an ambulance and the police. After his call to Ye Yuxuan, the paramedics arrived, swiftly moving Bai Weiwei to the ambulance. Bai Yaoyao's leap was interrupted by an awning, resulting in severe trauma that necessitated immediate surgery. Bai Weiwei was stable, her vital signs steady, but she remained unconscious. Upon waking, Bai Changyan looked upon his daughter with a weary expression. The household's security footage had been sabotaged, leaving him in the dark about the incident. Nevertheless, his suspicions pointed to his second daughter's involvement in the recent turmoil. An Le was now confined, undergoing intense interrogation. When Ye Yuxuan arrived at the hospital, he found Qin Qiu sitting outside Bai Weiwei's room, silently shedding tears. Pausing, he stepped closer to Qin Qiu and inquired with a detached tone, 'What has happened?' Qin Qiu turned, phone in hand, 'I've just lost another ranked match.' Disregarding the remark, Ye Yuxuan pressed, 'To whom did you lend your phone earlier?' Qin Qiu replied, 'To Bai Weiwei.' Without a moment's delay, Ye Yuxuan pushed open the door to the room, and there, on the hospital bed, lay a woman. In her tranquil slumber, the toll of sickness was apparent, her once radiant beauty now drawn and pale. Her lips were devoid of color, her complexion pallid, and even her once glossy black hair had lost its vitality. Ye Yuxuan couldn't fathom his own reaction. Though he had seen her before, his betrothed, she had never made an impression on him. Qin Qiu, sensing the charged atmosphere, stepped inside. 'What are you looking at?' His gaze upon Bai Weiwei was intensely unsettling. After a moment of silence, Ye Yuxuan softly stated, 'When she awakens, I wish to hear her voice.' Her voice had, for a brief moment, stirred his dormant emotions, causing his steadfast heart to quiver. Chapter 200: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (1) Bai Weiwei regained consciousness to the sound of System's voice. [Your mission is to win Song Yunhuan's love. Target: Song Yunhuan, completion: zero percent. Time limit: four months.] She had no time to think further, for as she opened her eyes, she was confronted with a pair of eyes filled with disbelief and hatred. Startled, Bai Weiwei realized that her own hands had just forcefully pushed a person away. The man was young, his black hair catching stray beams of sunlight that crowned him with a ghostly aura. Underneath his disheveled hair was an exceptionally handsome face. That face now looked at Bai Weiwei with animosity as it fell from the vehicle. She instinctively reached out to grab his hand but only caught the sleeve of his clothing. Due to the forces of speed and gravity, the sleeve tore, and the man still fell, quickly disappearing into a group of fleshy... zombies? Bai Weiwei focused her eyes and inhaled sharply. She was standing on the edge of an open cargo truck, with people crowded inside. Outside, a horde of decaying zombies was fervently pursuing the truck. Each time a human tumbled from the truck, the undead horde descended like ravenous shadows, eager to feed. The man she had just pushed was now swallowed by the crowd of zombies, likely devoured completely. Then came the familiar notification from System. [Ding, the male lead's favorability has dropped to negative thirty-five. He harbors intense hatred for you, far more than for someone who would cold-heartedly betray you.] Bai Weiwei felt goosebumps. What was wrong with System, sounding as if it was taken over by the Lovey-Dovey Package? What was with this notification style? She then remembered something of utmost importance. Holding onto the piece of torn sleeve, she asked in confusion, "The man that this body just pushed out..." "Yes, that was the male lead," System cheerfully confirmed. Bai Weiwei felt the world tilt on its axis, reality blurring at the edges, realizing the blood on her metaphorical hands and the depth of the negative favorability she had accrued. Had she really just pushed the male lead to his death among the zombies? With the male lead gone, who was left for her to win over? Could this reality be... With a trembling voice, Bai Weiwei asked, "Ah Ling, this isn't some horror genre plane, is it?" System replied, "Just look at the zombies chasing after your truck; it's obvious to anyone that this is the Apocalyptic Zombie Plane." Bai Weiwei steadied herself, "But the person I'm supposed to charm has just been eaten by zombies." "Solving this dilemma is the host's duty, so good luck, my dear," System replied cheerfully, leaving Bai Weiwei reeling with revulsion. Had the System gone awry, possessed by the vengeful spirit of love that was Bai Yaoyao? System reminded her again, [Ding, please begin to integrate the memories of this body.] The familiar, otherworldly headache returned, as if memories were seeping into her mind through an invisible conduit, draining the color from Bai Weiwei's face. After the memories settled, she remained speechless for a long time. Her target, Song Yunhuan, and her current identity, Bai Weiwei, were college alumni. Bai Weiwei was admired for her delicate beauty and sweet voice, making her quite popular with the opposite sex. Song Yunhuan was a hermit, a tech guy who spent his days coding in his dorm. Although handsome, his gloomy nature did not endear him to women. The original Bai Weiwei and Song Yunhuan should have had no overlap in their lives. However, the previous Bai Weiwei was a deceptive seductress - outwardly pure, but inwardly reveling in the vanity of garnering men's favor with her woeful facade. Chapter 201: The Zombie King’s Irresistible Girlfriend (2) It was Song Yunhuan's enigmatic solitude that drew her gaze; not a single woman had succeeded in breaching his perimeter. To her, a man who disregarded the allure of women posed a tantalizing challenge. Thus, she boldly bet her dormmate that she could, in under a month, unravel this man—this unyielding stone who had forever been aloof to feminine charm. Song Yunhuan, a neophyte in the dance of courtship, was briefly spellbound by Bai Weiwei’s guise of innocence and hastily reciprocated her avowal of love. But their nascent romance wilted after a mere three days, its progress arrested at the threshold of a cinema outing, before Song Yunhuan pierced through Bai Weiwei’s deception. He even stumbled upon the wager she had struck with her dormmate. Branded by betrayal, Song Yunhuan broadcasted her manipulative schemes for all to see online and insisted on their immediate separation. In the wake of her humiliation, Bai Weiwei was poised to exact vengeance on Song Yunhuan when the cataclysmic outbreak of the doomsday virus and the relentless tide of zombies upended her plans. The duo, freshly untethered from their ill-fated romance, found themselves thrust into a harrowing escape. With a multitude clamoring for salvation and only one truck for refuge, Bai Weiwei was left scrambling for a foothold. A fleeting act of mercy from Song Yunhuan granted her passage aboard the truck; however, as the sting of his prior denouncement surged within her, retribution clouded her judgment, and she thrust the unsuspecting Song Yunhuan into the clutches of the voracious undead below. In the aftermath of her betrayal, Bai Weiwei was transposed to another reality. Bai Weiwei gazed at her hands in dismay—why had her reflexes failed her when it mattered most to save Song Yunhuan? With him now a feast for the zombies, who would be her next pawn? Was it conceivable to charm the zombies themselves? No, she must prioritize her own preservation. Perched precariously at the truck’s rear door, overburdened by the mass of desperate survivors, her ejection was imminent. Some had already commenced their covert nudging; her fate, if she fell, was to join Song Yunhuan in death. The system’s prompt broke through her thoughts, 'Side quest reward distribution, please accept, Host.' Bai Weiwei: 'Accepted.' What she desired was an apex skill for navigating the apocalypse—or, failing that, a sanctuary from the chaos. The system announced: 'Ding, Irresistible Charm trait delivered.' Bai Weiwei considered: Irresistible Charm trait... In this apocalyptic hellscape, what purpose could such an accursed charm serve? It paled in comparison to a 'Golden Finger'* ability that might allow her to live without the need for sustenance. An urgent shout from the truck’s vanguard pierced the tension, 'The truck won’t accelerate; the zombies will catch us at this rate!' Weighed down by an excess of survivors, the truck teetered on the brink of failure—a harbinger of a gruesome end for all aboard. 'Should we... let some people off?' Though the question was asked without an owner, it echoed the silent wish of everyone present. Yet, none wished to volunteer for the grim walk into the jaws of death. Bai Weiwei, standing at the edge of oblivion, was nearly pushed beyond the brink. Should a purge ensue, she would undoubtedly be the first sacrifice. Predictably, there were those among the crowd already plotting her expulsion. As Bai Weiwei’s face contorted with indignation, she recognized the instigator as a senior from her college days. A man who had seemed the epitome of mildness and decorum was now a portrait of duplicity and self-preservation. She was about to protest when a sudden gust of wind swept past her, and the system intoned, 'Ding, Irresistible Charm trait activated.' A vision of pink, heart-shaped bubbles with subtitles floated before her eyes. 【Her chestnut locks, kissed by the wind, framed her radiant visage, her eyes, clear and shimmering, held an enchanting light, as untouched and pristine as a young fawn...】 Bai Weiwei: What is this nonsense? The senior looked upon her, transfixed, a flush of red coloring his cheeks. Bai Weiwei, with a furrowed brow, poised to speak, when yet another sequence of pink subtitles appeared. 【Her brows drew together, her visage of striking beauty now wore a sorrow that invoked an instinctive desire to protect.】 Bai Weiwei: '...' *Golden Finger: A term often used in speculative fiction to describe a special ability or advantage that allows a character to overcome obstacles or achieve success in extraordinary ways. Chapter 202: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (3) The upperclassman's heart seemed to be ensnared by her melancholy as he abruptly took her hand. 'You shouldn't stand here; it's dangerously easy to fall. Let's move further inside.' Wasn't he about to push her off just moments ago? His attitude had changed with bewildering speed. The upperclassman cleared a path through the crowd, escorting Bai Weiwei deeper into the secure confines of the vehicle. Bai Weiwei observed the significant influence this upperclassman, Lin Xiao, wielded; many appeared fearful of him, and his commands were met with prompt obedience. In this apocalyptic setting, anyone else forcing their way into the vehicle would likely have incurred the wrath of the crowd, risking being cast out. They arrived at the very back. A small clique had formed here, with Lin Xiao as one of its key figures. He guided her to a seat in the most sheltered spot, 'Weiwei, take a seat here. Once the vehicle breaks out of the city, my uncle, a senior military officer, will come to retrieve us.' He then sat next to Bai Weiwei, his cheeks flushed with a timid yet ardent gaze. Bai Weiwei kept her silence, eavesdropping on discussions about who might be left behind. It became clear to her that Lin Xiao came from a powerful family, especially an uncle who was a high-ranking military official. This elite group, all scions of wealth and power, explained their preferential treatment amid the crisis. With the vehicle's fuel dwindling, it served as a temporary refuge, assured of rescue due to the presence of these influential heirs. As a scream pierced the air, Bai Weiwei's brow creased. She was about to interject when Lin Xiao reassured her, 'Don't be afraid. Such accidents are commonplace now, but you'll be safe.' Bai Weiwei looked at him quizzically. Were they that close? The original host's memories depicted Lin Xiao as reserved and gentle, someone who never mingled with their group. Could it be that Lin Xiao had harbored a secret affection for the Bai Weiwei of the past? Just as this thought crossed her mind, the pink subtitles popped up again. 【Her downcast beauty, as gentle as the clouds at dawn and the mist over the sea, seemed so fragile that it stirred a protective instinct, an instinctive yearning to protect, to envelop her in warmth...】 Lin Xiao's excitement surged, 'You have nothing to fear, I will protect you, and ensure that you are not harmed by the storm.' After a moment of speechlessness, Bai Weiwei tapped into the System, 'What's with these pink subtitles?' Only she could see them, triggering an intense embarrassment. System: 'That's the effect of your Charm Aura. To them, you're a figure of poignant beauty and unparalleled grace.' Bai Weiwei felt a wave of exhaustion, 'Can you block them?' These subtitles were insufferable, almost driving her to distraction. System: 'They're blocked. However, the effect remains. In my opinion, the subtitles add a touch of youthful charm.' Bai Weiwei: Or perhaps the charm of the naive. As Lin Xiao passionately vowed to protect her, the System issued a sudden warning. 【Ding, the Male Lead's favorability has dropped to negative forty.】 Bai Weiwei was taken aback. Was Song Yunhuan still alive? At that moment, from the zombie horde that had engulfed Song Yunhuan, the mindless undead began to emit a terrifying, hoarse cry. It was as if they were seized by fear, or perhaps issuing some sort of warning. The zombies contorted violently, their decaying bodies torn asunder by an immense spatial force. From the pile of rotting flesh and severed limbs, a pale, colorless hand appeared, covered in blood, slowly flexing. Then, he rose steadily to his feet, his face hauntingly handsome, with a ring of blood-red hue surrounding the black of his pupils. He began to laugh softly. The laughter was hoarse and eerie. 'Bai Weiwei, I am ravenous for you.' Chapter 203: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (4) As the vehicle descended into chaos, Bai Weiwei was prepared for such a situation. Overcrowded and crawling, not even Lin Xiao's status as a privileged second-generation authority figure could stem the tide of the disaster that was unfolding. Particularly when zombies managed to leap onto the roof, and passengers near the rear door were dragged away by the undead, mayhem erupted within the confines of the vehicle. Amidst cursing and weeping, passengers shoved one another, and many fell out. The number of zombies seemed to inexplicably grow, drawn to their vehicle despite the presence of other potential victims, leading to a terrifyingly vast horde in relentless pursuit. The sight was so daunting it could strike terror into the faint-hearted. Bai Weiwei turned to the System, 'Is there anything that can repel zombies?' The System excitedly affirmed, 'Of course! The Mighty Zombie-Killing Agent, your reliable ally in the apocalypse, effortlessly eliminates the undead. For your peace of mind, choose the Mighty Zombie-Killing Agent.' Bai Weiwei commanded, 'I'll take a bottle.' With the stakes at their highest, she could ill afford to worry about anything else; if zombies feasted on her, all her strategies would come to naught. The System countered, 'That item comes with a steep price tag; you can't afford it on credit.' Despair washed over Bai Weiwei's face. 'After all the missions I've undertaken, why can't I accumulate any life points? Are you skimming them off? Have you left me bereft of everything?' The System responded with a gravity unbecoming of its usual self, 'How could you have nothing left?' Bewildered, Bai Weiwei questioned what she had left. The System replied in a cheery tone, 'You've still got me!' Dubious, Bai Weiwei asked, 'Can you drive away zombies?' The System sent her a virtual kiss, 'Not exactly, but I can cheer you on. Go, go, go—sending you a heart gesture!' A surge of exasperation rose in Bai Weiwei, feeling as if she was on the verge of coughing up blood. This system, more a bane than a boon, seemed intent on aggravating her. Furthermore, the System's manner of speaking was unbearably inane. Suddenly, Lin Xiao seized Bai Weiwei's hand with earnest intensity, 'Weiwei, don't be afraid, I won't let anything happen to you.' Bai Weiwei was blissfully unaware of the peculiar illusion her irresistible allure had woven around Lin Xiao. He timidly proposed, 'Weiwei, once we find safety, let's get married, okay?' Bai Weiwei was speechless. Lin Xiao, blushing, continued, 'I've even thought up names for our children. Ideally, we'd have two—one boy like me and one girl like you... hehe, and when we're both old, we can sit together at sunset, still deeply in love, admiring the beauty of life.' A sharp pain struck Bai Weiwei's chest, as if the mere thought could trigger a heart attack. Suddenly, a resounding thud from above signaled something had landed on the roof. The vehicle swerved and skidded, sending Bai Weiwei lurching forward. Lin Xiao's swift reflexes saved her from falling; they were nearly tangled together. After the collision, the vehicle jolted violently, ejecting many passengers, and the zombies swarmed. The ensuing scene was brutally savage, with the thick stench of blood permeating the air. The vehicle slowed until, with a dying gasp, it came to a stop. Screams filled the air as the halted vehicle spelled a death sentence for all. Lin Xiao's reactions were astoundingly quick—he grabbed Bai Weiwei's hand, shoved others aside, leapt from the vehicle, and they ran for their lives. Chapter 204: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (5) Those who failed to disembark were immediately engulfed by the advancing horde of zombies. Bai Weiwei didn't glance back, yet the cacophony of zombie roars and human screams chased after her, painting a picture of a living hell. Lin Xiao bolted ahead, navigating towards the outskirts of the city where an abandoned commercial district beckoned. He said, 'Once we break through here, we can make it to the outskirts. My uncle is waiting there.' Bai Weiwei, however, abruptly released Lin Xiao's hand and said with composure, 'Go ahead, I can't keep up with your speed.' She was being truthful; she genuinely could not match his stride. Lin Xiao, evidently well-conditioned and robust, possessed a stamina that far exceeded hers. She had already reached her physical limit by keeping pace with him thus far. Her legs were leaden, and her heart was beating so fiercely it caused her chest pain. She was well aware of her physical endurance limit and knew she had hit it. Regardless of her irresistible allure, Lin Xiao's character seemed reasonably good, adhering to the 'save one's self if you can' philosophy. Lin Xiao turned back, his face awash with gratitude, 'You truly have a good heart. Not only do you have the most enchanting eyes in the world, but you also possess the kindest soul.' Bai Weiwei could no longer contain herself as Lin Xiao went on, 'How can you be so endearing, so lovely, so...' Smack! Bai Weiwei's hand connected sharply, silencing his flattery. A momentary peace fell upon Bai Weiwei's world. After dodging several more zombie encounters, Lin Xiao realized that he couldn't flee the city with the 'lovely encumbrance' that was Bai Weiwei. Despite her being the most delightful of burdens. After all, his life was of paramount importance. Tears brimming in his eyes, Lin Xiao bid his farewell, 'Weiwei, wait for me. I'll come back for you, goodbye.' He then bolted away. Bai Weiwei muttered to herself, 'May we never meet again.' The System urgently advised, 'Quick, there's a place to hide just ahead.' Driven by the System's guidance, Bai Weiwei sprinted ahead. Zombies lunged at her, emitting a stench of decay that nearly made her vomit. It almost felt as though the zombies were toying with her, deliberately slowing their pace whenever she thought they'd catch her. Bai Weiwei spotted the warehouse indicated by the System, rushed inside, slammed the door shut, and barricaded it with any heavy object she could muster. The pursuing zombies wailed and pounded on the door outside, their cries causing Bai Weiwei's hair to stand on end — the prospect of being bitten by one of these abominations meant certain suicide. Becoming such a hideous creature was an unacceptable fate for her. The warehouse door proved to be remarkably durable, thwarting the zombies' attempts to enter for the time being. Exhausted, Bai Weiwei slumped to the ground and complained to the System, 'I suspect that one of those zombies out there could be Song Yunhuan.' Surviving amidst the zombie swarm was highly unlikely for Song Yunhuan. If he were still alive, he surely would have become one by now. The System acknowledged, 'Possibly.' Bai Weiwei's despair deepened, 'The male lead I'm supposed to charm isn't meant to be a decaying monstrosity with protruding eyes, pus oozing from every orifice, and sparse hair, is he?' The System retorted, 'No matter what, he is the male lead. Even if his appearance has deteriorated, your task is to persevere.' Bai Weiwei had an epiphany, 'I just realized something.' The System queried, 'What is it?' Bai Weiwei replied, 'My favorability level is only at negative forty.' The System observed, 'Negative forty is quite substantial. Are you not content with such a low favorability, considering your exceptional talents?' Chapter 205: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (6) Bai Weiwei sighed, 'In the last plane, I began with a negative fifty, but in this one, after pushing Song Yunhuan into a horde of zombies, I'm only at negative forty. It's clear that a threat to his virility truly ignites a man's hatred.' [System]: Could the host's focus be slightly misplaced? This lighthearted exchange with the System was merely a distraction for Bai Weiwei from the dreadful reality outside—a world teeming with zombies, a nightmare for anyone. Bai Weiwei glanced at the door and felt a wave of relief, 'Thank goodness for this sturdy door, or I would have already been zombie fodder.' No sooner had she spoken than the door vibrated, its screws bursting out one by one. [Bai Weiwei and the System]: '...' Suddenly, with a thunderous kick, the door splintered into fragments that clattered to the floor. Bai Weiwei sat frozen, as a stream of sunlight poured through the now-open doorway. A tall figure loomed in the doorway, backlit by the brightness, his dark hair framed by a sinister halo, his face—a visage of twisted charm and malice. 'I've found you, Bai Weiwei.' His voice, raspy and unexpectedly seductive, broke the silence. Bai Weiwei's mind raced with thoughts, as she swiftly gauged her next move. With feigned terror, her voice quivering, she uttered, 'Song Yunhuan?' Song Yunhuan's gaze was opaque, the crimson in his eyes intensifying as he smiled, 'Yes, did you think I wouldn't make it back?' Tears cascaded down Bai Weiwei's cheeks, and after several choked sobs, she sprang to her feet, hurled herself towards him, and clung to him tightly. Her loud sobs echoed with a mix of relief, guilt, and catharsis, 'Song Yunhuan, you're alive! It's such a relief... I'm so grateful you didn't die.' Song Yunhuan's body was unyielding and icy, resembling the dead. He looked down at Bai Weiwei with a deepening smirk, 'I was under the impression you would take pleasure in my demise.' Bai Weiwei gave his chest a light punch, her voice laced with faux petulance, 'I did hope for your end. How could you be so heartless towards me? I've never cared for someone as deeply as I care for you. How could you treat me so cruelly?' Her tone was deliberately flirtatious, betraying the manipulative nature of her charade. Song Yunhuan appeared confused by her act, 'You care for me?' Bai Weiwei lifted tearful eyes, 'Are you implying something else? I've always harbored deep feelings for you. It took immense courage to become your girlfriend. Yet you spurn and slander me, turning my affection into loathing. I truly desired your death.' Song Yunhuan's sardonic smile widened, the red in his eyes growing darker, 'Love, is it?' Bai Weiwei bit her lip, her demeanor a mixture of defiance and naivety, 'Indeed. Do you think I relish liking you? Do you grasp how humiliating it is to fancy someone of your stature? Your family's destitute, you're introverted; my friends find you distasteful. I've always aspired to marry into affluence. How could I possibly fall for someone as destitute as you?' [System]: Such blatant shamelessness. Bai Weiwei's lower lip trembled, her tears on the verge of falling, 'Yet, I'm inexplicably drawn to you. I've convinced myself you're a hopeless case, that you can't offer the life I seek. Nevertheless, I'm attracted to you. Too proud to chase after you, I confessed because of a dare with my dormmate.' Song Yunhuan stood in silence, deep in thought. Bai Weiwei's cheeks flushed anew, 'I never expected you to agree to date me...' Song Yunhuan pondered silently. Bai Weiwei's tone became sorrowful again, 'Yet you never returned my affections, and in a moment of impulsiveness... I'm relieved you survived.' Song Yunhuan suddenly erupted in laughter, 'Do you genuinely adore me that much?' Bai Weiwei's face turned crimson, 'It's shameful to always be the one confessing.' Song Yunhuan reached out, pulling her to her feet with ease, his smile more radiant than ever, 'Then, let me reciprocate. I have a particular fondness... for the prospect of you being devoured by zombies.' With that, he flung Bai Weiwei out the door. Outside, a swarm of zombies awaited. Chapter 206: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (7) Bai Weiwei: "Has my irresistible charm become useless?" She had believed that her performance, enhanced by her irresistible charm, would soften Song Yunhuan's heart at least a little. It was then that the System found the chance to remind her: "Irresistible charm only works on those with a favorability rating above zero." Song Yunhuan's favorability stood at a calamitous negative forty. She couldn't just brush it off as simply negative forty anymore—negative forty was perilously high. Bai Weiwei tumbled to the ground, her hands scraping against the concrete to cushion her fall, flaying her palms until they bled. The zombies encircling her, as if they detected the scent of fresh flesh, excitedly howled and converged upon her. Bai Weiwei's pupils constricted, "Damned System, does my irresistible charm work on these things?" The System responded indifferently: "Irresistible charm isn't meant to bewitch a horde of zombies; it's ineffective against anything that lacks consciousness." Zombies that have not evolved are devoid of consciousness. At the outset of this apocalyptic era, the only evolved zombie was Song Yunhuan. Bai Weiwei: "So, this side quest reward, apart from maybe bewildering a random passerby, is essentially useless?" The System offered encouragement: "Once you elevate someone's favorability to above zero, the charm will become effective." Bai Weiwei roared in frustration: "How can I wait for that when I'm about to be devoured?" No sooner had she finished her dialogue with the System than a group of zombies lunged at her. Bai Weiwei executed a frantic roll on the ground, narrowly dodging the zombies' onslaught. Her eyes, filled with helpless despair, found Song Yunhuan's gaze. Song Yunhuan still smiled, standing bathed in sunlight, yet his eyes were cold with a sinister chill. The zombies, seemingly on command, intensified their attack on Bai Weiwei. With their mouths agape and foul teeth exposed, they rushed forward, eager to grasp her. Bai Weiwei realized there was nowhere to hide; the entire warehouse was swarmed by zombies. And within the warehouse, aside from Song Yunhuan, no zombie dared to approach. Bai Weiwei, preferring to be torn to shreds by Song Yunhuan rather than fed to the zombies, thought bitterly, 'At least Song Yunhuan is handsome.' Just as she reached the warehouse, her foot was caught by something, and she was violently thrown to the ground. A zombie's hand firmly grasped her calf, dragging her toward the outside. Bai Weiwei's fingers dug into the ground, her fingertips bleeding profusely. She felt the sharp nails of the zombie piercing into the flesh of her leg, as blood began to pour out. Shivering, she suddenly felt engulfed in shadow. Looking up, she saw Song Yunhuan looming above her, slowly squatting down, his handsome face twisted into a ghastly smile. The smile was tinged with a trace of malicious satisfaction. "Do you realize, Bai Weiwei, when you pushed me out, I felt just as you do now—hopeless with no escape, left to the zombies' gnawing hunger." Bai Weiwei's eyes welled up with tears, her voice quivering: "I apologize, Song Yunhuan." His smile warped for a moment, "Apologize for what? You, a woman of your nature, should epitomize selfishness; why bother apologizing to me?" As the zombie dragged her away, Bai Weiwei clawed at the ground with all her might, yet her eyes remained fixed on Song Yunhuan. "I'm sorry, Song Yunhuan. I know I'm not a good person. I'm selfish, vain, petty, and pleasure-seeking, yet it was not intentional. I didn't want you to die; I just wanted to frighten you. I never imagined failing to hold onto you." Bai Weiwei spoke through her sobs, unable to hold back her tears. With her last bit of strength, she stretched out and grabbed his hand. His sleeve ripped, leaving her holding onto a torn piece. Chapter 207: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (8) It was during Bai Weiwei's frantic efforts to pull him up that their bond began to tear. With every ounce of her strength, she gripped his hand, her face a canvas of guilt as she uttered, 'I'm sorry.' Song Yunhuan did not struggle; he allowed her to clutch his hand tightly. As Bai Weiwei's strength dwindled, it became clear that human might was no match for the zombies' overwhelming force, and she was at her very limit. Suddenly, Song Yunhuan's fingers tightened, clasping her own. A glimmer of hope, a touch of joy, sparked in Bai Weiwei's eyes. His voice was calm, even gentle by some measure, 'I believe you didn't intend any harm, but...' His thin lips curved up slightly, his eyes a dark abyss sending shivers down one's spine, 'What difference does it make?' With reluctance, he released his grip, finger by finger, allowing the light in Bai Weiwei's eyes to fade. As he let go, zombies dragged her out, their fingers digging into her calf, sending pain shooting up to her scalp. She was pulled out into the unforgiving sunlight, the zombies swarming, one after another, lunging at her. Bai Weiwei felt her skin tear on her legs, arms, back—zombies clawing and biting with relentless savagery. The System issued a dire warning: 'Alert, the host is in imminent danger, Life Safety Subsidy is being compulsorily activated.' Life Safety Subsidy activated compulsorily. The pain vanished as if it were never there, yet her life force continued its relentless ebb. She looked up, her eyes swirling with struggle and self-reproach, yet void of hate. Before the horde submerged her, Song Yunhuan caught the silent plea on her lips. 'Song Yunhuan, I'm sorry.' As if her only intention had been to scare him, but in a tragic twist of fate, she had failed to maintain her grip. Song Yunhuan stepped out of the warehouse. The zombies scattered in terror, each one avoiding Song Yunhuan's presence. Upon awakening, Song Yunhuan discovered his body decaying, yet inexplicably, his flesh was reconstituting itself. He did not become the grotesque form of a zombie. Instead, he retained his previous appearance, the only difference being his newfound boundless energy, immense strength, and a corpse-like body devoid of a heartbeat. His hatred for Bai Weiwei ran deep—he detested the transformation she had caused. This intense loathing drove him to subject her to the same hellish ordeal he had endured. Though Bai Weiwei was numb to pain, she remained acutely aware of the extent of her injuries. Her body was a mosaic of trauma. As her grip on consciousness began to wane, Bai Weiwei thought her end was certain. But then, as if by some miracle, the zombies dispersed. Her face was deathly pale, marked by the zombies' ferocity, a sight too harrowing to behold. When Song Yunhuan approached, Bai Weiwei's eyes met his. Her face, untouched by the chaos, still held its delicate beauty, and now, clouded with confusion, she exuded a pitiable softness. 'Does it hurt?' Song Yunhuan asked softly. Bai Weiwei could only gaze back, her pain so profound it left her without words. Her hand, stained with blood from her struggle, reached out. 'Song Yunhuan...' She struggled to draw closer to him. Song Yunhuan, feigning concern, leaned in closer, responding with a nonchalant hum, as if comforting a pitiable creature beneath his concern. Bai Weiwei mustered the strength to sit up, reaching her physical limits. She was unable to stand, but her hand managed to graze his face. Chapter 208: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (9) Dust and blood from her fingers smeared his face. Yunhuan Song remained stoic, seemingly bracing for her scornful invectives. Yet, Bai Weiwei sighed a breath of relief, her voice emanating a delicate softness, "Yunhuan Song, is my life coming to an end?" With a calm resolve, Yunhuan Song affirmed, "Yes." Bai Weiwei felt a sense of release, "Before I depart, may I share a few words with you?" Yunhuan Song watched her silently, his detachment palpable. Suddenly, Bai Weiwei's other hand seized his garment, pulling his head down with the last ounce of her energy. Yunhuan Song's frame stiffened, the red in his eyes deepening. Their lips touched briefly, and Bai Weiwei confessed with a smile, "I have deceived you so many times, feigning innocence, naivety, and pitifulness. But my affection for you, that has never been a lie." As she smiled, tears streamed down her cheeks. "I apologize for not grasping your hand earlier, causing you to fall, it was not intentional..." Her voice dwindled to a whisper. Her fingers lost their strength, slowly releasing his clothing. "Yunhuan Song, I hold affection for you..." She fell back to the ground, her eyes beginning to dim, death's pallor spreading over her. Darkness enveloped her, and she finally lost consciousness. It took a moment for Yunhuan Song to come to his senses and touch his lips, still feeling the imprint of her kiss, tainted with the blood from her fingers. He tasted it, finding the flavor unexpectedly sweet—humans were indeed the most delectable feast to his zombie palate. Yunhuan Song, my affection for you... Affection, is that so? [Ding, the male lead's favorability has dropped to negative thirty-five.] --- Bai Weiwei was certain it was the end. Captured and bitten by zombies, she was on the brink of transformation into a zombie. The Life Safety Subsidy, a measure designed to temporarily shield one's lifeforce from the brink, could sustain her for only a day, after which she would face excruciating agony. In a daze, she spoke to the System: "System, how can I pursue Yunhuan Song if I become a zombie? Bald, with crooked teeth and a face of decay, my entrails dangling... he certainly won't grow fonder of me." The System assured her with a gentle voice: "Fear not, we'll cleanse the necrotic tissue as per traditional medicinal practices, tuck the entrails back in, stitch it all up, and a wig will have you looking lovely again." Touched, Bai Weiwei asked in her delirium, "System, am I truly lovely?" The System replied: "Of course, even as a zombie, you'd be the fairest of them all." With renewed vigor, Bai Weiwei struggled until her eyes fluttered open, only to be met with confusion—she was in the room of an old house, well-worn but clean, with an air of long habitation. The pale green curtains fluttered in the wind. She arose, her wounds healed to white scars, her heartbeat and body wholly human. Against all odds, she had not turned. With relief, Bai Weiwei stepped out of bed and walked barefoot into the living room. There sat Yunhuan Song, absorbed in reading. His gaze lifted gently to her, "Awake?" Puzzled, Bai Weiwei inquired, "I'm not dead?" Yunhuan Song shook his head, "You have a unique constitution, immune to the zombie virus." Her eyes widened with surprise, then sparkled with joy, "Is that so? I am indeed fortunate." Seeing her exuberant smile, Yunhuan Song too smiled, "When you said you liked me, was that true?" Caught off guard, Bai Weiwei blushed, hesitating before finally looking up with courage. Her eyes shone brightly, filled with mirth, "Yes, I like you." Yunhuan Song's finger tensed against the book. Calming the turmoil within him, he stepped closer and tenderly stroked her cheek. With a gentle smile, he asked, "If your affection for me is so profound, would you be willing to die for me?" Bai Weiwei: "..."
Chapter 368: Narrow Escape The balance tipped decidedly in one direction as gunfire raged, enveloping the sea's airspace in smoke. Bai Ye, wielding his high-speed magnetic wave gun with a fondness akin to addiction, took down another aircraft. Xiao Naibao, with poised command, led the premier terrorist organization's air force into an impenetrable formation, initiating a final ferocious assault. Upon discerning their disadvantage, Nikla eschewed formality and blurted out, 'Master Louis, we must retreat. Persisting in this battle ensures our complete destruction.' Louis' fists clenched tighter, and a turbulent fury engulfed him. He could clearly see their dire circumstances yet the thought of retreating burned him; victory had been within arm's reach. His emerald eyes flickered with a murderous glint before sinking back into a deep melancholy. He gestured to Nikla, signaling a strategic withdrawal. Louis cast a final, contemptuous glance at the pair drifting above the waves. 'Consider yourselves lucky,' he hissed under his breath, 'but this isn't over.' 'Babe, they're retreating. Shall we pursue?' Bai Ye inquired, his lips curving into a sly, dangerous smirk. Xiao Naibao's elegant smile mirrored Bai Ye's sentiment as he instructed a ceasefire. 'No, the game of cat and mouse has just begun. It would be a waste to end his game too soon,' he stated, his dark eyes betraying a calm resolve. With the situation reversed, Louis had erred grievously in provoking them. Nuo Nuo's demise demanded retribution, and Xiao Naibao's pride would settle for nothing less. While Louis might dictate the game's outset, its conclusion was Xiao Naibao's prerogative. Adopting a nonchalant stance, Bai Ye agreed, 'Fine, no pursuit. We have ample resources to play this game, and Louis might just find himself targeted by others eager to claim his head.' Xiao Naibao watched their adversaries flee, his cold laughter unspoken. 'Chu Li, it's over. Stand down; we're returning to Rome immediately,' Bai Ye communicated, directing his team home. Black Hawk and his team expended Herculean efforts to rescue Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya, taking all precautions against the virus they harbored. Ye Sanshao, who had warned them of his own infection, was treated with utmost caution. Exhausted, Ye Sanshao lay gasping, and with a playful nudge, teased Cheng An Ya, 'Miss Cheng, you might consider losing some weight; you're a bit too heavy.' His shoulder numbed from the prolonged exertion in the water, not to mention the added burden of Cheng An Ya. The thought of nearly losing his grip on her in the sea sent a shiver down his spine. The team's spirits soared with their safety assured. Towels were passed, hot water poured, and the atmosphere buzzed with jovial teasing and the hearty spirit of camaraderie. Wrapped in a blanket to fend off the chill, Cheng An Ya ignored Ye Sanshao's taunts, a sneeze reminding her of their narrow escape. Black Hawk's chuckle echoed, 'Sanshao, the missus couldn't get much thinner, or she'd be just bones.' 'I'm already bothered by it,' Ye Sanshao retorted, drying off, 'Her bones are the very reason she's so heavy.' Choosing silence over argument, Cheng An Ya accepted a change of clothes from Black Hawk, the men's attire hanging comically on her frame. She preferred the blanket's cocoon. As they settled, Black Hawk relayed that Ning Ning wished to speak with her. Seizing the microphone with fervor, Cheng An Ya cried, 'Baby, it's mommy here!' 'Hey, mommy, missed me?' Xiao Naibao's voice, brimming with mirth, emanated from the sofa. It had been too long since he had heard his mother's voice. 'Not one bit,' Cheng An Ya retorted with feigned ferocity, 'You're too slow. Mommy needed you sooner. You deserve a spanking.' At the mention of Xu Nuo, Xiao Naibao's heart clenched, but he masked it with a smile, 'Ready for that spanking. Once in Rome, you can do as you please. But I did miss you, mommy. Your indifference wounds me.' 'Mutual disdain,' she replied with a chuckle, her concern surfacing, 'You weren't hurt, were you?' 'I'm unscathed, really. Don't fret, mommy. The plane's landing soon; we'll speak afterward.' Ending the call, Cheng An Ya sipped her hot tea, while Ye Sanshao, deprived of a chance to speak with his son, watched with a silent accusation in his gaze. Ignoring Ye Sanshao, Cheng An Ya wrapped herself tighter as Black Hawk reassured, 'Sanshao, we'll be landing soon. The young master awaits.' Feeling ignored, Ye Sanshao pinched Cheng An Ya playfully, 'You heartless creature.' 'Stingy ghost,' she retorted, passing the hot water his way. They landed shortly after, the entire party safely ensconced within the castle walls. Chu Li, Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and others greeted them, their collective relief palpable at the sight of Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya unharmed. 'Brother, sister-in-law, quite the disheveled pair,' Ye Wei teased, her laughter shaking, 'Brother, I should have captured this moment as a keepsake.' 'Impudent girl,' Ye Sanshao chided with a laugh. With Weiwei, Shi Yi, and Xiao Naibao all safe, his own relief was profound. After such an ordeal, what else could go wrong? Xiao Naibao, yearning to embrace Cheng An Ya, was halted by her stern command. He remembered her warning of the virus. Then, noticing the clasped hands of his parents, he felt a pang in his heart. 'Daddy, mommy, you both... Bai Ye, check on them, please,' he implored, his faith in Bai Ye's medical genius unwavering. 'Understood, don't worry,' Bai Ye reassured with a smile. 'Virus?' The inquisitive gaze of a golden-haired, blue-eyed handsome man named Jason landed on Bai Ye, 'Xiao Bai, isn't this beyond your expertise?' Bai Ye, unfazed, retorted with a gentle smirk, 'Try calling me Xiao Bai again, Jason, and see what happens.' 'What's the harm? Xiao Bai is your name, just as they call Black Jack, Xiao Tie,' Jason shot back, his fiery temper akin to a regal lion, albeit with undeniable charm. His sapphire-like eyes blazed with indignation, and when riled, his presence was as formidable as a volcanic eruption. Black Jack, a man in his twenties with an intricate blend of Chinese and English heritage, bore a mysterious allure with a hint of Western depth in his eyes, which were a misty grey-blue, creating an illusion of depth. Yet, beneath that mist was a sharpness that betrayed his concealed acumen. Leaders of the premier terrorist organization, despite their youth, possessed dominant auras. With one alone, the air thrummed with authority; the combined presence of the three was nothing short of imperial. 'Jason, you truly need a lesson in manners,' Shi Yi interjected, her voice laced with humor, 'Why call him Xiao Bai? It's time to teach you a lesson.' The group's laughter filled the air. Ye Wei shook her head, focusing on the more pressing matter, 'Brother, sister-in-law, don't mind them. Better to soak in a hot bath and get checked later so you don't catch a cold.' At her behest, maids ushered Ye Chen and Cheng An Ya away for a bath. Xiao Naibao, torn between following and staying, ultimately remained as Bai Ye appeared poised for a scuffle. Tugging at Bai Ye's sleeve, Xiao Naibao looked up at him with hopeful eyes. 'Bai Ye, is there a way to cure my daddy and mommy?' 'Ning Ning, let me conduct a thorough examination first. Stay calm,' Bai Ye soothed, patting the boy's head. 'I'll do everything in my power.' Xiao Naibao had lost Xu Nuo, and now with his parents' fate hanging in the balance, his heart was fraught with anxiety. Bai Ye understood the turmoil churning within the boy. 'Don't worry too much,' Bai Ye comforted him. 'Let's leave it to Bai Ye. There's no problem that can't be solved,' Ye Wei declared confidently. 'If Louis created the virus, there must be an antidote. Impossible is not an option. Should Bai Ye fail, we'll strip him of his title.' Chu Li nodded in agreement, 'Precisely.' 'Xiao Bai, do you even have a title to strip?' Jason quipped, his curiosity piqued. Shi Yi barely suppressed her desire to knock some sense into him. 'And why didn't you two manage to bring back Louis?' Black Jack inquired, the weight of their unfinished business heavy in the air. 'I've wanted to annihilate him for some time. With the Mafia provocations escalating, it's high time we ended his reign of terror,' Bai Ye stated, his resolve as sharp as ever. 'Louis can wait,' Xiao Naibao calmly articulated, his young face shadowed with a menacing grin. 'To win without fighting is the pinnacle of victory. Personal vendettas aside, the conflict between the Mafia and terrorist organizations requires a different strategy. To wipe out the Mafia will demand significant resources. His standing within the Mafia is now precarious, and I suspect another power lurking in the shadows. So, let Louis unwittingly lead us to them, and we shall eliminate them in one fell swoop.' Their young compatriot's cunning had not gone unnoticed; though his tender years often softened their perception, his true nature was ever present. 'Wily indeed!' Jason exclaimed, his thumb raised high in approval. A man of action, he had always valued direct strategies, but Xiao Naibao's plans had his unwavering support. 'I concur with Ning Ning's strategy,' Chu Li affirmed. 'It's time to end this nuisance once and for all.' 'You always side with Ning Ning. Birds of a feather,' Black Jack teased, the corners of his mouth lifting in amusement. 'But I agree. It's time the Mafia learned to fear us, to avoid our shadow for decades to come.' Bai Ye nodded, his focus now solely on finding a cure for the virus plaguing Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya. That was his mission; the rest was Chu Li's domain. Ye Wei and Shi Yi exchanged knowing glances. Could there be another force at play? Their minds conjured the same visage – Mo Ye and Mo Jue. Only they held enough sway within the Mafia, shrouded in mystery enough to rival Louis. It made no sense otherwise for them to follow his lead. As the group settled in the living room, Xiao Naibao sought out Cheng An Ya. She had just emerged fresh from her bath, her cheeks flushed with warmth, cupping a steaming tea in her hands as she pondered deeply. 'Mommy...' Xiao Naibao pushed the door open, gracing the room with his presence. Cheng An Ya, stirred from her thoughts, admired her son with a soft smile, 'Baby, you've got quite the presence.' His attire exuded an aura that belied his age, transforming him into an imposing figure. 'Thank you for the compliment, mommy.' 'Keep your distance, sit over there. I might not be able to restrain myself from disciplining you,' she cautioned, pointing to the sofa across the room. Xiao Naibao cast a plaintive look Cheng An Ya's way, 'Mommy, you're pushing me away.' 'Precisely,' she affirmed, her laughter echoing around them. She studied Xiao Naibao, sensing an indefinable change in him. A mother's intuition was never wrong; she could feel the subtle shifts in her child. 'Mommy, why do you look at me so? Is it because you think your baby's become more handsome?' Xiao Naibao teased, his eyes twinkling mischievously. Cheng An Ya eyed him with mock seriousness, 'You've inherited your father's vanity, I see. But tell me, have you been alright? Were you bullied? Speak truthfully to mommy.' Xiao Naibao's denial was swift, 'Absolutely not. Louis must have manipulated those photos. Look,' he rolled up his sleeve, revealing an arm nearly healed from its earlier wounds, 'not a mark to be seen.' His injuries, once inflicted by Xu Nuo, no longer pained him. In fact, he longed for the days when her reprimands were but a symbol of her presence. If only she were alive, he'd gladly endure a lifetime of such scolding. 'Ning Ning, you're truly unharmed?' Cheng An Ya's brows knit together, detecting a fleeting sorrow in his eyes. With a nod, Xiao Naibao assured her, 'I'm fine, truly. But it's you and daddy we should worry about. Uncle Black Hawk mentioned the virus. How did daddy contract it too?' Cheng An Ya's thoughts turned to Ye Sanshao's insatiable desires, her face reddening anew. She chose to deflect, 'Let's not dwell on that. After all the chaos in the desert and at sea, contact was inevitable.' Xiao Naibao took her evasion at face value. 'Mommy, don't worry. Bai Ye's medical expertise is unparalleled. He will find a way to heal you both.' Chapter 369: Self-reliance Ensures Ample Sustenance After Bai Ye, the medical prodigy, conducted a thorough examination and drew blood for a comprehensive analysis, his face showed an unusual solemnity, igniting a sense of foreboding in Xiao Naibao. Previously, when Cheng An Ya was critically injured and faced with a life-threatening infection, doctors had resignedly suggested amputation as the only lifesaving measure. Yet, Bai Ye, unfazed and armed with sardonic wit, had confidently retreated to his laboratory sanctuary. As a healer without parallel, no malady seemed beyond the reach of his gifted hands. Even when Chu Li had been critically wounded by 23 bullets, Bai Ye remained the epitome of calm and composure, a living legend in the medical realm. Now, just as Jason had predicted, the realm of viruses was Bai Ye's Achilles' heel. The unusual gravity in his demeanor was an ominous sign, prompting even Jason to offer a sympathetic pat on Bai Ye's shoulder in a rare gesture of camaraderie. 'Finally, you've met a case that tests you,' Jason mused. This was akin to Xiao Naibao being outmaneuvered by the Mo brothers, Mo Ye and Mo Jue, the digital warfare maestros. Bai Ye had summoned over a dozen virus experts from Rome to the castle to collaborate on the research, enveloping the stronghold in an air of palpable gravity. Yet, the individuals at the heart of the matter were remarkably composed. Cheng An Ya had long since come to terms with the concept of mortality. During her harrowing escape, she had accepted the idea that death was not the worst fate. She had loved fiercely, had the unwavering support of Ye Sanshao, and the adoration of Ning Ning. With a fulfilling family and a successful career, she had experienced the full spectrum of life. This tumultuous episode only added to the richness of her life's tapestry, and she felt contentment. Her only lingering regret was not being able to see Ning Ning one last time. Now that her wish was granted, she was indifferent to the outcome of life or death. Ye Sanshao, the indomitable force, shared her disregard for the end. Chu Li, the stoic commander, commented on their fortitude, 'That's the spirit and courage we need.' As the group convened in the conference hall to discuss the virus and Ye Sanshao's dwindling days, Cheng An Ya's memory was jogged by a significant detail. 'Ye Wei had administered a virus-delaying agent that should buy us a few more days.' In the whirlwind of their reunion, she had nearly forgotten the critical interaction between Ye Wei and Chu Li. Though Ye Wei hadn't explicitly conveyed a message for Chu Li, the tacit understanding between them was undeniable. Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao felt compelled to inform Chu Li. Chu Li's gaze sharpened, focusing on Cheng An Ya with an urgency that startled her. The room, previously filled with the banter of Jason, Black Jack, and others, fell into an expectant hush. 'You have news of Ye Wei,' Chu Li stated calmly, his voice belying the tension that gripped him. His body was tense, his concern evident. Xiao Naibao was equally taken aback. As Ye Sanshao narrated the incident, Chu Li abruptly stood, offering a curt 'Thank you' before hastily departing. Jason and Black Jack quickly rose to follow. Ye Wei chuckled, 'Dark Chu must be over the moon this time. Look at his eagerness—it's a rarity indeed.' A significant military campaign by Dragon Gate seemed imminent. With the three giants poised to enter the fray, an earth-shattering confrontation was in store. Ye Wei inwardly mourned for Prince William, whose dominion was likely to be halved or entirely lost. If Ye Wei had the means, Bai Ye should, too, Xiao Naibao reasoned. His entire focus was on the virus threatening his parents. As he pondered his next move, a man approached, 'Young master, Brother Chu requests your presence in the study.' Xiao Naibao's lips pressed into a thin line. 'Dad, Mom, I'll return shortly to keep you company.' Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao exchanged a knowing glance, each filled with a sense of pride. Xiao Naibao seemed to have firmly chosen his path within Dragon Gate, a stark contrast to the obedient son of times past. Resigned to his choice, they resolved to support him on his chosen path. For Ye Sanshao, the pride was palpable. Cheng An Ya watched her son disappear into the corridor's silhouette. Turning back to the present, she inquired of Ye Wei, 'Wei Wei, has something happened to Ning Ning?' A mother's intuition is never wrong. Xiao Naibao's silence did not convince her of his well-being. Ye Wei admired her sister-in-law's perceptiveness and exchanged a meaningful look with Shi Yi. They debated whether to disclose Xu Nuo's fate. It was clear to Ye Sanshao that they were withholding something. 'Wei Wei, speak up.' Ye Wei met their gaze and relayed the full story of Ning Ning and Xu Nuo, including Xu Nuo's death and Xiao Naibao's blindness, sparing no details. Cheng An Ya's heart grew heavier with each word. It explained why her son's eyes had lost their usual clarity and innocence. Despite his background, he had always been a child at heart. But some experiences change a person's gaze, and the world seems different—it wasn't just her imagination. Ye Sanshao frowned, his heart aching for his son's ordeal, filled with remorse for his own absence. If Cheng An Ya had died for him, madness would have been too mild a term for his despair. Xiao Naibao's experience mirrored his own periods of isolation. 'Is the girl confirmed dead?' Cheng An Ya inquired. Ye Wei nodded. 'Our people have confirmed it. Speaking of Nuo Nuo...' She slammed her hand on the table in frustration, recounting Xu Nuo's lineage. 'All misfortunes seem to have converged on Nuo Nuo. Fate has been exceptionally cruel.' Ye Sanshao paused thoughtfully. 'Xu Mingyang and I have business connections. He seems like an upright man, not the type to be superstitious. Could there be more to this?' 'It's not like that,' Shi Yi interjected. 'I've researched the Miao family. Their life charts are indeed accurate, and their curse is real. But there were alternatives—they didn't have to abandon Xu Nuo. Even letting her be raised by others could have been an option. Her parents' decision was excessively harsh.' Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao remained silent. According to this, their son's future seemed precarious. Especially for Cheng An Ya, it wasn't unwarranted worry. She knew her son best. He might appear unchanged, but that was just a facade. A desolate heart renders one lifeless. 'Third sister-in-law, don't worry too much. Ning Ning is still young; perhaps time will heal,' Ye Wei reassured, suggesting that even the deepest bonds can fade over time. Cheng An Ya smiled faintly, acknowledging with a murmur. Ye Wei's words were meant to console them, but even Ye Sanshao knew that forgetting is harder than remembering. To fall in love takes but a second. To forget requires a lifetime. Ye Sanshao inquired about the current state of Dragon Gate, and Ye Wei was forthcoming. The situation was dire, with all three leaders embroiled in their own complex battles, Lin Yixuan's especially mounting. 'Brother, set aside these concerns. First, rid yourself of the virus. Dragon Gate has plenty of capable individuals,' Ye Wei advised with an enchanting smile. 'Louis will likely remain quiet for a while. It's a chance for everyone to recuperate. You weren't aware, but our commander berated us last night for that sensational naval battle.' The introduction of new weaponry into combat, especially by the world's largest illegal arms dealer, was bound to cause a commotion. Shi Yi offered a cold smile. 'According to Jason's tally last night, thirteen countries are vying for these arms at exorbitant prices, all of them major powers. They're publicly declaring resistance against terrorists, vowing to eradicate terrorist organizations. Yet, behind closed doors, they're purchasing our weapons.' 'That's the truth—ephemeral as a cloud!' Ye Wei's laughter grew even more enchanting. Miss Cheng remained silent, while Ye Sanshao chuckled. The arms market, under the control of the covert organization's senior members, had a stranglehold on many international lifelines. Their power was formidable, undeniable. The next heir was their own Ning Ning, whose influence was anticipated to grow even grander. After a brief moment, Ye Sanshao sought out Black Hawk for the latest on Dragon Gate. Ye Wei approached Cheng An Ya, 'Third sister-in-law, let's not bring up our earlier conversation to Ning Ning.' 'Why not?' 'He hasn't spoken of Nuo Nuo since regaining his sight.' 'I understand,' Cheng An Ya replied. 'Thank you all. Without you, Ning Ning's prospects would have been dire.' 'We owe our thanks to Nuo Nuo. Ning Ning owes his life to her sacrifice.' ... By noon, five fighter jets and three helicopters took to the skies from the castle, all charting a course for Mesilia. Chu Li, Jason, and Black Jack were aboard. In truth, Chu Li alone could have managed the situation. There was scarcely a challenge that necessitated the combined might of the three leaders of Dragon Gate. Jason and Black Jack were simply bored, and with the Mafia unable to stir up trouble, it was an opportune time to hone their skills. Inside the research lab, a whirlwind of activity unfolded, with the team of virus experts ensnared in a frenzy of urgency. Bai Ye's expression was stoic as he faced a situation that left him at an unprecedented loss. His brows, typically distant and aloof, now nearly converged in deep concern. 'Mr. Bai, who is the mastermind behind this virus?' the head of the expert team inquired. 'In my nearly four decades in this field, I have never encountered such a malevolent virus.' 'It was developed by the Mafia,' Bai Ye revealed, his gaze unyielding as he scrutinized the molecular structure of the virus displayed on the large LCD screen. Although virology may not have been his specialty, Bai Ye had some expertise, generally with laudable results. Yet, he had never before seen a virus with such a complex pathology. 'That's unfortunate,' the team leader mused. 'Last June, over a hundred virus experts converged on Rome. One was my friend. He mentioned working on a virus for the Mafia, likely this very one.' 'Can you still contact him?' Bai Ye asked, urgency coloring his tone. Those experts were undoubtedly the best of the best. 'He's passed away,' the team leader replied somberly. Bai Ye understood the grave implication. These experts were under the terrorists' command, Rome's elite. If they were at an impasse... Hope was fading. 'Mr. Bai, are there any leads at all?' Bai Ye shook his head. 'This is the most challenging case I've encountered.' The complexity of the virus was daunting. 'Proceed with the best relief agent possible. Every day we can gain is precious,' Bai Ye instructed with resolve, and the team leader quickly set to work. Although the antidote was elusive, a relief agent was within reach. Yet, it could only delay the inevitable for about 20 days at most. Bai Ye's thoughts turned to Xiao Naibao's earnest gaze, and his heart grew heavy. 'Mr. Bai, I've examined all virus records. This is a new strain, previously undocumented,' a middle-aged man reported, offering a dossier to Bai Ye. 'However, in 1934, a similar pathogen swept through Siberia. It was also transmissible and cellular, with symptoms akin to Miss Cheng's. The difference lies in the absence of a second-wave infectant. The infected had a lifespan of a month, but the principle should be similar. The official stance was a nuclear war leak, but the actual cause was the virus.' Bai Ye's eyes ignited with interest as he seized the report, devouring its contents with an almost voracious hunger. The virus, designated su-1934, was formidable, having ravaged a Siberian town. The government had sealed all exit routes to contain the spread, leading to a cleanup of the entire town and nearly 50,000 deaths. This virus was also cellular, the most analogous precedent they could find. 'Gather all information on 1934. I need every piece of data,' Bai Ye ordered decisively, and the man nodded, rushing off to gather the requested information. The stately Bai Ye, draped in his white lab coat, leaned intently over the computer. The lab buzzed with activity, a hive of dedicated study as specialists analyzed the virus and experimented with various reagents in their quest for solutions. 'Mr. Bai, perhaps we should consider this. Since the Mafia are the architects, they surely know the antidote,' the team leader suggested. 'Developing a new viral agent is a lengthy process, and Ye Sanshao and Miss Cheng may not be able to wait.' Even with a relief agent, they could only delay the outcome for 20 days, and they might still be without a clue. Furthermore, the virus's inherent instability and its cellular nature meant that if it manifested abruptly, the relief agent would be useless, sealing a fatal outcome. 'Self-reliance ensures ample sustenance,' Bai Ye declared, invoking the proverb with a composed demeanor. The team leader was speechless. With Louis having targeted Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao without mercy, it was dubious he would provide an antidote. He would have anticipated their detoxification attempts, their inevitable failure, and their search for him. By the time they found him—if ever—their lives would likely be over. The risk was too great. He was convinced that Louis would remain hidden for the foreseeable future. Why waste effort on a futile pursuit? After lunch, Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao succumbed to exhaustion. Since their return the previous night, they had been preoccupied with medical exams and blood tests. Fatigued by the relentless assault of the virus, rest had eluded them. Ignored by Ye Wei for a full day, Mo Jue felt slighted. He clung to Ye Wei's sleeve, his gaze filled with reproach and yearning. Ye Wei was sorely tempted to send him into the swimming pool. Xiao Naibao was intrigued by this version of Mo Jue. 'Auntie, has he been acting like this for days?' 'Five days,' Ye Wei confirmed. 'He's been possessed.' Xiao Naibao was fascinated by Mo Jue's transformation. The once enigmatic and formidable Mo Jue now brimmed with innocence, his violet eyes free of their typical duplicity, a stark contrast to his past. Watching him now, endearingly referring to Ye Wei as 'wife' repeatedly, was a sight to behold. 'Wife, are you speaking ill of me?' Mo Jue's eyes conveyed a sense of hurt as he puckered his lips, planting a bite on Ye Wei's cheek. Xiao Naibao shivered; such tenderness was foreign to him. His own displays of affection at three years old paled in comparison to Mo Jue's current demeanor. Ye Wei, now accustomed to his touches, stroked his hair. 'Behave, wife adores ghosts the most. The ones you loathe, you could easily scare to death. It's a form of flattery, understand?' 'Really?' Mo Jue's innocence radiated through his gaze. Without missing a beat, Ye Wei affirmed, 'Of course, when have I ever deceived you?' Xiao Naibao remained silent. Such remarkable calm. He couldn't help but reflect on Ye Wei's composure, a trait beyond the reach of ordinary individuals. 'Auntie, can he find Mo Ye?' Xiao Naibao asked directly, unconcerned whether Mo Jue comprehended. He sought a straightforward answer. 'He claims he can't,' Ye Wei replied. 'Big Boss Mo, that ice block, seems untouchable. The second brother is still the second brother, after all.' Xiao Naibao, '......' Mo Jue once again wore an aggrieved expression, clinging to Ye Wei as he continued to nibble. Xiao Naibao considered the scene inappropriate for children and promptly retreated to the research lab. 'Ning Ning, what brings you here?' 'Any leads yet?' Xiao Naibao discerned the gravity of Bai Ye's expression and grasped the severity of the situation, though he had braced himself for such news. At that moment, the comprehensive data on the 1934 virus was delivered. 'I'll discuss it with you shortly,' Bai Ye assured as he delved into the material. Driven by curiosity, Xiao Naibao joined him. The data on su-1934 was comprehensive, detailing the havoc, death toll, and the government's stringent measures. Bai Ye was most concerned with the virus's creator. 'Su Jinxiao?' 'Su Jinxiao?' Bai Ye echoed, the name unfamiliar to him, an encounter for the first time. The incident had been an accident, with the public narrative attributing the tragic deaths to a nuclear plant leak, while only a select few knew the virus was the true culprit. A spark of realization flared within Xiao Naibao, 'The grandfather of Su Man.' Chapter 370: To Riyadh Upon discovering that the creator of su-1934 was Grandfather Su, Xiao Naibao immediately reached out to Su Man. Beside him, Ye Wei's emotions were tumultuous; her gaze upon Xiao Naibao was filled with intense sorrow and rage, her delicate fingers tensed as if they were a ghost's claws, ready to deliver vigilante justice. Shi Yi, aware of the undercurrents of tension, maintained a composed smile. Mo Jue, with his lips forming a childlike pout, gazed at his wife and meekly remarked, "Wife, you're quite intimidating!" The group concurred; her presence was indeed fearsome, even Ye Sanshao was apprehensive that his sister might lash out at her own son. Her expression was downright chilling. Unaware of the reason behind the upheaval, except for Shi Yi, Bai Ye touched his nose thoughtfully. While Xiao Naibao waited for Su Man to answer the phone, he inquisitively looked at his aunt and asked, "Auntie, what are you doing?" "I despise you, I truly do..." Ye Wei, known for her enchanting allure, now looked like a sorrowful and vengeful spirit. Even Ning Ning felt a shiver down his spine. Before he could articulate his concerns, Su Man's voice emerged from the receiver. "Ning Ning?" Su Man's voice was remarkably soothing, like a breeze atop a mountain peak at dawn—chilly yet refreshing, pure and untouched by worldly dust, instilling a sense of unapproachability and sanctity. "Yes, Su Meiren, I need your help. Can you get online? I have something to send you." Ning Ning's tone was urgent, foregoing any pleasantries, his attention solely on the pressing matter, ignoring his aunt's darkened expression. "Is there trouble?" "Yes, it's a life-and-death situation." Ning Ning was forthright. "Send it through, I'm online." Su Man responded calmly, without probing for details. As Ning Ning was about to reply, Ye Wei snatched the phone, "Su Meiren, it's been so long. Have you missed me?" After a brief pause... "Ye Wei?" "Why so formal? Just call me Weiwei. After all, we've been close before, no need for such distance now," Ye Wei responded, her laughter sultry, her voice dripping with seduction. Mo Jue's eyes conveyed a mix of sorrow and jealousy as he witnessed his wife's flirtatious behavior. His inner beast stirred, ignited by a fierce desire to confront Su Man, to tear him apart. A sudden cold wave of murderous intent swept through the room, causing Shi Yi, Bai Ye, and Ye Chen to shiver. Ye Wei merely raised an eyebrow at Mo Jue and continued to regally ignore him. Mo Jue's aura of deadly intent grew thicker. The others felt a fleeting wave of concern that he might revert to his former self, but his eyes, though filled with lethal purpose, were devoid of malice. His fists clenched in silent anguish, yet he took no action, reassuring the others of his restraint. "I'm busy. Goodbye," stated Su Man, ending the call with decisive finality. Ye Wei's captivating charm was not something that any man could easily endure; it tested one's very resilience. Even Su Man, a man known for his composure, chose to steer clear of her, which spoke volumes about Ye Wei's formidable allure. If she set her sights on a man, no one, regardless of their identity, could do anything but flee from her, utterly incapable of standing as her equal. "Su Meiren's dismissal with a mere three words..." Ye Wei lamented, her frustration palpable as she held the phone. "After all my yearnings, such a waste of my affections." Cheng An Ya and Ye Chen shared an amused glance as Bai Ye approached Xiao Naibao. Ning Ning had just sent Bai Ye's organized data to Su Man. Shi Yi gestured towards Mo Jue, who now resembled a ghost. Ye Wei's smile faded slightly, and with a feigned innocence, she inquired, "Big White, who's troubling you? Tell your wife, and I'll make them pay." Mo Jue, in his characteristically straightforward manner, pointed directly at Ye Wei, conveying his sense of betrayal, "Wife, it is you who have wronged me." Everyone, "......" Ye Chen managed to suppress a smile, not wishing to completely dismantle Ye Wei's facade. The childlike Mo Jue had become her bane; her typical guile was ineffective against him. He expressed his discontent in the simplest ways, oblivious to the nuances of adult interactions. Ye Wei offered a playful smile, "Are you implying I should punish myself?" Mo Jue, still visibly upset, glared and swiftly moved to Ye Wei's side, grasping her sleeve and crying out, "Wife, who is this person, who is he, why are you so kind to him? You are seducing him!" Shi Yi felt a chill at the word 'seducing'. The once naive Mo Jue now grasped the concept of seduction, a revelation that was nothing short of miraculous. Recalling his time as Big White, he was a blank slate, with no understanding beyond 'wife'. Now, he understood it all. Ye Wei's influence had been transformative; she had imbued the innocent soul with her own hues. The term 'influential' was an understatement. Should Mo Jue return to his former self and reflect on his days as Big White... Well... Ye Wei might not have enough heads to spare for the vengeance he would seek. Such was his relentless nature; forgiveness was not in his vocabulary. She harbored a tinge of concern for Ye Wei's future prospects. With a tender stroke of Mo Jue's cheek, Ye Wei's smile was captivating, "Big White, how could you accuse your wife like that? He's miles away; seduction is impossible. The only one I would ever seduce is you." "Wife, you don't love me anymore, do you? Please don't let your heart wander. Big White will be very good, very obedient." Mo Jue's face was a picture of misery as he clung to Ye Wei's arm, fearing that she might cast him aside. Ye Wei remained silent, pondering the child's choice of words. Speaking of transferring affections, one was past tense, the other present. Surely it meant transferring love from Su Man to herself, right? Ye Wei was at a loss for words. "Wife..." Mo Jue was not easily mollified. Ye Wei, her patience waning, struck his abdomen with a punch and declared, "Stop this nonsense, or I'll beat you so badly, you won't even recognize your own brother." Everyone, "......" Miss Cheng and Ye Sanshao watched the unfolding drama with unbridled amusement, exchanging glances that reflected their enjoyment of the couple's dynamic. Miss Cheng contemplated the thrilling challenge of managing a man with such extremes. She vividly recalled the scars on Ye Wei's body, the aftermath of a savage beating, the iron lotus on her wrist that had nearly crippled her hand—these scars attested to the man's ferocity. Now, in his pallid state, he was malleable, presenting a unique challenge. Only Ye Wei's formidable spirit could keep him in check. Mo Jue felt a profound sense of betrayal, his violet eyes brimming with tears, his delicate lips quivering as if caught in an autumnal breeze, startling all present. Xiao Naibao, witnessing this spectacle for the first time, contrasted it with the stern figure he had encountered in the supermarket. His lips curved into a sly grin, "Big White, do you know who Su Meiren is? My aunt's former lover. She was quite passionate about him, pursued him for a full year. Now she's jealous because I have Su Meiren's contact, and she doesn't. That's why she's envious of me." Hearing this, Mo Jue's sorrowful gaze upon Ye Wei intensified. He rose abruptly, his anger surging, and departed with a dramatic sweep of his sleeve, displaying unexpected dignity and resolve. Ye Wei stood there, dumbfounded... o(╯□╰)o! Damn it, Mo Jue, are you rebelling? He had the audacity to turn his back on her, to sulk with such petulance. She was genuinely taken aback by his insolence. Miss Cheng, with unwavering calm, advised, "Weiwei, you should go and soothe him; he is truly upset." "Weiwei, is this the first time he's been angry with you?" Shi Yi inquired, seemingly in disbelief. Since that day, Mo Jue had held Ye Wei's words in the highest regard; she said one, he wouldn't dare say two. If Ye Wei commanded death, he wouldn't allow life. Her words were sacred, her decrees were truth. His obedience was absolute, his devotion unshakable—he feared nothing more than displeasing Ye Wei. This was indeed a rare spectacle. Shi Yi surmised that Ye Wei had not only colored Mo Jue's world with her own hues but also infused him with a dose of her own fiery temperament. After Xiao Naibao's troublemaking, he grinned elegantly, and Bai Ye gave a nod of approval. Witnessing Ye Wei's unraveling was a rarity, and with the show freely provided, he was naturally eager to spectate. "He's defied me." Ye Wei slammed the table, stood up with determination, and stormed off, her fury suggesting she was ready to exact vengeance on someone. "Auntie, Su Man responded to your message." Xiao Naibao called out behind her, but Ye Wei, as if deaf to his words, had disappeared from sight. Laughter filled the room. Indeed, every force meets its counterforce, yet Ye Wei's nemesis was unexpectedly extraordinary. They say a pure heart and a dark mind are a perfect match, and they couldn't be more right. Especially when one is as purely white as this. Su Man had clearly reviewed the documents, including the data on su-1934 and the analysis of the new virus. As a virologist, he quickly understood the specialized information. Su Man: Bring the person here. Mommy is the Most Important of All: Is there hope for a cure? Su Man: 70% certainty. Mommy is the Most Important of All: Excellent, I'm departing immediately. Su Man sent an address to Xiao Naibao, and Bai Ye committed it to memory. He harbored a mild curiosity, "A 70% chance, is he sure? With so many experts at a standstill, can he truly make a difference?" It was a bold claim to assert a 70% chance of success based solely on the documents. "If Su Man believes there's a chance, then we must trust there is one. Let us hasten to Riyadh. It's only a matter of hours away, and the round trip will be swift," Xiao Naibao urged. This opportunity, promising a potential cure for his parents, was not to be missed. Miss Cheng and Ye Sanshao exchanged a glance, signaling their agreement. "I will accompany you," Bai Ye declared, his countenance calm, his emotions hidden. Yet within him, a whirlwind of curiosity and excitement was brewing. Chapter 371: A Beauty's Smile Overturns the City (Part 1) In the silent contest of prowess among men, Bai Ye, lauded as a genius medic, was intrigued by a virus that baffled many experts, despite his modest foray into virology. When a man confidently claimed a seventy percent chance of success, it invariably signaled a near certainty of a cure to their kind. Bai Ye was keen to gauge the true extent of this individual's abilities. The mention of a high-speed magnetic wave scanner alone was an eye-opener. Su Man was a name that rang like thunder. Neither Ye Sanshao nor Cheng An Ya had any objection; a trip promised to be brief, and the prospect of a cure was too enthralling to delay. With Bai Ye and Ning Ning orchestrating the logistics, the aircraft was swiftly prepared. The leadership of the premier terrorist organization was temporarily entrusted to Claude, while Bai Ye instructed the lab experts to press on with virus research, directing them to communicate any breakthroughs immediately to preclude redundant efforts by Su Man. The arrangements were faultless. Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and Mo Jue weren't initially considered, yet as the aircraft readied for takeoff, Ye Wei boarded, Mo Jue in tow. Shi Yi, ever loyal to Ye Wei, quickly followed suit. Mo Jue's presence raised the possibility of an encounter with Mo Ye. 'Why join this escapade, Auntie?' Ning Ning was puzzled. Everyone knew of Ye Wei's past affair with Su Man, and now she had brought along a visibly jealous Mo Jue—wasn't this inviting chaos? He had hoped Su Man would focus on treating his parents. 'Why can't I go? It's been ages since Su Man and I last caught up,' Ye Wei countered with a smile so beguiling it was regrettable that only Bai Ye, Ye Sanshao, and Mo Jue were present to witness. Otherwise, she would have dazzled the entire room. Everyone was skeptical about her definition of 'chatting.' Surely, it wasn't meant to be this provocative. She must dream of rekindling things with Su Man. Indeed, with Mo Jue, a paragon of compliance and beauty, Ye Wei still harbored thoughts of Su Man, leaving everyone bewildered. What magic did Su Man wield to captivate so thoroughly? Even Ning Ning, who typically possessed high standards, couldn't help but express admiration for Su Man. Mo Jue, who had earlier stormed off with dignified fury, now quickly transformed into the very image of a doting husband, clinging to Ye Wei—an image of a man who'd do anything his wife desired. Such a drastic transformation was unexpected. Ye Sanshao and Bai Ye both gave Ye Wei a thumbs-up, while simultaneously expressing disdain for Mo Jue's henpecked demeanor. 'Brother Mo, feeling jealous?' Bai Ye inquired. Mo Jue, embracing Ye Wei, nodded emphatically, his innocent face devoid of any trace of jealousy. Ye Sanshao scoffed at the display; such docility was indeed rare. He wasn't nearly as indulgent with Cheng An Ya, sometimes delighting in her pursuit. Cheng An Ya gave a thumbs-up too, 'You have a gift for taming husbands, Wei Wei. Teach me your ways sometime.' 'Certainly, no problem. I guarantee Ye Sanshao will be beyond tractable,' Ye Wei assured. Ye Sanshao immediately pulled Cheng An Ya closer, his grin sinister, 'Miss Cheng, am I not treating you well enough? Why the need for taming techniques? Voice your concerns, and I shall address them forthwith.' Ning Ning shuddered and sought refuge closer to Bai Ye. Shi Yi's eyebrows arched, and Ye Wei quipped, 'You're so sour, brother. What did you eat for lunch? There's no need for such threats. If you were as accommodating as Big White, sister-in-law would treat you even better, with more tenderness.' Ye Sanshao silently glared at Ye Wei; he had no intention of emulating Mo Jue's pallid obedience. He was certain Cheng An Ya would take advantage and bully him more than Ye Wei ever did. His pride as a man was at stake. He couldn't fake Mo Jue's pure, unsullied demeanor even if he tried. 'I agree,' said Miss Cheng, looking forward to seeing if Ye Sanshao could assume a new guise for a bit of excitement. 'Come on, give me a smile, dear,' Miss Cheng teased, playfully hooking Ye Sanshao's chin. Ye Sanshao's lips twitched vehemently. This flirtatious demeanor mirrored Ye Wei's, wholly mastering the art, indeed birds of a feather flock together. He concluded his wife needed to stay a good two hundred meters away from his sister to avoid being led astray. Ye Wei collapsed into Mo Jue's arms, laughing, while even Shi Yi couldn't help but curl her lips with a hint of amusement. Ning Ning innocently covered his eyes, 'Mommy, please, not so stimulating. This is hardly suitable for children. You should also consider the pure hearts of your children.' Everyone, '......' Pure? If you're pure, what is dark? Bai Ye chuckled, offering an evaluation, 'Women, terrifying indeed.' 'I empathize with you,' Ning Ning solemnly patted Bai Ye's shoulder, expressing his condolences, 'Truly terrifying, I mourn for your future.' Bai Ye and Chu Li, long oppressed by Ye Wei and Shi Yi, empathized deeply. Now, witnessing Miss Cheng's wicked humor, anyone would find women intimidating. Bai Ye returned Ning Ning's comforting gesture, 'I also mourn for you twenty years from now.' 'I don't need it,' Ning Ning replied with a smile. The one who would have been tormented was no longer there, leaving everything hollow. He was content having Nuo Nuo in his heart for a lifetime. Other women didn't matter; he didn't need anyone else, so no one could torment him. Miss Cheng was conversing with Ye Sanshao when she overheard this and felt a deep heaviness in her heart, not sure what to say to Ning Ning. She gave him a profound look. The rest didn't think much about Nuo Nuo and continued to jest. Ye Sanshao and the others were family, familiar with each other, and Bai Ye, despite his reserved nature, had grown up with Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and others, forming good bonds with them, so he got along well with Ye Sanshao. The atmosphere remained vibrant, unmarred by the virus situation. Everyone was carefree, unwilling to let the circumstances dampen their spirits. Shi Yi curiously asked, 'Big White, why did you allow Wei Wei to go to Riyadh? Aren't you afraid your wife will be lured away by Su Man?' Ye Wei kicked her. Since when had this block of ice learned to watch her drama? That deserved a reproof. Shi Yi, always cool and detached, ignored Ye Wei's protest, thinking the drama was too good to miss. Not just her, but Bai Ye, Miss Cheng, Ye Sanshao, and Ning Ning were all curious, their gaze fixed on Mo Jue. Mo Jue blinked, answering truthfully, 'Wife said Su Man isn't as attractive as me. She left Su Man, not me. I am the rightful partner.' Everyone, '......' Even Shi Yi, usually so cold, choked up a bit, let alone Cheng An Ya and the others. Wei Wei, you could actually say such things, truly... Formidable. 'Brother Mo, Wei Wei is fooling you. I assure you on my character that those words are insincere. Look at her excitement at the mention of Su Man. And you believe that?' Bai Ye, oppressed for years, naturally wouldn't miss a chance to incite chaos. Ning Ning expressed similar suspicions. Mo Jue's purple eyes flitted with confusion, seeing everyone nodding in agreement, then looking at Ye Wei. He tugged at Ye Wei's sleeve and asked, 'Wife, would you deceive me?' 'No,' Ye Wei replied, her beauty nonchalantly serene. Mo Jue was content, scornfully sweeping over everyone, 'Wife said she wouldn't deceive me. Do not sow discord.' Shi Yi's eye twitched; to think Mo Jue could be trained like this by Ye Wei was indeed rare. Ning Ning laughed heartily. As a fellow man, Bai Ye saluted Mo Jue with a hundred points of respect. Ye Sanshao, quite heartlessly, leaned on Cheng An Ya's shoulder, laughing uncontrollably. This man was too adorable. Miss Cheng was composed; Mo Jue's expression as he said 'don't sow discord' was quite something, the epitome of an innocent white rabbit. 'Wei Wei, you have the skills,' Miss Cheng acknowledged. 'Miss Cheng, you flatter me,' Ye Wei responded. The two women exchanged a smile, and Miss Cheng glanced at Ye Sanshao. He shivered, feeling very uneasy. Miss Cheng's mischievousness was not minor, and being targeted by her meant a dead end. 'Miss Cheng, stop imagining those strange things in your head. He's not my type,' Ye Sanshao declared. Mo Jue was the quintessential image of a henpecked husband, and no man would aspire to emulate him. Ye Wei laughed, 'Brother, our Mo Jue is younger and more tender than you, delicious indeed. From his exterior to his core, he's pure.' Miss Cheng's smile grew even more gentle, 'You don't even know the meaning of 'pure,' do you?' Ning Ning joined in, 'Mommy, if you feel unconvinced, you could try having an affair. Su Man isn't bad, quite the beauty.' 'Watch it, or I'll end you,' Ye Sanshao threatened. If he could strike someone right then, he'd have slapped Ning Ning on the back of the head. Ye Wei wanted to say that Su Meiren was hers, but considering Mo Jue's pure white face, she wisely held her tongue. Observing the two beleaguered men, Bai Ye relished the joys of being single. The sun was bright, and life was beautiful. 'Wife, what are you talking about?' Mo Jue inquired with innocence. Cheng An Ya suddenly spoke up, 'Wei Wei, I suddenly concur with your earlier remark. Mo Jue must indeed be more alluring than Su Man. A man of such appearance is a world's first.' He was matchless, indeed. She had never encountered anyone more beautiful than Mo Jue. Had he been a woman, he would have appeared like a fairy descended to earth, particularly those purple eyes brimming with allure. Even now, as untarnished as a blank canvas, his every scowl and smile were incomparable, without peer. Ye Wei chose not to comment, just laughing lightly. 'Miss Cheng, you dare compliment another man? Have you lost the will to live?' Ye Sanshao narrowed his eyes, reaching for her hair, clearly green with envy. Miss Cheng patted his head, advising earnestly, 'Ah Chen, be honest.' You indeed lack Mo Jue's looks; just accept it. Ning Ning pondered, 'I'm also keen to see Su Man's appearance. Auntie, is he truly celestial?' 'Ask Shi Yi,' Ye Wei waved her hand dismissively, remaining silent with Mo Jue present. Shi Yi glanced at Mo Jue and offered a fair assessment, 'Each has their strong points.' 'Then he must be celestial,' Ning Ning concluded with a chuckle. Cheng An Ya suddenly noted the jade pendant on Ning Ning's chest and couldn't contain her curiosity, 'My dear, what are you wearing? A jade pendant?' That seemed more suited to a girl. Her son never wore such things. Ning Ning's smile waned slightly, a flash of sorrow crossing his face, then quickly returned to calm. Before he could answer, Mo Jue responded, 'It belonged to my Nuo Nuo.' The mood sobered. Ye Wei and the others were privy to the backstory, but Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao were not. Ning Ning nonchalantly stowed the accidentally exposed pendant back inside, his expression serene, betraying no hint of grief or desolation. But years later, Cheng An Ya would reflect on this moment and realize. There is a tranquility akin to still waters. 'It's quite beautiful,' Cheng An Ya commented softly, Ye Sanshao tightening his grip on her hand. 'Yes, I also find it very pretty,' Ning Ning said, his smile returning. As they watched their harmonious tableau, he longed for Nuo Nuo. At night, he dared not sleep, fearing dreams of her would come, and upon waking, he could only grasp at the regrets lingering in the air, leading to sleepless nights. These feelings, experienced too early, felt all the more intense. As time passed, these memories grew clearer, deeply etched into his heart, leaving an indelible mark, never to be erased, a lifetime's companion, and he would live with these memories, without regret. Bai Ye patted Ning Ning's shoulder, and everyone fell silent for a moment. It was Ye Sanshao who broke the silence, tapping the table, 'Ning Ning, didn't I tell you to bring home an idiot? Straying too close to a strong one, you'll have to keep your distance. Didn't listen, and now you've suffered, right?' Miss Cheng was wordless. Bai Ye laughed. The lessons in love started exceptionally early. Ning Ning clasped his hands in an exaggerated gesture of worship, 'Wise and mighty daddy, your son will diligently heed your teachings and dare not transgress again.' Everyone chuckled lightly. The ambiance was once again lively, and Cheng An Ya smiled, no longer speaking, her heart, however, ached tremendously. His forced laughter was apparent to her, very heart-wrenching. Upon reaching Riyadh after a journey filled with laughter, the plane landed on a private airstrip, within a spacious manor resembling an oasis with vast date palm groves and a dense forest of palm trees. At the center of the courtyard garden was an exquisite fountain. The elegant villa courtyard was verdant, planted with a variety of exotic flowers and plants. The manor, though showing signs of age, exuded a heavy sense of history. The curved corridors were adorned with crystal lights shaped like lotus petals, exceptionally beautiful. Walls were covered with climbing vines, lush and green. Maids, dressed in traditional Arabian attire—black robes, headcovers, and shawls—led them into the main hall. Ye Wei greeted them cheerfully, eliciting a round of light laughter. One of them, speaking English, said with a laugh, 'The master is going to have a headache again.' Riyadh was intensely hot in the summer, but the main hall was cool throughout. Bai Ye, with his keen observational skills, noticed the walls were made of ice jade carvings. Though ordinary in appearance, they were cool to the touch, a design to counter the summer heat. A clever innovation. 'Their walls are all carved from ice jade, the luxury of the rich,' Ye Wei commented, who had stayed here with Shi Yi before and was very familiar with the place. She naturally took some fruit from the table to quench her thirst after disembarking from the hot plane. Soon, maids brought over cold beverages and fruit snacks. Knowing Ye Wei and Shi Yi's preferences, they also prepared two glasses of blue-green fruit drinks for them. Using Arabic, Ye Wei said, 'Sister Daina, I didn't expect you to remember my favorite. I'm so touched.' Daina smiled and replied, 'The master is currently hosting Princess Qi. He'll be over shortly.' 'Is she attractive?' Ye Wei was curious. The visitor must have come to throw herself at him. Ye Wei had witnessed even more astonishing scenes last year. Daina's large eyes brimmed with laughter, 'Not as pretty as you.' Ye Wei was satisfied. Sister Daina, you're really on point. Bai Ye shook his head and nudged her shoulder, 'Can your husband understand Arabic?' Flirting should be preceded by pacifying the home front. Ye Wei had neglected this and spoke to Mo Jue in Arabic, 'Big White, my drink tastes awful. Let's swap.' Mo Jue obediently exchanged their drinks, but Ye Wei quickly stopped him, 'Never mind, I suddenly find it quite palatable.' He understood. Ye Wei was in a dilemma. Ning Ning laughed and translated for Cheng An Ya—they were the only ones who didn't understand Arabic; she wasn't as multilingual as the others, knowing just English, Japanese, and French. Before long, someone outside announced the master's arrival. A tall figure slowly entered, backlit by the sun, clad in a white robe, radiating a calm and tranquil aura. He exuded an aura of untouchable sanctity. Cheng An Ya's first impression was, indeed, it was Su Man! Everyone shared the same thought. A beauty's smile overturns the city. Chapter 372: A Beauty's Smile Overturns the City (Part 2) Su Man, in his mid-twenties, exudes a dignified posture, breaking away from the traditional Arabian attire. Opting out of the classic white robe, black headband, and white headscarf, he dons only the robe, his long hair bound with a silver ribbon trailing behind him. His willow leaf eyebrows, slender and extended, conjure images of distant mountains' silhouettes, while his black, spirited eyes mirror the clarity of spring water in mountain gorges, emanating a crisp cleanliness within their frostiness, akin to the penetrating chill of winds across icy expanses. His nose stands high, his lips are finely shaped, boasting a vibrant hue, and even his chin is exquisitely alluring—each feature a testament to divine artistry. He carries an aura of aloofness, an inviolable coldness that seems out of reach. The distinction of his features would never mistake him for a woman; he is unmistakably a man brimming with self-assurance and potency. No woman could wield such a domineering presence, nor exude such an air of unmatched pride. Dressed in white that surpasses the snow's purity, with black hair accented by a silver ribbon, he personifies an unmatched, breathtaking elegance. As he makes his entrance, he effortlessly captures every gaze; he becomes the center of the universe, with the world fading into obscurity around him. Even the worldly men and women of the hall, though often unfazed, find themselves ensnared in a reverent hush by his beauty. Even Ye Wei and Shi Yi, accustomed to his allure, are taken aback. Some individuals, regardless of the frequency of encounters, never fail to dazzle as if seen for the first time. Su Man's eyes, accustomed to such admiration, sweep across the hall and finally come to rest on Xiao Naibao, his lips, which seldom curve into a smile, now doing so ever so slightly. Instantaneous charm, a smile that captivates the entire city. "Su Meiren, I've missed you," declares Ye Wei, snapping out of the collective trance. Disregarding Mo Jue’s potential jealousy, she rushes forward, hoping for an embrace. Yet, someone is quicker than her. Mo Jue moves with swift grace, intercepting her with a pull of the waist, drawing her away from Su Man. His face, a masterpiece of God, is etched with protest, "Wife..." He lingers on the word 'wife' with a longing undertone. Su Man raises an eyebrow, his gaze as cold as the Antarctic as it lands on Ye Wei and Mo Jue. Ye Wei, failing to reach Su Man, is inwardly aggrieved, though she dares not let Mo Jue's temper flare; she is steeped in frustration. "I don't miss you at all," Su Man states, his voice crisp, carrying a clear, clean timbre that cuts through the silence. He harbors a deep respect for Mo Jue, the only man who seems to rein in Ye Wei; otherwise, who knows how many others would have fallen under her spell? "Su Meiren, that's hardly fair," protests Ye Wei, patting Big White's hand, signaling he can let go. Bringing him along was starting to seem like a misjudgment; if not for the fact that no one else in the castle could rein him in, she would not have brought him. "Su Man." Xiao Naibao approaches, his expression contemplative, and openly praises, "You are indeed full of surprises." Though tales of Su Man's otherworldly allure are widespread, it's only upon meeting him that one truly grasps his formidable nobility and unparalleled elegance. "Little one, you too are a surprise," responds Su Man, patting Xiao Naibao’s shoulder with a trace of warmth, "And Ye Wei is here as well?" Ye Wei bristles immediately, "What do you mean by that, Su Meiren?" Shi Yi states plainly, "He has discarded you." Xiao Naibao smiles, "She's my aunt." "The world is indeed quite small." Su Man's usually icy eyes reflect a hint of resignation, as he finds himself surrounded by familiar faces once again. Xiao Naibao introduces everyone in the group. Cheng An Ya and Ye Sanshao, burdened by the virus, simply nod in acknowledgment. Su Man, who usually prefers solitude, finds this situation surprisingly agreeable. A nod is sufficient for Bai Ye as well. "Ning Ning, why such a crowd for a medical visit?" Su Man's chilly glance sweeps across the room, exerting a subtle pressure. Some people naturally command such an atmosphere, and with a simple comment, they can intimidate. Ye Sanshao holds her peace, and Miss Cheng also remains silent. Those touched by genius often carry peculiar temperaments. However, their presence is necessary for treatment, so the rest is of no concern. "Can't I miss you? It's common knowledge that Shi Yi and I are inseparable," Ye Wei retorts. "Yes, and you've brought the whole family along." "Ah, are you regretting not accepting me earlier?" Ye Wei flirts, linking her arm with Su Man's, "Do you truly not miss me at all, Su Meiren?" "I don't," Su Man responds succinctly. His gaze shifts, freezing in its coldness, and Mo Jue has already secured Ye Wei by his side, his purple eyes emitting a subtle sourness. "Wife, please don't do this. If you wish to embrace someone, let it be me, okay?" The onlookers, "......" The others have their rationales; Bai Ye comments lightly, "He's quite arrogant." "He has the gravitas to match," Shi Yi observes, "He never offered us a friendly face, even after learning of our identities." "Ah, Wei Wei, so that's your preference? But..." Bai Ye glances at Mo Jue with a teasing smile, "The shift in your taste is remarkable." Mo Jue misses the nuance in Bai Ye's words, but Xiao Naibao smiles, and even Shi Yi can't suppress a chuckle. Ye Wei dismisses the subject with a wave of her hand, finding herself at a loss for words, "It was entirely accidental..." "Is he Arab?" Bai Ye inquires curiously, noting Su Man's features which bear the depth of an Arab's, yet also the refinement of an Easterner's, leaning more towards the latter. "His mother is Arab, his father Chinese. He's of mixed heritage," Xiao Naibao explains. Everyone nods; individuals of mixed heritage often possess a stunning beauty, and while they've encountered several, none have been as mesmerizing as Su Man. Ye Wei reclines in her chair, sipping her chilled drink, and slowly states, "Now you see why I was so captivated. Su Meiren is irresistible, both inside and out. Spend more time with him, and you'll see—he's a man of rare authenticity." Unfortunately, he holds no interest in her. Rumor has it Su Man prefers men, making her ineligible from the start—a true tragedy indeed. "Auntie, it appears your charm is waning," Xiao Naibao teases. "Nonsense, child. He's still utterly ensnared," Ye Wei gestures toward Mo Jue, her allure undiminished by him. Mo Jue, gripping Ye Wei's hand, interrogates, "Wife, didn’t you say he was less handsome than me, and that you had already forsaken him? Why do you still seek his closeness? You lied to me." "Old friends naturally miss each other, and embracing is a basic courtesy. Do you understand?" Mo Jue shakes his head, pointing to Shi Yi, "She didn't hug him." Bai Ye and Xiao Naibao stifle their laughter, Shi Yi snorts coldly, and Ye Wei elaborates, "Have you ever seen Shi Yi hug anyone? One would have to be courting death to seek her embrace. How can you compare your wife to Shi Yi?" One must never conflate fire with ice. "Wife, I would prefer it if you were like Shi Yi, less warm. Big White doesn't fancy it much," Mo Jue mutters, his mood plummeting, his head bowed, his once vibrant purple eyes now dim with despondency. Ye Wei feels a pang of discomfort at this version of Mo Jue; it makes her... uneasy. She never intended to change her ways for anyone, and since Su Man isn't interested, a little harmless flirtation seems inconsequential. "Wei Wei, have you noticed? He seems to be growing more astute," Shi Yi suddenly says, observing a distinct evolution over recent days. He's no longer the blank slate he once was, no longer taking Ye Wei's every word as gospel. Ye Wei nods in agreement, while Shi Yi harbors another concern—is he close to regaining his former self, or...? "Big White, have you recalled anything?" Ye Wei inquires softly. Mo Jue shakes his head, and both Shi Yi and Ye Wei exchange glances, choosing silence. Perhaps it's merely an illusion. "Wife, if you persist in this manner, I will end him," Mo Jue declares somberly, his purple eyes brimming with a deadly intent. "..." "Big White, come along. Let's take in the splendor of Riyadh together." Ye Wei ushers Mo Jue out of the room, and his somber expression instantly gives way to a bright, sunny disposition. This is a modestly sized research lab. As a virus expert, Su Man's personal lab is equipped with the world's most sophisticated research tools, compact yet fully stocked. One glance reveals test tubes, reagents, automated apparatus, computer diagram analysis, and vast LCD screens. Su Man collects blood samples from the pair and administers two different colored reagents. With only three present, Ye Sanshao senses no need for restraint and asks with urgency, "Mr. Su, is there truly a cure for this virus?" As Su Man performs a systematic check on Cheng An Ya, he responds with detached professionalism, "There might be, or there might not. I cannot guarantee it; it all depends on the virus's level of instability." Ye Sanshao prepares himself mentally, exchanging a subtle smile with Cheng An Ya, which she returns. At this point, life and death have seemingly lost their weight. Su Man, observing this pair, feels a kinship, likely due to his closeness with Ning Ning. If they could raise someone like Xiao Naibao, the parents themselves must be extraordinary. Moreover, the world has been abuzz with Ye Sanshao's exploits and scandals just months prior. Aware that they are Ning Ning's parents, Su Man took an interest, finding their story quite captivating. Now, witnessing their composed approach to life and death, he admires them. "Just call me Su Man." His voice remains crisp, bereft of any emotional undulation. Cheng An Ya smiles, allowing the examination to continue while engaging in conversation, "Su Man, how did you come to know Ning Ning?" "It was a chance encounter. He wanted a weapon diagram that I possessed. I was hesitant to share it, but he managed to hack into my computer. I had no choice but to concede; otherwise, he might have 'assisted' me in becoming stateless, gratis. I could have woken up to discover an unexpected name in the spouse column of my ID card, all thanks to his interference." Su Man recounts the incident. As Xiao Naibao's parents, Ye Sanshao and Miss Cheng experience a mix of embarrassment and pride... Their son's approach... was undoubtedly bandit-like! Emulating his son, Ye Sanshao thinks smugly, though the tactics are underhanded and scheming, they are undoubtedly effective. "...you are indeed unfortunate." Miss Cheng manages to say, instantly regretting her words. Shouldn't they, as parents, be the ones apologizing? Miss Cheng, o(╯□╰)o! "Indeed, I've accepted my fate," Su Meiren replies nonchalantly, in a tone that doesn't quite match the seriousness of the situation. Miss Cheng's coddling of Xiao Naibao has reached new heights. "A little misfortune isn't so terrible; my son is quite useful." Ye Sanshao comments, feeling no shame for Xiao Naibao's behavior, but rather a sense of honor. Su Man nods in agreement, "Indeed." Miss Cheng and Ye Sanshao feel a sense of closure; Su Meiren is exceedingly cooperative. The circumstances of their meeting are trivial; what matters is their current friendship, ageless and agreeable. As Su Man wraps up his examination of Miss Cheng, he raises an eyebrow, a flicker of realization crossing his frosty gaze, "I now understand that Ning Ning's personality wasn't shaped by his upbringing but is inherited." Ye Sanshao, "......" Miss Cheng, "......" Su Man instructs Miss Cheng to stand and Ye Sanshao to lay down, adding, "But you were correct." While examining Ye Sanshao, Su Man reviews the on-screen images and data, his gaze darkening. Cheng An Ya, unfamiliar with Arabic, can't decipher the text, but the images are explicit enough—they depict a liver. "This is going to be challenging." Su Man muses aloud. Cheng An Ya's heart quickens, a sense of apprehension arising, "What's the problem? Is there no hope?" "The virus has penetrated the liver; his case is more severe than yours," Su Man reveals bluntly, assuming they can withstand the truth, so he refrains from sugarcoating, "It's a cellular virus. Once it invades the liver, his bodily functions will sharply decline. In less than a day, he will lose the ability to move, only able to survive in a lab with the help of sedatives and an oxygen mask." Cheng An Ya's eyes widen instantly, her complexion turns ashen, her heart clenches with pain. Her mind goes blank, her limbs grow numb and icy with dread. The premonition of losing Ye Sanshao intensifies. "Su Man, what can we do?" Cheng An Ya strives for composure but fails; her voice trembles, her slender body rigid with tension. Ye Sanshao extends his hand, grasping Cheng An Ya's, the chill of his touch wrenching at her heart. Although they have reconciled with the notion of life and death, the imminent reality of a permanent separation elicits pain and despair. "Do not fret, Xiao An Ya, the situation is not devoid of hope," Ye Sanshao speaks soothingly, "We've already come to terms with it, haven't we?" "The predicament is more dire than anticipated, but it's not hopeless. Be assured; I'll exert every effort," Su Man asserts with determination, his icy eyes unwavering, "Ning Ning seldom requests my help, and I am committed to fulfilling his wish." Cheng An Ya breathes a sigh of relief; Su Man's words carry an inherent trustworthiness. "And her?" Su Man glances at Cheng An Ya, "She's faring well, still within manageable limits. She's the initial wave of infection; the virus is more stable in her, so her condition remains favorable." "Why is he affected more severely? I was infected before him." "Infection timing plays a minimal role." Su Man elucidates, "This variant of the cellular virus wasn't particularly unstable to begin with, and as he is the second wave of infection, the instability is exacerbated, heightening the potential for mutations." Cheng An Ya, not well-versed in viral dynamics, feels a heavy sense of gravity as Su Man's expression becomes more solemn, while Ye Sanshao calmly accepts the grim news. "By the way, Su Man, su-1934 was developed by your grandfather. Bai Ye mentioned its principle is akin to this virus—is there an antidote?" Cheng An Ya inquires. Su Man nods, his gaze briefly shadowed by a quickly concealed grief, "su-1934 was the product of my grandfather's research in his younger days. My grandmother was battling liver cancer, and his pursuit of cellular viruses was solely aimed at finding a cure. He worked in isolation, his research hidden from the world, aware of the catastrophic consequences that could result from virus research. Yet, it was stolen by an apprentice and fell into the hands of illicit elements, leading to a devastating loss of life in a Siberian town. He lived with profound regret, and dedicated his life to creating an antidote for su-1934, achieving success only in his final years. However, some documents were misplaced during a move, leaving the antidote's records incomplete. I need time to reconstruct the missing parts. While the principles are alike, this virus is evidently more intricate. At present, I have merely a preliminary concept and must be certain before venturing to test it on you." Ye Sanshao watches Su Man and offers a gentle smile, her demeanor serene, "Proceed with your work; I have confidence in you." Chapter 373: Wife, I Have No Interest in Him After Su Meiren had meticulously examined Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya, it was nearly evening when she emerged from the laboratory to prepare documents, leaving the maid to escort the couple to their accommodations. Xiao Naibao had been waiting anxiously in the room all afternoon, fretting over the examination that took longer than it had in Rome. He feared that if even Su Meiren couldn't find a solution, there might be no hope left in the world. Upon their return, Ye Sanshao's pallor was evident, causing Xiao Naibao's heart to sink. He hurried over, but Cheng An Ya, cautious of any accidental contact, instructed him to keep a safe distance. Reluctantly, Xiao Naibao complied. "Daddy, Mommy, are you okay? What did Su Meiren say?" Xiao Naibao asked urgently, having waited all afternoon and desperate for a glimmer of hope, despite the slim chances. Cheng An Ya didn't hide the truth from him. Xiao Naibao, though filled with fear and worry, didn't let it show. He pursed his lips and said, "Here, we have the world's top doctors and leading virus experts. Daddy and Mommy will surely be safe." Ye Sanshao managed a carefree laugh, admiring Xiao Naibao's composure, reminiscent of when Cheng An Ya had faced a car accident that nearly led to amputation. The child had been calm and even comforting to his grandfather. "Kiddo, don't worry excessively. Carry on with your usual activities. Since we trust them, let's trust them completely. No matter the outcome, your mommy and I will accept it," Ye Sanshao said calmly. "No need for such a long face—it's unlucky. Your daddy and mommy aren't dead yet, and you're already looking like you're cursed. Cheer up a bit." Miss Cheng waved her hand dismissively, unable to stand the sight of her son frowning. In her eyes, her son should always be smiling gracefully and adorably. A frown just didn't suit him. "Alright, alright," Xiao Naibao muttered, his rosy lips betraying his displeasure. "But you have to promise not to leave me." Miss Cheng smiled, playfully nudging him. "Wasn't it you who just said that with the top doctors and experts here, nothing would go wrong? How quickly have you changed your tune? Have you lost faith?" "Mommy, don't expose me like that," Xiao Naibao protested, his eyes wide with indignation. Miss Cheng and Ye Sanshao exchanged a knowing smile. "Little An Ya, Ning Ning, let's all go out later. You've never seen Riyadh before; the nightlife is truly splendid," Ye Sanshao suggested. Thanks to business, he had visited Riyadh twice, but each trip had been hurried, leaving no time to appreciate the city's beauty. However, the nighttime view had made a lasting impression. The idea of a family outing was precious to him. Aside from their previous seaside trip, the family had never traveled together, and Ye Sanshao wasn't sure if he would have another chance to enjoy these moments. He cherished the thought. "I agree," Xiao Naibao said, smiling elegantly, his eyes shining with childish delight. "Su Meiren mentioned that the local specialties here are quite famous." Ye Sanshao nodded and showed his son a thumbs-up, sharing a smile. Cheng An Ya hesitated, her eyes clouded with worry and fear as she recalled Zhang Bo's incident—a pain so intense it defied description. "With our condition, it's not safe for us to go out in public. If we accidentally infect others, it would be terrible." "You're right," Ye Sanshao conceded, realizing the potential risk on Riyadh's streets. "Damn, I can't even enjoy one last night of pleasure before I'm laid up tomorrow. Fate is truly a cruel mistress." Miss Cheng, "......" Xiao Naibao, "...... Daddy, please use civilized language and don't set a bad example for me." Ye Sanshao gave a sardonic smile and threw a 'spare me' look at Xiao Naibao. "Seriously, you've already given Louis the finger; how much more civilized can you get? Since it's just us, let's not pretend." Xiao Naibao touched his nose, his smile gone. "Still, Daddy, image is important." Cheng An Ya watched the father and son, chuckling at their endearing display. "Let's do it this way then: we'll drive around without getting out. Anything we want to buy, we can send our diplomat here to fetch it," Cheng An Ya suggested with a smile. "Babe, considering your old man might start his tough times tomorrow, you're going to have to put in some extra effort." "Yes, sir!" Xiao Naibao saluted. Ye Wei and Mo Jue had been so absorbed in each other that they'd vanished the entire afternoon. It was dinner time when Su Meiren left the lab, and the couple returned conspicuously. Mo Jue affectionately called Ye Wei 'wife' so often that it made everyone's meal seem more delicious. Seats were reserved for them, and they sat without hesitation upon arrival. The maid served them food and drinks. Big White had been unhappy earlier, but now he returned with a beaming smile, his cheeks tinged with a rosy hue, looking exceptionally adorable. Shi Yi whispered to Ye Wei, inquiring if she had managed to get a handle on him and if she had discovered anything. In terms of unspoken understanding, Ye Wei and Shi Yi were unmatched. In a short span of time, without any eye contact, they could grasp what each other had been up to. Ye Wei shook her head—everything was normal. Due to her unique status, Ye Wei, regardless of her feelings for Mo Jue—whether love or otherwise—always kept her guard up. She couldn't let anything interfere with the bigger picture, so their caution was only natural. However, it was unclear whether it was all an act or if genuine feelings were involved. How much was real and how much was fabricated was something perhaps not even Ye Wei could discern, let alone others. Her thoughts had always been enigmatic, and others perceived her as the same carefree and captivating figure as in the past. This confidence from Ye Sanshao and Bai Ye had led them to entrust Mo Jue to her care. "Su Meiren, how are my brother and sister-in-law?" Ye Wei and Mo Jue were seated opposite Su Meiren. One glance was enough to behold a sight pleasing to the eyes, and Ye Wei's mood soared. "They're doing well," Su Meiren replied succinctly. Xiao Naibao interjected, "Aunt Ye Wei, you've been so wrapped up in your own world, you still remember my dad and mom, huh?" "Child, eat more and talk less." "Mo Jue, did Aunt Ye Wei bully you?" Mo Jue, the picture of innocence, shook his head in defense of his wife. "No, Aunt Ye Wei treats me very well." The room fell silent as everyone silently mourned for Brother Big White. Any clear-eyed person could see that things were far from fine. Su Meiren fiddled with her food, her brows occasionally lifting as her gaze fell on Mo Jue. Sitting opposite her, it was only natural for their eyes to meet, but what was strange was how often Su Meiren looked over. Everyone present was sharp, and aside from Mo Jue, who seemed unaffected, they all sensed something. Su Meiren's sexual orientation was known to Ye Wei and Shi Yi, as it had been mentioned on the plane. Shi Yi, typically characterized by her icy demeanor, and Miss Cheng, who usually maintained composure, both struggled to keep a straight face, as the implications were too suggestive. With his looks, Mo Jue could captivate both men and women, especially now with his innocent gaze, face flushed with amorousness, purple eyes shimmering, and tender lips. He looked like the perfect pet for pampering. As Ye Wei relentlessly teased him, a complex love triangle formed in their minds: Mo Jue had fallen for Ye Wei, Ye Wei for Su Meiren, and Su Meiren for Mo Jue. Ye Wei had pursued Su Meiren for over a year, coming specifically for her. Unexpectedly, bringing Mo Jue along had somehow added a rival in love—a rival who called her 'wife'. They couldn't help but ponder how heartbroken Ye Wei must feel. Xiao Naibao sipped his iced coconut drink, his black eyes darting between Ye Wei, Mo Jue, and Su Meiren, his expression as cunning as could be. Ye Wei slowly put down her cutlery, her smile brimming with allure as she cut to the chase, "Su Meiren, have you taken a liking to my Mo Jue?" Su Meiren remained composed, not even raising an eyebrow. "Absurd." Mo Jue looked at Ye Wei with innocent concern, worried she might get angry. He hastily waved his hands, "Aunt Ye Wei, don't be upset. Rest assured, I like you the most and won't be interested in anyone else." Silence... Shi Yi discreetly turned her face away, her shoulders shaking as she suppressed laughter. Miss Cheng had to grip the tablecloth tightly, nearly collapsing with laughter onto the table. Ye Sanshao's eyes twitched, fighting the urge to laugh, feeling it quite inappropriate since Su Meiren was their host and they were guests. Xiao Naibao choked on his drink, turning away to spray it out while coughing uncontrollably. "Haha... In a room filled with an eerie silence, only Bai Ye laughed uproariously. Known for his casual and indifferent nature, such a loss of composure was rare. Su Meiren's eyebrows twitched coldly, and with a motion slow as a breeze, her piercing gaze swept over Bai Ye. She took a sip of tea with an air of nonchalance. Mo Jue still seemed unaware of the consequences he had caused, looking around with bewilderment, "What's wrong with everyone?" Ye Wei patted Mo Jue's head reassuringly. She had been bullied by Su Meiren many times without ever winning a single battle. She hadn't expected Mo Jue to give Su Meiren a red face so directly upon his first encounter. Good. Very good. The child had great potential. Watching Su Meiren turn red was a satisfying sight, although she maintained her calm and collected demeanor. "It's okay, Mo Jue. You did well and deserve commendation." Ye Wei praised him generously, and Mo Jue beamed with delight at his wife's commendation. "Ye Wei, you've trained an exceptional pet," Bai Ye said, finally catching his breath. Ye Wei smiled devilishly. "Su Meiren, don't be shy. If you consider giving me a kiss, I might consider lending you Mo Jue for a cuddle." Everyone, "......" Xiao Naibao was relieved he hadn't been drinking anything. Aunt Ye Wei, you're still the strongest. Ye Sanshao couldn't help but muse that with a sister like this, his life was indeed complete. Miss Cheng, however, felt that the Ye family was truly full of eccentrics, something she had long realized. Su Meiren's gaze remained frosty; her lips curving into a smile that could hardly be called a smile, as if brushed by autumn frost. The man's tone was even, without a ripple, "Personality-wise, he exhibits what's known as a fragmented personality. Age-wise, he is a dual-year layer. Regarding the soul, he cannot be considered a complete individual." ......  The room fell silent once more. Ye Wei's smile faded as she glanced at Mo Jue. "Have you encountered such a case before?" "A few years ago," Su Meiren replied. "Why does this happen?" "How should I know?" Su Meiren responded indifferently. Ye Wei looked aggrieved. "Su Meiren, that's not very nice of you." "I've always been this way." Su Meiren retorted. Ye Wei fell silent, even if it was the truth, Su Meiren, you didn't have to be so brazen about it, o(╯□╰)o. Xiao Naibao was curious. "Su Meiren, Mo Jue wasn't like this before. I've seen him once before, and he was completely different. He's been like this for many days now. When will he recover?" Mo Jue was still clueless, not understanding what they were discussing. Su Meiren raised her eyebrows and glanced at Mo Jue. "I don't know." "Didn't you say you've seen cases like this before?" Ye Sanshao also inquired, equally curious. Su Meiren stated, "This isn't a disease, it varies from person to person, so naturally, I'm not clear on the specifics." Shi Yi was more concerned about another issue. "Can he be cured?" "I don't know." "Why do you know nothing?" Bai Ye remarked. Ye Wei nodded in agreement. A quack indeed. Su Meiren's icy gaze swept over Bai Ye. "If I were to ask you, you'd probably be even more ignorant." Everyone fell silent—Su Meiren, you're quite sharp-tongued. Bai Ye laughed casually, not taking offense. "It's not a medical condition, so not knowing is normal. We have different areas of expertise; it's futile to compare." Su Meiren sipped her tea, her demeanor unchanged. "Making excuses." Bai Ye smiled serenely, taking a sip of wine, and everyone was silent once again. The atmosphere was truly peculiar. Ye Wei looked at Mo Jue, not saying a word. A fragmented personality? She had never heard of such a thing. Not a complete individual? That was even more nonsensical—he was clearly a living person. Chapter 374: The Return of the Enigmatic Beauty, Mo Jue After their evening meal, Ye Sanshao, accompanied by Cheng An Ya and Xiao Naibao, ventured out into the cool night for a leisurely drive. Despite Su Man's offer to guide them, Ye Sanshao declined, preferring to rely on his all-competent son. Unfamiliar as he was with Riyadh, he cherished these intimate moments reserved for their family of three. The transformation of Riyadh from a desert city to a resplendent metropolis was striking. Towering skyscrapers pierced the skyline, and the city's thoroughfares, awash with light, cast a radiant glow reminiscent of a vast sea of lamps. As they cruised at a leisurely pace, Cheng An Ya couldn't help but notice the abundant fountains. It seemed each street boasted a couple, each uniquely designed, adding a refreshing touch to the summer's heat. Ye Sanshao, with a knowing smile, illuminated the city's efforts in greening, 'A large part of the Sahara Desert falls within Saudi territory. Maintaining the greenery in Riyadh demands significant human and financial resources. These fountains aren't just for show; they play a crucial role in regulating the city's temperature.' Cheng An Ya nodded in understanding, her respect deepening. She had felt the stark contrast between the icy jade coolness within Su Man's abode and the fierce heat that awaited outside. Ye Wei had casually mentioned that forty degrees was the norm here, and temperatures could soar as high as forty-five degrees. It now made perfect sense why the streets lay deserted during the day; only those seeking punishment would venture out in such sweltering conditions. The trio occasionally paused to capture these moments, their laughter a joyous refrain against the backdrop of the simmering heat, blissfully unaware of the brewing storm back at Su Man's estate. Following dinner, Su Man secluded himself in his laboratory to finalize the antidote data for su-1934 and continue his virus research. Alone in the expansive lab, he wasn't surprised when Ye Wei dropped by. 'Su Meiren, what do you say to spending a delightful evening together?' Ye Wei's voice was sultry, her body leaning into him with a flexibility and fragrance that hinted at sensuality. She draped her arm around his neck, planting a seductive kiss on his cheek. Unmoved by such forwardness, Su Man remained detached. His noble and stern presence was accentuated by his ink-black hair, tied back with a silver ribbon. He set aside a scroll, fixing Ye Wei with a gaze as frosty as his tone, 'If you aim to entice, at least make an effort to dress the part.' Ye Wei's laughter was rich and unrestrained, her eyes alight with playful mischief as she toyed with Su Man's chin, 'I have lain naked beneath your sheets, and yet you showed no more emotion than a statue.' 'Forewarned is forearmed,' Su Man shot back, brushing aside her hand with a gesture of disinterest. Resolute, Ye Wei reached for Su Man's chest but found only solid muscle. She pouted, feigning sorrow, 'When will I be greeted by softness instead of this unyielding strength? Su Meiren, you should have confessed your preference for men. I've wasted a year chasing a mirage.' 'You never thought to inquire,' Su Man replied, his brows furrowing as he subtly urged her to stand, clearly uncomfortable with the proximity. Unyielding, Ye Wei's laughter was tinged with defiance, 'Had you revealed your inclination, I might have considered a transformation for your sake. By now, we could have been the epitome of a match made in heaven. How do you reconcile with severing such a perfect bond?' Unruffled by Ye Wei's capricious and illogical stance, Su Man retorted, 'Even if you were a man, my feelings would remain unchanged.' 'Beauty should not be constrained by gender,' Ye Wei countered, her voice layered with a slight grievance yet resilient in her pursuit. 'Enough. Speak plainly. I am otherwise engaged,' Su Man cut in, his voice icy and authoritative. His demeanor alone could intimidate the faint-hearted, but Ye Wei was not so easily cowed. 'You know the matter at hand. Spare me the charade,' Ye Wei pressed on. 'Then speak directly. No amount of circumlocution can mask your affections,' Su Man responded, his incisive words fully aware of the playful nature behind her year-long pursuit. He had, after all, accepted Ye Wei and Shi Yi as friends, which was why they had been allowed to stay for so long. Regardless of their formidable presence, he had the means to send them away should he choose. 'What harm is there in my affection for him?' Ye Wei boldly admitted, unabashed when her secret was unveiled. She motioned to Su Man's chest, 'What if he's entwined with the Mafia, potentially even the mastermind behind Louis? What if our relationship is nothing but a ruse?' Su Man arched an eyebrow, his white robe lending him an air of regal intelligence against the backdrop of night. 'Do you fear he's playing you?' he inquired. 'It's a logical deduction,' Ye Wei asserted, pulling up a chair to sit. 'I've spent my life orchestrating the fates of others, not to be outmaneuvered myself.' 'Ye Wei, you've sunk too deep,' Su Man stated, his voice carrying a hint of warmth in its icy delivery. 'You've truly fallen for him.' Ye Wei's smile receded, replaced by a veneer of cruelty and authority. 'Su Meiren, do you believe I should eliminate him? To cut off future threats at the root?' Su Man's smile was pristine, untouched by the grime of the world. 'I'm certain you lack the resolve to follow through.' 'Is there anyone I cannot bring myself to kill?' Ye Wei challenged him, her laughter embodying a natural grace and undisputed dominance. 'I'm certain,' Su Man reiterated, his arms crossed. 'Ye Wei, you seize what you desire and obliterate what you reject. But remember, the stiffest tree is most easily cracked by the wind.' 'You're no saint yourself,' Ye Wei retorted with a dismissive wave. 'Aren't we all the same in the end? You, me, Shi Yi, Bai Ye—we all share this ruthless path. Even the past Mo Jue was no different.' Su Man simply observed her, his dark eyes brimming with an unsettling clarity. Ye Wei shifted uneasily, 'You truly have no inkling of when he might awaken?' 'I do not. His kind are as rare as phoenix feathers or unicorn horns. There are no precedents to draw upon, and even if there were, Mo Jue's circumstances defy comparison,' Su Man spoke candidly. 'Is there any way to preserve him as Big White indefinitely?' Ye Wei inquired. 'What exactly are you suggesting?' Su Man probed. 'I want him to remain this way forever.' 'Ye Wei, that's a fantasy,' Su Man declared gravely, his voice a sharp chill. 'You're grasping at straws. This transient identity is fleeting; his true nature will inevitably resurface. Do not confuse illusion with reality.' 'I'm not concerned with the particulars. Is it feasible or not?' Ye Wei pressed. She held no preference for the current Mo Jue over his past self; she was well aware that the true Mo Jue was the man he had once been. Her fear was that if he reverted to his prior temperament, their camaraderie would dissolve. It seemed preferable to maintain the current façade. 'Would you really settle for a mere husk of the man?' Su Man questioned, taken aback. This was uncharacteristic of Ye Wei, who lived freely and never went to such lengths for anyone. 'He isn't completely hollow; his present demeanor has its own appeal,' Ye Wei argued, her tone shifting to one of frost. 'Can it be done, or can it not?' 'Impossible,' Su Man stated unequivocally. 'If the constructed personality overshadows the original for an extended period, it will consume him entirely, culminating in his death.' Ye Wei's expression darkened. Could he truly perish? She hesitated, a weight seeming to press upon her chest, an ominous premonition clouding her thoughts. 'Su Man, I have a grave foreboding. It's a choice between his life and mine. How should I proceed?' 'Do you wish death upon him or yourself?' 'Nonsense, I'm in the prime of youth; I have no desire to die.' 'Is the solution not evident then?' Su Man challenged, leaving Ye Wei at a loss for words. 'Understood,' Ye Wei conceded with a smile that thinly veiled a trace of lethal intent. 'I comprehend now.' With that, she turned on her heel and left the lab. As she departed, Bai Ye made his entrance. Su Man's gaze turned icy, his voice cutting like the sharpest blade. 'What purpose brings you to my sanctum?' 'Rome has dispatched the latest viral analysis data,' Bai Ye responded evenly, his gaze following the path Ye Wei had taken. 'Are you certain you're not erring on the side of disrupting fate?' 'Fate at times warrants defiance,' Su Man retorted. Bai Ye found himself at a loss for words. Ye Wei sat alone in the central courtyard, engulfed in silence, her heart heavy with regret for her encounter with Su Man. She had never before been plagued with such indecision. As the moon shone bright above, it only served to amplify her inner turmoil. Mo Jue, Mo Jue... What to do about him? Ye Wei's thoughts were in turmoil. If Mo Jue reverted to his former self, they would stand as adversaries. The memory of their past fierce clashes filled her with a mix of thrill and helplessness. If he remained as Big White, it would be an unfair existence, a life built on an illusion. Ye Wei wanted neither. Nor could she bear the thought that Big White's gentle nature might be nothing but a ruse. She knew herself too well; she would not hesitate to strike down an enemy, even if that enemy was Mo Jue. To kill him? To be unable to follow through? Su Man's eyes held a penetrating clarity. If it came to blows between her and Mo Jue, she would fight with all her might. But to actually take his life? She was likely incapable, as evidenced by the incident on the beach. If she were to act, now was the time. His recent behavior was concerning. Should he revert to the old Mo Jue, she might never find the strength to end him. To kill or not to kill? Ye Wei rubbed her forehead, grappling with the vexing question. 'Why sit here brooding amidst the sweltering heat?' Shi Yi clapped Ye Wei's shoulder, settling beside her. 'Debating Mo Jue's demise?' 'You know me too well,' Ye Wei replied with a smile. 'I am indeed conflicted over whether to kill him.' Allowing the tiger to escape once nearly cost her brother's entire family. The virus within Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya remained a puzzle, and though Xiao Naibao was unharmed, Nuo Nuo's death had left an irreparable void. Had she taken Shi Yi's advice on the beach and eradicated the Mo brothers, none of this would have unfolded. Louis would have found it nearly impossible to seize them. Now, with a growing sense of foreboding, all signs pointed to the Mo brothers. With Mo Jue right beside her, an opportunity beckoned. If it slipped by, she might never have another chance to vanquish Mo Jue. They were the architects of their own fate; it was theirs to conclude. 'Shi Yi, if it were Mo Lao Da in this state, would you end him?' Ye Wei suddenly inquired. Shi Yi's response was chilling, 'My words hold no weight. Decide for yourself, lest I influence you wrongly.' 'That's as good as a yes,' Ye Wei surmised, her smile betraying her understanding. 'Such a quandary. How could I possibly bring myself to harm such an innocent Mo Jue?' '......' Ye Wei, you are hopelessly entangled. 'Where could Mo Lao Da have vanished to these past days?' Ye Wei pondered aloud, the anomaly of the situation causing her concern. 'On the beach, he nearly relinquished his gun, his life, for Mo Jue. Now that Mo Jue is in our custody, Mo Lao Da has disappeared. Isn't that peculiar? His affection for Mo Jue runs deep; it's inconceivable for him to abandon him thus.' 'I, too, find it peculiar,' Shi Yi concurred, his eyes narrowing. 'It's not just you; I also harbor an ominous premonition.' Their assassin instincts were razor-sharp. Exchanging glances but no words, they remained seated for a time before Ye Wei retreated to her room. Within, Mo Jue was consumed by a computer game. Ye Wei's brows knitted; it had been days since she'd last observed Mo Jue so engaged with a computer. His face lit up upon seeing her, 'Wife, you've returned. Give me a kiss.' Ye Wei acquiesced, kissing his lips, 'What is it that you're playing?' 'Games,' Mo Jue declared, eager to show off his triumph. 'I've conquered the monster.' 'Impressive,' Ye Wei acknowledged, her smile genuine. The gaming screen allayed her apprehensions. This simpleton... She regarded Mo Jue, his exceptional features, his smile pure. Who could bear to harm someone so guileless? 'Wife, why do you gaze at me so?' Mo Jue inquired, pausing his game, his eyes reflecting confusion, 'What troubles you, wife?' 'Nothing,' Ye Wei replied offhandedly, collapsing onto the bed. This fool, his gaze was too innocent. 'Wife, you appear saddened,' Mo Jue pressed, his tone laced with severity, 'Who has wronged you? Inform Big White, and I shall rend them limb from limb.' In an instant, an angelic facade gave way to a demonic resolve. 'The only sorrow is for those I choose to afflict; none dare wrong me,' Ye Wei stated, dismissing the idea, 'Do I truly look despondent to you?' Ye Wei, does he understand the concept of sorrow? 'Your visage is that of sorrow,' Mo Jue insisted, 'Wife, do you indeed cherish Su Man so dearly?' 'Indeed, I do.' 'And what of me? Of Big White?' 'You are different.' Ye Wei responded with laughter, soothing his ruffled demeanor, 'No need for frowns. Why concern yourself with my feelings for Su Man?' 'I do not wish for you to cherish him.' 'I harbor affections for many—third brother, Shi Yi, third sister-in-law, Ning Ning... My heart is vast,' Ye Wei responded, amused by Mo Jue's pique. 'Wife, you omitted me.' Mo Jue's eyes brimmed with a palpable sense of injury, his grip on Ye Wei's sleeve reminiscent of a yearning pup. 'Enough. Allow me to freshen up, and we shall converse,' Ye Wei announced, springing from the bed and entering the en suite. Mo Jue, left behind, sulked, his fingers dancing across the keyboard, the screen transitioning to another three-dimensional image. To drink or not to drink? Why was his brother advocating for inebriation? Through typed words, Mo Ye conveyed: After you drink, your wife will adore you even more. Mo Jue considered the proposition. Could there be truth to this? Mo Lao Da: Trust in me, be good. Mo Jue's gaze drifted to the side where two glasses of red wine stood, recently delivered by a maid. His wife had always forbidden him from drinking, but curiosity prevailed... As Ye Wei emerged from the bathroom, she was struck by a discernible shift in the atmosphere. Despite the chamber's chill from the ice jade embellishments, a visceral cold enveloped her. Mo Jue sat at the edge of the bed, the wine glass slipping from his fingers... When had alcohol made its way into this room? Ye Wei's heart raced, yet Mo Jue looked up at her, his eyes now a frosty shade of purple, cold and menacing, his aura exuding an air of sinister mystery. Ye Wei paused for a mere three seconds before her lips curled into a familiar, alluring smile, 'Greetings, Mo Jue the beauty. Have you stirred from your slumber?' Chapter 375: The Onset of the Virus Mo Jue stood up slowly, his tall figure casting a shadow as if dipped in the darkness of the night, exuding a formidable pressure that made the already cool room feel like it was swept by a frigid blizzard, pregnant with lurking danger. It was an atmosphere strained and piercing, seemingly capable of slicing a person into shreds. Ye Wei's smile became more bewitching by the second, while her eyes held a fierce murderous intent. A cold ruthlessness and complex determination lay beneath her alluring exterior, making her resemble a poppy perched precariously at the cliff's edge—stunning, yet fraught with peril. In their standoff, neither spoke, each seeming to measure the strength of the other's aura. Their gazes, both beautiful and perilous, clashed in mid-air, sparking ferocious scorching sparks of intensity. This scenario was all too familiar. It reminded them of their encounter in the underground waterway, where both were unrelenting, unforgiving, each intent on putting the other in the ground. Mo Jue, do you, too, wish for my demise? They were akin to each other; if she harbored intentions to kill Mo Jue, she was well aware that the true Mo Jue would not spare her life either. The feeling was mutual. "Where is this place?" Mo Jue asked, each syllable ice-cold, his voice chilling. His last clear memory was on the island, being struck by Ye Wei with a rum bottle. Everything since then, the past seven days, were a void in his memory. He had no recollection of the events that transpired while he was his alter ego, Big White. But, with his keen observational abilities and astonishing deductive reasoning, he deduced that Ye Wei had managed to escape peril, and it was he who had assisted her. Otherwise, on that island, even if Shi Yi had been unharmed, the two of them wouldn't have been able to escape. He knew that once he consumed alcohol, he would become subservient to whoever he laid eyes on first, which is why Mo Ye never allowed him to drink. Since his birth, he had only been drunk foolishly once by accident, three times when Big Boss Mo deemed him adorable when inebriated, and once as a child after they had caused mischief, Big Boss Mo made him drink, then go and act coquettishly with their master. Other than these five times, this was the sixth. Mo Jue was acutely aware of Ye Wei's nature; she would surely exploit his vulnerability to the fullest, and his elder brother would certainly give Ye Wei and Shi Yi a pass, for the time being, to protect him. "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia," Ye Wei replied, her laugh as melodious as a silver bell. "Mo Jue, have you truly forgotten everything?" Her statement was conclusive; however well he hid it, his reaction spoke volumes. He had forgotten, indeed... Ye Wei was stricken with indignation. Although she often felt she had the upper hand over Mo Jue, in the past seven days, she had treated him with exceptional kindness, freely embracing and kissing him, stopping just short of consummating their relationship. She had seldom been so kind, so gentle, and now... He had forgotten? Ye Wei struggled to keep her composure, while Mo Jue, ever so detached, said curtly, "Not required!" "Not required?" Ye Wei's eyebrows arched; she could hardly believe her ears. The smile on her face turned chillier, her ire rising. Mo Jue regarded her coldly, "These memories, I don't need them." Ye Wei's eyes grew colder, the flicker of anger within them flaring into a blaze. Despite herself, she smiled, "Indeed, there's no need. For you, it was but a dream that left no trace upon waking. For me, it wasn't even worth a dream, so naturally, it's not worth remembering." Mo Jue's eyes darkened further, and the room's curtains fluttered. The vast room was suddenly filled with a ferocious, murderous intent. The tension was like a bowstring drawn tight, ready to snap. In a flash, Mo Jue moved, his silhouette as quick as a specter. In the blink of an eye, he was before Ye Wei, his fingers stretching out towards her throat at an astonishing speed. A gust swept through the room, and Ye Wei retreated rapidly, her right foot pressing against the wall to leverage a flip, landing behind Mo Jue. Her leg swept toward Mo Jue's spine. Without even turning his head, Mo Jue used the sound to locate her, catching her ankle, pulling and yanking her like an eagle tossing a chick, slamming Ye Wei against the wall with force. That's brutal indeed! Ye Wei turned mid-air, her back facing Mo Jue. He didn't grant her a moment's reprieve, his palm strike following immediately. Ye Wei braced herself against the wall with one palm, her feet kicking rapidly against the wall to ascend, narrowly avoiding Mo Jue's subsequent palm strike. She grasped the crystal chandelier's iron handle, spun with agility, and kicked at Mo Jue, compelling him to retreat. Seizing the opportunity to land, Ye Wei kicked up the wooden chair in the room and swept it toward Mo Jue, not giving him a moment to react. Mo Jue's fist met the chair head-on, the massive force of the impact clashing and utterly obliterating the chair. Splinters flew in all directions. His fist collided with the oncoming fist of Ye Wei, and that very moment, Ye Wei felt her wrist go numb, a sharp pain in her tiger's mouth. Her other hand opened, pressing up along Mo Jue's arm, trying to pin him down. However, Mo Jue easily turned around, securing her in a reverse embrace. "You cannot defeat me." Mo Jue's voice was deep, as he coldly stated an incontrovertible truth. His hot breath sprayed across Ye Wei's neck, the same scent she had grown deeply familiar with over these seven days. Ye Wei cracked a faint smile, "Then, let's see whose heart is the coldest." As she finished speaking, her elbow thrust backward, but Mo Jue restrained it. Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain on his other wrist. Ye Wei had twisted it, her body spinning as she fiercely kicked toward his head. Mo Jue was caught off guard and took the blow full-on, his body slamming against the wall. Ye Wei lightly touched down, the chair rising to meet her grip, and she swung it fiercely at Mo Jue. Mo Jue shielded his head with his arms, and the chair shattered against his arms, leaving behind only a single leg. As sturdy as iron. "Damn it, Su Meiren, with all your wealth, you still resort to counterfeit products?" The chair was too fragile, clearly a knockoff, as it had fallen apart so easily. Ye Wei threw the stick in her hand and swung her fists furiously at Mo Jue's handsome face. Before she could revel in the violence, Mo Jue caught her wrist and yanked her forward. Their positions were swiftly reversed, Ye Wei now pinned against the wall by Mo Jue's relentless assault, no mercy in his blows, his fists pummeling her chest and abdomen. "You think you're tough?" Mo Jue's voice was dark, his face indifferent as Ye Wei coughed up blood from his punches. He raised his fist again, landing it hard on her abdomen. Ye Wei vomited a mouthful of blood, her face instantly turning pale as paper, feeling as though her internal organs had shifted, a searing pain engulfing her. The agony was beyond bearable... Compared to their initial clash in the sewer, this time, Mo Jue's blows were harsher, swifter. His actions made it clear that he was the more ruthless one, so she should not dare to outdo him in cruelty. Ye Wei wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth, her smile alluring and stubborn, like a rose losing its luster but still fiercely blooming in beauty, determined to wither in a blaze of glory. "Why have you stopped hitting?" Ye Wei's smile was radiant as she raised her hand and lashed out fiercely at Mo Jue. He dodged with a turn of his head, and seizing the moment, Ye Wei's other hand, stained with blood, slapped Mo Jue's face hard. Mo Jue's eyes plunged into darkness, and with a chuckle, Ye Wei said, "That punch, that slap, let's settle all our accounts from these past seven days. We are even now." He hesitated, and Ye Wei smiled, her beauty devilish, and Mo Jue realized that in the midst of their fight, Ye Wei's palm had reached his chest, striking him with force. Mo Jue stumbled back several steps. Blood trickled from his lips. He lifted his gaze, his eyes sweeping coldly over her, as Ye Wei's palm wind struck him repeatedly in the chest, holding back no force, clearly intending to beat him to death. Utterly ruthless. She wore a smile, but it was one that smothered with its danger. "Ye Wei!" Mo Jue, normally a man of few words, was now filled with rage. His body surged up swiftly, a man and a woman, both formidable, entangled in a wild fight. It was an unsophisticated brawl, as if they had both forgotten their martial arts skills, fighting like street brawlers, all attack and no defense. A punch for a punch, a slap for a slap. Like wild beasts, they growled and wrestled, the furniture in the room scattered and shattered, leaving nothing intact, resembling the aftermath of an earthquake. They were both battered and bruised, here a contusion, there a purple mark, a gruesome sight, especially Ye Wei, who looked like a blood-stained, shattered doll. Yet she seemed to possess infinite strength, stubbornly standing off against Mo Jue, showing no sign of weakness. Such commotion had already alarmed Bai Ye, Su Man, and Shi Yi, along with Ye Sanshao, Cheng An Ya, and Xiao Naibao. When they arrived, Ye Wei was on top of Mo Jue, delivering punches relentlessly, a ferocity that sent chills down Bai Ye and Ye Sanshao's spines. Suddenly Mo Jue's leg lashed out at her abdomen with force. As Ye Wei fell backward, seemingly about to land on a pile of broken glass, Shi Yi was about to step forward to catch her, but Mo Jue was quicker. With a skillful tug at her hand, the two rose from the ground. As they steadied themselves, they both threw punches, their fists colliding with violent force, each retreating. Shi Yi steadied her waist, and Ye Wei finally stood upright, both panting, their appearances disheveled. Mo Jue's once heavenly face was now marred by conflict, and Ye Wei was no better off. The stark difference in Mo Jue's demeanor signified his return to his original self. The contrast was night and day. "You two certainly put on quite the show," Bai Ye commented dryly. It was the first time he had witnessed Ye Wei beaten to such a state—an extraordinary sight indeed. While he had come with the intent to watch, his fists were clenched, ready to join the fray at any moment. Ye Wei laughed, her voice rich and alluring, like a rose stained with blood, "Mo Jue, I can't outfight you alone, but what about a brawl?" Mo Jue gave a cold snort, "Feel free to try." "Big White, no... Mo Jue, you boast a bold tongue. If we set Wei Wei aside, Shi Yi and I alone would ensure you cannot leave this estate," Bai Ye coldly jeered, fully prepared to engage in battle. Shi Yi grunted, "He won't escape." After receiving such a brutal beating, Mo Jue wouldn't be allowed to leave unscathed. Cheng An Ya then suggested, "Ah Chen, why don't you fight him? If you lose, his demise is guaranteed either way." The virus, what a formidable weapon. Bai Ye gave a thumbs up, "Smart thinking." However, Ye Sanshao's gaze still lingered on Ye Wei. Suddenly, a tear gas canister shattered through the window and into the room, breaking the glass. White smoke billowed, and everyone quickly evacuated the room, closing the door behind them. When they re-entered, the room was empty. "Boss Mo has made his move," Xiao Naibao declared. Since Mo Jue had vanished, any pursuit would be futile. Shi Yi furrowed his brows, and at that moment, Ye Wei clutched her abdomen, spewing another mouthful of blood, and collapsed into Shi Yi's arms. "Wei Wei..." Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya rushed over anxiously, not daring to touch her, their concern evident. Ye Sanshao turned to Bai Ye, "Bai Ye..." "To my room," Shi Yi directed, and Bai Ye carried her there. Ye Sanshao wanted to follow, but Xiao Naibao had already entered Ye Wei's room. Concerned for their son's safety, Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya stayed behind. Xiao Naibao carefully avoided the debris and leaped onto the bed. "Ning Ning, what are you doing?" Ye Sanshao asked sternly, his curiosity piqued as he took a seat. All eyes turned to the computer screen. Mo Jue: Drink? Boss Mo: After drinking, your wife will love you even more. Mo Jue: Is that true? Boss Mo: Trust your brother. Ye Sanshao's eyebrow twitched, and Miss Cheng looked to the heavens in silent query—was this enticement? "Damn, Boss Mo is truly ingenious, summoning Mo Jue back just like that?" It was a blatant lure. The game between the wolf and the rabbit. Clearly, the rabbit had lost. "Only Boss Mo could pull that off," Xiao Naibao mused, his fingers flying across the keyboard until the screen appeared to nearly collapse, a torrent of English text scrolling rapidly before coming to a halt. "Daddy, do you remember the car we saw parked outside when we arrived?" Xiao Naibao suddenly asked. Ye Sanshao nodded. "Boss Mo was there," Xiao Naibao stated. Before Ye Sanshao could speak, a sharp pain erupted in his arm and liver, as if fine needles were stabbing his organ. His limbs began to ache terribly, followed by violent convulsions. He collapsed onto the bed, his body writhing in torment. "Ah Chen..." "Daddy..." "Quick, call Su Man!" Cheng An Ya cried out in urgency as Xiao Naibao jumped down and dashed away. "Ah Chen, hold on. You'll be okay," Cheng An Ya spoke, her voice filled with uncertainty, whether for him or for herself, her anxiety peaking. The fear of losing him was ever-present. Her hands trembled with dread, Cheng An Ya's face deathly pale. Hadn't Su Man said the virus would strike tomorrow? Why had it come early? "Ah..." Ye Sanshao let out a sudden, agonizing scream, veins bulging on his forehead, his delicate features contorting with an inhuman pain. Pushed beyond his limit... he fell into unconsciousness. Chapter 376: Untitled The virus inside Ye Sanshao manifested sooner than anyone anticipated, sending Cheng An Ya into a state of panic. Desperate to be by his side, yet advised by Su Man against visiting the lab, she reluctantly complied. Su Meiren's commanding presence made her words difficult to ignore, compelling Cheng An Ya to heed the advice despite her profound anxiety. 'Mommy, don't worry, Daddy will be fine.' Xiao Naibao reassured Cheng An Ya, his young face carrying a steadiness and determination that seemed beyond his years. His graceful smile held a poise that suggested the chaos around him hadn't touched him, his composure remarkable. 'Darling, Mommy isn't that fragile. I shouldn't need comfort at a time like this. Everything will be okay.' Miss Cheng knew her son well and smiled back, encouraging him not to fret, though her concern lingered. No matter her own fears, she made sure not to let Xiao Naibao see any panic. How would it look if Xiao Naibao, who shared her apprehension, had to be the one consoling her? She had always been Xiao Naibao's most formidable mommy, hadn't she? The mother-son duo then went to see Ye Wei, who was unconscious due to severe injuries. Bai Ye had already examined her, instructing that medicinal herbs be prepared and painkillers administered. Cheng An Ya felt a twinge of sympathy for Ye Wei's battered state. 'These injuries would be severe for an ordinary person, but Ye Wei will recover from this in a few days,' Bai Ye reassured. 'So these aren't considered severe?' Cheng An Ya asked incredulously. What would it take then? Being beaten to death? In Ye Wei's room, the bloodstains on her clothes were a testament to the brutality she had endured. Ye Wei's unconscious state was indicative of the extremity of her wounds. 'It’s nothing serious; she’ll recuperate in a few days,' Bai Ye commented lightly, while Shi Yi diligently attended to her wounds. 'What kind of deep-seated enmity makes them battle to near-death? It seems rather excessive, doesn't it?' Bai Ye pondered, stroking his chin. Could it be Mo Jue’s rage from embarrassment? 'When have they not fought as if their lives were at stake?' Shi Yi remarked, her tone a mix of curiosity and concern over Mo Jue's sudden, inexplicable recovery. 'Bai Ye, when will she likely awaken?' 'She should come around by tomorrow morning,' Bai Ye anticipated, tapping Shi Yi’s shoulder. 'Shi Yi, has Wei Wei truly fallen for him?' 'What do you think?' 'Is her heart captivated by the noble Big White, or the enchanting Mo Jue?' Bai Ye inquired further, genuinely curious. Xiao Naibao pondered for a moment, 'It must be the enchanting Mo Jue, right?' 'Why do you think that?' Both Shi Yi and Bai Ye asked in unison, Bai Ye inwardly marveling, 'Ning Ning, my dear, have you also come to understand what it is to fall in love? The world evolves so rapidly.' 'Just a feeling,' Xiao Naibao explained. Mo Jue's character might be more appealing to Ye Wei. And Big White? It was Mo Jue's transformation that made Ye Wei tolerate his foolishness afterward. With anyone else, she would've distanced herself long ago. In the end, it was all because of Mo Jue. 'Poor Wei Wei.' Bai Ye observed her wounds, feigned a sigh, and laughed freely, arms crossed in anticipation. 'I'm quite curious to see how Wei Wei will manage to win over the formidable enchantress Mo Jue.' Miss Cheng, who had remained silent, finally spoke up, 'I've never understood—what's the difference between Big White and Mo Jue? Aren't they the same person?' 'Mommy, there's a world of difference,' Xiao Naibao contended, with Bai Ye and Shi Yi concurring. They couldn't be viewed as one and the same. One akin to a demon, the other an angel. Different realms, different factions; they simply couldn't be equated. 'But consider Daddy. Sometimes, he's the epitome of seriousness, and at other times, he's utterly foolish. Isn't it true that everyone has many aspects to their personality? So why can't Mo Jue?' Cheng An Ya shared her perspective with a smile. 'It's all the same person after all, isn't it?' 'Different.' 'The same.' 'Mommy, it's three against one. The majority rules; you're outnumbered. There's no use resisting.' Xiao Naibao remarked playfully, the very image of a charming young English gentleman. '......' Cheng An Ya fell silent, her ideals of democracy in tatters. As if reading Cheng An Ya's mind, Xiao Naibao added with a chuckle, 'Mommy, when have you ever witnessed true democracy in action? And as for societal harmony—when has that ever been achieved?' Bai Ye and Shi Yi gave a thumbs-up—impressive was all they could say. Cheng An Ya felt slighted, 'You, being a grown man, shouldn't be so harsh with a delicate woman.' Xiao Naibao, '......um......' They left Shi Yi’s room amidst laughter, Bai Ye commenting, 'They truly are an extraordinary mother and son.' 'Their entire family is extraordinary.' Shi Yi concluded concisely, alluding to their unique peculiarities. 'Mr. Su, the master requests your presence in the lab.' A maid arrived quickly to summon Bai Ye, causing a brief pause among everyone. Bai Ye nodded and followed her to the lab. 'Ning Ning, what's wrong?' 'Su Man has called Bai Ye to the lab.' Xiao Naibao clarified, and Cheng An Ya’s heart sank. Had Ye Sanshao’s condition worsened? Her heart pounded, and Cheng An Ya’s complexion turned pale. She sat alone in the central courtyard, Xiao Naibao willing to stay, but as the night progressed, Cheng An Ya sent him to bed. Reluctantly, Xiao Naibao retired to his room. The night in Riyadh was stifling, the air motionless, the outdoor temperature unbearable, even in light attire. Cheng An Ya, however, was gripped by a cold that seeped into her bones, cold sweat beading on her brow, devoid of any sense of warmth. Cold. A chill from within, unsettling in its pervasiveness. It brought back the feeling of when Louis had revealed the virus's presence and they awaited Ye Sanshao's arrival. Profoundly afraid. The night deepened, the second half drawing near. She contemplated visiting the lab several times but hesitated, paralyzed by fear of what the virus's outbreak might entail. She knew all too well the torment it caused. When it struck her, the pain was excruciating, each moment an ordeal. Yet, her suffering was brief, as Louis would soon administer an agent to alleviate the pain. But she had witnessed Zhang Bo, in that small house, bashing his head, bloodied and battered, choosing death over enduring such pain. The more Cheng An Ya recalled Zhang Bo’s tragic fate, the colder she felt, her heart rate quickening, the ominous premonition returning. The night was silent, save for the sound of the courtyard fountain's spray. Once soothing, it now only added to her unease. She paced the courtyard, then sat, arms crossed in deep reflection, blending into the darkness, her presence as silent as non-existence. Then, she stood, a decision made, and strode toward the lab. The closer she approached, the more daunting it seemed. She dreaded hearing Ye Sanshao's agonized screams, but to her surprise, all was quiet. Cheng An Ya reassured herself—perhaps everything was fine. Bai Ye's medical expertise was renowned, and Su Man was a virology expert; this situation was different from Zhang Bo's. Perhaps there was hope; she should not let fear overwhelm her. Resolved, she pushed open the lab door and entered. Bai Ye, focused on the research monitor, was the first to notice Cheng An Ya. He arched an eyebrow, 'An Ya, why have you come?' Su Man, engrossed in testing two agents, didn't look up, his attention fixed on analyzing the compounds through the microscope. Cheng An Ya spoke softly, 'Please continue. I won't be a disruption. I just want to be with him.' Bai Ye glanced at Ye Sanshao on the operating table and nodded. The lab was small but equipped with state-of-the-art technology, making Cheng An Ya feel as though she had stepped into the setting of a sci-fi film. Ye Sanshao lay on the operating table, clad in an isolation gown, an oxygen mask secured to his face. Shackles restrained his limbs, and numerous needles protruded from his arms, chest, thighs, calves, and even his head. Various vials with mysterious fluids trickled into his bloodstream. Cheng An Ya gazed at his hand, her eyes catching the sight of blood on the floor. Following the crimson trail, she discovered a larger pool beneath her feet. Turning to his wrist, she saw it tightly clamped by handcuffs. Struggle had left clear wounds on his wrist, oozing blood. She bit her lip, holding back the tears that threatened to spill. She could imagine his struggle, the self-inflicted harm. There was no need to look further; his ankles were likely injured too. He must have tried to break free. Ah Chen... Through the isolation gown, she held his hand, Cheng An Ya looking at the unconscious Ye Sanshao, her heart aching in silence, tears threatening but never falling. She couldn't cry; he was bound to get better. As the saying goes, every wrongdoing meets its fate, and every act of kindness its reward. The one due for retribution was Louis, not Ye Chen, who had endured a lifetime of suffering. Ah Chen, don't be afraid, I am here with you, always. Even if it meant descending into hell, she would not let him face it alone. Cheng An Ya remembered a vow she had made: from that day on, she would be Ye Chen's guardian deity. But she had not lived up to her promise. Instead, her actions had nearly cost him his life. What sort of guardian was she? More like a harbinger of doom. Cheng An Ya felt a surge of regret, holding Ye Sanshao's hand tightly, biting back the tears, simply keeping him company in the quiet. Ye Sanshao slept deeply, his pale face serene. His breaths were faint, his heartbeat barely audible, his hand faintly warm—Cheng An Ya found a sliver of comfort. He was alive, and for that, she was grateful. As long as he drew breath, she would be by his side, every second, for every day that lay ahead. Chapter 377 Untitled Cheng An Ya had steadfastly remained beside Ye Sanshao in the laboratory until the wee hours of the morning. After administering a sedative, Ye Sanshao succumbed to a profound slumber. The only audible sounds were the muted beeps of electronic instruments and the gentle clinking of test tubes—the lab was steeped in a profound hush. Despite the dread filling her heart, Cheng An Ya had vowed not to disturb Bai Ye and Su Man, lest she impede their crucial endeavors. The duo worked in perfect sync—one conducting hands-on experiments, the other immersed in data analysis—sharing an unspoken rapport that negated the need for verbal communication. Cheng An Ya, seated silently beside Ye Sanshao, struggled against the tides of exhaustion; however, sleep continued to elude her. Her watchful eyes traced the contours of his face, occasionally darting towards Bai Ye and Su Man, seeking any hint of their progress from the subtle shifts in their expressions. Finally, Bai Ye could no longer overlook her plight. 'An Ya, it would be best if you rested. Sanshao won't awaken until we've concocted the antidote. Your vigil here serves no purpose.' 'I'm not weary,' Cheng An Ya asserted, her determination to remain by Ye Sanshao's side unwavering. Bai Ye afforded her a sympathetic smile. 'It isn't mere fatigue I'm concerned about; it's the risk of the virus within you becoming more unstable. It could manifest prematurely if you neglect your well-being.' Cheng An Ya's lips quivered, torn between her steadfast desire to stay and the logical truth in Bai Ye's admonition. She clenched Ye Sanshao's hand a little tighter, yet the strength to leave his side escaped her. She yearned to remain close to him, even at the expense of her own safety. 'You cannot possibly forgo sustenance and slumber indefinitely,' Bai Ye reasoned, recognizing the stubborn streak she shared with Ye Wei. Her face, a mask of resolve, rendered further persuasion pointless. 'Just a moment longer,' she whispered, each minute invaluable, acutely aware that there was nothing for her beyond these walls. Bai Ye exhaled a resigned sigh, yielding to her wish. He knew that eventually, fatigue would claim her. The enigma of love baffled him—why did the wise willingly partake in folly, choosing paths that offered neither solace nor solutions? With the exchange of the latest batch of data with Su Man came a frosty glance. The ambient temperature of the lab seemed to drop as Su Man spoke, 'A woman's presence here only serves as a distraction; it diminishes our efficacy.' Bai Ye remained silent. The icy tone of Su Man's declaration hinted at an underlying truth, though it made Bai Ye question if there might be more to his aversion towards Ye Wei. Cheng An Ya rose to her feet, a mixture of sorrow and indignation etched onto her face. 'Su Man, there's no need for such flagrant sexism.' Unmoved, Su Man regarded her with an air of unyielding arrogance, devoid of any semblance of empathy or chivalry. As if a ghost, Miss Cheng wafted out of the lab—her presence evidently a hindrance. If Su Man considered her presence detrimental to their work, then she had no choice but to depart. The imperative of their research outweighed her personal desires, and she could no longer justify remaining. Bai Ye nodded in Su Man's direction with a mixture of admiration and resignation. 'Impressive.' Su Man's eyes narrowed, and with a contemptuous snort, he turned back to his work. The pressing nature of their mission left no room for idle conversation, and Bai Ye, too, returned his focus to the task at hand. This was a medical puzzle the likes of which Bai Ye had never encountered, demanding his full attention to match Su Man's pace. As a genius doctor, he could not allow himself to be outshone. His reputation as a genius in the medical field was not without merit. 'May you one day fall into the hands of a woman,' Cheng An Ya muttered under her breath, her vexation tinged with a wry humor. Would a BL enthusiast genuinely scorn women? It was a concept she had never considered. If all BL enthusiasts were sexist, the fujoshi and BL wolves would surely be distressed. The internet was nearly overrun with fujoshi. Having navigated its realms for years, Cheng An Ya knew many a BL wolf and fujoshi, all fervent in their passion for BL—intimidating and formidable. And she herself was a proud BL wolf. The sting of being spurned was not a pleasant sensation. A curious thought crossed her mind—what transpires when two men are left alone, particularly when one is openly gay? Bai Ye, with his impeccable character and magnetic allure, was undeniably captivating—poised and graceful like jade. The idea was... An image of their intimate affection flashed through her mind, throwing her into disarray. Ah, she must be losing her sanity to entertain such a fantasy. Su Man was the very embodiment of cold ruthlessness, his gaze exuding absolute dominance. His aura, noble and untouchable, seemed to consider any attention a desecration. How could he possibly harbor romantic feelings for Bai Ye? It was his overt sexism that had sparked her wild musings, sending her thoughts adrift. O(╯□╰)o. Time surged forward, and in the blink of an eye, seven days had elapsed. Ye Wei's injuries had healed without leaving a trace, her complexion clear of any blemishes, her recovery nothing short of miraculous. Xiao Naibao jokingly referred to his aunt as an invincible cockroach, marveling at the speed of her recuperation. One might have anticipated a shadow of despondency to linger, yet since regaining consciousness, Ye Wei had been the picture of radiance, her demeanor indistinguishable from before as if Mo Jue had never existed in her life. She refrained from mentioning Mo Jue or Big White, as if he had been permanently expunged from her memory, unworthy of even a cursory thought. With pressing matters concerning The premier terrorist organization and neither Ye Wei nor Shi Yi in command positions, they opted to stay put in Riyadh. The world outside seemed deceptively calm, except for the upheaval in Melilia. Driven by rage for a beloved, Chu Li orchestrated a siege with the elite air forces of The premier terrorist organization, unleashing a relentless aerial assault on Prince William of Country R in the desert. Considering Li Yan's presence in the castle, Chu Li refrained from a full-scale bombardment, choosing instead to rely on sophisticated military firepower to besiege and strike. In a more sinister move, he contaminated the castle's nearby water source, severing their lifeline. The daily aerial circling above the castle was Chu Li's way of stating, 'I have all the time in the world; let's see who can endure.' Such brutish and domineering tactics were characteristic of a terrorist. With Chu Li's shrewdness, cutting off the water supply was merciful compared to what he could have done. If not for considerations for Li Yan, the conflict would have been far more harrowing and savage. As for Dragon Gate, Lin Yixuan's legal battle concluded victoriously, and he was released. Authorities from City A officially cleared the misunderstanding. Tang Si's condition was also on the mend, securing stability for Dragon Gate's dealings. On behalf of Ye Sanshao, Xiao Naibao juggled Dragon Gate's operations in North America while remaining on standby to aid Chu Li and the terrorists. Simultaneously, he contended with the joint military suppression from the Spanish, Italian, and other governments. Xiao Naibao advocated for a strategic withdrawal from the Middle East to seek a temporary reprieve from the international spotlight. Chu Li's provocation towards Country R had incited neighboring nations to lend their support, through troops or condemnation, whether they desired to or not. Additionally, the recent clashes with the Mafia had sounded alarms, with countries approaching with resolute determination to exploit this chance to diminish The premier terrorist organization's might. Chu Li, unfazed, continued his desert vigils, mocking Prince William and brazenly ignoring the government troops' encirclement. He arrogantly proclaimed this was a personal grudge between him and Prince William, warning that any interlopers would rue their interference. Given Chu Li's notorious track record, most smaller countries dared only to protest vocally, lacking the audacity to act. Amidst the clash between The premier terrorist organization and several governments, the opportune moment for the Mafia to act had arrived. Xiao Naibao had expected Louis to rally the Mafia to suppress The premier terrorist organization, seizing the chance to unify the underworld's might. Unexpectedly, the Mafia seemed to have receded into the shadows. Aside from a few minor military operations in the Middle East in collaboration with government forces, the Mafia's trail had gone cold. Xiao Naibao was befuddled, and upon investigation, found that Louis had been convincing the authorities to capitalize on the conflict, thus maintaining a safe distance from the fray while observing the power play unfold. Shi Yi, with a somber countenance, remarked, 'This is uncharacteristically passive for Louis.' Ye Wei concurred; their dealings with the Mafia, albeit limited, suggested that Louis's usual demeanor would not allow for such restraint. 'Could this be the doing of the Mo Brothers?' Cheng An Ya posed the question abruptly, having stayed informed of the ongoing events and developed her own insights. 'What might they be plotting?' Ye Wei sharply identified the crux of the matter, leaving Xiao Naibao momentarily perplexed. 'Their alliance with the government forces is tenuous at best,' Ye Wei said, her smile laced with allure. 'The chief mentioned last night that the Counter-Terrorism Organization has begun to intervene. The government troops will soon be scattered. They didn't anticipate this, war and chaos—that's the bane of counter-terror.' Chapter 378: A Scandal Brewing! Xiao Naibao paused, recalling the chief’s tirade in their group chat from the previous evening. With marked reluctance, he had instructed those in danger zones to hasten their withdrawal to avoid incoming fire. The sensation was indescribable—a peculiar cocktail of trepidation and glee. This operation was slated to be the premier terrorist organization's most significant and far-reaching military action to date. The Counter-Terrorism Organization, eager for engagement since their almost-intervention on Fatal Island, now faced a threat extending to Country R. With Country R's robust ties with South American and European nations, intervention seemed inevitable. The probable conclusion seemed to be the dissolution of the united government forces. If they intervened, mutual destruction was likely. The optimal strategy to save Country R and maintain peace was to dissolve the government forces, recasting the conflict as a petty squabble over a woman between Chu Li and Prince William. Only by letting it peter out could peace potentially be preserved. "It looks like it'll take half a month," Xiao Naibao mused, stroking his chin with a cunning smile, keen to observe the impending struggle. Despite the chief’s notorious temper, he was astute. Trickery was no easy feat with him. Shi Yi concurred, "If you want the chief to make a move, you'd better have something worth his while. Consider who he's after or what case he's itching to crack. Otherwise, he won’t budge." "The chief is all about grand gestures. A word to Ning Ning, and he’d have whatever information he needed," added Ye Wei with a laugh. Cheng An Ya joined in with a chuckle, "Wei Wei, let Chu Li claim his prize and return. If you stall and the Mafia ambushes, you'll be blindsided. Ning Ning, haven't you picked up any Mafia intel yet?" Xiao Naibao touched his nose, his smile wry, "I'd give it a few more days." Ye Wei nodded thoughtfully. Xiao Naibao's lips curled into a sly smirk, his eyes shining with mischief, "Auntie, you’re anxious for news about your Brother-in-Law Big White, aren't you?" "I'm eager to act on his news," Ye Wei replied with seductive charm, toying with her luminescent cup as though Mo Jue and Big White were of no consequence to her. Cheng An Ya softly chuckled, "Wei Wei, don't play the tough girl. You can't outmatch him." A bitter pill. Having recently been on the receiving end of a thrashing, she likely desired to rip Mo Jue to shreds. But confronted with his superior strength, she had to admit, Mo Jue was a force to be reckoned with. Ye Wei arched an eyebrow, her smile blooming like a rose. She casually draped an arm around Shi Yi’s shoulder, "I've got an ace partner here. If one can't best him, two will seal his fate. If a duel falls through, we’ll turn to a brawl, right, Shi Yi?" Shi Yi, ever the embodiment of chill, simply nodded, "Mhm, affirmative, I’ll sync up with you next time." Cheng An Ya’s smile blossomed, pure and radiant. Her eyes twinkled playfully as she innocently inquired, "Wei Wei, don't you always carry a gun? Why bother with a brawl?" Xiao Naibao stifled a chuckle. Mommy, on point. His mommy always hit the nail on the head with a smile that could disarm anyone. Shi Yi couldn’t help but throw a sidelong glance at Ye Wei. An Ya was spot-on. Renowned for her sharpshooting prowess, Ye Wei could fire with either hand with uncanny agility. Even mid-fight, she could effortlessly draw her weapon. That day, Mo Jue was unarmed and unguarded; he was an easy mark for Ye Wei. Yet, she hadn’t drawn her gun. That day, she had seen Ye Wei’s hand poised over the gun handle, but it never emerged. That rapid motion, though swift as lightning, was transparent to her, thanks to years of unspoken understanding. Having been battered yet not drawing a gun to kill—what did that imply? The Ye Wei they knew would sooner dismember an opponent than suffer a blow. Yet, she had been beaten to a pulp by Mo Jue. Ye Wei remained unfazed, her allure intensifying, "Sister-in-law, you’re missing the point. I enjoy a good stretch—close-quarters combat reveals an adversary’s weak spots fastest. It’s all about tactics." Xiao Naibao held his tongue. Auntie, you’ve got guts, to endure such a beating and still talk tactics. Cheng An Ya nodded as if enlightened, "Exactly. When you went after Ah Chen, you should’ve engaged him up close instead of shooting from a distance. Right?" "Sister-in-law, you’re vicious. If Brother Three and I sparred, you wouldn't recognize his face afterward," Ye Wei retorted, her innocence feigned. Cheng An Ya laughed along, not pressing the matter further. Ye Wei lowered her gaze, gently swirling her luminescent cup. The wine rippled, and from the side, it seemed as if a brilliant light had pierced the liquid. Indeed, the pleasure of grape wine in a luminescent cup was one of life's great delights. So, Mo Jue and Big White could go jump in a lake. In the clear wine, a pair of serene eyes reflected. "Has Brother Three shown any sign of waking?" Ye Wei suddenly asked. She hadn't ventured into the lab in days, instead, spending her time recuperating and scarcely leaving her room. Cheng An Ya had also kept her distance. Ever since Su Meiren mentioned that women were a distraction, whether true or fictitious, she genuinely waited for news without disturbing the lab. But she knew—Ye Sanshao had not yet stirred. The virus was formidable. "Not yet," Cheng An Ya replied, her voice tinged with exhaustion. "Su Meiren said that until the antidote is ready, he has to continue like this, dependent on nutrition solutions, sedatives, and other reagents beyond my ken." "Brother Three’s life is a series of trials." Ye Wei felt a twinge of heartache. If asked about her most cherished person in the world, it wouldn't be Big White or Mo Jue, but Ye Sanshao. Cheng An Ya shared this sentiment. Everyone was aware that Ye Sanshao’s vitality was waning, day by day. The seven-day deadline had long passed, and he was clinging to life solely by virtue of these medications. Though she felt for him, she was powerless. Why was she unscathed, while Ye Sanshao was teetering on the brink of life and death? "Mommy, Auntie, I’m confident Daddy will pull through." Xiao Naibao smiled gracefully, "With Mommy and me still here, Daddy won't want to leave. Otherwise, if Mommy remarries with me in tow, he’d spring out of his coffin, ghost or not." Ye Wei and Cheng An Ya couldn’t help but chuckle. Even Shi Yi’s lips curled into a faint smile, in keeping with Ye Sanshao’s character. Initially, Cheng An Ya thought Shi Yi and Ye Wei might have tasks to attend to, suggesting they might leave Riyadh. But Ye Wei was adamant about staying. Despite the turmoil beyond, Riyadh remained a sanctuary of calm. Few were needed to stand guard, so they assumed the responsibility of safeguarding the Ye family. They had failed in their duty before, precipitating a chain of events. This time, neither Ye Wei nor Shi Yi would consider leaving, determined that history would not repeat on their watch. Shi Yi suddenly inquired, "An Ya, you mentioned Louis could touch you. Could his blood work as an antidote?" "Bai Ye pondered the same. If we could analyze his blood, it might accelerate our progress. But Louis has likely thought of that too. He’s vanished without a trace," Cheng An Ya stated, a shiver running down her spine at the mention of Louis. "Where could he have gone? It feels like the stillness before a tempest; surely something is about to unfold." "Mommy, don't worry. The past won't repeat itself, you can rest easy." Su Meiren’s mansion was few in number but impregnable. Even Mo Ye could only peer in from the outskirts, unable to breach, let alone others. The mansion stood as a stronghold—exit allowed, entry barred, utterly secure. "It’s hard to pin down my unease." "Sister-in-law, I’m curious about something. Why hasn’t the virus inside you activated yet?" Ye Wei posed the question, her eyes narrowing slightly. "Checking the calendar, there are only a few days left in the month-long deadline. Even if not fatal, the virus should have acted by now." "I’m at a loss." Cheng An Ya herself was perplexed. These days she felt fine, everything as usual. Su Meiren and Bai Ye were engrossed in saving Ye Sanshao, leaving her to her own devices for the time being. Once activated, she’d end up like Ye Sanshao, lying on an operating table, awaiting either death or awakening. "I’m just as bewildered." Xiao Naibao smiled, then playfully raised his finger, "Of course, Mommy, I don’t wish for an outbreak." "Sister-in-law, you must be a variant." Laughter filled the room. As they were joking, footsteps approached. Bai Ye and Su Meiren appeared; they had spent the past two days in the lab. Fatigue was etched on their faces. Upon their arrival, Cheng An Ya and the others immediately flocked to them. Su Meiren looked especially drained. Despite her weariness, her cheeks were flushed. Flames seemed to dance in her frosty eyes, making Ye Wei pinch her own arm in disbelief. Huh, no fantasy elements? Su Meiren can blush? What was going on? She felt she had missed out on some spicy drama. "Su Meiren, is the antidote ready?" "Bai Ye, how’s Ah Chen?" ...... "Tomorrow." Su Meiren replied succinctly. Bai Ye gestured and seated himself. After a sip of tea, he stated, "We’re down to the last component. Tomorrow will tell." Cheng An Ya felt the knot of anxiety in her chest unravel as hope was restored. A blush of relief spread across her pale face, her eyes nearly welling up. Even though she had maintained a facade of normalcy before Xiao Naibao, only she knew the sleepless nights spent worrying, her gaze locked on the lab’s direction. She had prayed to the heavens more than a hundred times, begging for his safety. "That’s fantastic." Xiao Naibao's face brightened, a visible weight lifted from his youthful shoulders. Su Meiren stroked his head, her demeanor softening, and her tone gentler, "Worried sick, weren't you?" Ye Wei grappled internally with envy. Indeed, children are favored. Su Meiren had never spoken to her with such tenderness. She begrudged Xiao Naibao, the newcomer, and Ye Wei was in turmoil. "Concerned." Xiao Naibao affirmed, glancing between Su Meiren and the stoic Bai Ye. He sensed something was amiss, "Su Meiren, Bai Ye, with such good news, why the long faces when you arrived? It was quite the scare." Something was off. Bai Ye opened his mouth to speak, but Su Meiren silenced him with a sharp look. Bai Ye raised his hand, smiling, and made a shushing gesture, continuing his tea. The crowd was puzzled, and Ye Wei's gaze darted between Bai Ye and Su Meiren. They had all overlooked the distinct handprint etched on Bai Ye’s face, Xiao Naibao included. The hall fell into an uneasy silence. Su Meiren snorted coldly, her brows like daggers, her chilling aura truly daunting. Bai Ye grinned, and everyone anticipated Su Meiren’s next move would be his end. Instead, he shot Bai Ye a cold look and departed. The onlookers exchanged puzzled glances at his retreating figure. What had happened? Xiao Naibao sprang into Bai Ye’s arms, his small hand pressing against the handprint, his dark eyes blinking, "Bai Ye, what’s with your face?" "A minor run-in with nature's finest." Bai Ye's smile remained poised as he set down his teacup and ruffled Xiao Naibao’s hair, leaving the child miffed. Why did everyone fancy patting his head? Ye Wei hummed dubiously, sizing up her fingers against the imprint. She sought confirmation pragmatically, "Bai Ye, your fingers don’t seem quite that slender, do they?" The consensus was unanimous as several pairs of eyes scrutinized Bai Ye’s face. They wore expressions that screamed, "Bai Ye, we demand the truth." With the knowledge that an antidote was imminent, Cheng An Ya’s anxiety lessened considerably, and she too became fixated on the distinct handprint etched on Bai Ye’s face. It was a hit that was forceful and precise. At a glance, it was evident that the hand behind it was elegant, slender, and delicate. "Cut the act. Su Meiren slapped you, didn’t she?" Ye Wei’s smile carried a dangerous edge, her demeanor conflicted and charged. "Why did he hit you?" "Bai Ye, what did you do?" "You didn’t overstep, did you?" ...... The inquisitiveness was resounding. Bai Ye put down his teacup with grace, "I’m exhausted. Time for rest." As everyone watched Bai Ye’s elegant departure, then considered Su Meiren’s cold and formidable allure, they sensed the scent of scandal in the air. Ye Wei clenched her fists in frustration, "Bai Ye, don’t say you’ve just turned... to the other side... aahhhhh......" Chapter 379: Pregnant Ye Wei's visage contorted with rage, almost as if she yearned to charge at Bai Ye and tear him apart like a piece of jerky. Her exquisite features twisted into a ghastly facade, reminiscent of a vengeful specter from a harrowing tale. Xiao Naibao could almost visualize the horrifying image of Ye Wei with her hair ominously swirling around her. 'Wei Wei, stay composed, don't lose it,' Cheng An Ya gently admonished, her smile tinged with an undeniable tease. It was clear to everyone that the usually poised Wei Wei was on the edge of an outburst. Shi Yi silently questioned the heavens; among the geniuses, Wei Wei reigned supreme, yet even she was tested by the current predicament. Thankfully, Bai Ye, who had yet to turn his head at the comment, maintained an exceptional level of calm. Xiao Naibao timidly raised his hand, 'Auntie, I have a question. What does 'bent' mean?' Cheng An Ya's smile briefly stiffened before she recovered her poise. Shi Yi, grounded in his internal world, was as unmovable as a mountain. Ye Wei turned back, tenderly patting Ning Ning's head, imparting a lesson, 'My dear, you're certainly not 'bent,' and that's all you need to understand.' Xiao Naibao cocked his head, his eyes brimming with innocence. Though he didn't grasp the full meaning of 'bent,' he deduced from the women's reactions that it was not a term of purity. 'Mommy always says there's no end to learning, right?' 'Ning Ning, sweetheart, not every teaching is to be taken at face value. Otherwise, the world wouldn't be so rife with villains,' Ye Wei explained with gravitas. Ah, her composure was waning. Shi Yi shook his head, perplexed, 'Has Mo Jue left no imprint on you? To still spar with Su Man...' This woman was veiling an enigma, becoming more inscrutable with each passing day. 'He's inconsequential. How does he compare to Su Meiren? The blow to my pride has been profound,' Ye Wei sought sympathy, her voice blending lament with plea. 'Your lack of empathy is too cruel.' 'Do you yearn for someone's sympathy?' Cheng An Ya clearly relished the unfolding spectacle, 'It's only natural for you to be incensed.' Indeed! Upon reflection, Ye Wei had pursued Su Man for so long without any reciprocation, yet Bai Ye's interactions with Su Man over just a few days had stirred insinuations of an intimate liaison. With this envy blatantly displayed before her, it was natural for her to feel aggrieved. While Su Meiren's reaction wasn't positive, there was a reaction – a vehement one at that. Would the King of Composure react so strongly to an ordinary person? Highly unlikely. 'Sister-in-law, Shi Yi, did Su Meiren's cheeks flush just now?' Ye Wei inquired, her twisted smile seeking confirmation. 'Possibly, yes.' Cheng An Ya's response was more diplomatic, while Shi Yi simply nodded in agreement, both directing their gaze at Ye Wei. Ye Wei blinked, her reaction not as expected by the others. Instead, she pondered, touching her chin, 'Why though?' 'Why what?' Ye Wei rolled her eyes, 'Bai Ye prefers women, and Su Man men, right? So, if there's any danger, Bai Ye should be the concerned one, right? If there's a hint of scandal, it should be Bai Ye who's irate, with Su Meiren remaining composed. Why then is Bai Ye the calm one, while Su Meiren loses his temper?' 'That is odd indeed.' Cheng An Ya considered it, finding the situation strange, 'Did Bai Ye flirt with Su Meiren? Why else would he receive a slap?' 'Not likely.' Ye Wei and Shi Yi denied in unison. Bai Ye wouldn't do such a thing; he wasn't interested in men. Despite Su Meiren's allure, Bai Ye was not one to be superficial. They had known each other for a substantial period, Bai Ye's temperament was well-known to them, and such behavior was out of character for him. Flirting with women was not in his nature, let alone with men. 'Then why did Bai Ye get slapped?' Cheng An Ya asked again, the trio sharing puzzled glances. 'One might expect a slap for making unwelcome advances.' Shi Yi speculated, 'But Bai Ye isn't that type of man, so that's not the reason.' 'Then the reason remains a mystery.' Miss Cheng also pondered, her head tilted in thought. 'Could Bai Ye have been so bold as to assault Su Meiren?' Ye Wei tossed out a shocking suggestion, leaving everyone thunderstruck. Bai Ye was not one to tease, so how could he possibly leap to such extremes without any prior indications? It was a matter of procedure. 'If Su Man were taken advantage of, surely it would be the other way around—Su Man overpowering Bai Ye and then sending him to his demise. And all that would end with just a slap?' Shi Yi's tone was icy as he dissected Su Meiren's complex personality. 'Besides, Ah Chen was also present in the lab.' Once again, the three women fell silent, Xiao Naibao timidly raised his hand, 'Aren't you forgetting someone else is here?' 'Why are you still here? When you overhear discussions of adult matters, you should leave immediately,' Cheng An Ya admonished, implying it was his fault for eavesdropping, not theirs. 'Agreed.' 'Concurred.' Xiao Naibao, '......' Ah, the complexity of women. Yet, Nuo Nuo remained the best. 'Ah, I can no longer hold back. Why has my rival turned out to be a man...' Ye Wei completely lost her composure, her figure heading towards the central courtyard. Her silhouette seemed to glide eerily, a chilling sight indeed. As dinner commenced, Cheng An Ya, Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and Xiao Naibao's gazes frequently drifted between Bai Ye and Su Meiren, their expressions etched with curiosity and confusion. Cheng An Ya, an aficionado of the BL genre, felt a surge of relief knowing there was hope for the antidote, now having the leisure to revel in the affairs of others. From her many years immersed in the BL world, Bai Ye and Su Meiren were undoubtedly a match. Su Meiren, resplendent in white, exuded a cool arrogance; Bai Ye, the epitome of grace and charm. Together, they were a vision of rare beauty, a sight for sore eyes—an ideal match of formidable personalities, and her favorite. The imprint of the slap on Bai Ye's face had faded after an afternoon, and he now calmly accepted everyone's attentive gazes as he dined. His unparalleled composure was on full display. Ye Wei inched closer to Su Meiren, her grin wide, 'Su Meiren, why did you slap our Bai Ye?' Everyone shuddered at the term 'our Bai Ye,' but Su Meiren, without lifting an eyelid, replied, 'No comment.' 'No comment, huh? Don't be such a miser with words,' Ye Wei tugged at Su Meiren's sleeve playfully, 'Did Bai Ye bully you? I'll help you get even, I know you can't beat him, but worry not, I can.' 'No need to trouble yourself.' Su Meiren dismissed her coldly. Indeed, he wasn't as skilled in combat as those from the special forces, but he had plenty of ways to take someone down without relying on physical strength. 'It's no trouble at all, I've been itching to give him a good thrashing for some time now, it's not a bother at all.' Ye Wei continued to smile warmly. Xiao Naibao, for the umpteenth time, silently questioned the heavens. There was no end to shamelessness, and ordinary folks certainly lacked such quick-witted adaptability. 'Then suit yourself.' Despite Ye Wei's words, she was dismissed by Su Meiren's four-word mantra, and even Ye Wei had to admit, he was too tight-lipped. There was no hope of coaxing any inside story from Bai Ye. 'You're too selfish, keeping the fun to yourself when sharing joy is far better,' Ye Wei protested unhappily. Shi Yi agreed. Cheng An Ya continued her meal, and Xiao Naibao kept out of the fray to avoid becoming collateral damage. 'Bai Ye, you are straight, aren't you?' Ye Wei blinked innocently, 'I remember last year's Miss World practically worshipping you. A Russian beauty, I even saw you two kissing. You must be straight, right?' Bai Ye paused, then raised an eyebrow, 'You really do pop up everywhere, so you saw that?' 'I knew that silhouette resembled you, it was indeed you.' Ye Wei clapped her hands, laughing, 'Since you're straight, I'm at ease. Don't set your sights on Su Meiren.' Bai Ye smiled without a word, while Su Meiren, unlike his midday outburst, seemed unfazed, casually telling Cheng An Ya, 'You should rest early, we need to draw blood samples tomorrow. Don't eat anything before entering the lab.' After that, he stood up and departed. Everyone glanced at his plate, which was left almost untouched. Cheng An Ya complied, asking Bai Ye, 'Is the last ingredient really my blood?' Bai Ye nodded, 'Exactly.' Cheng An Ya felt a wave of relief wash over her. Success or failure would be decided tomorrow. Bai Ye's assurance was something she had no doubt in. His tone was relaxed and confident; she could let go of half her worries. 'Sister-in-law's blood, I thought Louis's would be necessary.' Ye Wei mused, 'I miss my brother dearly; he needs to recover quickly.' 'There should be an eighty percent chance of success.' 'By the way, Bai Ye, why hasn't the virus affected sister-in-law? She seems almost like any other person, why is my brother's condition so severe?' Ye Wei asked, clearly puzzled. 'The first contagion of this virus is inherently more stable than the second, that's not surprising. Plus, there are still several days left in the one-month period. I've given her a relief agent that can delay the effects for another ten days, so the virus is under control, nothing to worry about.' Bai Ye explained with a gentle smile. 'That makes sense.' Cheng An Ya nodded, grateful for the absence of an outbreak. Shi Yi glanced at Bai Ye's empty plate, her eyebrows rising, 'If I'm not mistaken, you two haven't come out in two days. Why are you eating so much, and Su Meiren so little? Is it that you're upset, no appetite, or is he made of iron?' Ye Wei prodded Bai Ye's arm, 'What on earth did you do to him? It's rare to see Su Meiren resort to hitting someone.' Several pairs of eyes fixed on Bai Ye's face, and he simply smiled, 'No comment.' 'Ten, we haven't had a good workout in a while.' Ye Wei cracked her knuckles threateningly, and Shi Yi got the message—they could get a bit of exercise that night. A show of force might make him talk. Bai Ye raised his hands, he had a trump card, 'I still have to administer the detox to Ye Sanshao every day.' Everyone, '......' 'That's easy to handle. We'll break your legs, you can still detoxify in a wheelchair. We need your brain, not your legs.' 'Uncle, you're ruthless!' Xiao Naibao gave a thumbs up. Bai Ye ignored the comment as if it were a breeze. The maid served them abalone soup, a portion for each, and Daina said, 'This was gifted to the master by Princess Qi last time. It's exquisite. The master asked me to prepare it for everyone to try.' Ye Wei rested her chin on her hand and smiled, 'Daina, your flattery is improving by the day. Su Meiren would never instruct that, it must be your idea.' 'Wei Wei is indeed perceptive.' Daina laughed, her alluring eyes sparkling shyly from under the black veil. Though her full face was hidden, those eyes alone suggested Daina was a stunning beauty. Ye Wei laughed. Su Meiren had a taste for simplicity and didn't care for seafood; the abalone would've just been a feast for the rats in the mansion. Moreover, it was a gift from Princess Qi, certainly a treasure. 'This has a peculiar taste.' Cheng An Ya fanned her nose, her brow furrowed with discomfort. 'It's quite aromatic.' Xiao Naibao commented. Daina served each person a bowl, but as she placed one before Cheng An Ya, she suddenly felt nauseous. Not wanting to be rude in front of everyone, she tried to endure it. The smell, however, was too much, and unable to hold back, she covered her mouth and rushed from the dining room, retching... Daina and the rest were caught off guard, with Xiao Naibao and Ye Wei quickly abandoning their utensils to follow. Cheng An Ya, leaning against a column, vomited non-stop, leaving everyone in concern. 'Mommy, do you feel ill?' 'Sister-in-law, what's wrong?' ... Cheng An Ya couldn't stop heaving, and it took a while before she finally did, looking somewhat pale. Bai Ye's brow furrowed with concern. Once Cheng An Ya steadied herself, he insisted on checking her pulse. Cheng An Ya laughed it off, 'I'm fine, really, I might just be averse to the smell.' 'Let's have a look at your hand.' Bai Ye smiled warmly, and Cheng An Ya could only extend her hand. Bai Ye placed a thin paper and felt her pulse. After a moment, his eyebrows raised, and he regarded Cheng An Ya with a curious expression. Xiao Naibao was anxious, 'Bai Ye, what's wrong with my mommy? Is it the virus acting up?' 'It's not the virus.' Bai Ye mused, 'She's pregnant.' Chapter 380: To Keep the Child or Not? Pregnant? Cheng An Ya's eyes widened, her mind blank as if struck by lightning, leaving her at a loss. It felt as surreal as an alien invasion. Bai Ye was also somewhat taken aback, as if in disbelief, he checked her pulse several times before finally confirming the pregnancy. His gaze then settled on Cheng An Ya, as if pondering something. "Bai Ye, are you certain? Cheng An Ya is pregnant? They've jumped out of planes twice during their escape. If she were pregnant, the child would have likely been lost long ago. How could it possibly survive?" Ye Wei found the situation hard to believe; after all the intense action they had endured, it had to be a miracle, or... Shi Yi remained silent, while Little Bun, whose actual name is Xiao Naibao, stroked his chin, seriously contemplating this development. "It's a definitive sign of pregnancy; she's indeed with child," Bai Ye announced with finality, his gaze growing even more curious as he looked at Cheng An Ya, who was still reeling from the news, sitting dazedly as if the pregnancy had nothing to do with her. The group exchanged perplexed looks, momentarily unsure of what to say. Little Bun waved his hand in front of Cheng An Ya, snapping her back to reality. Her face turned pale, "This child..." Seeing her reaction, Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and the others couldn't help but wonder—could this child belong to Louis? If it were indeed Louis's, that would complicate things significantly. Louis had coveted her and had held her captive for many days. If he had taken liberties with her, it wouldn't be surprising. Judging by the timing, the pregnancy was recent, and the logical conclusion was unsettling. Cheng An Ya's expression was also puzzling, prompting Ye Wei and Shi Yi to suspect the worst. However, Little Bun quietly watched his mother. "It's less than two weeks old, about ten days," Bai Ye added, his expression becoming increasingly odd. "What?" Ye Wei gasped, her eyes suddenly mirroring the same oddness, her lips twitching, "Could Ye Sanshao have...?" Ye Wei was quick to piece together the timeline of Ye Sanshao's viral infection and their escape. The child was not Louis's; it had to be Ye Sanshao's. Recalling that Ye Sanshao had worn gloves throughout their journey to avoid physical contact, everyone assumed that their collision during the plane jump had led to the virus infection. But the truth seemed to be more astonishing. Ye Wei's expression prompted easy assumptions, and Cheng An Ya's face flushed with embarrassment. Ye Wei, your bluntness is uncalled for. Shi Yi found the situation shockingly amusing, quipping, "It seems the true nature of a man is undeniable." Ye Wei seamlessly added an old adage, "To die under a peony flower, even as a ghost, would be romantic. Ye Sanshao... he's truly bold. Filled with desire, what folly..." This idiom emphasizes the pursuit of love and beauty, even at the cost of life—a fitting description of Ye Sanshao's actions. "It's not what you're thinking." Cheng An Ya hastily waved her hands in denial, but her protest seemed to confirm their suspicions. As she spoke, all eyes turned to her, carrying a mix of insinuation and a look that said, 'Don't bother explaining, we understand.' So, Cheng An Ya composed herself. Alright, let them think what they will. Given Ye Sanshao's impression of rashness, she decided to remain silent rather than make things worse. How could this have happened? Cheng An Ya couldn't make sense of her feelings: a little joy, a bit of aimlessness, and a touch of fear. This was not the best time for a pregnancy. Back at the castle, she had been infected, and Ye Sanshao, carelessly, hadn't taken any preventive measures due to their need to escape. They hadn't thought much about it then, but now it seemed a life was at stake. It was a dire situation. Cheng An Ya was deeply conflicted. How could her 'hit rate' be so high? Twice, and both times, it was a success? If every encounter led to pregnancy, wouldn't she be setting a record? Cheng An Ya's thoughts were in disarray as she imagined a dozen children surrounding her, calling her 'mommy'. Cheng An Ya finally understood what it meant to be jolted awake. She swallowed hard; the thought was too frightening. Ye Wei, Shi Yi, Bai Ye, and the others were already stunned by the range of expressions on her face, enjoying a silent play filled with excitement. Little Bun timidly asked, "Mommy, what are you thinking about?" Cheng An Ya shook her head and quickly resumed her usual smiling expression, not even blinking, "Nothing." Unaware of her inner turmoil, they wouldn't dare tell others, lest she be made the butt of jokes for days. Perhaps she was the only pregnant woman in the world whose thoughts wandered this wildly upon learning of her pregnancy. But then again, their conception rate wasn't 100%. That day, Ye Sanshao had exerted himself for nearly a day and a night, and they had lost count of the number of times... Cheng An Ya felt psychologically balanced. "Bai Ye, could the child have any issues?" Cheng An Ya pushed aside the clutter in her mind, her primary concern now being the child's health. Being pregnant in an unhealthy state and having been injected with various relief agents, it was highly likely that the child would be affected. If the child was born with disabilities or mental challenges, it would be better not to have them at all. Though it would be hard to let go, how could she bring an unhealthy child into the world? "Yeah, could the child be infected with the virus?" Ye Wei and Shi Yi asked in unison. Bai Ye pondered deeply, "The exact situation is still unclear, as the child is too small. We'll have to wait until the child grows larger to perform a thorough examination. The virus will definitely infect the child." The extent was the question. Cheng An Ya's pregnancy seemed to complicate the detoxification process. He would need to consult with Su Man. Cheng An Ya clenched her fists anxiously, her heart racing. This pregnancy felt different from when she had Ning Ning. There was less joy this time, and more panic. She feared she couldn't keep this child. Ye Wei, sensing her thoughts, said softly, "An Ya, don't worry too much. Tomorrow the virus will be resolved, and since the child is still small, maybe once your virus is cured, the child's will be too. And even if the child isn't healthy, it's okay to terminate. You and Ye Sanshao are still young; there will be plenty of opportunities to have children." Little Bun's tender face showed reluctance, "I want mommy to have a little brother or sister." "We all do, but they have to be healthy before we can have them," Ye Wei said, feeling a weight in her heart. It seemed the child's fate was uncertain. Without an examination, they knew it would be unlikely to keep the child. Cheng An Ya also realized this, her face losing its luster, and her dark eyes dimming without a trace of light, crossed by a touch of pain, Was it really necessary to terminate? She didn't want to think too pessimistically; she hoped to keep the child. The fruit of love, she couldn't bear to lose it. "An Ya, don't be too anxious. Let's resolve the virus in your body first, and then we can address the child's situation. There's still hope," Bai Ye offered, his smile always distant yet so warm, comforting, especially in his white doctor's coat. Cheng An Ya nodded and smiled, "I know." Ye Wei turned her head, pondered for a moment, and asked, "Bai Ye, An Ya has always been in good condition without showing any additional symptoms. Could the virus have transferred to the child?" Cheng An Ya also considered this possibility. If her body had been healthy all along, could the virus really have moved to the child? If so, the child would surely be doomed. "There is that possibility." Bai Ye furrowed his brow, but Cheng An Ya's blood analysis showed the virus was still present, making it unlikely that it had fully transferred to the child. If it had transferred, the child definitely could not be kept. "I'll go consult with Su Man." With that, Bai Ye left the hall and headed to Su Man's room, his brow marked with grave concern. Cheng An Ya felt an ominous premonition, as if this little life she had not yet known for long might be fated to part, ending up as nothing more than a fleeting joy. Her heart ached as if pricked by needles. "Mommy, don't worry. After Bai Ye and Su Man discuss it, they will check you thoroughly, and then you'll know," Little Bun reassured her with a smile. He didn't like seeing mommy with a troubled face. "Right, An Ya, don't worry too much. Perhaps we're worrying over nothing," Ye Wei said with a smile. Cheng An Ya smiled back, "Don't worry, it's fine. I was just wondering whether it's a boy or a girl." Little Bun quickly raised his hand, "I prefer a little sister." Little sisters were the cutest. He could be her protector, a good big brother. "Why not a little brother?" "A little brother is fine too, but I still prefer a little sister," Little Bun replied, his excitement barely contained, "If the little sister is fine, she will be born soon." "Ning Ning, darling, I bet you it's going to be a little brother." "I bet on a little sister." "Then you're bound to lose. According to the Ye family tradition, it's yang over yin," Ye Wei said earnestly. Cheng An Ya, "... It seems so." "I just want a little sister."  Chapter 381: Beauty Under the Moon Cheng An Ya returned to her room, her mind unsettled. A mother's instinct whispered that her unborn child, Xiao Naibao, was growing strong within her, a bond of heart to heart forming. Surrounded by others earlier, she merely felt astonished. Now, standing alone on the balcony under the moon's soft luminescence, her emotions surged with a profound maternal instinct, more intense than when she first learned of Ning Ning's existence. Ning Ning had been her pillar in a foreign land; this new life, however, was a testament to the love she shared with Ye Sanshao, perhaps even more momentous. The moon over Riyadh cast a gentle, clarifying light, wrapping the bustling city as if in a mother's tender embrace. Cheng An Ya found herself praying for Xiao Naibao's survival, wishing for the heavens to grant them a chance at life. She was not one to believe in fate, yet in this moment, Cheng An Ya couldn't help but hope—if prayers held any power, she would willingly become a devout supplicant. "Mommy." Ning Ning's soft voice broke the silence as he appeared on the balcony, his smile warm and comforting. His face had lost its babyish roundness, looking more mature. As his mother, Cheng An Ya's heart ached with a fierce protectiveness, yearning for the days of his cherubic innocence. "Why are you still awake?" Cheng An Ya moved aside, wary of her own impulsive desire to embrace him. Ning Ning's lips turned downward in a silent protest. "Mommy, don't be so cautious." "I'm a walking contagion; keep your distance," Cheng An Ya dismissed the protest. "What's wrong? Can't sleep?" "A little. Mommy, will I really get a sister?" Ning Ning's eyes shone expectantly, the word 'sister' seemingly written in a bright pink hue within his gaze. Cheng An Ya hesitated, torn between the harsh reality and not wanting to dash his hopes. After a brief pause, she chose honesty. "It's uncertain for now. Don't get your hopes up too high. Whether it's a sister or brother, with daddy and mommy here, anything is possible." Ning Ning's laughter rang out, a light-hearted sound in the quiet night. "Mommy, you're funny. I don't want a brother—I want a sister." The adage came to mind: Love and bread will come in due time. "Alright then, a sister," Cheng An Ya conceded with a smile, sharing in Ning Ning's longing for the child's safety. She imagined Ye Sanshao's surprise upon waking, likely quipping about the disruption to their couple's world. Cheng An Ya couldn't help but be perplexed by her own thoughts. "Mommy, you seem to favor boys over girls." "That's absurd," she protested. She loved the idea of a daughter, to dote on and dress in beautiful clothes. "I like daughters just as much." "Then why do you keep mentioning a brother?" Ning Ning scrutinized her, pointing out she had never once spoken of wanting a daughter. Cheng An Ya defended herself, blaming it on the Ye family tradition favoring sons—a tradition Ning Ning himself was proof of. "Then keep having babies until a daughter comes," Ning Ning suggested earnestly, causing Cheng An Ya's expression to darken at the absurd suggestion. Ning Ning's eyes squinted with glee, his mood visibly uplifted. Cheng An Ya's worries for Xiao Naibao were momentarily forgotten. "Haven't you thought that mommy might not be able to keep this baby?" "With Bai Ye and Su Man on our side, there won't be any issues," Ning Ning said with a confident smile, his voice betraying a hint of bloodlust. Only in front of Cheng An Ya did he allow his ferocity to show. "Louis..." Cheng An Ya looked up at the moon, "Hasn't he disappeared without a trace?" "I'm on it. Once I level up my skills, I won't need to fear Mo Ye and Mo Jue," Ning Ning stated, his determination to surpass their technical expertise clear in his tone. He wouldn't let the matter rest. "You could leave Riyadh now," Cheng An Ya suggested, reassuring him that Black Hawk and the others could take care of things. "How could I? I won't be at peace until you're safe," Ning Ning replied with a smile. "In my heart, daddy and mommy always come first. How could I prioritize revenge over your well-being? That's out of the question." "Alright, stop trying to make mommy feel better. When you get a wife, you'll forget about your mom. I'll focus on your sister," Cheng An Ya quipped. To her surprise, Ning Ning agreed, "A daughter will forget her mom once she has a husband, too. Mommy, you're the same. How can you teach your daughter if you're setting a bad example?" Cheng An Ya was left speechless, only managing to say after a while, "That's why, in this world, parents are the most tragic figures." "..." "Mommy, I still love you the most," Ning Ning said earnestly. Cheng An Ya's heart clenched; she knew the depth of her son's love for her, for his most beloved was now gone. "I know," Cheng An Ya smiled. "You're quite the charmer tonight, aren't you?" "I'm just happy because you're pregnant," Ning Ning replied, his happiness evident. "I hope your dad wakes up tomorrow. I'm looking forward to his reaction." "Dad will probably say, 'Damn, just when I hadn't had enough of us two, another light bulb comes along,'" Ning Ning mimicked Ye Sanshao so vividly that Cheng An Ya doubled over with laughter on the balcony. "My dear, you've got it down to an art." ... Su Man's estate was reminiscent of an aristocratic dwelling from bygone days, a blend of modern design and classical grandeur. His secluded garden, resembling a small courtyard, foretold an ancient charm. The house's facade exuded wealth and antiquity, with marble for walls and glazed tiles for the roof, with white jade lotus lanterns hanging beneath the eaves, creating an air of elegance. The garden showcased a collection of exotic flora. Bai Ye, struck by the sight of a purple-blue flower, an unknown species to him, was engulfed in the sweet fragrances that filled the air. "What flower is this?" Bai Ye's curiosity piqued as he knelt before the unfamiliar bloom, resembling a rose yet clearly not one—a purple-blue rose, a sight unseen to him. He reached out tentatively, only to be halted by Su Man's chilling voice carried by the night breeze, "If you value your life, you'd best not touch it." His tone was akin to an icy spring in winter, chilling those caught in its cold embrace. Bai Ye withdrew his hand, pondering the eccentricity of planting a garden with such deadly botanicals. "What brings you here?" Su Man inquired coldly, his figure statuesque in the moonlight, distant and ethereal, like a deity descended upon earth. Even men might find themselves momentarily captivated by his beauty. Beauty under the moon, an elegance without equal. Bai Ye suspected that Su Man's frosty demeanor was reserved for him alone. Their rapport had warmed over the past few days, only to cool once more—unexpectedly so. With a polite smile, Bai Ye approached the matter at hand, "I've come to discuss something with you—Cheng An Ya is pregnant." Chapter 382: Xiao Bai and the Scheming Mind Su Man was taken aback, having not expected Cheng An Ya's pregnancy. His typically stoic expression was briefly replaced by one of concern, but as the shock subsided, a frosty glint appeared in his eyes. 'Aren't you the self-proclaimed genius doctor? Missed the diagnosis, did you? So much for your perfect record.' Bai Ye offered a warm, soothing smile, as if to melt the tension. 'Why the blame game? You didn't notice either.' It had been eight days since Bai Ye's last examination of Cheng An Ya. Back then, her pregnancy was in its nascent stages, barely two days old, and showing no obvious signs. Given that their attention had been wholly consumed by the virus, how could they have suspected pregnancy? Precision has its limits, especially in Su Man's lab, where the focus was on virology, not the subtleties of pregnancy detection. Expecting a find like this in such a place would have been extraordinary indeed. The oversight had no bearing on his medical expertise. 'I'm not a physician,' Su Man responded coolly, deflecting responsibility. As a virologist, missing the signs of Cheng An Ya's pregnancy was understandable. However, for Bai Ye, lauded for his medical acumen, the oversight was a hard pill to swallow. Bai Ye kept his thoughts to himself, 'Su Meiren, a little grace would go a long way.' But 'grace' was not a term Su Man was familiar with. His lips pursed. 'The pregnancy doesn't change our approach to the virus. The detox must proceed as planned. Is there even any point to this discussion?' Bai Ye's headshake carried a mix of warmth and firmness. 'It's not that straightforward. An Ya's pregnancy introduces potential complications. The child she carries could be at risk of infection.' 'Abort it,' Su Man interjected, his voice unwaveringly pragmatic. 'We're dealing with a cellular virus capable of altering genetic makeup. If the fetus is already infected, who knows what kind of monstrosity might result?' A serious expression shadowed Bai Ye's features. He had contemplated this very scenario – a cellular virus is not an ordinary infection; it could fundamentally change human DNA. The possibility of the child being some sort of bio-engineered entity or mutant was a harrowing thought. That would be a tragedy of unimaginable proportions. Yet, the very idea of a new life brought a flicker of hope to everyone involved. To bring up termination now would be nothing short of cruel. 'And if the child is virus-free?' inquired Bai Ye. Su Man's scoff was cutting. 'You're asking that? For a supposed medical prodigy, you seem to lack basic knowledge. The child is developing amidst a pandemic. Do you really think it could remain unaffected?' 'Su Man, no diagnosis is absolute. There could be a chance, however remote.' Bai Ye remained composed, undeterred by the sarcasm. A shadow crossed Su Man's face, his eyes sharp with an unspoken threat. 'Refer to me as 'Su Meiren' one more time, and you'll regret it.' Bai Ye chose to remain silent. Su Man stood, his white garb almost luminous in the moonlight, his black hair secured with a silver clasp – an image of otherworldly elegance. Wasn't he celebrated as a beauty, just like Ye Wei and Xiao Naibao? Bai Ye saw no reason to avoid the term. Sensing Bai Ye's thoughts, the air around Su Man seemed to grow even colder, his presence intimidating. Bai Ye wisely refrained from further provocation. Though not a physical match for Su Man, the array of poisons at his disposal was formidable. One could only guess what toxins Su Man could unleash with a mere gesture. 'I came to discuss An Ya and the baby. Ning Ning is eager for this child. You wouldn't want to disappoint him, would you?' Bai Ye played his trump card, appealing to their collective fondness for Ning Ning. Despite his youth, Ning Ning had endeared himself to them all, not just with his charm, but with his genuine warmth – a sentiment that had spurred Bai Ye to go to great lengths to protect Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya. Su Man's hard exterior softened just a fraction. 'We'll have to wait until the fetus is more developed to make a definitive assessment. If it's infected, it's likely not viable. The virus's inherent instability could lead to mutations or other issues during the pregnancy. However, if they're willing to take the risk, I won't stand in their way.' Gambling on the slim hope that the child might emerge with superhuman abilities, perhaps even surpassing Ning Ning, was a long shot. Even adults struggled to assimilate the virus into their cells; the odds for an unborn child were even slimmer. Bai Ye grew quiet, fully grasping the weight of Su Man's words. 'Would the antidote work if the fetus is infected?' Bai Ye asked. 'The likelihood is slim. This is not a typical case of infection; this is a natural-born carrier. Antidotes are ineffective against such.' Su Man spoke with a bleak resignation, as if discussing someone born to a life of poison, for whom antidotes offer no solace. Bai Ye felt a surge of concern. 'So there's no cure?' Bai Ye challenged, his casual smile masking the storm brewing within. 'And here I was, thinking I was the only one with an overstated reputation. We each have our specialties, and this is certainly not one of mine.' Su Man's eyes held a fierce, silent challenge, though he chose not to respond directly. 'We'll pick this up tomorrow.' Su Man stood, his figure blending with the moonlight, his aloofness clear. Bai Ye remained still, watching Su Man with an unwavering smile. Su Man's sneer cut through the air. 'Anything else?' 'Are you still angry? Surely, you're not so petty.' Bai Ye's voice was light, but it carried a strength to match Su Man's. 'It was an accident, and you've already retaliated. That should settle it.' He knew Su Man's pride was wounded. Bai Ye was known for his restraint; he seldom showed anger or indifference, instead maintaining a smile, a demeanor as polished and refined as jade – his hallmark. Yet beneath that poised exterior lay a fierce pride and determination, traits skillfully veiled by his outward tranquility, creating the illusion of a consummate gentleman. Su Man, on the other hand, made no effort to disguise his nature. Aristocratic and haughty, his self-restraint was sheathed in ice. 'Enough. Leave,' Su Man said coldly, his impatience clear. Bai Ye's laughter was light, his demeanor unflustered. He raised an eyebrow, a playful challenge in his voice, 'Could it be that you're actually offended?' Su Man's gaze was icy, the sharpness in his eyes enough to cut through steel. Bai Ye met his look with a gentle smile, the frostiness seemingly melting away. Su Man's features grew colder, while Bai Ye chose silence over words. The memory of their earlier mishap in the laboratory surfaced unbidden in both their minds. They had spent nearly eight days in each other's company, diligently working on the antidote for the virus. Bai Ye's assistance had lightened Su Man's burden considerably. His expertise in detoxification was undeniable, yet in certain respects, he found himself outmatched by Bai Ye. Each had their own areas of specialization, and they had managed to compensate for each other's shortfalls, collaborating effectively. At first, Su Man had not been particularly impressed with Bai Ye, sensing a competitive streak in him that he deemed presumptuous. Su Man had every reason to be confident to the point of arrogance, dismissing the title of 'genius doctor' attributed to Bai Ye. Over time, however, as they worked closely together, Su Man began to recognize Bai Ye's genuine talent. Their understanding of each other deepened, and a tacit camaraderie developed between them. Heroes often find kinship with one another, particularly when they are unparalleled geniuses in their respective domains. Familiarity tends to dissolve formalities. One day, the conversation veered towards the topic of homosexuality. For two adult men, one of whom was gay, such a discussion was inherently awkward. Su Man clearly preferred not to dwell on it, and Bai Ye, perceiving this, didn't pry. Unexpectedly, Su Man had an accident with a reagent vial. As Bai Ye moved to clean up the spill, his footing betrayed him... Such scenes are a staple in TV dramas: the male lead, through some unforeseen mishap, falls and ends up in a compromising position with the female lead, usually culminating in an accidental kiss. And thus, a romance is sparked. In movies and television, this trope has been played out to the point of cliché, leaving audiences numb, while actors relish the drama. It's a 'romantic encounter' scene in its purest form. But applied to Su Man and Bai Ye, it simply doesn't fit. Why? Because Bai Ye's agility is such that he could navigate an oil-slicked floor with ease. The idea of him stumbling was implausible; even if he did fall, he'd have righted himself before hitting the ground. But in the moment he realized he was toppling towards Su Man, Bai Ye was momentarily transfixed, And that split-second of distraction proved catastrophic. Su Man, unprepared, was indeed brought down by Bai Ye. The fall itself was inconsequential – an accident, after all. Su Man wouldn't have held a grudge over something so trivial. However, the essential element of this classic scenario was missing: the kiss. Without that, it wasn't a true 'romantic encounter' moment at all. It wasn't accidental, Bai Ye had kissed him intentionally. From tumbling to kissing, there was no hesitation, so convincing that it might have been mistaken for an accident. But Su Man was no fool. He knew the weight of Bai Ye's body all too well. He was rooted to the spot for a brief eternity before his hand connected with Bai Ye's cheek in a resounding slap. In that instant, Su Man was livid. He had clearly sensed a shift in Bai Ye's gaze mid-fall and knew something was amiss. He had tried to push him away but was too late. For the first time in his life, he felt violated. This was nothing like Ye Wei's flirtation and seduction. At least Wei Wei had never breached the sanctity of his lips. An unexpected kiss exchanged for a slap from Su Man didn't seem like a bad trade. Su Man's first kiss, Bai Ye's first time being struck – it was a first for both, a bizarre form of parity. Who would have guessed that Su Man, in a surge of indignation, would revert to treating him like a stranger once more? 'Are you courting death?' Su Man's voice was as sharp as a guillotine, his aura menacing. The recall of Bai Ye's momentary astonishment and hesitation at the contact only deepened his sense of affront. If Bai Ye was indeed flirting with danger, Su Man had no qualms about obliging him. They had just broached the subject of homosexuality, with Bai Ye wryly commenting that such relationships seldom endure, driven more by the thrill of novelty than lasting connection. The remark had irked Su Man. Yet, Bai Ye's observation was undeniably rooted in reality. Bai Ye was aware that his own preferences differed from Su Man's; he was unequivocally straight, attracted to women. So what did his kiss signify? A fleeting curiosity, a dalliance with temptation? Su Man, a man of unassailable integrity, was not ashamed of his orientation, but being kissed by another man had left him feeling as though his masculinity had been called into question. Considering Su Man's habitual pride and superiority, it was no wonder he was incensed. For the first time, Su Man found himself truly unsettled. Bai Ye's response was a raised brow, 'No, I rather enjoy living.' Su Man snorted coldly, his glare blazing with repressed fury, 'Leave now, or prepare to face the consequences.' He turned and walked away, leaving Bai Ye with the sight of his retreating, frost-tinged silhouette. Bai Ye remained where he was, his posture relaxed, his smile deepening. As a man celebrated for both his intellect and looks, he found himself genuinely puzzled. What had he done to be on the receiving end of such disfavor? Why he had kissed Su Man was a mystery even to Bai Ye. It had seemed an impulsive act, one he couldn't fully explain to himself. As he fell, the familiar scent of Su Man – a cool fragrance he had grown accustomed to over their days together – had enveloped him. For a man to carry a scent was often a source of embarrassment, but Su Man, who spent his days among flowers and plants, had become one with this cool aroma, as if it were a natural extension of himself, alluring in its subtlety. So close in proximity, perhaps it was the intoxicating scent or the allure of those lips that had clouded his judgment. Before Bai Ye could grasp the implications of his actions, their lips had met. To claim it was an accident would be disingenuous; he had been deliberate. Bai Ye cast a final glance over the resplendent garden, a sense of bewilderment settling over him. He couldn't fathom what had driven his actions, lost in thought as he exited Su Man's courtyard, oblivious to the piercing gaze that followed his departure. Hmph. Su Man's scoff echoed in the silence, a sound laden with the promise of retribution. The noble and exquisite man's lips curled in a faint smile, as though he had already seen his prey unwittingly ensnared. Chapter 383: The Poison is Neutralized The next day, within the sterile confines of the research lab, Cheng An Ya watched intently as Bai Ye administered the antidote to Ye Sanshao. The transparent liquid flowed through him like an icy spring, chilling her heart and limbs, her palms slick with cold sweat from the tension. She watched the operating table anxiously for any sign of Ye Sanshao's reaction. This wasn't the first antidote that Su Man and Bai Ye had devised. Over the past few days, they had experimented with three different formulas, each initially tested on lab rats. The first two were fatal, and the third elicited no response. But now, the lab rat had shown a reaction. Su Man's analysis confirmed that within an hour, the bloodborne toxins had been completely neutralized. This meant they had, at last, a successful antidote—at least it was effective in the lab rat. As Cheng An Ya was pregnant and the antidote's human effects were unknown, Ye Sanshao was chosen for the first human trial. His time was running out. The injection was necessary. Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and the others were present, including Xiao Naibao. It was a pivotal day. If the antidote failed, they would need to find another solution, losing even more time. Ye Sanshao's time was running short. Xiao Naibao and Cheng An Ya understood this was their last chance. Everything rested on today's outcome. After the antidote was administered, everyone's gaze was fixed on the diagnostic screen, silently observing. The sedatives had been stopped, and now Ye Sanshao was only on an oxygen mask; all other treatments had been withdrawn. They held their breath for the antidote's effects. Bai Ye checked Ye Sanshao's pulse, his expression grave. The pulse was steady due to the sedative's recent cessation and showed no awakening signs. After half an hour, there was still no reaction. The screen didn't show any decrease in viral activity. Cheng An Ya, not fully understanding the analytical diagrams, only knew they depicted the virus consuming cells—an internal view of Ye Sanshao's body. Bai Ye had explained that the black areas represented virus-infected regions. The scans showed severe invasion in Ye Sanshao's liver, stomach, and spleen. His body was rife with the terrifying virus, all in a state of fluctuation and mutation. Post-antidote, red bubbles appeared on the screen, relentlessly attacking the blackened regions. Having observed the lab rat demonstration, they expected the black areas to fade and eventually vanish after ten minutes, signaling the virus's eradication. Yet after thirty minutes, there was no change in Ye Sanshao. The red bubbles continued their futile assault on the black areas, a stark battle between good and evil—goodness striving to eliminate evil but powerless to do so. With arms crossed, Bai Ye watched the screen, almost holding his breath. For the first time, his heart raced with anxiety. Could the antidote be wrong? His calculations had indicated a reaction within fifteen minutes. Why was there none? The lab rat had begun assimilating the virus within just ten minutes. Something was off. A fine sheen of sweat formed on Bai Ye's brow. At the computer, Su Man sat calmly, his eyes sharp as he focused on the screen. He appeared composed, as if the half-hour without reaction was expected. But beneath his calm exterior, Su Man's palms were sweating. He knew that if the antidote had no effect, Ye Sanshao would surely die. Even if he and Bai Ye worked around the clock to create another antidote, they wouldn't have results for at least three to five days. Cheng An Ya might be able to wait, but Ye Sanshao could not. Su Man's noble features were marked with grave concern. Without looking back, he knew the expressions of those standing behind him. Cheng An Ya and the rest refrained from disturbing Su Man and Bai Ye, worried about breaking their concentration. Ye Wei and Shi Yi pressed their lips together, waiting anxiously. Xiao Naibao stayed close to Cheng An Ya, fearing she might not withstand the tension. The suspense between life and death was excruciating. In such moments, many begin to lose hope. Xiao Naibao glanced at his father on the operating table, his eyes filled with pain. He had acknowledged his father for less than half a year. He couldn't bear the thought of losing him. Palm readers often say one is bound to lose a loved one within ten years—a saying that seemed true, as most people had indeed lost a beloved family member within that timeframe. He had already lost Nuo Nuo. So he had already experienced the loss of a loved one. Therefore, daddy, you must survive. If he were to pass away, his mother would likely become a shell, forever devoid of happiness. Daddy, please, you must hang in there. He had always had faith in Su Man and Bai Ye, but at this critical moment, he realized just how anxious he was. Cheng An Ya stood aside, leaning against the edge of a table, her gaze intense as she stared at the screen, afraid to miss any detail. She prayed desperately for the antidote to take effect quickly. 'Bai Ye, increase the dosage,' Su Man ordered in a deep voice. Bai Ye's brow furrowed, and without hesitation, he administered another dose of the antidote. The antidote was also a toxin. Without the virus in Ye Sanshao's system, just the antidote would be fatal within a minute. Thus, increasing the dosage was risky. A slight miscalculation could lead to death from the antidote itself. 'Bai Ye, what's happening? Why is there no reaction?' Ye Wei asked, her voice tinged with anxiety, 'Could it be ineffective?' 'Wait,' Bai Ye said firmly. The agonizing wait continued as time slipped away. They had been told he would awaken within an hour. If not, he would die. Yet as an hour neared its end, he showed no sign of awakening. Hope seemed to be slipping away, drop by drop. Suddenly, a clanging noise came from the operating table. Ye Sanshao's wrist moved, attempting to break free from the handcuffs but to no avail. He grew frantic, pulling and tugging with great strength. Everyone gasped in shock. Su Man quickly began to analyze Ye Sanshao's bodily function indicators on the computer. Ye Sanshao first grunted as if in extreme pain, his head shaking uncontrollably, his body straining against the restraints. Cheng An Ya and Ye Wei moved to intervene but were stopped by Bai Ye. Abruptly, Ye Sanshao let out a vehement roar, 'Ahh...' His eyes, sealed in darkness for ten days, snapped open with an intensity reflecting his inner chaos. The dark pupils were streaked with blood, a fearsome red, and his limbs began to thrash violently, his cries and shouts echoing those of a madman. The sight tore at Cheng An Ya's heart, 'Achen...' She covered her mouth tightly, her heart wrenching, unwilling to watch any longer, her gaze falling to the table, Yet his cries of madness still rang in her ears. Achen... 'Daddy...' 'Brother... what's wrong with you?' Ye Wei was panic-stricken, 'Su Man, what's happening to my brother?' 'The antidote is finally taking effect,' Su Man stated calmly. 'Normally, without the sedative, he would be in excruciating pain. Now with the antidote attacking the virus, the two reactions are clashing. This is expected.' 'Furthermore, we've increased the dosage, which means his pain will be even more intense,' Bai Ye added. 'Daddy won't be harmed, right?' 'A reaction means he's not going to die,' Su Man assured, his hands swiftly testing all of Ye Sanshao's indicators while instructing Bai Ye to inject several more agents. So detached, yet so decisive. Relief washed over everyone upon hearing the news. Cheng An Ya and the others, not versed in medical intricacies, couldn't understand the technicalities, only that Ye Sanshao's agony seemed to lessen. The harrowing screams, as if his very insides were being torn out, were nightmarish. Ye Sanshao's visage was terrifying, his features twisted in pain, his voice hoarse, limbs marked with wounds from the handcuffs and shackles, blood flowing freely, the flesh nearly embedded into his bones. Cheng An Ya's heart ached. 'Daddy, you'll be okay. Hold on,' Xiao Naibao clenched his fist, cheering for Ye Sanshao. 'He can't hear you,' Bai Ye said with a smile. In his current state, Ye Sanshao could feel nothing but pain and the vertigo of impending death. This lasted for about ten minutes. Finally, the antidote began to merge quickly with the black virus areas, progressively purging Ye Sanshao's body of the virus. Ye Wei and Shi Yi, familiar with various modern technologies, had never witnessed such a detailed process. They could see the antidote cleansing Ye Sanshao's body, the black virus weakening, then slowly disappearing. Simultaneously, Ye Sanshao's body broke out in sweat. His roars quieted, turning into pained groans. In the end, Bai Ye administered the serum, completing the final detoxification step. Ye Sanshao, utterly exhausted, succumbed to a deep sleep. Cheng An Ya rushed forward, but Bai Ye quickly intervened, 'An Ya, he's just been detoxified. Don't risk getting poisoned again. It's your turn now.' Cheng An Ya paused, 'Detoxified, really? Is he alright?' 'Yes, it was successful.' 'Fantastic!' Ye Wei and Shi Yi high-fived, the lab erupting in cheers, even a faint smile passing Su Man's lips. After such a harrowing detoxification, Xiao Naibao voiced his concern, 'Will mommy also suffer as daddy did?' 'No,' Bai Ye replied with a chuckle.  Chapter 384: The Child Under Siege by the Virus Cheng An Ya's detoxification unfolded as smoothly as a standard inoculation. After the administration of the antidote, a veil of drowsiness enveloped her, and she lay rested on a separate operating table. The internal scan disclosed a stark reality – the virus within Cheng An Ya had congregated menacingly around her womb. Bai Ye's suspicions were confirmed. Ye Wei had voiced that Cheng An Ya's symptoms were atypical for a viral affliction. Bai Ye reflected on their time at Louis's isolated island, where Cheng An Ya had displayed complete debilitation and sharp pains in her organs. These peculiar symptoms emerged at Prince William's fortress, suggesting the unborn child might be siphoning the virus, essentially marinating in a viral bath as it developed. Su Meiren had indicated as much, and without even glancing at the internal view, Bai Ye knew the child was surely tainted by infection. 'Is this child treating the virus as a nutritional supplement?' Ye Wei gasped, eyes widened in disbelief as she peered at the internal view, Xiao Naibao's expression clouded with worry. The sight they faced was unsettling. 'All signs point to yes,' Bai Ye intoned, a wave of trepidation washing over him. The child's conception occurred amidst Cheng An Ya's viral siege; it was possible the child was born a harbinger of the virus. The ramifications were daunting. Beyond the virus's impact on the child, if born, could any soul dare to touch him? Su Meiren's brows, normally a portrait of serenity, now knitted slightly – a rare display from the refined Su Meiren. The serious turn of events wasn't lost on Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and Xiao Naibao. While Ye Sanshao slept in oblivion and Cheng An Ya seemed at peace in her slumber, their hearts raced with acute concern. 'Su Meiren, what do you foresee?' Xiao Naibao inquired. With a gentle pat on his hand, Su Meiren offered a pale consolation, 'It's too early for conclusions. Infection is confirmed, but only time will tell the depth of its consequences. Your mother will not suffer.' The antidote was working its silent war against the viral invader, methodically purging it from Cheng An Ya's body. Unlike Ye Sanshao's harrowing pain, she merely rested, tranquility etched upon her features. 'Bai Ye, didn't the elder witch mention once that Black Hawk experimented with creating toxic beings? Could this child's predicament be akin?' Ye Wei's query sliced through the air, evoking memories buried deep. 'Toxic beings?' Su Meiren's eyebrow arched in intrigue. A nod from Bai Ye confirmed the dark past, 'Black Hawk once reared infants as bearers of death, their sustenance laced with lethal toxins from the onset of life. From a dozen, only three survived infancy. Their sustenance remained venomous throughout growth; out of those, two succumbed, leaving only one. This survivor was no ordinary child; he was a bearer of death, his very touch fatal. The gravest exposure meant certain death, while the slightest required immediate serum and months of recuperation. Even his breath was a wisp of death.' 'How barbaric,' Xiao Naibao muttered, his frown deepening at the thought. Fortunate was his Nuo Nuo, not subjected to such torment under Black Hawk's clutches. 'Truly barbaric. The elder witch confined the child, severing ties with Black Hawk over this atrocity. It's a tale from many years ago, almost forgotten until Wei Wei's mention. Such experiments bear scant success, with a heavy toll paid in lives for a single survivor. Moreover, a toxic being's diet must always contain toxins, or the absence of poison would prove more fatal than its presence,' Bai Ye recounted somberly, a tale of horror they'd only heard whispers of – whispers that were undoubtedly true. 'If the virus were to vanish, would the child then perish?' Shi Yi posed her enigmatic question, the complexity of the situation stretching the bounds of comprehension. 'I've heard of such phenomena, but the child's case differs,' Su Meiren replied with his characteristic calm, 'If the child withstands growth, it signifies a virus-cell integration within. Though formless still, growth persists. Viruses are not akin to poisons. Innate carriers may even master the virus. Should the virus's absence be fatal, then fate deems the child never to belong to this world.' Su Meiren's voice was even, the virus in Cheng An Ya's body diminishing, expelled through perspiration. Bai Ye too administered a serum. Everyone else, barring Bai Ye, grappled with understanding, though the sense of an impending resolution to the viral menace offered a sliver of solace. Ye Wei escorted Cheng An Ya back to their quarters, Bai Ye did likewise with Ye Sanshao, entrusting the maids with their care, particularly for Ye Sanshao's grievous struggles. Su Meiren and Xiao Naibao lingered, the latter expressing his deep gratitude, 'Su Meiren, your efforts have been nothing short of Herculean.' 'It was but a trifle,' Su Meiren offered dismissively, his hand finding a perch on Xiao Naibao's shoulder, 'We're allies, after all. Formalities are unnecessary.' Xiao Naibao's lips curled into a smile, and Su Meiren guided him to sit upon the courtyard bench. Riyadh's overcast skies cast a chill, yet the expansive central courtyard, aided by the fountain's mist, felt pleasantly cool. 'When do you plan to depart?' Su Meiren queried. Their departure was inevitable; Dragon Gate, the premier terrorist organization, and the Mafia stood at the precipice of chaos, with victory's mantle yet undecided. As pivotal figures within their factions, they would need to strategize against the Mafia and the coalition of government troops, with the latter half of the year promising upheaval. 'I was about to ask you the very same. Will my mother encounter any more issues? With the child harboring the virus, is re-infection a possibility for her?' Xiao Naibao's thoughts were cautiously protective. 'That won't happen. They've developed antibodies; they are now immune to the same virus,' Su Meiren assured, 'I've considered this. Should complications arise, they're more likely to affect the child, not the adults. The direst contingency would involve terminating the pregnancy.' Xiao Naibao nodded, his mind partially at ease. 'My primary concern is for my mother. I must be wholly prepared this time; I refuse to let Louis triumph again.' Determination shaded Xiao Naibao's tone, the specter of finding Louis's lair loomed near. 'In the weight of power, the premier terrorist organization holds dominion, the Mafia follows, and Dragon Gate trails. The second seeks to dethrone the first, a feat impossible to achieve alone—support from the third is essential,' Su Meiren's lips curled in a knowing smile. Worldly machinations could not escape his keen gaze from within his secluded abode. Xiao Naibao's smile mirrored his understanding, 'He surely can't win over Dragon Gate, thus his sole path lies in absorption, to dominate all of North America. With the Mafia dividing power across the continent, even the terrorist organizations proceed with caution. Success in conquering North America would lead to a two-tigers-one-mountain scenario; any resistance by then would be futile. But that assumes he can indeed conquer North America.' 'Precisely,' Su Meiren uttered with a chuckle. Xiao Naibao's first journey here had been consumed by the viral crisis, leaving scant opportunity for deeper exchanges. As their time for departure drew near, Su Meiren felt a pang of reluctance. Yet, he was a man who let life flow as it may; partings, after all, were at destiny's whim. Moreover, their paths were bound to intersect in times to come. 'Riyadh is a haven of tranquility. Mo Jue has been gone for days, and despite Louis knowing my parents are here, he remains inactive. Strange, indeed,' Xiao Naibao mused. He had hoped to set a trap, vacating all of Dragon Gate and the premier terrorist organization's operatives from Riyadh, leaving only Ye Wei and Shi Yi. Yet, Louis's inaction remained a curious aberration. 'With the world at one's feet, beauty becomes but an afterthought,' Su Meiren's tone was light. Xiao Naibao considered the wisdom before Su Meiren inquired further, 'Those firearms from before haven't been completed yet, have they?' 'The high-speed magnetic wave gun? One has emerged from the forge,' Xiao Naibao admitted, his lips pursed slightly. 'Your design proved formidable to manufacture, yielding many failures and a solitary success. Yet, future production should prove more manageable.' 'I'm impressed; I had anticipated another month or two for completion. Your organization's reserve forces are indeed formidable.' 'Of course,' Xiao Naibao proclaimed with pride. 'Bai Ye was fortunate to be the first to trial the weapon. Its power is formidable indeed; capable of taking down a fighter jet even at high speeds. It's almost inconceivable.' 'The speed nears that of light itself,' Su Meiren noted, a smile touching his lips. This had been his labor of love for three years, resulting in a creation he was immensely proud of. Had it been brought to market, it would have commanded a lofty sum, yet Xiao Naibao had managed to swindle it away. Bai Ye, fortunate to be the inaugural tester, had reaped the benefits. Xiao Naibao chuckled, his large, dark eyes flickering with cunning, 'Su Meiren, you are a true siren,' Xiao Naibao said with a teasing lilt. 'Our Bai Ye is no unsellable stock; he's our bestseller,' Xiao Naibao retorted with a twinkle in his eye. 'In terms of quality, appearance, and functionality, he's unparalleled. Not to mention, he's a versatile asset.' Su Meiren's laughter echoed, a rare and unguarded display that spoke volumes of his current ease. Xiao Naibao felt a sense of completion, having witnessed such unguarded mirth. This jovial scene, observed from the vantage of a distant villa balcony by Ye Wei and Bai Ye, seemed to radiate scandal. Su Meiren's smile was indulgent, Xiao Naibao's demeanor far too intimate. An indignant Ye Wei remarked, 'Su Meiren is far too immoral, harboring an inappropriate infatuation with my Ning Ning. It's excessive.' 'You might be overthinking it. Are you sure it's not Ning Ning who's taking liberties with him?' Bai Ye quipped with a chuckle as he began to descend the stairs. Ye Wei, quick to follow, playfully probed, 'Bai Ye, do you harbor feelings for Su Meiren?' 'I have a preference for beauties,' Bai Ye replied. Ye Wei, '...Perhaps I should suggest Su Meiren consider a different kind of change.' 'Even a change of that nature wouldn't make him a beauty,' Bai Ye countered, distinguishing between beauty and a beautiful woman. 'Spare me the self-contradiction,' Ye Wei chided. 'Are you forsaking Su Meiren for the embrace of Mo Jue?' Bai Ye teased, comfortable with Ye Wei's closeness. He hadn't overlooked the intimacy, but neither he nor others like Chu Li had ever viewed Ye Wei and Shi Yi as women. Otherwise, their shared history spanning over a decade would have naturally engendered romantic entanglements. 'Nonsense,' Ye Wei scoffed, 'I still favor Su Meiren.' She deliberately avoided mentioning Mo Jue. Bai Ye issued a gentle reminder, 'Once Ye Sanshao and An Ya awaken, we'll likely depart Riyadh, and a fierce battle awaits. Be mentally prepared. I trust you won't let emotions cloud your judgment, but a word to the wise, lest you find yourself beyond salvation.' Bai Ye's concern was clear; Big White, at least, was predictably obedient. Mo Jue, by contrast, seemed a dangerous variable, one that could lead to dire outcomes. 'Your faith in me is that scant?' Ye Wei pinched his arm, feigning offense, 'Would I betray our cause?' 'It's not about trust; it's about concern,' Bai Ye clarified with a friendly smile, 'Mo Jue appears dangerous, and I doubt you're his equal.' 'I'm not his match?' Ye Wei's pride was slightly wounded. 'In matters of cunning, men often hold an edge,' Bai Ye observed, 'Consider An Ya—despite her intelligence, Ye Sanshao often outmaneuvers her in strategy.' 'That's discriminatory,' Ye Wei accused. 'I'm merely skeptical of you. Just be careful,' Bai Ye advised. 'Understood. I won't disappoint,' Ye Wei assured him with a mischievous grin. As they reached the central courtyard, she leaned in and planted a flirtatious kiss on Bai Ye's cheek, whispering, 'For your reward.' Bai Ye was bemused, his eyes catching Su Meiren and Xiao Naibao's attention. Su Meiren's expression remained stoic, his eyes now exuding a cold sharpness, the previously gentle smile vanishing in an instant, replaced by a chilly huff. Chapter 385: Caught in the Act Cheng An Ya woke to the deep silence of the night. Moonlight, unbidden, leapt through the balcony, casting silver shards across the floor. The room was bathed in the soft glow of a white jade lamp, a soothing light that didn't sting the eyes, but instead wrapped everything in a gentle embrace of warmth. The poison had been neutralized—this she knew with clarity. Bai Ye had administered the antidote, and in those moments, she had briefly entertained the thought of an eternal slumber, free from pain, as they say, a peaceful death. Now, she almost laughed at the notion, her mind surprisingly at peace. After all, she had the reassurance that Ye Sanshao was safe. The only regret, had death come, would have been for the child—two lives, not just one, would have been claimed. Such a thought was far from comforting. A smile graced her lips as she turned to find Ye Sanshao asleep by her side, the warmth from the bedding seeping deep into her bones. It was as if the very pores of her skin had opened to welcome the comfort, a feeling so blissful it was akin to rebirth. Perhaps it was the psychological release from the knowledge that they were no longer carriers of the lethal virus. No longer did she have to fear passing it to innocents or causing the death of those dear to her. Despite maintaining a facade of normalcy in recent days, the weight of their plight had pressed heavily upon Cheng An Ya. Since Zhang Bo's death, it had been as though a heavy stone lay upon her chest, suffocating her in the stillness of the night. It was a malady of the heart, one that had driven her towards isolation, fearing the harm she might bring to others. Now, with the heavy stone shattered, her spirit felt light for the first time. It was truly the comfort of being unburdened, similar to being granted a new lease on life. Next to her, Ye Sanshao's gentle breathing was a soothing melody. The terrifying image of his twisted visage during the detoxification had faded into the past. All that mattered now was his tranquil slumber, a testament to his safety. All their trials seemed worthwhile. Cheng An Ya often reflected on the adage that those who survive great misfortune are destined for ensuing blessings. They had weathered countless dangers—leaping from a plane over the desert, enduring days of entrapment, narrowly escaping death within a castle, and almost being blown to smithereens at sea. They had danced on the edge of life and death, not to mention the virus that had clung to them, yet here they were, unscathed. Could it be that their path forward would now be smooth sailing? One could only hope. Cheng An Ya was aware that Louis was still out there, the Mafia's movements were a mystery, and Dragon Gate had seen its fair share of turmoil recently. Someone was pulling the strings behind the scenes, aiming to unleash another wave of bloodshed and chaos. She didn't need to ask around; the pieces of information she gathered from Xiao Naibao's and Ye Wei's analysis were telling enough. After this round of detoxification, they would likely face even greater storms. She could only wish that Ye Sanshao, having tasted the full spectrum of life's bitterness, had reached the end of his tribulations. May his future be one of peace and smoothness. With a sigh, her hand reached out, gently tracing his eyebrows—thick, well-shaped, framing eyes shut tight with lashes that curled just so, casting delicate shadows beneath that were nothing short of beautiful. His nose, high and regal; his lips, a work of art. His features, chiseled as if by divine hand, were stunning to behold. Cheng An Ya was well aware of Ye Sanshao's extraordinary looks. Though he might not command the same awe as Su Man or Mo Jue, his was a rare beauty unlike any other. Her fingers slid across his lips, recalling their warmth. Cheng An Ya hesitated, then withdrew her hand, wondering what this man, so fond of himself, would think if he knew of her secret adoration. She seldom had the chance to study his face with such undivided attention. Memories of his domineering, angry, cunning, and at times pitiful expressions flitted across her mind, coaxing a smile onto her lips. Her laughter broke the silence. "Do I really look that funny to you?" A hoarse voice laced with displeasure sounded out. Cheng An Ya, startled, met the gaze of a pair of dark, irate eyes. Ye Sanshao's eyes, previously closed, now glared at her with indignation. A surge of relief washed over Cheng An Ya—he was awake, and all was well. But when had he woken? Her face flushed as she remembered her fingers caressing his features. "Were you awake before?" "Why the laughter?" Ye Sanshao's gaze darkened, his grip tightening on her hand, jarring the wound on his wrist. He winced, pulling on the other side too, knitting his brows in pain. "Stop, don't move," Cheng An Ya insisted, helping him to sit up. Luckily, he hadn't pulled too hard, and the bandage held the blood at bay. She was about to remove it to apply fresh medicine, but Ye Sanshao stopped her. "It's merely a scratch," he said, glancing at his wrists and then at his ankles, recalling fragmented images that allowed him to piece together the recent events. He faintly remembered his own madness, the clanging of metal echoing in his ears. At the time, the pain seemed trivial and was now barely a memory. "Even scratches need tending," Cheng An Ya replied, fetching the medicine. She unwrapped the gauze and carefully reapplied it to his wounds. It was only then that he truly noticed how ghastly the cuts on his wrist were. A flash of alarm crossed his mind, and he quickly looked to Cheng An Ya's wrist. She was safe, and a question burst forth from Ye Sanshao, "What about the poison in you? Is it gone?" Cheng An Ya nodded, recounting the events, but she left out the matter of their unborn child. She was unsure how to broach the subject with Ye Sanshao. Once the medicine was applied, she bandaged his wounds anew. "You haven't yet answered my question," Ye Sanshao pressed, nudging her with his head. To laugh in his face as he slept—she must be chastised. Cheng An Ya rolled her eyes, "Is it wrong to be happy? The poison is gone; it's a cause for celebration. Why shouldn't I laugh?" "Liar," Ye Sanshao grunted, leaning forward to plant a kiss on Cheng An Ya, "How long have I been asleep?" "Nine days," she replied. Nine days of tension for Cheng An Ya. Especially today, during the detox, and the sensation of hovering on the edge of despair, had been indelibly etched into her heart. The agonizing wait, more torturous than any other moment, would be forever unforgettable. Ye Sanshao looked at her, his eyes deepening, and he suddenly said, "It's been so long, you owe me a kiss. You should take a page from those princes who kiss their sleeping beauties awake." Puckering his lips, he leaned toward her expectantly. Cheng An Ya pushed him away, laughing and scolding, "In what way do you resemble a princess?" Ye Sanshao laughed too. The previously heavy atmosphere dissipated instantly, replaced by light-heartedness and joy. Cheng An Ya glanced to see him smiling softly, lips curved in a slight smile. She moved closer, and Ye Sanshao tilted his head, naturally capturing her lips with his. Cheng An Ya extended her tongue, delicately tracing the contours of his lips. Suddenly, she found herself enveloped in his embrace, Ye Sanshao taking the lead. He plunged into the kiss, deep and thorough, exploring every inch of tender flesh within her mouth, his tongue twirling, nibbling, and savoring. He relished the joy of rebirth, the excitement of regaining what he had once lost. Everyone who falls asleep does so with the awareness that they may never awaken again, holding in their hearts a mélange of emotions about parting. To be alive in such a moment—who would not be filled with joy? The treasure in his arms felt all the more precious. Cheng An Ya closed her eyes, savoring his kiss, surrounded by a familiar scent, a gentle breeze brushing her brows, filling the room with softness and affection. No amount of kissing seemed to satisfy. Ye Sanshao was insatiable. Just as he relented to allow her a breath, he was back again, dominant and devouring. His kisses, as imperious as his nature, were demanding and powerful. Moonlight bathed them in a soft, white glow, the beauty beside him like jade. Held in his arms, in the intimacy of their bed, it was only natural for them to gravitate closer. Cheng An Ya was lost in the intoxication of his kisses, only conscious of her earlobes being teased and sucked upon, the hot breath spiraling into her ear canal. This heat seemed to travel through the ear canal to her central nervous system, then plunge downwards. A restless heat awoke in her lower abdomen, embarrassingly intense. This sensation was somewhat unfamiliar, yet also known, a reminder of that day and night in the desert castle, where she had felt such heat countless times. Her fingertips seemed drained of strength, melting into a pool of spring water in his arms. Her cheeks were flushed like blooming roses, her eyes sultry as silk. Completely at his mercy. "An Ya..." His low, husky voice rose slowly, his breath scorching her delicate neck, painting her snowy skin with a blush of pink. Wet, hot kisses trailed lower, fingers clumsily undoing her clothing. When a wound was nudged, Ye Sanshao grunted, pausing briefly. Cheng An Ya, her mind clouded with desire, snapped to clarity, her gaze clearing as she stopped Ye Sanshao's head, "Ah Chen, stop, your hands and feet are still recovering." "It's nothing," Ye Sanshao dismissed her concern, indifferent to his own wounds. He was about to tear open Cheng An Ya's clothing when she quickly sat up, only to be held down by him, "Stay still." "Enough, we're not dead yet; there's no need to rush in the next day or two." Cheng An Ya mocked him. Both men and women, once they've tasted desire, find it hard to let go—especially someone like Ye Sanshao, emblematic of passion. But even passion must be tempered with reason. "What if you take the lead?" Ye Sanshao, undeterred, suggestively blinked, his eyes alight with eager anticipation, looking forward to Cheng An Ya taking the initiative. Her face flushed even brighter red. She pushed against his shoulder, signaling for him to back down, "I wouldn't know where to begin." "I can guide you." "..." Cheng An Ya's face grew hotter. Ye Sanshao leaned in and whispered in her ear, causing her nearly to kick him off the bed, her face burning with embarrassment, "You... pervert, forget it." Ye Sanshao suddenly leaned in, kissing her deeply. Cheng An Ya struggled briefly, then heard the clatter of cups and plates. They both turned to see two figures—one larger, one smaller—attempting a hasty retreat. Ye Wei and Xiao Naibao turned around slowly, Ye Wei taking in the sight of her sister-in-law with swollen, red lips and a face flushed with the bloom of spring, her eyes enchanting, and her brother, unsatisfied and fierce-eyed... It was the first time she truly understood the thrill of interrupting someone's private moment... Exhilarating. Xiao Naibao, the picture of propriety, waved cheerfully. Ye Wei chimed in, "Big brother, sister-in-law, your stamina is impressive, very impressive... Continue, continue, we'll come back later..." "Yeah, continue, continue..." Xiao Naibao parroted. Neither of them showed any sign of moving, instead holding a tray and innocently watching the scene unfold. Cheng An Ya, had she not been concerned about Ye Sanshao's injuries, might have kicked him off the bed by now. How embarrassing... Oh, to be struck down by lightning at this moment! This was the feeling of being caught in the act... "You two have no sense of decorum," Ye Sanshao snorted coldly, finally getting off Cheng An Ya. Fortunately, they hadn't progressed to the point of tearing off her clothes; otherwise, they would have been in for quite a show. Ye Wei remained silent. Big brother, you can't blame us for your eagerness. Who in their right mind would think of such things after lying down for so many days, with such severe injuries? It's your own fierce nature; you can't fault us. Originally, she and Ning Ning had carefully timed their visit. Neither had eaten all day, and Ye Wei had someone prepare a light, easily digestible meal to send over, out of consideration for her brother and sister-in-law's well-being, to save them the hassle of summoning someone. Who could have expected to walk in on such a scene? Xiao Naibao was equally taken aback. Though he clearly understood his father's prolonged hunger, he hadn't anticipated such ferocity. He even considered that if his father's hands and feet were incapacitated, he might let mommy take the lead, which was rather... corrupting to the pure hearts of minors, leaving Xiao Naibao somewhat conflicted. "Big brother, here, have some ice milk to cool down," Ye Wei offered, presenting the tray of drinks, porridge, and dishes with a mischievous smile, beckoning her brother to come and quench his fire. Indeed, a man left wanting can be a fearsome thing. Cheng An Ya overcame her embarrassment and thought little of it. With the Ye family, one needed a resilient heart, and such a minor incident wasn't enough to unsettle her. Thankfully, her clothes were not disheveled; otherwise, it would have been a true loss of face. "Mommy, I can finally hug my treasure." Ning Ning set down the tray, ignoring his father's jealous stare, and leaped into Cheng An Ya's arms, clinging to her without letting go, "Mommy..." "Such a good child." Cheng An Ya laughed, casually pinching Ning Ning's cheeks, planting a big kiss on his face, Ning Ning's smile radiating joy. "Mommy, you smell really nice, no wonder daddy always loves to nibble on you." Xiao Naibao rotated his head, and Cheng An Ya's embarrassment peaked, her hand coming down on the back of his head, "Are you looking for trouble?" "What a violent reaction." Xiao Naibao chuckled, pulling Cheng An Ya to the dining table, "Mommy, it's been a long time since you've tasted your baby's cooking, hasn't it? I prepared everything myself." Ye Sanshao had already begun to devour his meal voraciously. His hunger was profound, stemming from an emptiness beyond mere food—a deep-seated yearning for the closeness of his family after such a lengthy separation. Chapter 386: Parting Ways With the virus neutralized, it was time to discuss their departure from Riyadh. Bai Ye, Ye Wei, and Shi Yi had deliberated; they must return to Rome and escalate their efforts to swiftly resolve the grudge between Prince William and Chu Li. The primary objective was to tackle the Mafia. It seemed that Prince William was likely being manipulated by Louis to weaken the first terrorist organization and distract them. They couldn't afford a prolonged conflict with Prince William—it would be counterproductive. Bai Ye had been in touch with Chu Li, who would mobilize the first terrorist organization's global influence after finalizing matters in Rome. They intended to exploit international dynamics to force Prince William into submission. At such a pivotal moment, Bai Ye doubted William would choose mutual destruction over a quarrel with Chu Li. This was the most expedient solution. Ye Wei and Shi Yi also had their missions. They needed to locate the whereabouts of the Mo Brothers and Louis. "Daddy, Mommy, may I go with Bai Ye this time?" Xiao Naibao inquired. He and Ye Wei had sought out his parents for this very request. If it hadn't been for the recent events, Xiao Naibao would have already endeavored to join the first terrorist organization. Presented with an ideal opportunity to hone his abilities, he was keen not to miss out. He was determined to follow this path to the end and knew he had much to learn, away from the protective embrace of his parents. Above all, he was driven by the need to avenge Nuo Nuo. He couldn't let Louis or Grey Wolf off the hook. Ye Sanshao had no objections, subtly nodding to suggest that Xiao Naibao needed to convince his mother, Cheng An Ya. "Mommy, what do you think?" Xiao Naibao turned to Cheng An Ya. "I know you've just recovered, and it may seem premature to discuss this, but please, grant me this one indulgence, okay?" Cheng An Ya leaned back, gazing deeply at Xiao Naibao, momentarily speechless. Xiao Naibao met her gaze with silent determination. Cheng An Ya sighed internally. What point was there in stopping him now? The decision to let her son spread his wings had been made during her own flight. She recognized that she couldn't equip him with the skills he needed for growth; that was a task for others. "If you're set on this, I have no objections." Cheng An Ya eventually yielded. Ye Wei breathed a sigh of relief. Convincing Cheng An Ya might have once been challenging, but now it seemed straightforward. She mused whether to thank Louis for imparting such a profound lesson on Cheng An Ya. "Mommy, you're the best." Xiao Naibao embraced Cheng An Ya tightly, "Thank you, Mommy." Cheng An Ya kissed her cherished son, "Do what you feel is right. You've matured, and Mommy trusts your judgment." The ordeal had prompted growth in both of them. It was the moment for her to release her grip. A son is akin to a kite in the sky; a mother is the string that anchors him. Without slack, he'll never explore beyond his current horizon. Only by loosening the string can he ascend higher and farther. The distance he covers is immaterial, as long as he does not fall. Should he drift far, she can always reel him back in. Ye Sanshao observed the mother and son duo, his expression softening with contentment. Meeting Cheng An Ya, loving her, and having such an exceptional son were the greatest blessings of his life. These were boons he had cultivated over multiple lifetimes, and he treasured them. "Dad, Mom, what about you two?" Xiao Naibao asked, concern lacing his voice, "Are you returning to City A?" Ye Sanshao nodded, "I need to head back. I've been away for a month. Lin Da and Tang Si are anxious. We three must strategize our offensive against the Mafia. Louis's next move might be to take over North America, with Dragon Gate squarely in his crosshairs." Xiao Naibao nodded, his grip on Cheng An Ya's hand tightening. He ventured, "Mommy, why not remain here in Riyadh? Su Man's residence is a sanctuary, a fortress. With Su Man here, you're out of harm's way. Once everything settles, you could then return to City A. Wouldn't that be wise?" Cheng An Ya shook her head, "No, I want to go back with you. There's no room for negotiation." Xiao Naibao recognized his mother's firm stance. He glanced at Ye Sanshao, who responded with a comforting smile. "This time, she'll be under my watch every second. We won't let history repeat itself." Moreover, Dragon Gate's assassins would be on a 24-hour vigil, ready to defend them. They wouldn't repeat their previous oversight. Louis would find it daunting to even get close to City A now. "It's a sound plan," Ye Wei analyzed calmly. "Staying with Third Brother or here with Su Man doesn't change much. City A is currently a haven, while Riyadh might prove riskier. Even if they fear Su Man, if Third Sister-in-law were alone, Louis might take a desperate gamble." "Exactly," Xiao Naibao agreed, holding Cheng An Ya's hand firmly. "Mommy, I won't let you be frightened again." Before Cheng An Ya could express her thanks, Ye Sanshao's punch connected with Xiao Naibao, who clutched his throbbing head, glaring at Ye Sanshao with a sense of injustice. "Dad, are you trying to dumb me down?" "Those are my words. When did you start stealing my lines?" Ye Sanshao glared, narrowing his eyes, "You little rascal, my wife doesn't need your protection." Xiao Naibao pouted subtly, repeating his earlier sentiment. Mom is the Most Important of All, and being her Guardian Deity is his duty. Who let Dad be absent for all these years? It's hardly fair to cut in line now. He wisely kept these thoughts to himself. Cheng An Ya rolled her eyes and playfully mirrored Xiao Naibao's earlier punch, "Be quiet." Ye Wei couldn't help but laugh. "Rebellious, aren't we?" Ye Sanshao feigned a striking pose, but Cheng An Ya was unfazed, ignoring him as she spoke to Ye Wei, "Wei Wei, I entrust Ning Ning to you. Look after him well, please." "Third Sister-in-law, don't worry. He's clever and cunning; he'll stay out of trouble." Xiao Naibao smiled humbly. "Now that we've decided, I'll make arrangements for the plane," Ye Wei said. "Third Sister-in-law, if you feel any discomfort, inform Su Man right away. He assured us there won't be any danger for now." "I understand, no worries," Cheng An Ya responded. "An Ya is detoxified, isn't she?" Ye Sanshao's voice wavered, his heart racing, as he locked his intense gaze on Cheng An Ya, a flicker of alarm crossing his features. "Didn't Third Sister-in-law tell you? She's cleared the toxins, but the little one inside hasn't shown any signs yet." Ye Wei spoke before Cheng An Ya could intervene. Ye Sanshao was shell-shocked. Chapter 387: A Father-Son Conversation Ye Sanshao required almost ten minutes to digest the implications of Ye Wei's words. By the time he collected himself, Ye Wei and Ning Ning had already left, affording him and Cheng An Ya a moment alone. As he returned to the present, Cheng An Ya had already consumed her second cup of hot tea. Was he stupefied with happiness, or with anger? Cheng An Ya mused with curiosity. Although the child's arrival was unexpected and not part of their initial plans, it filled her with immense joy. And what about him? Considering his deep affection for Xiao Naibao, Cheng An Ya surmised he would also be delighted about the child. Nonetheless, the future father's reaction time was remarkably delayed. She nearly nudged him to elicit some reaction, his unchanging expression having lasted too long; while his face might not tire, she grew weary of it. "Pregnant?" "Yes, from that night in the desert." Cheng An Ya stated with composure. Suddenly, her wrist was seized tightly, pulling her into his warm embrace. His large hand pressed her back against his chest as he bent down, his lips claiming hers in a commanding kiss. His kiss was possessive, his tongue prying her lips apart, delving deep into her mouth, almost reaching her throat, caressing every tender spot within, insatiable in his tasting and plundering. Amidst the stormy embrace, she naturally responded in kind, lacking any resistance to him. Ye Sanshao pinned her hands behind her back, angling them to better suit his fervent, vigorous kisses. Although not their first kiss, Ye Sanshao had never been one for gentleness. This level of forcefulness was unprecedented, and she could taste the faint hint of blood from their pressing embrace. She sighed inwardly; he would never learn gentleness. As he kissed her relentlessly, robbing her of breath, Cheng An Ya slightly turned her head to escape his scorching kiss. Unappeased, he continued to kiss her cheek and earlobe, his breath hot on her neck, igniting a warmth within her belly that unsettled her. Her cheeks flushed with a light pink hue. Then, Ye Sanshao turned her face back to his and kissed her again, this time with considerably more tenderness. As her gaze swept across the room, the soft white light outlined the man whose eyebrows now seemed to harbor a softness like gentle water. In that moment, she felt an overwhelming tranquility, as if eternal. Content, she acknowledged they expressed joy differently, but she secretly admitted she liked Ye Sanshao's direct approach. Her heart brimmed with sweetness, clearly delighted about the child. If only they could keep it, how wonderful that would be, she thought. She couldn't help but wonder about Ye Sanshao's reaction seven years ago if he'd known about Xiao Naibao. Likely, he would have coldly commanded an abortion, the difference between emotional warmth and coldness was stark. "An Ya, I'm very happy," Ye Sanshao eventually spoke after a long pause, his chin resting atop her head, his voice a soft murmur. Cheng An Ya smiled, her heart echoing his happiness. In Xiao Naibao's room. During the day, Xiao Naibao closely monitored the situation with Ye Wei, Shi Yi, and others, strategizing with Chu Li. The rest of his time was spent absorbed in computer technology. He had to admit, he was not yet on par with the Mo brothers. When facing a barrier, advancing further is exceedingly challenging. Scoring a perfect 100 on a test leaves no room for improvement; the only difference is the perfection of execution. Sometimes, one must exert extra effort. Xiao Naibao was luckier than most; a prodigy, destined to surpass others, overcoming challenges with ease. Though not yet at Mo Ye and Mo Jue's level, he could discern the veracity of their information. With more time, he was sure he could outmatch the brothers and become the ultimate king in this domain. Ye Sanshao found him still at work upon arrival. "Daddy?" Xiao Naibao paused his work, glancing at the clock—it was past midnight. "Daddy, why aren't you asleep?" "What about you? You're also awake. What are you working on?" Ye Sanshao sat beside Xiao Naibao, quickly understanding the situation with a look at the computer screen, and gently ruffled his son's hair. "Don't push yourself too hard." "It's fine." Xiao Naibao smiled. "I'm sparring with the Mo brothers. I'm not tired; in fact, I'm invigorated. Daddy, I'll soon surpass them, and then taking down Louis will be easy." Plagued by insomnia, he was haunted by dreams of Xu Nuo, a fiery rose, her laughter unreachable. Awakening to desolate loneliness, he loathed this sensation and barely slept, relying on sedatives. This provided ample time to challenge the Mo brothers. Ye Sanshao smiled. "Daddy believes in you." "Why aren't you with Mommy?" "She's asleep," Ye Sanshao replied, glancing at his son who smiled knowingly. "Daddy, do you want to talk?" Otherwise, why would Daddy seek him out so late? "Be cautious in everything as you leave us this time, understand? Regarding Louis, I know you despise him, but don't let vengeance blind you, or else you'll lose direction," Ye Sanshao cautioned. He always harbored unease; Cheng An Ya felt their son's change, and he too perceived it. Despite Xiao Naibao's innocence and charm, his nature had altered. He worried that the boy's deep-seated hatred would ultimately injure himself. How profound his current hatred for Louis was and how intense his desire to kill matched the potential satisfaction upon achieving his goal and the subsequent confusion that would ensue. Obsession always has its consequences. Once his mission was complete, what would sustain him? Xu Nuo wouldn't return to life, and his heartache wouldn't heal. He feared his son might wander too far down the path of vengeance and suffer for it. This was a lesson from his life. "Daddy, I don't understand what you're saying." Xiao Naibao chuckled with mature grace, his youthful fingers rhythmically tapping the keyboard, his gaze drifting outside, away from Ye Sanshao's. How could he not understand? Yet, his inner turmoil was something no one else could comprehend. Without experiencing loss, one cannot fathom such heart-wrenching despair. Sometimes, he would stand on the balcony, staring at the Riyadh sky, pondering if destroying the Mafia would diminish the hatred in his heart. His heart had toughened. "Do you truly not understand?" Ye Sanshao questioned, his voice laden with concern. His son was too clever, too mature for his age. Their father-son relationship had always been akin to friends and family. He had never spoken so seriously with Xiao Naibao before, nor had he ever been angry with him. This son was impeccable. He wouldn't provoke anger, was obedient and affectionate, intelligent and charming. He had no faults to correct; his thoughts were more meticulous than anyone's, careful and understanding. Because of his extreme intelligence, his stubbornness was all the more alarming. Xiao Naibao remained silent; his young face had shed its childlike innocence, his profile enshrouded in darkness, lacking the gentle elegance of daylight or the sweet charm he showed Cheng An Ya. His presence was cold and intimidating, his thoughts swirling in his eyes like a fierce spirit lurking within. The room fell silent. The moon over Riyadh rarely appeared full, always missing a piece, its light casting a chill that penetrated the soul. "Xiao Naibao, have you grown so much that you no longer heed my words?" Ye Sanshao's voice contained a hint of repressed anger. His son's silence confirmed his suspicions. "Daddy, I'm aware of my boundaries." Xiao Naibao spoke softly, his voice carrying a heavy undertone. Too much malice was detrimental. He did intend to unleash his fury. What did it matter if he was merciless? But... "If you're punishing yourself, Xu Nuo's death becomes meaningless," Ye Sanshao spoke solemnly. "If it were your mommy, she wouldn't want me to become a man only capable of hate, without knowing love." Unfamiliar with love? Perhaps. They say that long-held hatred can make one forget how to love. Even Louis' death might not quench his thirst for vengeance. But after that, whom would he hate? For the first time, Xiao Naibao saw Ye Chen in a new light, his image towering in his heart. That hand on his shoulder felt immensely supportive. "Daddy, I understand." Ye Sanshao patted Xiao Naibao's shoulder, his words filled with earnest hope. "I truly hope you understand and swiftly emerge from the shadows." With that, he stood and left. Xiao Naibao watched Ye Sanshao's retreating figure vanish at the door, his thoughts a whirlwind. Since Xu Nuo's passing, this was the first time someone had conversed with him like this. His feelings were a mix of shock and anger, but that man was his father, and anger could not be sustained. Slightly shocked, it turned out his father had always seen right through him, comprehending his inner turmoil without a word. And somewhat moved, because he realized that no matter how old or smart a child is, in their parents' eyes, they remain transparent, with every emotion laid bare. Previously, he thought the absence of a father didn't matter; he could ensure Cheng An Ya's lifelong contentment. After getting to know Ye Chen, he had come to like this father. He had strived to unite them, seeking a complete family. In truth, for Xiao Naibao, a father meant having one more person to cherish and one more person to care for. At that moment, he didn't grasp the warmth filling his heart. It wasn't until years later, reflecting on the past, that he recognized the significant role a father plays in a son's life. Subconsciously, he heeded his father's words, avoiding a misguided path.
Chapter Four Hundred and Thirty-Seven: Striking an Iron Plate At that moment, with the Blue Silver Golden Light Array activated, the firelight dimmed instantly, being drawn and guided downward. However, the Fire Gourd was not so easily subdued. It forcefully sucked upwards, capturing a portion of the flames, and 'whooshed' to the side, escaping the Blue Silver Golden Light Array's confines. The events unfolded rapidly, almost too swift for the eyes to keep up. This one's tricky! We must subdue her swiftly, lest the Enforcers arrive. As the Fire Gourd spewed flames downward, the woman reappeared, her eyes filled with malice, 'What are you doing?' As she spoke, a circle of magnificent light patterns quietly emerged beneath her, freezing her body instantly. Tang Wulin’s Blue Silver Grass entwined upwards in response, Ye Xinglan's Stargod Sword pointing directly at the adversary's chest, while Xie Xie, having silently moved behind her, positioned his Light Dragon Dagger at her neck. Everything was a setup. What could be better than Xu Xiaoyan’s Starlight Chains when dealing with a single opponent? The absolute binding effect of the Starlight Chains is indeed a heaven-defying presence! Just as everyone relaxed, believing the opponent was subdued, a sudden change occurred! The Stargod Sword was already at the front, and the sharp edge of the Light Dragon Dagger at the neck, when threatened with death, the woman's eyes suddenly brightened. A sonorous phoenix cry emanated from her, and immediately after, an immensely strong soul force burst forth from within her. Triggered, fiery red glows appeared beneath her clothes at her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, and knees. An incredibly formidable soul force erupted from the woman. It was many times stronger than before, and as the soul force rose, it transformed into a massive fiery ring that surged outward. The Fire Gourd in the sky now displayed fine golden patterns, and the once foot-tall Fire Gourd grew to two feet, increasing several sizes in an instant. The powerful fire elemental fluctuation erupted, forcefully repelling Tang Wulin and his companions with a violent impact, the flames gnawing at their soul powers like relentless parasites. The phoenix cries intensified, and the woman exuded a majestic aura. Immediately after, pieces of dark red armor rapidly materialized, covering her entire body. A phoenix helmet covered her head, with the dark red armor extending elegantly to both sides and downward in an arc, accentuating her feminine form. At her shoulders, soft lines enveloped and covered her entire arms. The dark red armor, adorned with flame patterns and a golden-red phoenix emblem on the breastplate, wasn't particularly extravagant, but once it covered the woman, her presence soared. 'Dou Kai!' Tang Wulin exclaimed, his face also showing a bitter smile. Yes, this was Dou Kai! Judging from its complexity and the aura fluctuations, it was indeed Single-Word Dou Kai. The light rings seen on the woman’s body were containers for storing the Dou Kai. Single-Word Dou Kai could not yet be integrated into a Dou Kai Master’s body. Even so, this was a complete set of Single-Word Dou Kai! It meant that the woman, originally with a five-ring cultivation, now had her strength boosted instantly to the seven-ring Soul Saint level. Yan Feng was extremely incensed. She had been in an exceptionally good mood today, elated. Just before, she had gone to the towering Sky Spirit Douluo Tower to officially register as a Single-Word Dou Kai Master. Dou Kai Masters are top-tier existences that any organization would eagerly support. During the contract signing, the Soul Transmission Tower had agreed to a series of welfare policies for her. At only twenty-seven years old, she was one of the youngest Dou Kai Masters in Sky Spirit City, with a limitless future. The Soul Transmission Tower had promised to support her with ample resources to help her strive towards becoming a Two-Word Dou Kai Master. Once she became a Two-Word Dou Kai Master, she would have a significant standing on the entire continent. But who could have expected that right after leaving the Soul Transmission Tower in high spirits, she would be ambushed by this group of youngsters. Moreover, their capabilities were formidable. If she hadn't activated her Dou Kai, she might have been caught off guard earlier. She was unaware that Tang Wulin and his teammates bore no malice. The Stargod Sword and Light Dragon Dagger had made her feel the threat of death. At that moment, Wu Zhangkong’s voice sounded in the ears of Tang Wulin and his five teammates, 'If you can defeat her, you will have passed this city’s challenge.' Tang Wulin’s lips twitched slightly. Teacher Wu, oh Teacher Wu, you indeed have a sly side! This is a fully equipped Single-Word Dou Kai Master, equivalent to a seven-ring Soul Saint-level powerhouse. Can we really win against her? Before he had time to ponder further, Yan Feng had already made her move. Her mighty soul power surged in an instant, and with a point of her right hand toward Tang Wulin, the Fire Gourd overhead immediately projected a line of fire that reached him in the blink of an eye. At this juncture, there was no choice but to give it a try; explanations were undoubtedly futile. By her expression, one could tell that she was provoked. They were not justified in this! First, they had to deal with the matter. Tang Wulin took a deep breath, the three purple soul rings on his body suddenly vanished, and golden rings emerged. The rings bloomed, his right arm expanded, golden dragon scales spread out, and simultaneously, brilliant star lines converged on his right hand, revealing his Dou Kai gauntlet. Against a true Dou Kai Master, how could he not go all out? 'Dou Kai?' Yan Feng was startled to see the Dou Kai on Tang Wulin’s right hand. Impossible was the word that flashed through her mind! How old was he? And she had clearly seen that Tang Wulin’s Dou Kai had emerged directly from his body. Could it be Two-Word Dou Kai? Even though it was just a single piece, having Dou Kai at such a young age was unthinkable. When she obtained her first piece of Dou Kai, she was already twenty-one, and even that was considered prodigious. After years of arduous cultivation, she had finally become a true Single-Word Dou Kai Master. But how old were these youngsters in front of her? As Tang Wulin initiated his action, the others also quickly sprang into action. Xu Lizhi, who had retreated a good distance earlier, silently flew out enchanted buns – Agile Steamed Buns, Bloodthirsty Red Bean Buns – one for each person. Tang Wulin, with his left hand behind him, caught two buns, and without any hesitation, he stuffed them into his mouth. A swift battle was necessary. Even if it was just Single-Word Dou Kai, once the full set was assembled, it had the capability to help soul masters quickly recover soul power. They had no chance in a drawn-out battle with her. He stomped his left foot on the ground with a thunderous roar, and Tang Wulin shot up like a dart, his right arm shielding in front, his blood boiling and the aura of the Golden Dragon King surging forth. His eyes turned completely golden, and the blood qi fluctuations radiating from his body were intense. The Golden Dragon Claw was poised to contend with the opposing flames, pushing forward against them. As the team leader and an aggressive battle soul master, he could not afford to retreat at this moment. Only by holding the frontline could his comrades have a chance. Bolstered by the Bloodthirsty Red Bean Bun, his own soul power and blood qi force instantly exploded to their peak, and his entire skin displayed faint golden scales, particularly on his right hand, right arm, and right chest, where the scales were exceptionally brilliant. He possessed a twin martial soul? Yan Feng was taken aback. 'Hmph!' She didn't evade, and the Fire Gourd above her head began to spin, transforming the original line of fire into a swath of flames that swept past Tang Wulin’s head, enveloping his companions and blocking the others. She sought to isolate Tang Wulin, planning to deal with this apparent leader of the group first. As the Golden Dragon Claw reached her swiftly, Yan Feng’s right hand also rose, forming a fist to clash head-on. As they were about to collide, the dragon’s chant within Tang Wulin’s body suddenly intensified, and a massive golden dragon head, over two feet in diameter, appeared out of nowhere, directly engulfing Yan Feng’s right arm. Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens! The meal of Ruby Shrimp had not allowed Tang Wulin to break through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, but it had significantly enhanced his abilities, making him more adept at controlling Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens. Yan Feng was also shocked. She felt a forceful impact head-on, and as her fist was unleashed, the flames seemed to be devoured. The Golden Dragon Claw, like a large pincer, clamped onto her right hand. The Golden Dragon Claw exerted its strength, and Yan Feng’s entire Single-Word Dou Kai illuminated. All the flame patterns on it seemed to come alive, especially the Fire Phoenix on her chest, which truly moved and turned into a phoenix shadow charging directly at Tang Wulin’s chest. This was... Chapter Four Hundred and Thirty-Eight: Big Sister, I Think There's Been a Misunderstanding Yan Feng was poised, her Fire Gourd atop her head at the ready. Her soul rings ignited, propelling a tangible, golden-red fireball that hurtled towards Tang Wulin’s chest with ferocious intensity. This was the essence of Battle Armor—a flawless amalgamation of offensive and defensive capabilities in one Battle Armor suit! Tang Wulin could feel it—the formidable power of his Golden Dragon Claw dissipated as soon as it came into contact with the opponent's Battle Armor, its potential for destruction utterly neutralized. The counterattack was swift and punishing. Even with the enhancements from Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens and his gauntlet Battle Armor, Tang Wulin was, at best, on par with a Four-Ringed Soul Sect Leader. But here he stood against a true Single-Word Battle Armor Master! Summoning his Right Arm Power, he tried to leverage his formidable strength to toss the foe aside. At the same time, a Blue Silver Grass shot up from beneath, a last-ditch effort to change direction and evade the relentless Phoenix and its fiery orb. Yet, against all odds, both fiery assailants tracked his movements, mirroring his evasive maneuvers. Just then, an Ice Spear, a silent harbinger of death, impaled the Phoenix with unerring precision, triggering an immediate explosion that sent Tang Wulin flying backward. The disparity in soul power was painfully clear! Despite the support from the Bloodthirsty Red Bean Bun, Tang Wulin felt an internal agony, as if his very essence had been shattered by the blast. Sword threads interwove into a defensive net, halting the pursuing golden-red fireball which exploded, accompanied by a muffled cry from Ye Xinglan. In terms of tactics and combat skill, Tang Wulin’s team was on equal footing with Yan Feng. The real hurdle was the overwhelming gulf in soul power. With her Single-Word Battle Armor, Yan Feng was an impenetrable fortress, untouchable by Tang Wulin and his allies at this stage. Xie Xie appeared behind Yan Feng like a wraith, his Light Dragon Dagger and Shadow Dragon Dagger poised to strike. But her Battle Armor flashed, repelling the attack with a burst of fiery brilliance. How could they continue the fight when they couldn’t breach her defenses? Yan Feng was rapidly gaining control of the battlefield. Suddenly, a premonition of danger washed over her, as a resplendent four-colored light orb appeared, swirling with blue, red, yellow, and green halos. The fist-sized sphere barreled towards her. Without hesitation, Yan Feng's fourth soul ring lit up, the Fire Gourd expanded, and a barrage of golden-red fireballs erupted forth. Like a volley of sequential fire cannonballs, they blocked the light sphere's path. Explosions thundered, unleashing a vicious Elemental Storm that filled the air. Tang Wulin had regained his footing, the Mysterious Heaven Technique coursing through him to quell the internal inferno. Unscathed physically, the battle had nonetheless become unwinnable! All eyes were now on Gu Yue's next move. As expected, the defense of a Single-Word Battle Armor Master was unassailable. The Elemental Storm ravaged the skies for an enduring six seconds before it began to subside. Yan Feng stood unyielding, her stance unchanged. Her Battle Armor, ablaze with golden-red flames, showed no signs of dimming. The Fire Gourd was once again aimed at Tang Wulin. "Big Sister, I think this is all just a misunderstanding," Tang Wulin said, managing a strained smile. At that moment, a piercing alarm blared, and three figures closed in rapidly. These were Mech Armors, though unlike the ones encountered in Sky Spirit City, these were entirely yellow, devoid of any purple. "Cease!" commanded an Electronic Voice, demanding obedience. Yan Feng, ready to strike, was forced to halt. The Fire Gourd tilted skyward, poised like a deadly sentinel as she glared at Tang Wulin, her eyes seething with indignation. Then, she noticed the boy who had first engaged her now wore an expression of profound grief and outrage. Descending from above, the three Mech Armors, each a towering ten meters tall, separated the combatants. "Waah!" Xu Xiaoyan's tears erupted as she clung to Ye Xinglan, sobbing uncontrollably. Xie Xie's head drooped in a show of despair, while Ye Xinglan seemed lost in a daze. Xu Lizhi sat on the ground, and Gu Yue maintained a neutral expression, a flicker of mirth dancing in her eyes. Tang Wulin stood protectively, drawing Gu Yue close behind him, his face etched with feigned sorrow. "Enforcer, your timing is impeccable. Please, save us. Had you arrived a moment later, we would have been incinerated." "What?" Yan Feng was taken aback, disbelief etched on her face—it was they who had attacked first! The Electronic Voice from the Mech Armor inquired, "What exactly is transpiring here? Why have you engaged these youths, Single-Word Battle Armor Master?" Yan Feng, a recent registrant as a Single-Word Battle Armor Master at the Sky Spirit Douluo Tower, was not recognized by the Enforcers. When the words 'Single-Word Battle Armor Master' were uttered, there was an undeniable edge of wariness in their tone. With their trio of Yellow Mech Armors and their level of cultivation, they stood no chance against a Single-Word Battle Armor Master. "They are the true aggressors," Yan Feng countered with vehemence. Tang Wulin blinked his large, innocent eyes, feigning shock, "You... what are you implying? We attacked you? You're a Single-Word Battle Armor Master! We are merely humble soul masters. Uncle Enforcer, I am but fourteen, and the youngest of my companions is a mere thirteen. Would we truly dare to challenge a Single-Word Battle Armor Master?" Yan Feng, trembling with barely contained fury, countered, "You're slandering me! It was you who initiated the attack, at which time my status as a Single-Word Battle Armor Master was unknown. We are strangers to each other." Without missing a beat, Tang Wulin fired back, "If we are strangers, why would we attack you? I clearly heard you boasting about your recent ascension to Single-Word Battle Armor Master and looking for someone to test your strength. Then, you turned towards us and struck without warning, forcing us into defense. My mentor always emphasized, 'With great power comes great responsibility,' yet you, a Single-Word Battle Armor Master, chose to bully us children. How dare you invert the truth?" Xu Xiaoyan's wails grew louder, her body almost hanging off Ye Xinglan. Ye Xinglan turned her head away, unable to bear the charade. Xie Xie let out a long, heavy sigh—his time with Tang Wulin had indeed sharpened his dramatic flair. With each side ardently defending their stories, the Enforcers were left confounded, yet instinctively, they leaned towards Tang Wulin and his team. The advantage of youth was clear; it seemed improbable for them to have provoked a Single-Word Battle Armor Master without provocation. "All parties, accompany us to the Soul Transmission Tower. We shall review the Surveillance Video to determine the truth," declared the lead Enforcer, his voice laden with authority. "Absolutely!" Tang Wulin readily agreed. Yan Feng, her teeth gritted in frustration, spat out, "Wait until the evidence is laid bare, you little miscreant. Then we'll see who's truly Calling a Deer a Horse." She was seething with fury! The three Mech Armors pivoted, forming a triangular formation around Yan Feng, signaling their readiness to escort her. "Proceed. Please deactivate your Battle Armor first." This was a preventative measure against any unexpected escape attempts. Yan Feng's anger was palpable, "Are you blind to the truth? What will you do if I refuse to deactivate it?" In an instant, the Mech Armors glowed ominously, their Soul Guidance Cannons locking onto her. "Uncle Enforcer, do you see? She remains as imperious and overbearing as ever," Tang Wulin observed, inching backwards as if bracing for a potential backlash. Yan Feng’s wrath could not be contained any longer, "I'll burn you to ashes!" she roared, charging towards Tang Wulin. The Mech Armors were no mere decorations; their Soul Guidance Cannons fired without hesitation, and the storm of Soul Guidance Cannon Shells erupted with devastating force. Chapter Four Hundred and Thirty-Nine: Heart-Racing Handsomeness The Soul Transmission Pagoda's Enforcers, all rigorously trained, confronted the mighty Yan Feng with the most foolproof tactics. They launched a trio of Soul Guidance Cannon Shells, not directly at Yan Feng, but detonating them mid-air. The resulting collision unleashed a violent Elemental Storm. Despite her Battle Armor, Yan Feng was knocked off balance by the ferocious energy shockwave. The three Mech Armors surged forth, ascending and raining down a relentless barrage from their Soul Guidance Cannons, sparing no energy in their assault. Faced with a Single-Word Battle Armor Master, they couldn't afford any half-measures. Moreover, the leading Enforcer had already called for reinforcements. They just needed to stall for a short while. Tang Wulin and his team now recognized the true strength of these Enforcers. If they hadn't managed to split the Enforcers in Sky Spirit City, preventing their teamwork, they would've faced serious trouble. The trio of Mech Armors coordinated perfectly, their Soul Guidance Cannons firing furiously in a seamless, interlocking pattern, enveloping the area. Yan Feng, despite her strength, found herself hard-pressed. Her main combat power lay in her Fire Gourd Martial Soul, and her newly attained Single-Word Battle Armor hadn't fully synchronized with her soul power. For a moment, she was truly suppressed. Tang Wulin wouldn't miss such an opportunity. Leading his friends, he beat a hasty retreat, shouting, 'Everyone be careful not to get hit. Let's fall back further. Enforcer, keep it up!' Xie Xie disappeared like a wisp of smoke, sprinting to the nearby Soul-Guided Vehicle. The rest of the team quickly boarded, even Xu Lizhi showing unexpected agility. The Soul-Guided Vehicle's engine roared, speeding off instantly. At that moment, the Enforcer's entire focus was on Yan Feng, the clamor of Soul Guidance Cannons drowning out the vehicle's startup noise. They failed to notice Tang Wulin and his companions' escape. Likewise, Yan Feng, blinded by the energy barrage, didn't realize they were gone. Without Tang Wulin's instruction, Xie Xie zigzagged through alleys, pushing the vehicle to its limits. 'We really hit a snag this time. Could our luck be any worse? Aren't Battle Armor Masters supposed to be incredibly rare? How did we manage to pick one?' Xu Xiaoyan grumbled, her face devoid of tears. Tang Wulin smiled bitterly, 'We need a new plan. This method is too unpredictable, and we're making enemies. Not a good idea! If we keep this up, we might end up on the Soul Transmission Pagoda's blacklist.' Gu Yue said, 'That won't happen with me here.' Xie Xie praised, 'Boss, your acting skills are top-notch! That performance was stellar!' Tang Wulin replied irritably, 'You think I wanted that? That Battle Armor Master's strength is clear; a few Mech Armors wouldn't stand a chance against her. If we hadn't acted that way, being caught by the Soul Transmission Pagoda would have cost us precious time. We'll find a way to apologize later.' At the Sky Spirit Soul Transmission Pagoda. With a 'slap,' Yan Feng struck the metal table before her, sparks flying, 'Now you all realize, right? Those kids were nothing but frauds. It was them who attacked me first, wasn't it?' As the Enforcers reviewed the surveillance feed, they were rendered speechless. Yan Feng had barely broken free from the Mech Armors' siege when she noticed Tang Wulin's group had vanished. Fuming, she considered pursuit, but by then, the Enforcers' reinforcements had arrived—three Purple Mech Armors quickly surrounded her. Confronted by six Mech Armors, Yan Feng, as a Single-Word Battle Armor Master, had limited options. She could've broken out, but that would've confirmed her involvement in the day's events! Instead, she opted to surrender and was brought back to view the footage. 'We apologize, Miss Yan Feng. We've confirmed your identity. We regret our earlier actions; we never imagined these young ones could be so devious,' the Enforcers apologized. Yan Feng, boiling with rage, demanded, 'What are you waiting for? Bring them back now!' The leading middle-aged Enforcer hesitated, 'That's not possible. Though the Soul Transmission Pagoda holds a unique status, it's not part of the Federation's enforcement. If we dispatch forces to apprehend them, we risk overstepping our authority, which would harm us. We've notified the government; it's up to them now. Besides, our evidence is limited. Most importantly, you're uninjured. Even if we brought them back, there would be little we could do. At most, they could be charged with disturbing the peace and detained for a few days.' Yan Feng calmed down a bit. She wasn't injured, so pressing charges would be difficult. They seemed truthful about their ages, thirteen or fourteen, protected under the Minor Protection Law. Detention would be challenging; likely ending with a guardian's fine and a stern warning. Those little devils, utterly infuriating! 'Miss Yan Feng, please calm down. We apologize for this situation,' the Enforcers collectively said, bowing slightly to her. Yan Feng's anger subsided slightly at their gesture. She waved them off, 'Forget it. Just make sure I don't run into them again. I'm leaving if there's nothing else.' The Enforcers respectfully escorted her from the Soul Transmission Pagoda. As a Battle Armor Master affiliated with the Sky Spirit Soul Transmission Pagoda, they held her in high regard. She could well become their superior one day! Upon leaving the Soul Transmission Pagoda, Yan Feng scanned her surroundings, searching for Tang Wulin and his team, but they had disappeared without a trace. Then, her gaze fixed in one direction. There stood a young man, her age, tall and dressed in white. His attire was reminiscent of ancient times, a white robe draping his figure, long indigo-blue hair cascading down his back, exuding a cool aura. Yan Feng's martial soul was of the Fire attribute, which influenced her fiery temperament. Yet, upon seeing this man, the fire within her inexplicably cooled. He was incredibly handsome. She involuntarily swallowed. No girl could resist such a handsome man, especially one so well-proportioned and attractive. Moreover, at just a glance, Yan Feng was shocked to find she couldn't gauge his cultivation level. Yet, she was certain he was a soul master whose strength surpassed her own. Could he be an Ice-attribute soul master? As a Fire-attribute soul master, she was keenly aware of Ice attributes. Is he walking towards me? Yan Feng's heartbeat quickened. Initially unsure, she soon realized the man was indeed walking straight toward her. His pace was steady, though unhurried. His gaze met hers. Such clear eyes! So incredibly handsome! Yan Feng could see her reflection in his eyes, but she suddenly realized her appearance was less than ideal. Her clothes and hair were disheveled from the earlier scuffle. Slightly flustered, she attempted to straighten up. Despite her efforts to be discreet, her cheeks felt warm. 'Hello,' his voice was cool. Yan Feng's heart skipped a beat. His voice was pleasing, albeit cold, but it struck a chord. 'You, hello!' Yan Feng, facing the handsome figure mere steps away, found her voice quivering. 'My name is Wu Zhangkong.' The man in white nodded to her. 'Oh, I'm Yan Feng.' She blurted out her name instinctively. 'I deeply regret the trouble caused today. Those children are my students. They're undergoing a test—their academy's end-of-term exam. Hence, they've been seeking sparring partners, with no malicious intent. I apologize on their behalf.' Wu Zhangkong bowed slightly to Yan Feng. 'Oh, it's alright,' Yan Feng replied, her heart racing. But then, her pulse abruptly paused, her pupils dilated, and her voice rose an octave, 'What did you say? Those kids, they're... your students?' 'Yes,' Wu Zhangkong affirmed. Yan Feng's breathing quickened, 'So their unprovoked attack on me was at your instruction?' Wu Zhangkong remained impassive, 'That was not my directive, but as their teacher, I am willing to accept responsibility. You may hold me accountable.' 'You...' Yan Feng suddenly found herself at a loss for words, her anger dissipating. Wu Zhangkong nodded at her once more, 'I apologize again, goodbye.' Turning, he began to walk away. 'Hey!' Yan Feng called out. Wu Zhangkong stopped and looked back, 'Is there something else?' Yan Feng protested, 'Is an apology all there is? We're just going to leave it at that?' Wu Zhangkong asked, 'What more would you have me do?' Chapter Four Hundred and Forty: Invite Me for a Meal Yan Feng stated, 'An apology should be sincere, shouldn't it? At the very least, you ought to treat me to a meal.' As she voiced this sentiment, she blushed on her own behalf. Yet, having dedicated herself to cultivation well into her twenties without ever having had a boyfriend, Yan Feng now unexpectedly encountered an instance that made her question her disbelief in love at first sight. The man before her, exuding an aura of cool detachment, had captured her fancy with his striking appearance. His handsomeness alone was utterly captivating! 'Agreed.' Wu Zhangkong gave a nod, 'What would you like to dine on?' Yan Feng responded eagerly. 'Your choice.' Contemplation flickered in Wu Zhangkong's eyes before he finally said, 'Come with me.' He began descending the staircase, his back to her. Such an impressive figure he cut, Yan Feng thought, her heart fluttering as she hurried after him. The annoyance she had felt towards the younger students earlier seemed to fade in light of her newfound admiration for their dashing instructor. She had decided to forgive them – such is the whimsy of fate! Wu Zhangkong walked with an unhurried grace, Yan Feng following quietly in his wake. She refrained from speaking, finding simple pleasure in observing him, much like one would savor the view of a breathtaking landscape. As they passed by, Wu Zhangkong drew the gaze of women of all ages, drawing silent accolades for his striking looks. Yan Feng, with her acute hearing of a five-ringed Soul King, overheard numerous swooning whispers, though none as frequent as her own internal exclaims of his attractiveness. Turning into an alley, Wu Zhangkong halted before a modest establishment with a narrow frontage. Through the window, the intimate interior was visible – it housed merely four tables. The lunch hour was approaching, and the appetizing scent of stir-fried dishes emanated from within. Wu Zhangkong stood at the entrance, lost in thought, a rare softness touching his usually icy gaze. From the side, Yan Feng could see the transformation. 'Ah, Zhangkong! You've arrived! Please, come in.' A man with short hair and a stout frame, appearing to be in his fifties, greeted them warmly. He was evidently well-acquainted with Wu Zhangkong, draping an arm over his shoulder and guiding him inwards. Had Tang Wulin and others witnessed this, their astonishment would have been palpable. Notoriously fastidious, Wu Zhangkong showed no signs of irritation from the man's touch. Instead, he nodded amiably and proceeded inside. Yan Feng followed suit into the eatery. The diner was indeed quaint, with the cleanliness leaving something to be desired. Under ordinary circumstances, such a venue might earn a poor rating from Yan Feng for a date. However, with Wu Zhangkong as her companion, the small diner took on a charm of its own – reflective of his unique persona. The world can indeed be prejudiced in favor of the handsome! 'Zhangkong, it has been a while. Are you well?' the portly owner inquired as he seated them at a table by the bed. Wu Zhangkong settled into his seat with a familiar ease, 'All is well.' 'And this is your friend?' The owner now noticed Yan Feng. Yan Feng, though not conventionally beautiful, possessed a certain allure, especially in the bloom of her youthful prime. 'Hello.' Yan Feng greeted the owner with a smile and took her seat across from Wu Zhangkong. The owner's mouth hung open for a moment in apparent surprise. 'The usual, if you please.' Wu Zhangkong indicated with a nod. The owner recovered from his astonishment, 'Of course, the usual. I'll prepare it right away. It's wonderful to see you like this, Zhangkong!' With that, he scurried off to attend to the order. With the owner's departure, the fleeting warmth on Wu Zhangkong's face reverted to its customary frost. Yan Feng, seated across from him, could now scrutinize his features more intently. His eyelashes were indeed lengthy, and his eyes, strikingly beautiful. His nose was straight, his lips perfectly proportioned. What would it feel like to be kissed by him? What am I thinking! Yan Feng's cheeks flushed with the thought. 'Do you frequent this place?' she ventured. Wu Zhangkong's gaze, usually so distant, finally settled on her. 'I used to,' he replied. Yan Feng remarked, 'That explains the owner's familiarity with you.' 'Indeed.' 'Do you reside in Sky Spirit City?' she probed further. Wu Zhangkong shook his head. 'Then where might you be based?' Yan Feng inquired. 'Shrek,' was Wu Zhangkong's terse reply. Yan Feng asked, 'How old are you this year?' Wu Zhangkong paused, then shook his head, declining to answer. Yan Feng ventured a guess, 'Twenty-seven?' Wu Zhangkong gave no response. 'Incorrect? Then twenty-six? Surely not twenty-eight?' A slight furrow appeared between Wu Zhangkong's brows, 'Thirty-three.' 'Thirty-three?' Yan Feng exclaimed in surprise, 'You certainly don't look it. Your complexion is remarkable. Had it not been for your mature air, I would have assumed you were barely past your twenties. I myself am nearing twenty-seven, which makes you more than six years my senior.' 'Indeed.' Yan Feng queried, 'Are you always so succinct in conversation?' 'Indeed.' 'What about those disciples of yours? What kind of assessment are they undergoing?' Yan Feng continued. 'Final exams,' Wu Zhangkong responded. Yan Feng huffed, 'That leader, he's really something. Not only did he strike me, but he also had the gall to play the victim convincingly. Is that what you taught him?' Wu Zhangkong replied with a helpless expression, 'Not by my instruction.' 'Then who did teach him such tactics?' she pressed on. A trace of a smile flickered across Wu Zhangkong's face – a rare sight for Yan Feng. 'He is naturally gifted,' Wu Zhangkong conceded with a hint of resignation. Yan Feng advised, 'You must be careful in selecting disciples. Like nurturing a sapling, you, as a teacher, must ensure they grow upright, not astray.' Wu Zhangkong assured her, 'He has a good heart. That will not happen.' Yan Feng scoffed, 'I beg to differ. But enough about him. Tell me about yourself. Are you affiliated with an academy? Which one is it?' At that moment, the robust owner reappeared, announcing the readiness of their meal. A few humble yet hearty dishes were served: Candied Sweet Potatoes, Yu Xiang Pork Strips (a spicy garlic pork dish), Kung Pao Chicken, and a Clay Pot Tofu Soup. Three dishes and soup, accompanied by two bowls of rice. Yan Feng felt her hunger piqued; in her excitement, she had skipped breakfast. Despite its unassuming appearance, the restaurant's offerings were delectable, surpassing even some of the grandest hotels in taste. 'Please, help yourself,' Wu Zhangkong invited. Yan Feng eagerly began her meal, her first bite of Yu Xiang Pork eliciting a delighted widening of her eyes. 'This is truly exquisite. Who would have thought such a modest place could serve such tantalizing fare? It's delightful.' Wu Zhangkong commenced his meal at a more measured pace, his attention divided between the dishes and the memories they seemed to evoke, his eyes clouding over with a distant haze. He savored a morsel of Candied Sweet Potatoes, lost in the flavors and perhaps in reminiscence. 'You've yet to disclose which academy you represent,' Yan Feng pressed between bites. 'Shrek,' Wu Zhangkong stated plainly. 'Shrek Academy? Ah! Shrek Academy?' Yan Feng's grip on her bowl nearly slackened in shock. Her eyes fixed on Wu Zhangkong, her tone rising slightly, 'You, you're a teacher at Shrek Academy?' 'Is there an issue?' Wu Zhangkong glanced her way. Yan Feng's demeanor shifted, 'No, not at all.' Internally, however, she cheered, Perfect! Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-One: Yan Feng and Sky Ice His dashing appearance was impeccable, and his status as a teacher at Shrek Academy only augmented his ideal image. 'I've long aspired to join Shrek Academy! I tried their entrance exams but sadly didn't pass. It's regrettable; I could've been under your tutelage.' Wu Zhangkong replied with cool detachment: 'Not a chance. We would've been peers. You wouldn't have been my student.' Yan Feng felt slighted. 'Is this your idea of conversation? That's hardly the way to address a lady.' Wu Zhangkong continued eating in silence, only adding to Yan Feng's irritation. This man! Nevertheless, her curiosity soon overtook her discretion, 'You must be a Battle Armor Master since you teach at Shrek, correct? Single-Word or Two-Word?' 'Two-Word,' Wu Zhangkong responded succinctly. Yan Feng was visibly impressed. A Two-Word Master at only thirty-three was remarkable! It explained why she had been unable to determine his cultivation level. 'I've recently advanced to Single-Word Master status, and I've named my armor 'Feng.' Single-Word Masters typically choose a name with a single syllable, and I chose my own name. What about you? What are the names of your Battle Armor?' 'Sky Ice,' Wu Zhangkong stated. 'Such a melodious name. Why 'Sky Ice'? Your martial soul must be ice-related to warrant such a name,' Yan Feng speculated. Wu Zhangkong met her gaze, 'Sky is part of my martial soul's name, and Ice is my wife's name. We should eat now; it's customary not to talk during meals.' His wife's name? That revelation hit her hard. She should have known better; a man as outstanding as him was bound to be taken. A profound sense of loss overshadowed her hunger. The rest of their meal proceeded in quiet; Wu Zhangkong was scarcely eating, his mind awash with memories... 'Zhangkong, I can never get enough of this place's honey-glazed winter melon. Who knew eggs could be this delicious? I'll learn this recipe and make it for you at home, alright?' 'Hold on, leave some tofu for me! They say tofu does wonders for the skin. While my skin might be slightly smoother than yours, I still aim to improve it further.' 'This garlic pork stir-fry is perfect with rice. Maybe I could have another half bowl? Tell me, you don't think I'll put on weight, do you?' 'You're such a klutz, you've got rice all over you. No, I won't kiss it off. Stop, don't rub it off on me!' ... After vacating the diner, the sun was at its zenith. 'Thank you for the lunch,' Yan Feng said, still smiling. Wu Zhangkong shook his head, 'I should be on my way.' 'Might I have your Soul-Guided Communication Number? I'm heading to the Soul Transmission Tower to have them retract the accusations against your disciples. I'll let you know once it's settled.' Wu Zhangkong hesitated but eventually disclosed a sequence of numbers. 'Perhaps I could invite you for a meal at Shrek in the future?' Yan Feng suggested optimistically. Wu Zhangkong offered her a fleeting look, 'I need to leave. Farewell.' He then turned and strode away. Yan Feng's gaze lingered on his departing silhouette until it vanished, followed by a soft sigh. 'The good ones are always taken. When will I stumble upon someone like him? Sky Spirit City seems too confined. I should relocate to Shrek City; my rank as a Single-Word Master should open doors. I'll request a transfer through the Soul Transmission Tower.' Their Soul-Guided Vehicle thrummed down the highway, aiming for the subsequent city. With the Sky Spirit City debacle behind them, they had to divert their path through another city. Despite their brainstorming, they couldn't devise a quicker strategy than stirring up trouble at the Soul Transmission Tower and dealing with the Enforcers. They had no choice but to tread the old paths. Fortune isn't always consistent; it fluctuates. In the following cities, they faced little resistance and effortlessly accomplished their final exams. Their guise as Inspectors was foolproof, and after several cities, their mission was half complete. 'It's the fourth day. We need to accelerate our efforts. Let's aim for two successes today, and two more tomorrow, then we'll arrive in Mingdu. Mingdu's brimming with strong Soul Masters, given its status as the Federation's hub. We'll just need to be more discreet.' Tang Wulin analyzed the map and formulated a plan with his comrades. From initial anxiety to a growing sense of ease, their journey was proving to be an invaluable experience. Throughout their final exam, they had encountered and surmounted various challenges. The confrontation with Yan Feng had been the most trying, revealing the sheer power of a Battle Armor Master. As students of Shrek, they could have potentially subdued a Six-Ringed Soul Emperor with their combined might. Yet, against a Battle Armor Master, they were completely outclassed and unable to breach the defenses. 'Wulin, I'm aware of an ideal locale in Mingdu for our final exam,' Ye Xinglan interjected suddenly. 'Oh? Where might that be?' Tang Wulin inquired, intrigued. A glint of excitement shone in Ye Xinglan's eyes, 'There's a longstanding rivalry between that institution and our academy. Completing our final exam there would carry significant weight.' Tang Wulin's eyes sparkled with resolve, 'It's a sound proposal. I concur.' 'Then it's decided,' Ye Xinglan affirmed, her fists balled in anticipation. 'Before we get too carried away, let's address the immediate challenge,' Xie Xie cautioned, his voice laced with apprehension. Peering forward through the windshield, they were confronted with an alarming sight. The highway ahead was blockaded by a line of over twenty mech armors—five in purple, fifteen in yellow—forming an intimidating barrier. There were no halted Soul-Guided Vehicles, suggesting the mech armors had only just descended. The insignia on their chests confirmed their affiliation with the Aether Transmission Spire. After five rounds of exams, the Aether Transmission Spire had caught up to them at last. 'Wulin, what's our course of action?' Xie Xie braked sharply, seeking guidance from Tang Wulin with a sense of urgency. Tang Wulin's eyes narrowed, the prelude to his typical surge of resolve. 'Halt the vehicle!' he commanded. With an elbow strike of practiced might, he sent the door flying, seized the roof, and sprung out. His prompt decision broadcasted to his comrades the need for immediate action—they would not yield easily. Being apprehended wouldn't be too severe—probably just a penalty and an apology—but it could mean being returned to Shrek Academy in disgrace, threatening their final exam. No class leader in Shrek Academy's history had ever failed. Tang Wulin was adamant about not becoming the first, nor would he let his teammates face disqualification. Xie Xie stomped on the brake and twisted the steering wheel, directing the Soul-Guided Vehicle toward the guardrail. As formidable Soul Masters of Shrek Academy, even Xu Lizhi was safeguarded by Tang Sect's esoteric techniques. They ejected from the vehicle as it collided with the guardrail, scattering in every direction. Gu Yue clutched Xu Xiaoyan protectively, declaring 'Elemental Storm!' Upon their exit, Xu Xiaoyan's martial soul flared to life, her third soul ring igniting with a bright glow. Supported by Gu Yue's Elemental Tide, a fierce blizzard unfurled from her core. With forests and fields on either side of the highway, Tang Wulin bellowed, 'Into the woods, quickly!' He propelled his friends forward, yet he himself remained steadfast. The mech armors, noting their abrupt change in direction, soared skyward. Soul Guidance Cannons locked on to them, advancing at breakneck speed. Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Two: Omnipotent Gu Yue Although mech armor flight does involve an acceleration process, it is incredibly swift, a speed unmatchable by their current pace. Only by darting into the forest did they have a sliver of hope for escape. Moreover, Tang Wulin had another advantage: these mechs belonged to the Soul Transmission Tower, not to official authorities. Mechs from the Soul Transmission Tower would not dare to kill easily, as the order of the Federation must not be disrupted. Thus, Tang Wulin concluded that the goal of these mechs was to capture them, not to kill. With this assessment, he had some confidence in leading his companions to evade capture. Indeed, as the mechs that flew into the air retracted their Soul Guidance Cannons and approached bare-handed, the five leading purple Mech Armors sped toward them like lightning. Tang Wulin lightly tapped his toe, and soared into the air. The golden light flickered, and the Golden Dragon King's power erupted, his body swelling with scales emerging. His right arm suddenly enlarged, and his Battle Armor gauntlet materialized. In an instant, he elevated himself to the strongest combat state. With the sound of dragon chants within him, Tang Wulin took a deep breath, circled his hands in front of him, placed his left hand on the Battle Armor on his right forearm, and with a fierce shout, he swung a claw into the void. Reverse Blood Qi Circulation, Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens, Golden Dragon Terrifying Claw! He channeled all his soul power through his hands into the Golden Dragon Claw on his right hand, using Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens to activate his Golden Dragon Terrifying Claw. Before this final exam, he dared not do so, as his right hand's Golden Dragon Claw would feel overwhelmed, but with the continuous enhancement of his blood qi after stepping out, although he did not break through the Golden Dragon King's Fourth Seal, his body's tolerance had evidently strengthened. Five splendid claw shadows swept across the sky, chilling to the bone with a dark golden gleam at the edges and a brilliant gold at the back, vaguely showing dragon scale patterns. The five claw shadows were only five feet long when first swung, but they swelled against the wind. In a blink, they became massive shadows of dozens of meters. Despite becoming more ethereal as they expanded, they perfectly blocked the path of the five purple Mech Armors. The purple mech pilots were startled by this sight, as a soul master's attack range is proportional to their strength. The golden light on Tang Wulin was naturally assumed as Soul Rings, but since when were there golden Soul Rings? Coupled with such a vast control range of the claw shadows, their first reaction was to activate their protective barriers to the extreme and defend with all their might. 'Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom—' Five roars exploded in the air, and the five mechs were struck and flew backward. With the core force of the Golden Dragon Terrifying Claw hitting one of them, its protective barrier was filled with cracks, nearly shattering. From afar, the scene was undoubtedly shocking. Faced with twenty mechs, that small figure leaped into the air, with one claw, five purple Mech Armors were swept away — what a display of overwhelming might! Although the fifteen yellow mechs followed closely, seeing the five purple mechs blasted away by Tang Wulin, they hesitated for a moment, not daring to rush forward directly. The force that could send purple mechs flying could likely tear their mechs apart! Tang Wulin landed with a thud, his toes tapped the ground, and he flew backward, disappearing into the blizzard that had already formed behind him. A soft hand quickly grabbed his, pulling him along at high speed. The blizzard unleashed by Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan was beyond the existence of an ordinary millennium soul ring technique. Especially when they only sought to obstruct sight and detection, without considering attack strength, in just a moment, they had already covered hundreds of square meters. The blizzard raged in the air, with a tornado emerging, swirling with snowflakes, severely obstructing the mech pilots' vision. Tang Wulin's strike not only blocked their pursuit but also had a strong deterrent effect. The purple-ranked mech pilots also had no confidence that they could emerge unscathed in a one-on-one situation. Therefore, they did not dare to scatter to search but had to gather together, using the mechs' radar to find their targets. However, the methods to counter mech radars were already covered by Shrek Academy early on when they started school. The energy fluctuations within the blizzard were chaotic, making it almost impossible for radars to be effective. Tang Wulin was pulled forward as he ran. Suddenly, the ground beneath him gave way, his body sank, and before he knew it, he was back on solid ground, then plunged into darkness as the light suddenly disappeared. Then, a golden light shone, and he could finally see. They were in a not-so-large space, surrounded by dirt, with all his companions there, and the one who had grabbed his hand was Gu Yue. The golden light was shining from her hand. She released Tang Wulin's hand, and without a word, her eyes lit up, and she unleashed both her soul skills, Elemental Tide and Earth Element Control. At once, Tang Wulin felt the ground beneath him slowly sinking, and more astonishingly, the dirt above them began to close on its own, as if constantly swallowing them down. At this moment, the companions looking at Gu Yue were all in awe, even the proud Ye Xinglan's eyes sparkled with admiration. Earth Element Control was simply divine under these circumstances! The earth elements beneath the ground were undoubtedly the most abundant. Gu Yue used her cultivation to control the dirt, sinking them deeper, with the soil enough to block most scans. The farther from the surface, the less likely they were to be detected. Naturally, they were safe. As the saying goes, 'no road leads to heaven, no door leads into the earth,' but Gu Yue had opened that door for them. The Soul Transmission Tower's mech pilots could never dream that they could escape underground, and they had no way to pursue them, unless they had used the Soul Guidance Cannons for carpet bombing immediately. But these mech pilots were from the Soul Transmission Tower, and Tang Wulin and his comrades had not committed any grave sins, at most they were just causing trouble, so how could they make such a grand display? After a full ten minutes or more, Gu Yue, sweating from her forehead, finally stopped controlling the earth elements. 'Everyone, control your breathing, the air is thin underground,' Tang Wulin told his friends. They couldn't afford to escape the pursuit only to suffocate underground. 'It's fine,' Gu Yue said. She flicked her left hand, and a ball of water hung in mid-air, her right hand gently rubbed on the water ball, and it gradually shrank, making the air in this underground space much more comfortable. 'I learned from the teacher how to separate water elements, which can create the oxygen we need. There will be no problem for a short time.' 'Gu Yue, you are truly all-around amazing!' Xu Xiaoyan exclaimed in admiration. Gu Yue smiled faintly, 'Don't talk about this, they probably can't find us now. We'll go out later. But what do we do next? The Soul Transmission Tower is after us, and all the city towers must have received the message, they will be on high alert, our previous methods won't work. We need to change.' Tang Wulin's eyes narrowed slightly, 'The cities we're going to are all big cities. Big cities must have soul master academies. There won't be a lack of soul masters with cultivation higher than ours. We can do this...' His thoughts were still on the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy he had mentioned earlier. Since they couldn't go through the Soul Transmission Tower's route, that would do. A full hour later, Gu Yue controlled the soil to push them back up to the surface, and as expected, the mechs were gone, leaving no trace. But to their frustration, their vehicle was also destroyed and could not be driven. Tang Wulin had already checked the map. From their location, the next city was less than two hundred kilometers away. With no other choice, there was only one word for it — run! With Gu Yue's Wind Element Control and Xu Lizhi's Agile Steamed Bun, Tang Wulin carried a bit of Xu Lizhi, Ye Xinglan helped Xu Xiaoyan, and the six could only rely on their legs, following the path near the highway to the next city. Chapter 443: Challenging the Academy! For Tang Wulin, two hundred kilometers was but a minor stretch for his robust physique. However, for Xu Lizhi, even with the revitalizing effects of his Agile Steamed Buns and Bloodthirsty Red Bean Buns, the journey took its toll, leaving him visibly leaner. 'The Soul Transmission Tower!' Xu Lizhi muttered, his fist clenched not so much in anger but in a mix of exhaustion and a defiant resolve. 'And what will you do?' Gu Yue asked, a hint of mockery in her voice. Glancing at her, Xu Lizhi declared, 'They can forget about ever tasting my buns again!' Ye Xinglan couldn't help but retort, 'Such grand ambitions.' Tang Wulin pondered for a moment, 'Originally, we planned to cover two cities today. Now, it seems we must adjust to just one. Everyone, take a moment to rest. We'll seek out the academy this afternoon.' Settling into a modest inn, they quickly recovered, their resilient soul master constitutions accelerating their recuperation. Tang Wulin utilized this pause to inquire about the whereabouts of the local Soul Master Academy. Here in Sky Destiny City, and with Mingdu still some two thousand kilometers ahead, interspersed with several cities, they would need to complete their mission before they could board a soul-guided train westward. The academy in question was none other than the famous Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy, an institution that exclusively enrolled soul masters endowed with the gift of flight. Although the advanced institute specialized in cultivating elite soul masters, mech armor masters, and battle armor masters, the group agreed that a staunch focus on the latter wasn't necessary. Graduates typically left the advanced institute in their early to mid-twenties. At Shrek Academy, it was a rarity for someone to forge a Single-Word Battle Armor by that age, much less at other academies. 'We have found our mark!' Tang Wulin resolved. While the others rested, he felt reinvigorated. Borrowing a soul-guided communicator from the inn, he connected with a number he knew well. 'Master Uncle Zhentai,' Tang Wulin greeted, his voice filled with respect. 'Wulin, how is the final exam progressing? Smoothly, I hope?' came the gentle inquiry from Zhentai. Tang Wulin confessed, 'It's proving to be rather challenging, with a few unforeseen complications. I find myself in need of funds to continue with the exams. At present, I'm in Sky Destiny City. Without my blacksmith badge, I'm unable to take on forging tasks. Could you possibly intercede with the local Blacksmith Association on my behalf? I'd like to undertake a refinement forging or spirit forging assignment. Additionally, I need to borrow a forging hammer and plan to trade the finished product for travel expenses.' Zhentai's voice carried a hint of amusement, 'You're really in a bind, aren't you? Forego the forging. With your level of skill and your youth, it might attract unnecessary attention. I've made arrangements with the Sky Destiny Blacksmith Association to provide you with some funds instead.' 'Thank you, Master Uncle Zhentai,' Tang Wulin said, his gratitude apparent. He internally commended his generous uncle. Zhentai chuckled, 'There's no need for thanks; we're family, after all. Do visit the headquarters when you get the chance.' 'I most certainly will.' Tang Wulin assured him, already looking forward to the guidance from the divine craftsman and the enticing culinary delights that awaited him. After a visit to the Blacksmith Association, Tang Wulin rejoined his companions in the afternoon, now a million Federation coins richer. 'Shall we procure another vehicle?' Xie Xie suggested, a hint of eagerness in his voice. 'What are your thoughts?' Tang Wulin sought the consensus of his friends. Ye Xinglan contributed, 'A vehicle would indeed make things more convenient. It might not be as swift as the soul-guided train, but it would certainly ease our navigation within the city. The navigation system could save us considerable time.' 'Then let's purchase one!' With the newly acquired funds, they secured another vehicle of comparable size. Armed with Tang Wulin's researched address, they set their course for the Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy. The Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy, situated in the southwestern corner of Sky Destiny City, had a history spanning nearly two millennia. Although not as venerable as Shrek Academy, with its roots tracing back to the dawn of civilization, Destiny Skyreach Academy nonetheless had its own lengthy and storied past. The academy had nurtured numerous talents and maintained a close alliance with the military. In days past, when the military sought soul-guided masters, their preference leaned towards those with native flight capabilities. Soul-guided devices enabled soul masters to ascend the skies, yet those with innate flight abilities had a distinct advantage in aerial supremacy. The appearance of soul-guided devices had once significantly narrowed the gap between average soul masters and the exceptionally gifted. The advent of mech armors momentarily made the intrinsic strength of soul masters inconsequential in deciding the outcomes of combat. It wasn't until the emergence of battle armors that soul masters reclaimed their prominence. Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy prided itself on its specialization in training soul-guided masters, particularly those adept in flight. Consequently, their mech armor masters were renowned throughout the Federation, highly desired by military districts. With military support, the Academy had thrived and expanded rapidly. Even among second-tier institutions, it was considered a frontrunner, trailing only the ancient, prestigious academies. A modest soul-guided vehicle halted in an alley not far from the Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy. Six individuals in verdant sportswear alighted — green, the emblematic hue of Shrek Academy. Tang Wulin, the leader, donned the newly acquired sportswear. As they approached the grandiose academy gate, towering over twenty meters high and forty meters wide to accommodate mech armors, he exchanged a glance with Xie Xie, who unfurled a banner supported by two bamboo poles. The banner, ten meters wide, sported white fabric adorned with bold green lettering, perhaps not calligraphy but clearly legible nonetheless. Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi each took a pole, securing them into the ground. As students began their day, they were met with this unexpected sight, prompting a range of reactions from astonishment to curiosity. A passerby read aloud from the banner: 'From Shrek Academy, we challenge your strongest team under twenty.' Was this a declaration of challenge? Indeed, it was Tang Wulin's straightforward and bold strategy — simple, unrefined, direct, and efficient. Security was present at the Academy's entrance, and as the day was just beginning, students arriving were promptly met with this bold declaration. Their reactions varied from awe to confusion, anger, and curiosity. Soon enough, the academy's entrance was encircled by spectators. The name 'Shrek Academy' commanded the most attention — a moniker that signified legend to any student. Were students from the fabled Shrek Academy truly here issuing a challenge? A contest with the strongest team under twenty? They looked to be no older than fifteen. Tang Wulin stood at the forefront, stoic, convinced that the Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy could not refuse such a direct challenge. To do so would tarnish their reputation irreparably and deal a severe blow to their students' morale. 'Are you truly from Shrek Academy?' a young man, likely seventeen or eighteen, inquired of Tang Wulin, skepticism etched into his voice. Tang Wulin nodded, 'Hello, we are indeed from Shrek. We seek a friendly exchange and the opportunity to engage in a match with your esteemed academy.' The young man probed further, 'How can you prove you're from Shrek?' Tang Wulin responded with a slight smile as a glint of gold flashed in his eyes. A radiant surge of golden light erupted from beneath him, casting an awe-inspiring halo around him, drawing gasps from the crowd. Gold? What could a golden soul ring represent? Legends spoke of powerful soul spirits with orange rings, but a golden one? Golden soul rings were steeped in myth, rumored to be the sacred marks of the gods. Oblivious to the onlookers, Tang Wulin was not revealing an ordinary soul ring, but a 气血魂环, a rarity of immense power and significance. Tang Wulin knew well the predicament he faced. How could he prove his identity when every item of authenticity had been seized by the academy? He refrained from revealing his three purple soul rings, opting to unveil the golden ring for its profound impact — to command immediate attention and respect. The young man appeared taken aback, instinctively retreating a few steps. Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Four: Skyreach Starry Sky Academy At that moment, the grand gates of the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy swung open, revealing several figures who strode out. They appeared to be over forty years old, with the lead figure standing tall and robust, his streaks of gray hair standing proudly, exuding a vibrant spirit. Tang Wulin made no effort to conceal his gleaming Golden Soul Ring imbued with Blood Qi, and upon his emergence, it immediately caught the leader's eye, prompting a fleeting expression of astonishment. The man advanced a few steps before halting. "From Shrek Academy, are you? Are you members of its outer or inner court?" he inquired. "Outer court, first-year Class One, class president, Tang Wulin," was the response. This was not a mere spar like those sought at the Soul Transmission Tower—this was a formal challenge. "Class president?" The man's face registered greater surprise than when he had first seen Wulin's golden soul ring. "Please roll up your banners and come inside," he directed, stepping aside to provide them with passage. With a signal from Wulin, Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi promptly stowed the banner away. They had adhered to the necessary protocols; a confrontation at the gate would be improper. When issuing a challenge to an esteemed institution, maintaining decorum was essential. "Resume your studies now; there's no need to gather here," the middle-aged man declared, his commanding voice clearly holding sway within the academy. The students scattered like startled birds, heading back into the academy. Wulin and his companions followed the man into the academy, a venerable establishment with extensive grounds and refined ambiance, its pathways adorned with many intricate sculptures. "I am Li Zhilong, Director of Education at Skyreach Starry Sky Academy," the man introduced himself. "Our academy boasts a long-standing tradition as the foremost high-level soul master institution in Sky Destiny City, specializing in the training of flight-type soul masters, soul guidance masters, and mech armor pilots. We also host a graduate school dedicated to the cultivation of Battle Armor Masters. Are you here on behalf of Shrek Academy?" As Li Zhilong mentioned 'Shrek Academy,' Wulin felt a stir within him and opted for transparency. "Director Li, we are here not as representatives of our academy, but on personal initiative. This is a trial set by our academy, which commands us to seek out and engage in combat with adversaries who surpass our own might in various cities. Bereft of all identification and equipment, we found ourselves compelled to adopt this strategy, for which we ask for your understanding. We chose Skyreach Starry Sky Academy knowing full well that it stands as the pinnacle of education in Sky Destiny City and the entire northwest region." Gu Yue and Ye Xinglan exchanged glances with Wulin, their expressions tinged with puzzlement. When had he become so forthright? Was this a new side of him? Yet, Li Zhilong's reaction to Wulin's candidness proved even more unexpected. He let out a hearty laugh. "Ah, the audacity of youth is a hallmark of the prodigies nurtured by Shrek Academy. Your restraint from barging through our gates has already shown us respect. I remember, back in our day, an upperclassman undertook an academy mission that led him to single-handedly challenge a military encampment, causing quite the commotion." The words 'our Shrek Academy' elicited a collective startle from the group. Wulin, equally startled, asked, "You, too, are a Shrek Academy alumnus?" Li Zhilong's face lit up with pride. "Indeed, I am. Perhaps some fifteen classes before yours. Regrettably, I barely graduated from the outer court." Though he claimed it was a narrow success, his face betrayed no sign of struggle—only pride. Graduating from Shrek Academy was a source of immense pride in his life. Wulin returned the smile. "Then, we should address you as 'Senior.' Greetings, Senior Li. We apologize for any inconvenience. Should this be unsuitable, we will take our leave and seek alternative means to fulfill our final exam requirements." Li Zhilong dismissed the idea with a wave. "Why talk of leaving? You've come all this way. Besides, after the spectacle at our academy's entrance, if we don't present some form of resolution, I'll be hard-pressed to explain it to our students. Rest assured, I will find you worthy opponents—the strongest under-twenty team. I am also eager to gauge the disparity between our students and yours. It's been a long time since I last visited Shrek. Oh, how I miss the Spirit Ice Plaza! My greatest hope was to study by the Sea God Lake and enter the inner court. Alas, it was not to be." A wistful look clouded his eyes, filled with reminiscences. Wulin maintained his genial demeanor, his forthrightness having been a strategic choice, informed by the familiarity detected in Li Zhilong's initial gaze and the emotional shifts that followed whenever Shrek was mentioned. It was this insight that had prompted him to speak openly, resonating with the director's heart. The Skyreach Starry Sky Academy's main teaching building was an imposing edifice, a towering dome nearly a hundred meters high that rivaled the main building of Shrek Academy, albeit slightly smaller in scale. Li Zhilong led them to a lounge before inquiring, "You've come for a sparring match among soul masters, have you not? Will you be utilizing mechs?" Wulin quickly refuted the possibility, "No, sir. Would it be conceivable for the academy to sanction us to bring mechs under our current circumstances?" "Very well, take a moment to rest, have some water, and I will arrange the rest. We shall talk more later." "When did you become so forthright?" Xie Xie blurted out, barely containing his curiosity after Li Zhilong had departed. Gu Yue chimed in, "He must have noticed some connection. Director Li must share a history with our academy, hence Wulin's candor. Isn't that right?" Initially befuddled, she began to piece together the underlying dynamics as the conversation progressed. Wulin merely smiled, tapping his temple with a finger. Ye Xinglan emitted a disdainful snort. Wulin addressed them, "Prepare yourselves. The forthcoming exchange will be challenging. Though Director Li is our senior and has endorsed our examination, he now represents the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy. He will surely select their finest students for the match. Their expertise in flight will make for a demanding challenge. Let us proceed according to the plan we've discussed." Heads nodded in agreement as Wulin closed his eyes to focus. Shortly after, Li Zhilong returned. "Do you require a moment to adjust?" he inquired upon entry. Standing, Wulin replied, "No need, Senior Li. We have to travel to the next city to continue with our exam. The quicker we resolve this battle, the better for all of us." "As class president, you're not apprehensive about the prospect of elimination?" Li Zhilong teased with a wry smile. Wulin shook his head, "That's not my concern. Rather, I aim to amass as many points as possible to distribute among my classmates. My aspiration is for every member of our class to remain until the end." Li Zhilong's expression softened, touched by the sentiment. "Commendable indeed! You are truly a class president. With that, let us proceed." The group was surprised to find that the towering academic building lacked elevators, relying solely on spiraling staircases for ascent, designed to provide constant physical training. They climbed to the summit, entering an expansive hall that, to their amazement, was open to the sky above, unencumbered by a dome. "This is our academy's Astronomy Platform, a vital space for practical training. It spans a full three hundred meters, and since we specialize in nurturing flight-type soul masters, there are no height restrictions," Li Zhilong explained. "It's a magnificent sight," Wulin observed. "Gazing at the stars from here at night must be an incredibly beautiful experience." Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Five: The Stargazing Platform Li Zhilong smiled and said, 'Witnessing the stars here is effortless; shortly, you'll be in awe of them. Our Stargazing Platform is endowed with unique properties. Whether day or night, once activated, it draws us nearer to the cosmos, presenting a closer view of the stars. The platform's grand Soul Guidance Formation captures the astral forces from space, channeling the purest energy to aid our students' cultivation. Only our exceptional disciples are granted access at designated times for their training. It's predominantly a retreat for our postgraduate students to temper their bodies and Battle Armors with the quintessence of the stars.' Tang Wulin's astonishment was evident; the Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy indeed harbored extraordinary secrets. The impending match seemed daunting. But wait—astral forces? Starlight? He instinctively glanced at Xu Xiaoyan, who also seemed bewildered. 'Please familiarize yourselves with the ambiance. Our students will join you shortly.' The Stargazing Platform was encircled by a towering thirty-meter wall. Upon closer examination, the wall was adorned with elaborate patterns and glyphs, intricately crafted from rare metals. With Li Zhilong's introduction and their own heightened senses, they could detect the immense latent energy within the platform. Soul Guidance Formations have been integrated into daily life for many years, yet the quest to unlock their full potential has been inexhaustible. Increasingly complex formations have been developed, each with distinct functions. The military's vast formations are notably prevalent, essential to their defense systems. The formation before Tang Wulin was, without a doubt, the most elaborate and extensive he'd ever encountered. It made him wonder if Shrek Academy had something of equivalent grandeur. After all, it is the preeminent academy on the continent. As they absorbed the surroundings, a group of pupils appeared, dressed in the black uniforms of Destiny Soul Master Academy, each chest emblazoned with star-shaped embroidery. The silver stars denoted their cultivation level, with additional stars indicating higher Soul Energy. In the postgraduate phase, these silver stars would change to gold. The stars clearly signified the strength of each student. The six who arrived, all adorned with silver stars, were a mix of four men and two women, aged between eighteen to twenty. They regarded Tang Wulin's group with eyes reflecting curiosity. A single glance allowed Tang Wulin to estimate their capacities. The strongest sported forty-six silver stars, and the others also surpassed forty, aligning with the criteria for their challenge. From Shrek Academy, they were unfazed by higher-level adversaries. However, Tang Wulin was intrigued by the Stargazing Platform. Undoubtedly, Li Zhilong's decision to host the contest here was strategic. Li Zhilong, still wearing a warm smile, said, 'Let me introduce you all. These six are the elite students of Shrek Academy. And our six are the most exemplary of our students, up to the postgraduate level. Now, please introduce yourselves.' Tang Wulin nodded to the opposite group. 'I am the team captain, Tang Wulin, a Battle Soul Master specializing in offensive control.' A young man with a tall and lean stature stepped forward, returning the greeting with a smile. 'Hello, and welcome to Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy. I am the captain, Xiao Tian Tian. Interestingly, I also specialize in offensive control as a Battle Soul Master, just like you.' Their eyes met—both smiling, each gauging the other. Due to his age, Xiao Tian Tian was more elongated and slender than Tang Wulin, yet he couldn't discern any emotion in Tang Wulin's gaze. Gu Yue was concise, 'Gu Yue, an Offensive Battle Soul Master.' The second from Destiny Skyreach, a slim male, appeared unremarkable, yet he was the second most potent there, at Level 44. 'Ye Zishu, a Swift Attack Battle Soul Master.' 'Xie Xie, also a Swift Attack Battle Soul Master.' The third member of Destiny Skyreach was a towering figure, the most robust of the six. 'Jian Mochen, a Swift Attack Battle Soul Master.' Despite his build suggesting an Offensive Battle Soul Master, he was identified as Swift Attack—a curiosity. 'Ye Xinglan, an Offensive Battle Soul Master.' The fourth from Destiny Skyreach was a youth of average build but with a magnetic presence. With a faint smile, his voice resonated deeply with Tang Wulin's group, 'Zhang Xining, a Control Battle Soul Master.' 'Xu Xiaoyan, a Control Battle Soul Master.' Xu Xiaoyan's voice carried a trace of confusion as she introduced herself. The fifth member of Destiny Skyreach was a petite and beautiful girl who giggled, 'I'm Li Yaoyao, an Offensive Battle Soul Master.' 'Xu Lizhi, a Gastronomic Tool Soul Master,' The last student from Destiny Skyreach was a woman with both a striking appearance and figure, her demeanor exuding gentleness yet fortitude. 'I'm Han Yushang, a Control Battle Soul Master.' Another specialist in control? As the introductions concluded, Tang Wulin grew more cautious. Their captain, Xiao Tian Tian, was a Battle Soul Master focused on offense and control, and they had two additional pure Control Battle Soul Masters. Only six people—half were dedicated to control. What did that imply? Moreover, given the distinctive traits of Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy, all six were flying soul masters, now poised to compete on their specialized field, all above Level 40. This promised to be quite the confrontation. Tang Wulin glanced at Gu Yue, who caught his gaze and returned it. They shared a quiet nod, an unspoken agreement between them. 'The teacher in charge of the Stargazing Platform will activate the barrier shortly. This is a friendly match, so exercise restraint,' Li Zhilong instructed, his voice imbued with eager anticipation. He took pride in being a Shrek Academy alumnus, but the prospect of his proteges outshining those from Shrek thrilled him even more. Although Tang Wulin's team was young, his role as class president symbolically embodied Shrek. Victory in this match wouldn't just address an age difference; it would also herald a milestone for Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy. Which academy had ever vanquished a younger team from Shrek? The teams retreated to their respective positions, adhering to the rule of a minimum one hundred-meter distance before the battle's commencement. As they positioned themselves, Tang Wulin's eyes gleamed with a resolute light. Those familiar with him understood that the greater the pressure, the more his fighting spirit ignited, unleashing his potential. The six adversaries before him were formidable, indeed. But were they as formidable as the top five young geniuses of their time? Having overcome even martial soul fusion techniques, Tang Wulin was confident that even here, in this specialized arena, they could still triumph. This was the indomitable spirit of Shrek. They stood not just for themselves, but for the glory of Shrek! In a triangular formation, Tang Wulin led the way, with Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan at his heels. Gu Yue, Xu Xiaoyan, and Xu Lizhi were at the back. The Destiny Skyreach team, however, seemed indifferent to strategic positioning, simply aligning side by side. A six-on-six team battle would test the individual strengths and the synergy between teammates. 'Ready!' Li Zhilong took on the role of the match referee. A resonant hum pierced the air as the walls encircling the Stargazing Platform blazed to life. Patterns that had lain dormant now seemed animated under the glow, which surged skyward, converging into beams that joined and erupted into a massive column reaching for the heavens. Such was the grandeur of the Stargazing Platform. Tang Wulin felt the energy fluctuations around him. The sky was swiftly eclipsed; the golden daylight receded, yielding to an endless nocturnal canvas sprinkled with stars that felt tantalizingly close. Enigmatic and pristine energy descended, cloaking the entire platform. Tang Wulin saw that each of the six opponents was enveloped in a faint golden aura, their presences subtly bolstered. Clearly, in this environment, they had the upper hand. 'Hmm?' A soft sound emanated from behind him. Turning, Tang Wulin was greeted by an astonishing sight. A brilliant golden light erupted from behind him. The golden mist rose, nearly veiling the figure nearby from view. 'Xiaoyan,' Tang Wulin whispered her name with a mix of wonder and concern. Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Six: I'm Perfectly Fine, It's Wondrous "I'm unscathed. I'm perfectly fine; this feeling is wondrous!" Xu Xiaoyan's voice trembled lightly, yet it clearly quivered with excitement. The referee for this match, Li Zhilong, was somewhat surprised. He was the most familiar with the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, a place where students could hone their bodies by absorbing Astral Force, effective only for soul masters possessing flight-type martial souls. This platform was the very foundation of the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy. Engaging in combat here naturally amplified one's soul power, and the recovery speed was substantially greater than in the external world. But what about that girl from Shrek Academy? Could that be her true martial soul? Students varied in their sensitivity and absorption capacity towards Astral Force. The more attuned they were with the Astral Force, the more pronounced the Astral Force fluctuations would appear on the platform. The faint golden halo that Tang Wulin previously observed was indicative of this, and within the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, only a select few students could physically manifest Astral Force, a state not visible on most students, where a vague golden mist was the manifestation. The golden mist surrounding Xu Xiaoyan had almost materialized, so much so that even Li Zhilong, who was well-acquainted with the place, couldn't decipher the changes occurring within her. "Begin!" Following Li Zhilong's thunderous shout, the confrontation between six first-year students from Shrek Academy and the strongest under-twenty team of Skyreach Starry Sky Academy commenced. From Shrek Academy's side, three figures dashed out as quick as lightning. Tang Wulin attracted the most attention, stamping his left foot on the ground and propelling forward like a cannonball, his velocity astonishing. At the moment of his launch, his martial soul also emerged, with three dazzling purple soul rings, and a swarm of Blue Silver Grass vines sprouted forth. Yet, it was challenging to recognize these as Blue Silver Grass, with their translucent blue vines marked with gold, and upon closer examination, one could discern faint scale-like patterns on their surface. Advancing with him were Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan. Xie Xie moved with a lightness, lacking Tang Wulin's brute force, but matching his speed. Ye Xinglan's velocity was so rapid it was almost invisible. All three, each adorned with the luminescence of three soul rings, were like three swift arrows, charging towards their opponents. The six students from the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy responded in unison; they jumped and ascended at the same time. Xiao Tian Tian leaned slightly forward, and a surge of dark red light burst from him, his eyes also turning a deep crimson. Wings akin to those of a bat spread from his back, and with a powerful flap, he rocketed skyward. His four purple soul rings shimmered, radiating an awe-inspiring aura. As he released his martial soul, his initially slender frame began to expand, growing more robust. What kind of martial soul was this? Tang Wulin took a moment to recognize it. Next to Xiao Tian Tian, Ye Zishu was particularly unusual. He brought his hands together in front of him, and a beam of yellow light shone, remarkably transforming into a lengthy bamboo stick. Then, as his second soul ring flickered, the bamboo gently swayed, and a multitude of bamboo leaves took flight, gathering behind him into a pair of wings. With a push from the stick on the ground, he vaulted and soared. His flight was ethereal, more like a tuft of cotton floating upwards than actual flight. Gu Yue let out a sound similar to an eagle's call, and a set of wings unfolded, his hair now noticeably adorned with feathers. With a flap, he surged into the heavens determinedly. His martial soul was the Skyscraper War Eagle! Zhang Xining also had a set of wings, but compared to Gu Yue's, his were significantly smaller and more agile. With a light flap of his white wings, he glided up, hiding behind Gu Yue as if he were a little bird that had been startled. What left Tang Wulin agape was Li Yaoyao. As this seemingly delicate and lovely young woman ascended, an intense blaze surrounded her. Subsequently, her entire skin turned dark, and her arms each solidified into what seemed like boulders, with flames propelling her upwards. Among the six who had flown up together, she was the quickest. What kind of martial soul was that? It was truly an eye-opener from a flight martial soul academy. Finally, Han Yushang was somewhat more typical. The wings she unfurled resembled those of a colorful butterfly. With a soft flutter, she ascended elegantly. Indeed, all six were capable of flight! For soul masters with more than three rings, a hundred meters was merely a matter of a few breaths. As Tang Wulin and his team thrust forward fifty meters, Tang Wulin suddenly leaped, landing on his feet and using the momentum to heave a trailing Blue Silver Grass vine forcefully. Pulled by the Blue Silver Grass, a silhouette shot up like a missile, heading straight for the six from the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, who had already risen at least thirty meters into the air. It wasn't just him who stopped. Ye Xinglan and Xie Xie also ceased their advance, leaping towards Tang Wulin. He spread his arms, grabbing their waists, and his body began to spin on the spot. After three swift rotations, he flung them out, and both Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan ascended. Lacking flying martial souls themselves, they couldn't halt the ascent of their adversaries from a hundred meters away. However, they could intercept them mid-air before they reached an untouchable altitude. The one Tang Wulin first hurled into the air was none other than Xu Lizhi, whose robust figure was now coiled into a ball, resembling a meatball-shaped projectile, aimed towards Skyscraper War Eagle Gu Yue and his protectee, Zhang Xining. Control-type battle soul masters were always more challenging than assault-type counterparts, a fact Tang Wulin firmly believed in. That's why he sought to neutralize the control-type battle soul masters among the enemies first. Xie Xie, catapulted into the fray, aimed for Butterfly Wing Han Yushang, while Ye Xinglan targeted the opposing team's captain, the formidable Xiao Tian Tian. The trio dispersed in three directions, and just this act alone showcased Tang Wulin's immense strength and control prowess. A careful observation would reveal that although they were airborne, each of their waists was coiled with a Blue Silver Grass vine. Tang Wulin's position was right at the core of the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy. A barrage of fireballs erupted, each with a diameter of more than a foot, trailing brilliant tails of fire, bombarding Ye Zishu and Li Yaoyao. Tang Wulin's plan was simple. He aimed to block the opponents as quickly as possible, with Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan providing remote support from the ground, while he coordinated from the center, always ready to launch assaults. He did not anticipate defeating the opponents outright but intended to eliminate a portion of them. Next would be a war of attrition. Although flying soul masters held certain advantages over standard soul masters, the soul power expenditure while flying was significantly higher than that of a soul master standing on solid ground. Therefore, Tang Wulin was not daunted by the possibility of the opponents remaining high above, out of reach. The first engagement occurred on Xu Lizhi's front. He was the initial one propelled by Tang Wulin, and with the thrust of the momentum and Tang Wulin's formidable arm strength, he was unquestionably much faster than those who relied on wings to fly. Gu Yue had just reached his prescribed altitude when an enormous meatball-like figure from the opposition charged directly at him. Behind him, the first soul ring on Zhang Xining illuminated, and a piercing trill filled the air. His voice was truly melodious, enchanting, and lingering. His martial soul was the Hundred Spirits Bird, and as a flyer, he commanded his foes with his voice. His primary soul skill was deceleration—to weaken the opponent. Yet, his slowing ability had no immediate effect on Xu Lizhi. After all, Xu Lizhi wasn't flying through his power but was launched by Tang Wulin. Gu Yue, as a leading student of the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, reacted swiftly. His first soul ring lit up, and he flapped his wings vigorously forward, with dozens of eagle feathers transforming into arrows, targeting Xu Lizhi. In aerial combat, the skill to attack from a distance was essential, as it was easy for the combatants to create a gap between them. The eagle feathers sliced through the air, producing a series of 'pupu' sounds. Unfortunately for Gu Yue, what he was unaware of was that his opponent was from the Tang Sect. What was the cornerstone of the Tang Sect at its foundation? Hidden weapons! In mid-air, the previously balled-up Xu Lizhi suddenly stretched out, his hands forming a circle in front, his face still wearing a simple smile, his chubby palms glistening like jade. The eagle feathers, as though pulled into a vortex, converged inward and were effortlessly snatched in his hands. Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Seven: The Disparity Xu Lizhi extended his hands forward, transitioning from Dragon Grasp to Crane Control, as a volley of tenacious and sharp Eagle Feathers shot forth. Propelled by his rich soul power and amplified by the Tang Sect's secret technique, Celestial Flower Scatter, the feathers sped toward the Hundred Spirits Bird Soul Master, Zhang Xining, with even greater velocity than before. Meanwhile, Xu Lizhi had already reached Gu Tianming. Confronted with Xu Lizhi's towering presence, Gu Tianming realized he could no longer protect Zhang Xining. His second soul ring glowed, his Eagle Wings doubling in size in an attempt to intercept the Eagle Feathers while simultaneously preparing his second soul skill, Eagle Wing Strike! However, Xu Lizhi simply smiled and mockingly waved at him, halting his forward momentum mid-air as a burst of icy radiance shot forth like a myriad of frozen arrows, gracefully bypassing Gu Tianming, and homing in on Zhang Xining. This was Xu Lizhi's true lethal move; the initial Eagle Feathers were merely a clever feint. Before the Eagle Wing Strike could connect, Xu Lizhi swiftly retreated, his smile unwavering as he waved to Gu Tianming. It was too late for Gu Tianming to assist Zhang Xining. Although many of the Eagle Feathers were blocked, a few still reached their target. Zhang Xining, a pure controller with a sound-based martial soul, had nearly no offensive capabilities but unparalleled control powers. Caught off guard, he flapped his wings desperately to dodge but was still nicked by several feathers, leaving behind cuts. Just as he thought he had dodged the worst, a vast expanse of icy light appeared before him. Hundreds of steel needles, each imbued with dense soul power, covered all his possible escape routes. Inescapable! A sigh echoed in his ear, followed by a series of 'ding ding' sounds as he plummeted from the sky. "Zhang Xining, eliminated," Li Zhilong's voice was tinged with helplessness. However, there was no choice but to intervene. With just one exchange, they had lost a key control-type warrior with no flight-type soul master to counter. Shrek Academy, indeed a breeding ground for prodigies. Zhang Xining's face flushed with embarrassment, indignation filling his heart. But in the unforgiving arena of competition, discontent could not change the outcome. Xu Lizhi landed beside Tang Wulin, who used Crane Control to skillfully redirect the momentum and place Xu Lizhi by his side. Xu Lizhi's hand was already offering a restorative meat bun to Tang Wulin, who bit into it and quickly consumed it. Meanwhile, Xie Xie ascended, closing in on Han Yushang. Swift attack-types like him have an advantage over controllers, and once in close quarters, turning the tide was nearly impossible. Yet, Han Yushang remained unusually composed. Her second soul ring flared, but no visible change occurred. She seemed to manipulate unseen strings in front of her, then gently tapped her wings behind her. Xie Xie experienced a distorted reality, the world abruptly appearing in black and white, followed by the sensation of something shattering. Han Yushang seemed within reach, his Light Dragon Dagger slicing through air but only hitting an illusion. A faint pain on his shoulder, and he began to fall. To the observers, Xie Xie seemed to lash out inexplicably at thin air, while Han Yushang, with a tap of her Butterfly Wings, soared skyward. A chill ran down Tang Wulin's spine. Mental Control System! Xie Xie's errant strike could only mean he was ensnared by Han Yushang's illusion. She was more than a flight-type martial soul; she possessed a mental control-type martial soul as well. As Xie Xie fell, a dazzling burst of firelight erupted, not from a fireball by Gu Yue but from the swiftly ascending Li Yaoyao. It was challenging to discern the glow of her soul ring, but her entire form seemed to coil up in midair, then transformed into a meteor plummeting toward earth, targeting Xie Xie with incredible speed and fierce momentum. What kind of martial soul was this? A Meteorite? Xie Xie, a swift attack-type soul master, was vulnerable during his fall. Swift attack-types are known for their lower defenses. As Xie Xie began to fall, Li Yaoyao, having shattered one of Gu Yue's fireballs, charged at him. Their practiced synergy was evident. Tang Wulin's Blue Silver Grass wrapped around Xie Xie's waist, pulling him sideways through the air, narrowly evading Li Yaoyao's meteoric assault. Yet, Li Yaoyao did not relent in her descent; she continued her ferocious dive, with Tang Wulin now in her crosshairs. The linchpin of Shrek Academy's team was unmistakably Tang Wulin. Offensive Control System. Tang Wulin, seemingly oblivious to Li Yaoyao's approach, tugged on the Blue Silver Grass entwining Xie Xie's waist and shook it with force. Xie Xie's descent stopped abruptly, and as he was propelled back into the air, his target remained the Butterfly Soul Master, Han Yushang. Ye Xinglan and Xiao Tiantian clashed in the sky. Ye Xinglan, her form fused with her sword, shot towards Xiao Tiantian like a piercing cold star. Xiao Tiantian's body surged with starlight, his massive figure extending his wings to their fullest. With both hands, he shot a blinding dark-red fireball at Ye Xinglan, blocking her path. The Sword Deity Star shone, transforming into streams of golden light, akin to countless stars bursting forth. A soft golden aura enveloped Ye Xinglan, making the Circumpolar Constellation seem to brighten with her presence. The dark-red fireball disintegrated, and her sword's edge reached Xiao Tiantian in an instant. Xiao Tiantian was taken aback; he hadn't anticipated Ye Xinglan could also harness the Strength of Starlight for an attack, and it was clearly more in sync than his own. His third soul ring shimmered, and horns emerged from his forehead. A dark-red electric net exploded outwards from his center, turning him into a colossal electric sphere in a split second. "Ding!" The Star God Sword was deflected, and Ye Xinglan, with no leverage in the void, seemed set to fall. But at that moment, she lifted the Star God Sword, her third soul ring glowing. A dazzling light surged, and her body, defying gravity, shot upwards like a comet piercing the sky. Li Zhilong watched, somewhat dumbfounded. He recognized that Ye Xinglan's martial soul must be tied to the stars; without that connection, she couldn't manipulate starlight so fluidly. A foreboding feeling settled in. As Tang Wulin shook the Blue Silver Grass to help Xie Xie rise, Li Yaoyao, now a meteorite, was upon them. The thunderous momentum, her solid form, and the scorching flames highlighted her explosive attack power. Facing such a meteorite, Tang Wulin raised his right hand, golden scales surging, revealing the Golden Dragon Claw. Clasping his claw into a fist, the Force of Vitality within him surged in reverse, a golden radiance rising around him. This wasn't power borrowed from the starlight but the physical manifestation of his vitality swelling to its zenith. "Boom—" Tang Wulin stood firm, unyielding, as Li Yaoyao, transformed into a meteorite, halted abruptly before his fist. In that moment, time on the Astronomy Platform seemed to stand still. The violent roar captured everyone's attention. Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Eight: At This Moment, The Stars Shine Brightly Li Yaoyao's attacks were renowned for their ferocity, her Martial Soul being the extraordinary Meteorite. Although incapable of true flight, she could soar skyward with the propulsion of her Martial Soul's tail flame and plummet down with devastating force upon her foes. Each of her Soul Skills enhanced this method of attack. At her current strength as a Four-Ringed Soul Sect Leader, her full-powered impacts could exceed three thousand kilograms of force. Even if the initial strike didn't subdue her opponent, she could vault skyward for another onslaught, a tactic that instilled fear in her adversaries. Her defenses were as formidable as a meteorite's crust, making her the ace of their group, the omnipresent warrior capable of altering her trajectory mid-descent. However, against Tang Wulin, her prowess proved ineffectual; he didn't even attempt to evade. The severe collision left both warriors motionless. What was this anomaly? Li Zhilong moved closer, poised to assist either combatant should the need arise. In an instant, his pupils constricted. Centered around Tang Wulin's Golden Dragon Claw, minuscule fractures appeared on the Meteorite, quickly spreading to every inch. The Meteorite crumbled with a thunderous crash, and Li Yaoyao, with a delicate cry, collapsed from within its core. A tendril of Blue Silver Grass swiftly entwined her, binding her securely. Li Yaoyao's complexion turned ghostly pale, her body writhing in agony from the intense collision, yet the shock in her heart surpassed the physical trauma she endured. How was it possible? A single hand had stopped her mightiest blow! Tang Wulin shook his right hand, feeling a tingle of numbness—the impact was indeed formidable. He mused, 'Is that the best they can do?' Another one down! A second contender from Skyreach Starry Sky Academy had been defeated. Tang Wulin looked to the heavens as Ye Xinglan's third Soul Skill, the Stargod Sword's Descent, fell from above. Illuminated by the Circumpolar Constellation around the Astronomy Platform, her Starfall was akin to a meteor chasing the moon, the most powerful she had ever unleashed since Wulin had known her. The Strength of Starlight proved invaluable, especially in empowering allies. Xiao Tiantian's fourth Soul Ring ignited, and suddenly, his presence stilled, his face obscured, leaving only his blood-red eyes visible. An abyssal aura surrounded him. With a forceful motion, he drew a circle in midair, unleashing a surge of black energy that formed a vortex overhead. Starfall plunged into the vortex, which trembled violently. The next instant, Xiao Tiantian vanished, and Ye Xinglan with him. What had just happened? Was this a spatial technique? No, there were no fluctuations of spatial elemental energy. In the wake of Tang Wulin's shock, a dark red luminescence flashed, and Xiao Tiantian reemerged in the air, but Ye Xinglan was absent. What kind of Soul Skill was this? Xiao Tiantian spread his wings, diving rapidly, his form changing as he targeted Gu Yue. Clapping his hands into the void, a dark red glow erupted in front of Tang Wulin, resembling a black hole poised to devour him. Concurrently, countless green shadows descended from above—these were bamboo leaves, twisting and turning in the air, like arrows raining down, blanketing the field and obscuring Ye Zishu's figure. Amongst the multitude of bamboo leaves, seven shimmered with a golden hue, drawing in the surrounding starlight. His Martial Soul, the Seven Ingenious Star Bamboo, grew more versatile with each new Soul Ring, one such evolution being the gift of flight. The seven star-infused bamboo leaves were his most formidable attack, his fourth Soul Skill. The battle had only been underway for a short time, yet two of their team had already fallen. The six from Shrek Academy, though lesser in cultivation, each wielded a solid foundation and extraordinary combat prowess. Without unleashing their full power now, they would have no chance. Therefore, as Xiao Tiantian unleashed his power, so did he. Elsewhere on the battlefield, Gu Tianming, the Skyscraper War Eagle, spread his wings wide, hurtling towards Xie Xie in the sky and sheltering Han Yushang, the Butterfly Soul Master. Han Yushang's fourth Soul Ring lit up, her butterfly wings abruptly doubling in size, flapping mightily towards Tang Wulin. Butterfly Wings, the moniker of her fourth Soul Skill. Tang Wulin felt as though a Sea of Consciousness had materialized before him, its waves battering his mind with relentless intensity. This onslaught was no mere control; it was a formidable spiritual assault. He quickly realized that Han Yushang's spiritual power must have reached the Spirit Sea Realm, on par with Gu Yue's level. Since Tang Wulin's spiritual power had approached the Spirit Sea Realm threshold, it had ceased to progress. The Spirit Sea Realm was a monumental barrier in spiritual cultivation, and he had been tirelessly cultivating his Mysterious Heaven Technique, anticipating a breakthrough. He was certain that, by the time he unraveled the Golden Dragon King's Fourth Seal, he would also transcend into the Spirit Sea Realm. Presently, the immense spiritual waves that surged towards him caused his head to ache intensely, and Xiao Tiantian's assault was already imminent. A golden halo enveloped Tang Wulin, revealing the Golden Dragon Body. He was shrouded in a sheath of golden light, covered in expansive golden scales, etched with elaborate patterns, his vitality surging forth. He suddenly crouched down, hugging his knees, coiling into himself. Xie Xie's figure, ethereal in the sky, hurled his Light Dragon Dagger with a blinding slash of light, aiming for the Skyscraper War Eagle, Gu Tianming. His silhouette flickered incessantly in the void, dancing on air. Gu Tianming, thrown off by the elusive foe, managed to block the Light Dragon Dagger with his wing. Almost instantly, Xie Xie was upon him, and a burst of gold emerged from his underarm. Gu Tianming felt a tightening grip, ensnared in a golden snare. Xie Xie retracted his Light Dragon Dagger, repelling the winged assault, and with that force, he leaped upwards, executing an aerial somersault. His dagger traced radiant arcs, his form weaving in and out of existence. The golden radiance that bound Gu Tianming rapidly climbed, and as he grappled with Xie Xie's swift onslaught, he couldn't contend. Xie Xie's attacks were exceedingly fast, ghostlike in their precision, invariably striking where Gu Tianming was most vulnerable. The unyielding tempo left him breathless. Eventually, the golden radiance ensnared one of his wings, and Xie Xie, spinning in the air, commanded a Light Dragon Storm, overwhelming Gu Tianming as they descended from the heavens. After dispatching the Butterfly Wings at Tang Wulin, Han Yushang pivoted to assist Gu Tianming, but he was already under Xie Xie's control. She prepared a spiritual attack against Xie Xie when suddenly, a profound sense of peril emerged within her, her body plummeting abruptly. An unseen edge grazed by her. Han Yushang was startled. "Don't move!" A steady hand now encircled her waist from behind, a chilling breath on her neck. "Your spiritual power is strong, and I'm uncertain if I could withstand your spiritual assault. But I am certain of this—if I falter, I'm bound to leave some marks on your neck, or perhaps inadvertently, on your lovely face. So, let's descend calmly, shall we?" Han Yushang had never been so intimately close to anyone; her lovely face blushed with mortification, rendering her incapable of initiating any spiritual attack. Overwhelmed by a mix of anger and embarrassment, she could only gently beat her wings and descend. Xie Xie, through his sole efforts, had vanquished two more foes. Meanwhile, Tang Wulin remained coiled, weathering the storm of attacks. The bamboo leaves descended, targeting Tang Wulin, Gu Yue, Xu Lizhi, and Xu Xiaoyan, who had remained still but was bathed in resplendent golden light. The seven golden leaves, hidden among the throng, each zeroed in on their targets. Gu Yue remained composed as a tempest erupted around her, deflecting the bamboo leaves. A glint of silver, and she evaded Xiao Tiantian's lunge, reappearing beside Xu Xiaoyan. As for Xu Lizhi, being in Tang Wulin's proximity, she assumed he required no additional protection. As Gu Yue was about to unleash her abilities to safeguard Xu Xiaoyan, she detected a peculiar energy fluctuation and spun around in astonishment, only to hear Xu Xiaoyan's soft voice. "Stars, shine in all your splendor!" Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-Nine: Stellar Mutation The Starwheel Ice Staff, gleaming with captivating brilliance, was raised high above Xu Xiaoyan's head. In an instant, countless beams of starlight burst forth. The intense starlight, in harmony with the Zhou Tian Xing Dou, swiftly filled the Stargazing Platform. Every bamboo leaf vanished beneath the radiant starlight, leaving behind only seven golden bamboo leaves suspended midair, motionless. It wasn't just the leaves; Xiao Tiantian, who had missed his mark, Ye Zishu still aloft, Gu Tianming, grounded by Xie Xie's Golden Words Entwining, and Han Yushang, the Butterfly Soul Master descending with Xie Xie's Shadow Clone, were all enveloped in golden light. The figures in the sky, in the next moment, descended rapidly, transitioning to a free fall. Those on the ground found themselves completely immobilized. For that brief instant, the entire world seemed bathed in gold. Xu Xiaoyan, shrouded in starlight, appeared like a goddess incarnate, with flecks of golden light weaving a breathtaking radiance around her. A pattern, identical to the one on the top of her Starwheel Ice Staff, had mysteriously appeared on her forehead. As the starlight shone with commanding presence, the light seemed to soften, as if in acknowledgment of its sovereign. The patterns of the entire Stargazing Platform's formation lit up, the stars in the heavens regained their brilliance, and a deluge of starlight madly surged toward her. Xu Xiaoyan, light as a feather, floated upward, with the starlight converging rapidly toward her. Tang Wulin, having regained his footing, was rendered speechless by the sight. He didn't forget to move forward, subduing the golden Xiao Tiantian with a swift motion, and catching Ye Zishu with a tendril of Blue Silver Grass to prevent him from harm as he descended from the sky. Xie Xie's Shadow Clone, with Han Yushang in tow, rolled on the ground to cushion their landing, standing firm. They, too, looked up at the strange phenomenon unfolding above. Everyone could sense it—Xu Xiaoyan's essence was transforming, undergoing a fundamental change. Martial Soul Mutation! Indeed, only such a mutation could trigger these intense energy flares and the spectacle unfolding before them. Moreover, her current state indicated a positive change, a remarkably beneficial one. Li Zhilong stood stunned; such a turn of events in the match was beyond his expectations. Even without Xu Xiaoyan's outburst, the match's outcome was clear. Neither Xiao Tiantian's attacks nor Han Yushang's psychic strikes had inflicted significant damage on Tang Wulin. In terms of endurance, Tang Wulin was unmatched among all present. Having withstood even Yuanen Yehui's powerful assaults, the current skirmish seemed trivial by comparison. The talents from the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, though strong with their four-ring capabilities, were not a match for Yuanen Yehui. If Yuanen were here, he could have single-handedly crushed the entire opposing team. The Stargazing Platform, which Tang Wulin had feared, ended up being the catalyst for Xu Xiaoyan's transformation. Flickers of light danced across the sky as Ye Xinglan reemerged, suspended in the air. Bathed in starlight, her form radiated a golden glow, with the Stargod Sword in her grasp shining with a splendor akin to the stars themselves. She was absorbing the starlight, albeit in smaller amounts compared to Xu Xiaoyan, and her body gently descended to the earth. She sat down cross-legged on the ground and began to meditate. Opportunities like this were fleeting, and the students of Shrek Academy never lacked the acumen to seize them. The golden hues on the students from the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy slowly faded, restoring their mobility. They, too, were shaken by what they had witnessed. The match no longer needed to continue; the outcome was clear. Tang Wulin turned to Li Zhilong, who was still in a daze, and approached quickly, whispering, "Senior, regarding this..." Li Zhilong snapped back to reality, asking instinctively, "Your classmate, her Martial Soul—it's tied to starlight?" Tang Wulin nodded. Li Zhilong inhaled sharply. "I've never seen a soul master so in tune with starlight. This is truly..." He longed to say how fortunate it would be if she were a student at their academy. His years at Skyreach Starry Sky Academy had given him a deep understanding of the Stargazing Platform, and he knew that this baptism of starlight, whatever mutation it triggered, would surely bring immense benefits to Xu Xiaoyan. A talent of her magnitude was undoubtedly a prodigy! To nurture such an individual would bring unparalleled enhancement to the entire Skyreach Starry Sky Academy. But it was clear that this was not possible; she hailed from Shrek. Tang Wulin said, "Senior, could you perhaps not interrupt the stellar display? Xiaoyan's condition..." "Of course!" Li Zhilong interrupted, stating firmly, "Even though she's not our student, this once-in-a-lifetime event is a fortunate encounter for her and an opportunity for us. We will record this data for posterity; it will be invaluable for the study of starlight. Don't worry. Starlight is infinite; let her absorb it." Turning to the six students from the Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, he commanded, "You too should pay close attention to the shifts in starlight, and see if you can glean any insights from it." "Yes!" Xiao Tiantian and his peers answered respectfully. Their spirits, however, had taken a hit. As the outstanding young talents of Skyreach Starry Sky Academy, they had always held themselves in high esteem. Reaching a six-ring cultivation before twenty, with three specializing in control, they had been unrivaled in competitions throughout Sky Destiny City and its neighboring cities. Xiao Tiantian’s Demon King Martial Soul was particularly formidable. But today, they had been thoroughly outmatched by a younger Shrek Academy with an average cultivation one ring lower, and without even a single flying soul master on their side. It was a gap that lay at the very foundation of their strength. How could they not feel disheartened? The starlight absorption lasted for more than an hour before Xu Xiaoyan's figure gently landed on the ground. Radiant points of light emerged on her skin, each one shimmering like a star in the night sky. Tang Wulin, using his spiritual power, estimated the number of these points—around three hundred and sixty-five. Xu Xiaoyan sat cross-legged, activating the Mysterious Heaven Technique, with the three hundred and sixty-five golden spots on her flickering intermittently. Her Starwheel Ice Staff, standing tall beside her, had turned completely golden, especially the starwheel at the top, which now seemed ethereal, as if it bore the imprint of the Zhou Tian Xing Dou, giving one the sensation of looking up at the starry sky. Her Martial Soul had undoubtedly evolved, especially the starwheel. The oscillations of soul power around Xu Xiaoyan had not increased significantly, but the aura she exuded was one of purified essence. In the embrace of the starlight, her entire being seemed to become translucent, marvelously peculiar. Xu Xiaoyan had always been the weakest link in the team, managing to contribute only through the control of her Starwheel Ice Staff at night and the recent ability to use her first soul ring's Starwheel Chains during the day. Now, it seemed she had truly ascended. The Zhou Tian Xing Dou gradually returned to normal, and the glow of the Stargazing Platform dimmed. The starlight on Xu Xiaoyan, as if absorbed back into her, quietly vanished. Her already beautiful visage now glowed with a lustrous sheen, subtly twinkling like the light of a gem. Drawing a deep breath, Xu Xiaoyan slowly opened her eyes to find every gaze in the vicinity focused on her, causing her pretty face to blush with a delicate touch of rose. Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty: Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy 'How do you feel?' Tang Wulin inquired. Xu Xiaoyan furrowed her brow, 'It's rather peculiar, difficult to articulate.' Tang Wulin could discern from her gaze; it wasn't that she found it indescribable, she simply preferred not to discuss it in the current setting. 'Senior, we regret the inconvenience today. Now that Xiaoyan has recovered, we shall take our leave,' Tang Wulin conveyed to Li Senior. Li Zhilong looked to Xu Xiaoyan, 'Junior, your experience was quite unusual, and we've captured everything for analysis. Could you provide a Soul-Guided Communication Device Number for ongoing dialogue?' 'Of course.' Having benefited from their assistance, Xu Xiaoyan naturally would not decline such a request, leaving behind her Soul-Guided Communication Device Number. Naturally, this would be relevant once they reclaimed their Soul-Guided Communication Devices from the academy. Presently, all devices were in the academy's custody. Stealthily departing Destiny Skyreach Soul Master Academy, they got into their vehicle. Xie Xie steered towards the next city. 'That sparring session with the academy proved beneficial,' Tang Wulin reflected. 'It genuinely facilitates our development. Moving forward, we must adopt a more tactful approach in the next city.' Gu Yue mused, 'Will luck grace us once more in the future? This time was pure serendipity, encountering a Shrek Academy graduate.' Tang Wulin chuckled, pulling out a piece of paper from his pocket. 'Before we departed, I sought advice from Senior Li. Our academy's alumni are cherished everywhere. Which institution wouldn't desire a teacher from Shrek? Senior Li provided a list of academies within the cities ahead, with Shrek graduates and their contacts. Armed with this, we can arrange sparring sessions well in advance.' 'Is that possible...?' Gu Yue stared at him, astonished. Xu Xiaoyan also commented, 'Captain, had you anticipated this strategy? It's ingenious. Had we known, we would have initiated with this method.' Tang Wulin inquired, 'Xiaoyan, your martial soul has mutated, correct? What sensations do you have?' Xu Xiaoyan appeared bemused, 'Indeed, it has mutated. Who could have imagined the presence of such immense astral force? At first, I was perplexed, but as that vast astral force merged with my martial soul, it seemed to rapidly mature, akin to an awakening.' 'If I'm not mistaken, my original martial soul was immature, perhaps flawed. That's why my capabilities varied between day and night. While my cultivation would slowly compensate for this defect, it would persist and possibly cause greater issues later. This astral absorption has mended these imperfections and cleansed my martial soul, enhancing its refinement.' 'Why then do I sense your soul power hasn't significantly increased after absorbing so much astral force?' Tang Wulin pondered. Xu Xiaoyan wore an odd look, 'With gain comes loss. My martial soul has been replenished, but in the process, some elements were lost. My Starwheel Staff should be renamed simply as Star Staff. The ice attribute has been eradicated by the astral force, leaving only the pristine Starwheel.' Tang Wulin was stunned, 'Is that plausible? So, you've lost all your ice-attribute soul skills?' Xu Xiaoyan nodded. Gu Yue questioned, 'With the transformation of your Starwheel Staff, have your soul skills evolved?' Xu Xiaoyan smiled, 'Certainly. Otherwise, it would have been a net loss. With my martial soul's evolution, my soul skills have naturally advanced. All three have undergone notable changes. I'll demonstrate them in our next clash. Like the captain, I've evolved into an Offensive Control type.' Tang Wulin gave a thumbs up, noting that Xu Xiaoyan seemed far more self-assured after the evolution. 'Xinglan, and you? You also absorbed some astral force, right? Your thoughts?' Ye Xinglan smiled faintly, 'My martial soul resonates well with astral force, yet is quite stable. As a result, my soul power alone has elevated. I have reached level forty.' Level forty! This revelation caused even Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi to whirl around. Xu Lizhi beamed with joy, 'Sister Xinglan, congratulations for achieving level forty!' Ye Xinglan acknowledged the sentiment with a gentle nod. With Ye Xinglan attaining level forty, she merely needed to fuse a new soul spirit and secure her fourth soul ring to ascend to the Soul Ancestor realm. She was the first among the sextet to reach this level. Given her innate talent and the might of the Stargod Sword, her overall strength at level forty would scarcely be lesser than Yuanen Yehui's. Tang Wulin directed Xie Xie, 'Let's not rush onto the expressway; we should find a place to purchase Soul-Guided Communication Devices.' The single purpose of acquiring a communication device was clear. 'Greetings, is this Senior Zhang from Shrek Academy? We are from Shrek Academy...' As Tang Wulin had professed, Shrek's influence was extensive, and alumni looked after their juniors. Additionally, the presence of distinguished students from Shrek for knowledge exchange and sparring was beneficial for these academies as well. In the subsequent days, their journey proceeded without a hitch, engaging in two exchanges daily and successfully concluding the ninth task of the final exam. Just one more, and they could pass this final exam and return to their academy. 'Why are there no seniors from our academy at Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy? Aren't they ranked among the continent's elite institutions? Why is that?' Xu Xiaoyan queried with curiosity. Tang Wulin clarified, 'From what I've learned from the previous academy's senior, Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy was once decimated, and our academy was implicated. Since then, their antagonism has persisted. Thus, Sun-Moon Royal is the sole academy that rejects Shrek graduates as instructors. Similarly, our seniors are disinclined to assume positions here. Although they don't compare to Shrek, Sun-Moon's enmity towards us has never waned.' Xie Xie proposed, 'Should we still opt for this academy? I've heard about Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy; their nurtured elites are also quite formidable. Many of the Federation's high-ranking officials are alumni. Perhaps we should contemplate an alternative?' Tang Wulin's smile was composed, his eyes sparkling, 'What's our examination's purpose? The academy stripped us of all possessions, sending us on this trial. It's not merely about completing the exam; it's about obtaining meaningful growth. Do we lack confidence?' Xie Xie's gaze hardened, and he flashed a thumbs-up to Tang Wulin. Xu Xiaoyan was eager, 'In the previous bouts, I have yet to truly perform.' Ye Xinglan remarked calmly, 'Indeed, we have yet to showcase our abilities.' Gu Yue glanced at Tang Wulin, 'This is the final confrontation, isn't it?' Tang Wulin and she shared a glance, his face breaking into a smile. Against an archenemy, victory was the sole option. 'Victory yields additional points.' Suddenly, a cool voice echoed within the vehicle, startling everyone. 'Wu Zhangkong?' Tang Wulin exclaimed, then spotted Wu Zhangkong outside the window. Wu Zhangkong, as if sauntering through the void, glided effortlessly alongside their swiftly moving car, his voice emanating from within. Tang Wulin's lips twitched, 'Wu Zhangkong, can you hear our conversation?' Wu Zhangkong peered through the window at him and nodded. 'You represent Shrek's honor. Having chosen Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, failure is unacceptable. I will accompany you as the team's instructor.' A teacher-led exchange competition certainly presented a far more formal affair. Tang Wulin ventured, 'What's the incentive for victory?' Wu Zhangkong replied, 'Win, and each of you will receive full marks, plus an extra ten points. That is to say, you may distribute fifty additional points amongst others.' 'A deal it is!' Tang Wulin agreed without hesitation. Such a score would ensure the attainment of his goal. An additional three hundred points among the six could significantly assist many classmates. Wu Zhangkong's tone was even, 'Lose, and all prior efforts turn futile. You will all fail outright.' 'That harsh?' Tang Wulin was flabbergasted. Wu Zhangkong elaborated, 'The feud between the academies is more severe than you imagine. Hence, should you lose, I too shall tender my resignation, accepting responsibility.' Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-One: The Unyielding Teacher Wu This wasn't just about being tough on us; Teacher Wu was equally stringent with himself! Tang Wulin started to doubt whether deciding to challenge the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had been the right choice. The pressure was truly immense. Mingdu! The most technologically advanced city on the Douluo Continent, Mingdu stands proudly in the western part of the continent, embodying the very heart of the entire West. Upon entering Mingdu's boundaries, Tang Wulin and his companions encountered a sight rarely seen elsewhere. "Is that a flying car? A high-altitude flying car?" Xu Xiaoyan exclaimed, pointing at an object soaring in the sky. "Precisely. The high-altitude flying cars are still in the trial phase. As the Federation's most important technological hub, Mingdu is at the forefront of these groundbreaking tests," Xie Xie confirmed, his eyes filled with wonderment. As the flow of traffic began to constrict, they noticed something unusual ahead. Dozens of mech armors—gargantuan suits designed for combat—were patrolling the highway exit, though their exact purpose remained veiled by distance. "They're not conducting identity checks, are they?" Xie Xie suddenly voiced his concern, anxiety creeping into his voice. His words sent a ripple of apprehension through the group. They each possessed an identity card, a metallic card imprinted with their personal information. Although, before departing the academy, these had been confiscated. An epiphany struck Tang Wulin. "The academy's plan must have been to send us to Mingdu for our final stop. This... The tests truly are ubiquitous. No wonder our identity cards were seized." "So, what's the plan?" Xu Lizhi turned to him, his expression fraught with worry. Should they be checked and found without identity cards, intense questioning would surely follow. Tang Wulin had no idea what might unfold next. They had never been in such a predicament before, nor had they faced such scrutiny in any other city they had passed through. Gauging the distance to the highway exit, Tang Wulin instructed Xie Xie, "Drive the car to the side." Xie Xie, who had recently honed his driving skills, adeptly maneuvered the soul-guided vehicle to the edge of the highway. "Abandon the car?" Xie Xie queried. "Could Teacher Wu present our identity cards for us? He was just following us, wasn't he?" While speaking, he glanced out the window, only to confront a stark reality. Teacher Wu Zhangkong was nowhere to be seen. "Never mind, wrong guess," Tang Wulin muttered before turning to Gu Yue. "Prepare to do what we discussed..." Nearing the highway exit, where officials were indeed verifying the identity cards of all travelers, Gu Yue made her move. With a flash of silver light, Gu Yue vanished from the vehicle, reappearing moments later dozens of meters away in mid-air. With an elegant gesture, she summoned a massive, three-meter-wide Fireball, which shot into the sky. Its rising form resembled a radiant morning sun, increasing in size and trailing a tail of flames as it climbed. The spectacle drew the immediate attention of both the passing vehicles and the patrolling mech armors. Several units ascended to locate Gu Yue, but their focus was largely captured by the expanding Fireball. The team's vehicle discreetly pulled to the side, and as they watched, the Fireball detonated in the sky with a resounding explosion, scattering a cascade of sparks that resembled the most magnificent fireworks. Gu Yue's aim was to make the Fireball as imposing in appearance as possible, with little emphasis on its destructive power. The doors opened, and six silhouettes exited stealthily. They refrained from fleeing immediately; by this time, numerous soul-guided vehicles had halted to observe the aerial display. Tang Wulin scanned the area and commanded in a hushed tone, "Go!" They vaulted over the guardrails with ease and sprinted into the distance, swiftly disappearing into a cluster of buildings adjacent to the highway. Only then did the alarm sound from the direction of the highway. Tang Wulin, leading Xu Lizhi, with Ye Xinglan guiding Xu Xiaoyan, and the Agile Steamed Bun, along with Gu Yue's wind element aid, made a hasty retreat. After a lengthy sprint covering several kilometers, they boarded a bus headed for central Mingdu, finally allowing themselves to relax. Their youthful appearance, being only thirteen or fourteen years of age, made them less likely to draw attention. Tang Wulin purchased bus tickets and handed them out to his companions. That's when he spotted a familiar countenance. Teacher Wu Zhangkong was seated at the back of the bus, gazing out the window, seemingly lost in contemplation. Tang Wulin approached and took a seat beside him. "Can we now head directly to the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy? Please, let's not wander any further. Lead the way," Tang Wulin pleaded. Teacher Wu Zhangkong glanced at him and remarked, "Your reaction was commendable." A sheepish grin spread across Tang Wulin's face, but it quickly dissolved when Teacher Wu Zhangkong added his next comment. "You're usually so frugal. Losing two vehicles must hurt, doesn't it?" Three strands of exasperation fell from Tang Wulin's forehead. Of course, it hurt. But what could be done? It was all a result of the academy's exacting final exam. Teacher Wu Zhangkong offered no further comment and closed his eyes, seemingly to meditate. Tang Wulin couldn't help but inwardly grumble about the academy's rigorous comprehensive training. With Teacher Wu Zhangkong present, there was no need to rush. They would disembark when he did. Moreover, Teacher Wu Zhangkong had assured them that victory over their opponents in the impending exchange match with the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy would earn them a perfect score on the final exam, with additional points to boot. The architectural style of Mingdu starkly contrasted with that of Shrek City. Whereas Shrek City harmonized classical and modern elements, exuding a cultural aura, Mingdu was a pure high-tech steel jungle. Gigantic buildings with distinctive designs and features stood shoulder to shoulder, many so bizarre and eye-catching they demanded attention. Certainly, Mingdu was immense, its streets teeming with activity. Even after an hour-long bus ride, they only felt like they had penetrated a section of the steel jungle, with no idea of their precise location within Mingdu. Teacher Wu Zhangkong rose, exited the bus, and the six students quickly followed suit. Passersby surged past, a testament to the city's unrelenting pace. Teacher Wu Zhangkong led them toward a particular direction, and at a bus station, they boarded another bus. The students promptly followed. After switching buses thrice, Tang Wulin felt as if they were still ensnared within an endless metal forest. Mingdu might not rival Shrek City in sheer size, but in terms of building density and population, it unquestionably surpassed it. "I dislike this place; it's too hectic, too claustrophobic," Xu Xiaoyan voiced her discomfort, her lips pursed in displeasure. "I concur, it's excessively bustling," Xie Xie chimed in, ruffling his hair. As they conversed, a towering building ahead captured their gaze. Emblazoned at its peak were the prominent characters: Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. The structure, a veritable metal fortress, with adjunct buildings radiating from its core and merging with three other towers, constituted an impressive complex. Was this truly an institute of learning? Was the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy really such a place? Tang Wulin glanced at Teacher Wu Zhangkong, contemplating whether to inquire if they should proceed directly or if Teacher Wu Zhangkong would formally request a sparring match using his Shrek official identity. Before he could articulate his thoughts, Teacher Wu Zhangkong had already advanced toward the building. Standing before the structure, a device materialized in Teacher Wu Zhangkong's hand with a flicker of light— a soul guidance loudspeaker. Without a moment to gather their thoughts, he pressed a button, raised the device to his lips, and projected his voice toward the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy's imposing edifice. "Hear this, students of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy! We six hail from Shrek Academy, our average age a mere fourteen. We challenge your finest under twenty. Our arrival serves a single purpose—to demonstrate to you the chasm that lies between you and the continent's paramount academy." Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-Two: Is Such Ruthlessness Necessary? The chilling voice boomed like rolling thunder, audible throughout the surrounding streets. In Wu Zhangkong's hands was none other than a Soul Guidance Loudspeaker! Having spoken his piece, he pressed a button and handed the loudspeaker to Tang Wulin. 'Teacher Wu, do you have to be so merciless?' Tang Wulin sighed. Wu Zhangkong replied coolly, 'Is a perfect score that easy to obtain?' Before Tang Wulin could argue, the loudspeaker in his hand came to life again, 'Hear this, students of Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. We are a group of six from Shrek Academy with an average age of fourteen. We challenge your strongest under twenty to demonstrate the chasm between your academy and the continent's finest.' So, the loudspeaker has a recording function... And then, Wu Zhangkong vanished into thin air... A solitary gust swept by, tinged with melancholy! Teacher Wu, what about leading us? What about the trust between teacher and student? The Soul Guidance Loudspeaker sounded once more, and Xie Xie looked at Tang Wulin, 'It seems we've been set up.' Xu Xiaoyan swallowed hard, 'Is this the legendary extra without extra charge? A perfect score isn't easily earned!' Ye Xinglan clenched her fists, 'Then let's fight. If it were me, I'd shout the same challenge.' Next to Ye Xinglan, Xu Lizhi raised his plump hand, 'I agree!' Gu Yue moved next to Tang Wulin, examining the Soul Guidance Loudspeaker, 'It seems nothing incorrect was said.' Tang Wulin sighed, 'I want to give Teacher Wu a nickname - how about 'Pit King'? He finally found the switch on the loudspeaker and turned off the device that had been broadcasting their challenge four times over. Within minutes, they drew a crowd. Students and staff from Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, as well as passersby, had gathered around. A blond middle-aged man emerged from the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy building, his face grim as he watched Tang Wulin turn off the loudspeaker. 'Shrek Academy?' The middle-aged man stepped forward, his face stern as he inquired. Tang Wulin stored the loudspeaker in the ring given by his master, 'We come from class one, grade one of the Shrek Academy outer court.' 'You're here to challenge us? Very well. Follow me.' The man stated, as a powerful aura surged around him. It was sharp, piercing the heavens, making the onlookers feel as though they might be torn apart. The crowd was shocked. 'Disperse. Those who wish to know the outcome, watch the large screen for the live broadcast shortly.' With that, the middle-aged man retracted his aura and headed back inside. Was it truly that straightforward? Tang Wulin glanced at his peers, a sense of foreboding settling over him. The power radiating from this individual was clearly beyond their capacity; he might indeed be on the same level as Teacher Wu. Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, with its renowned reputation on the continent, ranked just below Shrek Academy. As Wu Zhangkong had indicated, a perfect score was indeed hard to come by! But no matter what, they had no retreat. The pressure intensified; they were representing not just themselves but also Shrek Academy. Around the corner, Wu Zhangkong stood silently, observing Tang Wulin and the group follow the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy staff member inside. His face remained expressionless, but the corners of his mouth lifted slightly. The upcoming battle would be their true test. Upon entering the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, Tang Wulin felt as though he had stepped into a high-tech factory. Metal was everywhere; in the center of the grand hall, a massive metal sphere rotated silently, brimming with potent soul guidance energy. Its soft light rendered the hall luminous and inviting. The reception area appeared more like that of a corporate headquarters than an academy. The sleek metal desk glistened with cloud-like patterns. Clearly, this was a rare metal, a testament to opulence. If only he had brought his forging hammer, Tang Wulin might have been tempted to refine it right there and then. The middle-aged man remained silent, leading them onwards. As they passed the reception, two beautiful attendants stood and bowed respectfully. Various individuals of differing ages were present in the hall, most in the white uniforms of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. Their gazes towards Tang Wulin's group were curious, yet tinged with rejection and malice. It seemed the welcoming atmosphere Shrek Academy enjoyed elsewhere did not extend to this place. Here, they were viewed as formidable adversaries. Had these students been indoctrinated? Tang Wulin silently mused while discreetly observing his surroundings. Now, his only hope was that the upcoming contest would be fair. If not, the academy could easily set a trap for them with its profound resources. The elevator, expansive and immaculately white, ascended swiftly and smoothly. The middle-aged man kept his silence, and Tang Wulin's group exchanged glances, all maintaining composure. The elevator halted on the sixteenth floor, and the middle-aged man led them out, Tang Wulin and the others in tow. They arrived at a room that resembled a conference hall. 'Sit,' the middle-aged man commanded, dispensing with any pleasantries. Tang Wulin had braced for this; they had come to stir the pot and were prepared for whatever came their way. It would have been strange indeed if the academy had received them warmly. Teacher Wu, you truly are the 'Pit King'. 'So, you've come to issue a challenge?' The middle-aged man seemed to seek confirmation once again from Tang Wulin. Tang Wulin nodded, 'A sparring match, if you will.' 'Very well. In a moment, we will provide you with a space to select your opponents. We at Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy will not take advantage of your youth. State your ages.' Tang Wulin let out a quiet sigh of relief. Facing opponents of the same age, they had no fear. 'We average fourteen years,' Tang Wulin declared. The middle-aged man's eyes narrowed, 'Excellent, our representatives will be no older than fifteen. Their ages will essentially match yours. However, there are two things you should be aware of. First, this match will be witnessed by our entire academy. Second, it will be broadcast across all major screens within Mingdu City.' Tang Wulin's heart steeled, 'Isn't that a bit excessive for a simple private sparring match?' he inquired. The middle-aged man replied flatly, 'It is necessary! If you win, it will be an incentive for our entire student body. If you lose, we will have the opportunity to severely strike at Shrek's reputation. So, it is essential.' Such deep-seated animosity, such intensity. Only now did Tang Wulin grasp the full extent of why Teacher Wu had chosen this particular method for their challenge. The rivalry between the two academies was far fiercer than they had imagined. But the path was set; there was no turning back, and this was a battle they couldn't afford to lose. 'Very well!' Tang Wulin's reply was a single, resolute word. 'Wait here.' The middle-aged man stood and left, leaving Tang Wulin and his six companions alone in the conference room. Gu Yue was about to speak, but Tang Wulin signaled for silence, 'Let's adjust our states and prepare for the battle ahead.' They were in enemy territory, and for all they knew, listening devices could be present. Too much talk could lead to trouble. No words needed, let our battle speak, then we shall depart. Gu Yue quickly caught on to his intent, and all six sat cross-legged on the chairs, entering a meditative state, each tuning their condition. Unbeknownst to them, their arrival had set the entire Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy in motion. Within an hour, promotions for the upcoming match had spread across Mingdu and the Federation. Half an hour after Tang Wulin and his group arrived, the Sun-Moon Television Station announced it would broadcast the battle live across all Federation cities. The clash was proclaimed as the 'Soul Master World's Youth Summit Battle.' On the street, Wu Zhangkong watched the large screen on the building, listening to the announcement echoing down the streets, his eyes slightly narrowed. Just then, his soul guidance communicator came to life. 'What's all this about?' Shen Yi's voice came through, tinged with surprise. Wu Zhangkong responded calmly, 'Nothing much. The kids have issued a challenge at the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. I simply lit the fuse to their courage.' Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-Three: Flaunting Their Might Shen Yi's voice carried a solemn weight. 'This matter is quite serious! Senior Brother, why didn't you inform us earlier? The academy is now at a disadvantage. The Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy's promotional campaign is massive, and the entire city of Mingdu, along with neighboring cities, is abuzz. The news has even spread throughout the Federation. If we lose this match, the blow to our academy's reputation will be colossal. Have you considered these repercussions?' Wu Zhangkong replied, 'I understand my disciples, which is why I made this decision. It's under great pressure that their potential is best unleashed. If they lose, I will take responsibility for the defeat and resign. However, if they win, I am convinced they will be worthy to challenge the present generation of the Shrek Seven Monsters. I have faith in them to uphold the academy's honor with their utmost effort, and I trust in my students.' After a moment's reflection, Shen Yi replied, 'Alright, I'll consult with the academy on their stance and get back to you.' Five minutes later, the Soul-Guided Communication Device rang once more. 'Elder Cai has given you the go-ahead. The outcome is secondary; win or lose, the priority is to return those young talents unscathed. They are the future's hope. Also, Elder Cai mentioned...' 'What did she say?' Wu Zhangkong asked, intrigued. Shen Yi continued, 'Elder Cai said she would actually prefer to see Tang Wulin and the others lose the match. Sometimes, defeat is not necessarily detrimental.' Wu Zhangkong asserted with conviction, 'Failure can indeed be the mother of success, but only through continuous victories and building unyielding momentum can one ascend to the pinnacle of success. I believe they will emerge victorious in this match.' Shen Yi affirmed, 'Understood, the academy will also make arrangements. Just ensure their safety.' Inside the conference room of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. Tang Wulin opened his eyes, glancing at the wall clock and frowning slightly. Two hours had passed since they had been left waiting, with no word from the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy about the match. Were they intentionally leaving them to stew? Through meditation, he had achieved a state of peak readiness. As Wu Zhangkong had stated, the pressure had honed his mental sharpness, leaving him feeling like an inexhaustible force. His teammates concluded their meditation in succession. 'No news yet? Shall we go out and inquire?' Xie Xie asked Tang Wulin. 'Let's wait a little longer,' Tang Wulin suggested. 'Since they invited us here, I doubt they'll just leave us sidelined. Perhaps they need time for preparations or to select our opponents. Let's be patient.' As they spoke, the conference room door swung open, and the middle-aged man from earlier entered once again. 'The stage is set, and the Great Soul Fighting Arena awaits our valorous clash. Do you need more time to prepare?' 'We are ready as well,' declared Tang Wulin. 'Then, please follow me.' The middle-aged man, devoid of any intention to introduce himself or inquire about their names, turned and led the way. Following him into the elevator, they ascended directly to the thirty-sixth floor before transferring to another elevator, which moved laterally before descending. After a two-minute descent, the doors opened to a stone chamber that replaced the metallic confines they had become accustomed to. The ancient stones seemed to pulse with a strange energy. Once inside, Tang Wulin and his companions felt their soul power slightly boiling, as if the environment was enhancing their ability to wield it. The man remained silent, guiding them through the expansive stone space, until they reached a grand hall. The ceiling was adorned with a stunning fresco depicting a narrative: a youth sat in a plaza surrounded by individuals clad in the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy uniforms, distinctly more archaic than their present garb. Among them, a youth stood out, donned in the unmistakable uniform of Shrek Academy, drawing Tang Wulin's gaze with a peculiar sense of familiarity. Who could this be? There was something about that Shrek Academy youth that seemed oddly recognizable to Tang Wulin. On one side of the hall stood a massive archway formed by two doors, each towering over fifteen meters and stretching thirty meters wide, easily accommodating a mech's passage. 'This is the waiting area for the Great Soul Fighting Arena. You will be summoned to enter for the match,' the middle-aged man informed them, gesturing towards the stone benches where they could sit and wait. Was the waiting area always this grand? Tang Wulin had assumed this was their battlefield. He could vaguely hear the distant commotion outside, not quite discernible, yet he was certain of its existence. The atmosphere of the forthcoming match was suffocating with anticipation. In the past two hours, the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy must have executed extensive preparations. The man made his way to a side door, and just as he left, the previously muted noise from outside exploded into a cacophony. A wave of sound surged through the hall, catching Tang Wulin and his team off guard. A rousing voice boomed, 'Shrek Academy has come to provoke us; will we stand for this? Fellow students of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, let's rally behind our contenders. We shall have Shrek's delegation retreat in defeat. We shall proclaim to the continent that we are the supreme academy.' Was this... the ambiance of the competition venue? Amidst the provocative rhetoric, the clamor of cheering, jeering, and assorted cries filled the air. 'Is this their way of flaunting their might?' Gu Yue's eyes narrowed. 'It seems they want to impose some pressure on us. Everyone, stay calm,' counseled Tang Wulin. Xie Xie scoffed, 'Pressure? How much does that weigh?' Xu Xiaoyan, brimming with excitement, said, 'Looks like there's quite a crowd. To unveil my evolved martial soul before so many, do you think I might have a chance to join the inner court?' 'My Stargod Sword is eager for action!' Ye Xinglan declared with a hint of eagerness. Xie Xie laughed, 'Eager for action doesn't quite sound right coming from a lady, does it?' 'Do you wish for death?' Two voices chimed in unison. Besides Ye Xinglan, the other was Xu Lizhi, who then promptly stuffed a gigantic steamed bun into Xie Xie's mouth, effectively silencing him. Xie Xie ducked behind Tang Wulin, removed the bun, and said with an exaggerated tremble, 'Captain, I'm genuinely terrified here.' Tang Wulin rolled his eyes, 'Your acting skills need work. Xinglan, I swear I don't know him. If you feel like teaching him a lesson, I'll assist you in holding him down.' Ye Xinglan snorted, 'I'll remember this. We'll settle it later. Wulin, let's strategize.' A gleam sparked in Tang Wulin's eyes as he nodded. Gu Yue raised her hands, summoning an ice-blue halo at her feet that gradually formed into a dome, enveloping the six of them in an isolated sanctuary, silent and cut off from the world outside. After ten minutes, 'The match is about to commence; please prepare to make your entrance,' a detached voice announced. The ice dome didn't shatter but seamlessly melted away from the top, its water constituents evaporating into the air. Observing the vanishing ice dome, the middle-aged man's eyes shifted, reflecting silent acknowledgment of their impressive control. Before them, the towering doors gradually parted, and the already intense noise from before swelled into a tumultuous roar as an exuberant atmosphere engulfed them. Beyond the archway, a world of blinding brightness awaited, beckoning them to step forward. The middle-aged man led the way to the threshold. Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-Four: Entering the Arena Tang Wulin strode confidently forward, taking the lead with his head held high, followed by his teammates Gu Yue, Ye Xinglan, Xie Xie, Xu Xiaoyan, and Xu Lizhi. Chests puffed out with pride, they were no longer just individuals or students completing their final exams, but warriors battling for the glory of Shrek Academy! It was only upon their entrance into the vastness of the Great Soul Dueling Arena that they could grasp the sheer magnitude of the structure. Not even within the esteemed walls of Shrek Academy existed an edifice of such scale. Fashioned after the ancient colosseums, the arena’s diameter spanned over a staggering one thousand five hundred meters, with stands that could house an audience exceeding one hundred and fifty thousand spectators. Tang Wulin was certain – this had to be the largest stadium across all of Douluo Continent. It likely served as the central hub encircled by the towering structures of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. The stands, though not filled to capacity, were bustling with life, occupied by at least sixty to seventy percent of its volume. These were not solely academy members; the crowd was too large, its origins enigmatic. Upon the central chairman’s stand, Tang Wulin could sense several imposing auras, as heavy and immovable as mountains, their focus intently fixed upon the six newly emerged competitors. When Tang Wulin and his comrades stepped into the heart of the Great Soul Dueling Arena, the cacophony of the crowd abated abruptly, and in that brief moment, they became the sole focus of over a hundred thousand pairs of eyes. Despite their steely composure, the weight of such attention was a formidable pressure to bear. Xu Xiaoyan and Xu Lizhi were visibly affected, a pallor creeping onto their faces. Each spectator's aura, unique and palpable, created an almost tangible pressure when combined, challenging the competitors' mental fortitude and resolve on a profound level. The scenario was proving to be more challenging than they had initially anticipated. With a deep breath, Tang Wulin's right foot stamped forward assertively, triggering a radiant ring of golden light to erupt from beneath him. In that moment, centered upon his being, a potent wave of blood qi surged forth. Though invisible to the eye, it wrapped protectively around his allies. Bathed in the tumultuous tide of Wulin's blood qi, the others found respite from the pressure; the external noise diminished, and, more crucially, their dampened spirits began to rise again under the fiery embrace of Wulin's blood qi. Atop the chairman's stand, a senior elder squinted, "Golden soul rings? Such rarity. Could it be... a million-year spirit beast? Impossible! Not even the Soul Transmission Tower boasts such ancient creatures. In our recorded history, sightings of million-year spirit beasts are scarce, a mere one or two occurrences at most." "Yet, each instance seems to intertwine with Shrek Academy," the middle-aged man beside the elder commented, his brows knitted in concern. "Keep vigilant," the elder instructed firmly. "Understood!" As the onlookers noted the golden soul rings manifesting around him, and his frame seemingly expanded, the hostile tension in the spectator seats lessened slightly. However, it was not long before the jeering and cursing resumed, now amplified. Tang Wulin paid no heed to the crowd, continuing his march toward the arena's epicenter with unyielding determination. It was there that he spotted six individuals already standing in wait. Adorned in the pristine white uniforms of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, they certainly appeared to be peers in age to Wulin's own team. Besides these six, another figure loomed overhead, a middle-aged man clad in a suit of Battle Armor that exuded the splendor of a Three-Word Battle Armor Master. Was he the referee, or was his presence another tactic to exert pressure? This was their first encounter with such a grand spectacle, and while it was natural to feel a hint of nervousness, Tang Wulin thrived under such conditions. His teammates often joked that he was like a coiled spring; the greater the pressure applied, the more forceful his rebound. Clad not in their academy uniforms but in the vibrant dark green of Shrek Academy's tracksuits, they faced their opponents with poised readiness. "Now, the rules of the match will be announced," the middle-aged man hovering above declared with a commanding tone. "What?" Tang Wulin gestured, indicating that he couldn't hear. "I said the rules of the match will now be announced!" the middle-aged man repeated, his voice tinged with soul power. "What are you saying? I can't hear a thing! It's far too noisy here. Maybe spray some insecticide to quiet down the flies?" Though Tang Wulin feigned an inability to hear, his voice was loud and clear, amplified by soul power. While it didn't reach the entire arena, the venue's sound system captured and broadcasted his words. "Activate the protective shield," the middle-aged man ordered, his expression darkening. A dome of white, translucent energy slowly ascended, forming a barrier that solidified high above at a hundred meters. This shield not only acted as a physical barrier but also muffled the ambient sounds, bringing an abrupt stillness to the arena. "Can you hear clearly now?" he asked Tang Wulin, his gaze icy. Tang Wulin nodded, then theatrically extracted wads of paper from each ear, declaring, "The world has quieted down." His teammates followed suit, each removing their own earplugs, prompting a visible twitch in the middle-aged man's facial muscles. Were it not for the thousands of eyes upon them, he might have descended to give them a piece of his mind. This spectacle was not just for those present; it was being broadcast across the continent to every soul guidance television station possible. The intent was to amplify the grandeur of the event. All previous preparations were designed to impose pressure on these students from Shrek. At an average age of just fourteen, their youthful nature was immutable. If they could be daunted, the chances of victory for his side would increase significantly. What he hadn't anticipated was Tang Wulin's unconventional approach. A simple act of pulling out earplugs had incited the crowd, provoking a symphony of outrage that, regrettably, was now silenced by the protective shield. To those watching the match on soul guidance television without bias, or those who favored Shrek Academy, the sight elicited laughter. Shrek Academy truly had cultivated a handful of treasures. "The competition rules will now be announced," the middle-aged man stated once more. "Go ahead," Tang Wulin responded, this time with feigned compliance. "This match is primarily a sparring exercise. However, to ensure both parties can fully exhibit their capabilities, I will only intervene as referee to stop the match or to declare a disqualification if there is a threat of severe injury, disability, or death. Victory will be determined by which side retains combatants after the complete incapacitation of the opposing team. Is that clear?" "So, as long as we don't kill them, anything goes, and there are no other limits, right?" Tang Wulin clarified, with a hint of mischief in his tone. Across from him, the six opponents glared, their anger palpable. Yet, restrained by the hovering referee's authority, they remained silent. "You can interpret it that way," the middle-aged man replied coolly, his eyes flashing with an unspoken warning. Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-Five: No More Jokes Tang Wulin spoke, "Before we commence, may I be granted a few words?" The middle-aged man replied, "Speak your mind." Given the multitude of eyes upon them, disallowing Tang Wulin's request would seem discourteous. Tang Wulin began, "Firstly, while we hail from Shrek Academy, we approached this challenge out of admiration for the esteemed strength of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. Having only joined Shrek for a single term, we hardly stand as its delegates. Thus, we are here as individuals. It's only fair to mention, within the hallowed halls of Shrek, we're but the least among our peers, not fitting emissaries of the academy's caliber." The middle-aged man stood aghast. Neither he nor the upper echelon of Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had foreseen such words from this youth! They had orchestrated an elaborate setup, poised for a victory they were confident would elevate their academy's prestige while dealing a crushing blow to Shrek. Tang Wulin's declaration, however, that they were mere novices and not official representatives, meant that even a victory would be devoid of its intended glory. And should they face defeat, the disgrace would be intensified. The middle-aged man, barely containing his wrath as he hovered above, descended to confront Tang Wulin. "Did you not previously assert yourselves as emissaries of Shrek Academy in this friendly contest?" he demanded, his voice laced with anger. Tang Wulin exhaled deeply, a flicker of light in his hand revealing the soul-amplifying device. Pressing the button, Wu Zhangkong's voice emerged, resounding across the venue, "Heed this, pupils of Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. We six, average age fourteen from Shrek Academy, challenge your most formidable under twenty. Our intent is not to represent, but to manifest the chasm between your institution and the continent’s apex academy." "This declaration does not once imply our participation as Shrek Academy's envoys! It merely acknowledges our association with Shrek Academy, our mean age, followed by a challenge. To display the gap. But the mantle we bear is our own!" The middle-aged man seemed on the verge of an eruption. "After all the preparations, this is your ploy? This is outright..." Could children of merely fourteen conceive such a brazen scheme? Despite longstanding rivalry, Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had never doubted Shrek's might and dignity. Upon Tang Wulin and his cohort's arrival, they had mobilized their strongest warriors, eager to diminish Shrek's renown. They hadn't anticipated that their full-force strike would feel akin to hitting a tuft of cotton. The middle-aged man longed to confront Shrek's newfound impudence but resisted. Denigrating Shrek Academy was not a venture he dared entertain. Tang Wulin blinked with feigned innocence, "Shall we then proceed with the bout? Should you opt for surrender, we could dispense with the formalities." The middle-aged man, adorned in his Three-Word Battle Armor—a testament to a stature akin to a Title Douluo—radiated with pent-up might. Annihilating Tang Wulin and his companions would be as trivial as flexing a finger. "Enough with the frivolity. We stand before you as Shrek Academy's chosen. For the glory of Shrek, we shall engage in battle and seize victory!" Just as the middle-aged man verged on his wit's end, Tang Wulin's demeanor transformed abruptly, his voice resonating with the conviction of their pledge. The middle-aged man stilled, a breath of relief escaping him. Thankfully, the young ones refrained from prolonging their charade. The illustrious Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy could not be perceived as afflicting mere children. "Prepare for the commencement of the match," he declared, ascending once again. "Additionally, while we do represent the academy, my prior statement stands firm: we indeed rank amongst the most modest at Shrek," Tang Wulin asserted. The middle-aged man, ascending, swayed, nearly tumbling from the heavens. Tang Wulin offered a subtle smile and stepped forward, addressing his adversaries, "I am Tang Wulin, of Shrek Academy’s outer court, first-year class one." He deliberately neglected his title as class leader; the first-year outer court was indeed the most basic tier. Tang Wulin's recent words had significantly dampened the audience's fervor for Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. The confidence of his opponents appeared shaken. "Long Chen!" The vanguard of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, Long Chen, stood with an air of unyielding resolve, his youthful visage contrasting his impressive stature. As Tang Wulin spoke earlier, Long Chen was the single Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy member whose expression remained steadfast, his composure unshaken. Tang Wulin quipped, "Considering your stature, surely you haven't surpassed twenty years? Victory would be void if that were the case." Long Chen cast him a frigid glance, "I hope your prowess matches the agility of your tongue." Gu Yue moved to Tang Wulin's side, "Gu Yue from the outer court's first-year class one, Shrek Academy." Another figure, a female, advanced next to Long Chen, "Xue Liushuang!" Her beauty was striking, her form graceful, standing next to Long Chen, they appeared quite the match. Though Tang Wulin surpassed Long Chen in attractiveness and build, he lacked Long Chen's towering height. Xue Liushuang's gaze did not rest on Gu Yue but fixated on Tang Wulin, her curiosity evident. "Ye Xinglan." Ye Xinglan took her stance beside Tang Wulin. Another from Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy approached, "You Dingqi!" His physique was average in height, yet robust, with broad shoulders and muscular arms that bespoke his strength. "Xie Xie!" "Xu Xiaoyan!" "Xu Lizhi!" The remaining Shrek trio announced themselves together. Their counterparts followed suit. "Jian Mochen!" A plump youth, his girth rivaling that of Xu Lizhi. "Kuang Zhantian!" An imposing girl exuding a powerful spirit! Her petite stature and rebellious gaze belied the boldness of her name. Tang Wulin almost suggested that with such uniqueness, she would thrive at Shrek Academy. "Weng Daimin!" The final introduction came from a gentle girl with blue hair cascading to her shoulders, her innocence palpable. Six against six. Unlike their prior academy challenges, neither group divulged their soul master types, sharing only their names. "Both teams, retreat and prepare for the contest. Withdraw to a distance of one hundred meters," the middle-aged man aloft commanded, his voice steady once more. Whatever the outcome, narrative threads would be plentiful post-battle. Even if Tang Wulin's team later disavowed representing the academy, it would be too late—they were Shrek Academy students, in essence and in truth. The teams gradually retreated, and Tang Wulin's previously nonchalant expression shifted to one of solemn concentration. The adversaries, seemingly equal in age, each radiated a unique aura. On their home ground, they would indeed be formidable. Vigilance and caution were of the essence. As they backed away, their triangular battle formation emerged. Long Chen stood at the forefront, the brawny You Dingqi and the stout Jian Mochen at his sides. Could they be agility-type soul masters? Behind them were Xue Liushuang, Weng Daimin, and Kuang Zhantian, arrayed in a line, with Weng Daimin at the center. Weng Daimin's positioning suggested she was likely a control-type soul master, while the roles of Xue Liushuang and Kuang Zhantian remained enigmatic. Once the hundred-meter gap was established, they faced each other, poised for engagement. "The contest, commence!" Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty-Six: The Battle Begins With the middle-aged man's thunderous shout, the clash representing the might of two elite academies—and the culmination of Tang Wulin and his team's final exams—finally erupted. This time, Tang Wulin didn't rush headlong into the fray; instead, he and his comrades summoned their martial souls in unison. A multitude of purple soul rings, emblems of their advanced cultivation, ascended majestically, with Wulin's own trio of rings shimmering conspicuously. Their opponents from the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy were quick to respond, calling forth their martial souls as well. Long Chen moved forward, his stature rising by three inches as four soul rings spiraled up from beneath him—each one a regal purple, indicative of a four-ringed Soul Sect Leader. Long Chen's impressive display of four purple soul rings could easily rival that of Wu Siduo, a fellow prodigy on the young geniuses roster, who was known for her twin martial soul and soul fusion skill. Yet here stood Long Chen, with a seeming single martial soul, but with a rank approaching Wu Siduo's—a clear testament to his formidable strength. He was undoubtedly the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy's trump card in this age bracket. Beside Long Chen, Jian Mochen and You Dingqi each revealed their martial souls. You Dingqi's soul weapon was not a mere hammer but a meteor hammer, distinguished by its short handle and the long chain that coiled around his arm—three purple soul rings graced his presence, signifying an extraordinary soul master, though he lacked a fourth. Jian Mochen, with two yellow and two purple soul rings, manifested a large round shield as his martial soul. The shield, adorned with intricate patterns resembling a tiger's head, was large enough to shield his robust figure entirely, marking him as a defensive soul master. Among the three women in their rear, Xue Liushuang displayed four purple soul rings, Weng Daimin had three, and Kuang Zhantian also bore three purple soul rings. Within this sextet, three were four-ringed Soul Sect Leaders—a force that could easily stand toe-to-toe with the young prodigies of their class. Wulin inwardly commended their formidable strength. As he did, he considered that their prowess might only extend so far. The six selected by Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy were undeniably talented, but Wulin believed that if they were to face Wu Siduo and her quintet, the outcome would be far from certain—even though his own team had triumphed over Wu Siduo and her allies. This generation of Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy students did indeed wield impressive strength; however, they likely lacked an in-depth understanding of Shrek Academy. This cohort of Shrek Academy's outer court freshmen could only be described as 'brilliantly exceptional.' Unbeknownst to Tang Wulin, after Shrek Academy completed its enrollment, Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had acquired some information. They were aware that five prodigies from the roster of young talents had become part of this generation at Shrek Academy, although that was the extent of their knowledge. While Tang Wulin and his team were preparing earlier, Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had conducted their investigation; among their six, none were listed among the young talents. Therefore, their conviction in a forthcoming victory was not unfounded. Long Chen's left foot pressed against the earth, propelling him forward and leading the charge towards Tang Wulin's team. His second soul ring glimmered, heralding a resonant Dragon's Roar. His second soul skill, Dragon's Roar, sent powerful waves echoing around him, a faint golden silhouette appearing as if a mighty dragon was stirring. A dominant aura of light burst forth without restraint. His martial soul, the Radiant Holy Dragon—Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy's ace of aces! Proclaimed as the most promising of his generation to become a Four-Word Battle Armor Master, he was truly a child of the heavens. Once Long Chen saw that none among Shrek Academy's six had four soul rings, he felt certain of the modesty Wulin had claimed earlier. Long Chen was acutely aware that this match was being live broadcast with countless eyes upon them. This was his moment to shine, to rise to prominence on the backs of Shrek Academy's students, and to establish his standing in the soul master realm. 'Hehe,' Tang Wulin chuckled, a sentiment echoed by his comrades. Wulin gestured with his hand, signaling that there was no need for the others to advance, and with a light tap of his toes, moved to meet Long Chen. His approach was unassuming, lacking the oppressive air of his opponent. Wulin's three purple soul rings withdrew, and the golden halo that once awed the crowd reemerged, with golden scales unfurling across his skin. 'Roar!' The intensity of Long Chen's Dragon's Roar grew louder. In a one-on-one clash, his trio of rings challenged Long Chen's quartet, and Long Chen's martial soul was the illustrious Radiant Holy Dragon. Excitement surged within Long Chen's heart. To defeat the opposing leader in a one-on-one confrontation was the optimal moment to demonstrate his prowess. As the distance between them closed, Long Chen felt something amiss. His adversary seemed impervious to his Dragon's Roar; his eyes were radiant, and the look he directed at Long Chen was suffused with an inexplicable sense of pity. Pity for what? The gap between them closed in the blink of an eye, and Tang Wulin too ascended, his golden soul ring radiating as he rose. The Reverse Blood Qi Circulation technique activated, unleashing the formidable presence of the Golden Dragon King from within him. Long Chen's foot struck the ground, propelling him skyward, his arms outstretched, activating his first soul skill, Dragon Claw! He harbored no trace of underestimation towards Tang Wulin. Renowned as the foremost genius of the younger generation from Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, he was composed and substantial, never taking an adversary lightly. Aware of his potential to dominate his rival, he gave his all. As the light from his first soul ring shone, the fourth illuminated as well, demonstrating a soul master's adeptness at soul ring manipulation. His fourth soul skill, Dragon's Force, channeled the mighty power of the Radiant Holy Dragon bloodline throughout his body. His dragon claws glimmered with brilliant gold, and a layer of embryonic scales now veiled his skin. While not true dragon scales, they hinted at their emerging form. His intent was to deliver a decisive blow, to vanquish Tang Wulin outright, and with their morale at its peak, to then overwhelm the rest of Shrek Academy's students. At that moment, even if they claimed not to be the strongest from Shrek Academy, they were still its students! With such a resounding defeat, what more could be said? However, at that critical moment, Tang Wulin's aura erupted. Their auras were destined to converge before their bodies clashed. In that fleeting instance, Long Chen was besieged by an indescribable terror that welled up from the deepest recesses of his heart. How could this be? How could he possibly be afraid? Overwhelmed with confusion, yet the reality was inescapably before him. It felt as if something had seized his heart, sending tremors through his blood vessels. Before him, Tang Wulin, who had also taken to the skies, seemed to grow ever more imposing, and Long Chen felt as if he was diminishing in his shadow. The strength of the Dragon Claw waned rapidly; he gritted his teeth, driving his soul power, striving to quell his quaking. But against his will, Wulin's aura was so overpowering that Long Chen's Dragon's Force crumbled. Dragon's Force was meant to enhance the aura of his Radiant Holy Dragon bloodline. But at that moment, his bloodline's aura was suppressed, and even the effects of the soul skill were forced back. This was the chasm between bloodlines, and it was precisely the manifestation of the Golden Dragon King bloodline's formidable power that Tang Wulin wielded.
Chapter 449: The Neighbor's Dog After inspecting the house and finding no issues, they were close to finalizing the purchase. Nanfeng would discuss the rest with the real estate agent and the former owner. Juanmao was overjoyed today, totally getting a kick out of its day out. Nanfeng chuckled, 'Juanmao, don't worry. Next time, you can move in and play all you like. You’ll get to swim in the sea and meet plenty of little fish and shrimp—how fun!' After a swim and being called to shore by Fang Zhao, Juanmao dug in the sand for a while. As they left, it gazed out the car window, clearly not ready to leave. Happy, Juanmao lay in the car, dreaming about its future happy life. Juanmao's impression of the ocean? An endless seafood buffet that doesn't cost a dime. Its cheer lasted until it got back to the Advanced Students' dorm. Once Nanfeng and the crew had left, Fang Zhao closed the door and called, 'Juanmao, come here.' Juanmao scampered over, tail wagging like crazy. 'Had fun today?' Fang Zhao asked. 'Woof!' 'Did you enjoy it there?' Fang Zhao probed again. Juanmao leapt up and barked again, tail going wild. 'Speak.' 'Fun!' Juanmao said. It was now switching languages with ease and sounded pretty slick. 'Alright,' Fang Zhao nodded and fired up the Study Machine. Juanmao: '...' Its ears twitched, and it reluctantly stepped back, trying to be sneaky. Ignoring its retreat, Fang Zhao turned on the Study Machine and showed it a new folder. Inside were e-books— Marine Environmental Protection Law Youth Environmental Protection Knowledge Series Marine Wildlife Conservation List Marine Environment Management One Hundred Marine Facts for the New Century The Sea, My Home ... Twenty marine-related books in total. There weren't just e-books, but also twenty sets of tests. Juanmao: '...' Its ears, once perked up, now drooped. 'You're a quick reader, even quicker now, right? Finish all twenty books here and ace all the tests, then you can hit the sea. We'll be moving in less than two weeks,' Fang Zhao said. With Juanmao's memory and smarts, acing these tests would be a breeze. Fang Zhao wasn't worried about Juanmao in the sea; he was more concerned about Juanmao eating endangered species into oblivion. How big was Juanmao's stomach, really? Fang Zhao still had no clue. During their stint on Bur Star, Juanmao had sneaked a few bites here and there, but it had been cautious because of Fang Zhao's warnings. Their time on Bur Star was short, and with Fang Zhao watching and others around, Juanmao couldn't go all out. But at their new home, Juanmao would have the sea at its doorstep every day. Without rules, it might as well be an invasive species, upsetting the marine balance. Fang Zhao needed to teach Juanmao a thing or two. The ocean life had bounced back, and it couldn't be wrecked by one dog. No perfect scores, no sea; stick with the Study Machine! That day, Nanfeng came by to chat about the new place's renovation with Fang Zhao. Walking into the dorm, he saw Juanmao in timeout, looking downhearted with tear stains under its eyes. Pausing, Nanfeng looked away and went to talk business with Fang Zhao. Juanmao's sulking? Standard stuff. Nanfeng was now unfazed by it. After talking shop, Nanfeng remembered the online buzz and mentioned it, 'Boss, did you catch the buzz about today's internet craze?' 'What's up?' Fang Zhao had been buried in his paper all day, with notifications set to silent, so he was out of the loop. 'Heard about Will's painting?' asked Nanfeng. 'Yeah, the one about his graduation piece?' Fang Zhao had seen Will's show and given it an A+. One of the pieces, titled 'The Neighbor's Dog,' featured Juanmao. With the show over two days ago and Fang Zhao occupied with writing since the morning, he was oblivious to the stir online. Nanfeng filled him in. After the show, the academy put Will's art on their website, which got everyone talking. Will had nailed his goal for the year—first to paint Fang Zhao, then his dog. The first goal was done and dusted a while back, and Will's 'My Neighbor' had already made waves online, with some joking that Will made Fang Zhao look alien. Now, 'The Neighbor's Dog,' following in 'My Neighbor's' footsteps, was trending again. 'The Neighbor's Dog' was Will's most time-consuming and painstaking work during his advanced studies, and his favorite to boot. The vibe of this painting was similar to 'My Neighbor,' but it was trickier to get. 'My Neighbor' at least looked human, but 'The Neighbor's Dog' didn't even resemble a dog, let alone a pet. Without the title, no one would guess it was a dog at all. With its lively colors and a mysterious, majestic air, it seemed otherworldly yet somehow fitting. The more you thought about it, the more you felt a shiver down your spine. 'Is Fang Zhao's dog that scary?' a Huangyi student wondered after seeing the painting, remembering the little curly-haired dog from campus and double-checking online. Those at Huangyi who had heard Fang Zhao's concert and analyzed Will's painting closely had their own thoughts. 'Putting it into words, this painting gives off the same vibes as Fang Zhao's 'Eta.' It's a bit beyond normal folks' grasp.' Even people who didn't get art, standing there looking at it for a sec, would feel something powerful, a chill running through them. The net was buzzing. 'Post-study, Will's let his imagination fly free, to places we can't follow.' 'What beef must he have to show Fang Zhao's dog like that?' 'If you missed Will's earlier work, check how he painted Fang Zhao in 'My Neighbor.'' 'What if Will's got some doggy trauma, to paint it so frighteningly? Turned a cutie into a creature!' 'That's art for you!' 'Artist's world—truly beyond us mere mortals.' 'No joke—I stared at that painting for a good five minutes, still couldn't figure it out, but felt it was something special, with a weird vibe that stuck around.' 'This deep kind of art needs a lot of looking into.' 'Wouldn't be easy to sell this painting, right?' 'Works as a charm to ward off evil at home, if nothing else.' 'It's a smart buy. Will's got potential, he's going places.' Once Will's art hit the school's website, folks were quick to offer to buy. In the end, a Muzhou collector shelled out far more than Huangyi's estimate to snag 'The Neighbor's Dog.' Some thought the Muzhou collector was too hot for Juanmao. Muzhounese seem to lose their cool over Juanmao. Others called it hype, either for Will the artist or for Fang Zhao's dog. Muzhounese's way with dogs? Kinda hard to get, like they'd lost their marbles. Reacting, Huangzhou TV's Art Channel snagged an interview with the big spender. During the chat, the Muzhou collector said, 'Lots buy Will's work thinking about the artist, not the art. I'm different; I see the art, and especially the dog in it. I've got this feeling, this piece is gonna be worth a fortune someday.' Xiong, tuning into the live interview, mused, 'Muzhounese got some wild dog sense. Humans, you're something else.' Thanks to Will's 'The Neighbor's Dog,' Juanmao was now a hot topic and even made the news in Huangzhou. After Nanfeng left, Fang Zhao skimmed the news and told Juanmao, 'Better stay inside for a bit. Stand for five more minutes, then back to the books. You only scored 62 this morning. Go over the animal protection stuff again! Whales aren't for snacking! And corals are a no-go!' Chapter 450: Moving Day Juanmao dedicated an additional two days to memorizing the Marine Environmental Protection Law and the Marine Wildlife Conservation List, reinforcing his knowledge with videos and images to deepen his understanding. He delved into materials from both the old and new centuries, ensuring the appearances and behaviors of these species were etched in his memory. Driven by the desire to freely swim in the ocean, Juanmao pushed himself to the limit. The last time he had exerted such effort was to acquire his own Study Machine. His test scores gradually improved from barely passing to the seventies and eighties, and finally to the nineties. With one final effort to solidify his recollection, he was poised for success. Nanfeng had suspected that being confined due to incidents on the net and the inability to stroll would affect Juanmao's mood. Contrary to expectations, the dog's zest only intensified by the day, impervious to the constraints. Fang Zhao concluded his supplementary tasks at Huangzhou Art Academy, and after the remaining advanced students completed their evaluations, the academy organized a graduation ceremony for those who successfully finished the Huangyi Twelve Rhythms Advanced Course, awarding certificates. The ceremony was straightforward—those who conquered the Twelve Rhythms were hardly average students and inclined towards academia, making elaborate ceremonies unnecessary. Held in Huangyi's top academic auditorium, Elder Master Fang, present among the audience, beamed with pride as he captured Fang Zhao's momentous occasion on stage with numerous photos and videos, later shared with peers and in retirement group chats. Post-ceremony, Elder Master Fang eagerly approached Fang Zhao. 'Let me have a look,' he said, examining the certificate radiating with an auric sheen, grinning so broadly his teeth seemed in danger of falling out. After snapping several high-resolution photos from different angles, Elder Master Fang returned the certificate to Fang Zhao. 'Take care to keep this safe; ensure it doesn't end up as a dog's chew toy. One of our retiree's great-grandchildren had his new diploma torn apart by a dog. It was beyond repair,' Elder Master Fang remarked, casting a glance at Juanmao. Juanmao returned a gaze filled with wide-eyed innocence, as though he had been wrongfully accused. Elder Master Fang then turned back to Fang Zhao, advising, 'In any case, make sure it's well-protected.' How many could claim possession of a Twelve Rhythms Advanced Course certificate annually? It was an esteemed accolade, typically a precursor to mastery. Within the retiree association of Yanbei City, no other family had this honor. Content with the graduation photos, Elder Master Fang was ready to depart. Their stay in Huangzhou had been lengthy, and it was time to return home. Before departing, Elder Master Fang gazed at his courteous and gentle great-grandson, then admonished Yan Biao and Zuo Yu with a note of worry. 'You absolutely must ensure Fang Zhao's safety! Nowadays, there's an abundance of crazed fans, and rivals resort to underhanded tricks. Fang Zhao is simply too kind-hearted, too trusting, oblivious to the maliciousness of others.' Yan Biao and Zuo Yu: '......' Do they recall the events of Fang Zhao's year of service? Do they know the origins of his Reserve Officer title? Are they aware of how he dominates in gaming?! What thickness of rose-colored glasses must one wear to utter such statements, or has age led to selective amnesia, erasing certain pivotal events? Yet, perhaps Fang Zhao does appear much gentler now? Could this be the refinement imparted by art? Regardless of their internal musings, Yan Biao and Zuo Yu could only firmly assure Elder Master Fang, 'Yes, we'll ensure his safety!' After one final photograph with Fang Zhao, Elder Master Fang departed, content. Once Fang Zhao settled into his new abode and found leisure, Elder Master Fang intended to visit. With academic endeavors momentarily paused and the advanced students preparing to depart, they were slated to present at an Academic Conference Report at Huangyi, catering primarily to students. This event was less formal and severe than typical Academic Conference Reports. The Student Union even opened a live stream, allowing those unable to attend in person to watch online. Fang Zhao generously shared his expertise; he disclosed every insight and technique amassed during his year of in-depth studies. The Academic Conference Report spanned two hours, but the ensuing Q&A and autograph session went on for four. Some suggested that Fang Zhao should remain at the academy. Given his current prowess and accolades, he was more than equipped to serve as a lecturer at Huangyi. 'How wonderful it would be if Fang Zhao could stay at Huangyi,' a student lamented. But soon, they realized that while Fang Zhao the individual had moved on, his teachings persisted in their exam questions... Following a year of advanced studies and his departure from Huangyi, Fang Zhao organized his affairs in Yanzhou before relocating. The weather was idyllic for the move from the center of Qi'an City in Yanzhou to the seaside. Perhaps detecting the proximity of the sea, 'Bunny'—referred to as 'Curly' in the original translation but corrected to match the glossary—exhibited exceptional vigor today, actively engaging with the aquarium, its 'ears' keen to probe beyond. Fang Zhao had ordered a more expansive aquarium, transferring 'Bunny' from the compact travel tank to the generous new environment. Acclimating to its new residence, 'Bunny' navigated the tank, mimicking a buoyant, animated marshmallow puff. This seemingly adorable marshmallow puff nearly brought about calamity for two would-be burglars. A faultless disguise. The truly dangerous ones are not just those decked in vivid hues but also those with a deceptive allure. The most elated about the move was undoubtedly Juanmao. He had achieved his test objectives the day prior to the move, and since dawn, he had been bustling with activity, urging Fang Zhao to proceed with the relocation. As the collection shelf was stocked, ensuring no gaming helmet was missed, Juanmao desired to secure his Study Machine alongside them, but Fang Zhao intervened. 'We'll still be utilizing the Study Machine,' Fang Zhao stated. Juanmao emitted two mournful barks, his tail drooping as he retreated. Yet, his spirits swiftly rebounded, and he eagerly anticipated inspecting his new dominion. Zuo Yu maintained a grip on the leash. Dogs possess a robust territorial instinct, and staking claim to space is inherent in their nature. The new domicile provided a larger territory, and Juanmao surveyed it with sheer joy, periodically howling to signal his presence to the other neighborhood dogs. From this day forward, this was his home! As Fang Zhao concluded organizing his possessions, evening had descended. He dispatched Yan Biao and the others home, granting them a couple of days off. After their departure, Juanmao, who had been reclining by the door, trotted over. 'I wish to swim in the ocean,' Juanmao spoke. 'Is it solely for swimming?' Fang Zhao inquired. '...perhaps a little foraging as well,' Juanmao cautiously confessed, gauging Fang Zhao's reaction. 'I'm famished.' Throughout his tenure at Huangyi, Juanmao's diet was stringently regulated—he often felt famished, only managing to covertly find extra sustenance when accompanied by Fang Zhao. This year had indeed been one of scarcity for him. Fang Zhao had taken note of Juanmao's increasing hunger. His dietary preferences were broadening. Foods previously ignored now piqued his interest, as though he was evaluating their edibility. On one occasion in the vehicle, his intense sniffing led Nanfeng to suspect tampering, promptly sending the car for inspection. Ultimately, other than some inexplicable scratches, the car was unscathed. When Fang Zhao later inquired, Juanmao revealed he had been ravenous at the time and had detected the scent of food. Juanmao was aware of what was consumable and what was not; even with novel items, he could ascertain their edibility. Previously, the opportunity to eat at will was non-existent; now, with a new home and an exceptional chance to indulge, Juanmao had no intention of missing out, unwilling to wait any longer. He had been patient all day, waiting for Nanfeng and the rest to depart before proposing a foraging excursion. Fang Zhao reviewed the weather forecast—clear skies were predicted in the coming days. Since Juanmao had satisfied the testing criteria and responded to several supplementary questions with precision and speed, Fang Zhao felt it was permissible to grant him a bit of freedom. Daytime outings risked attracting attention; the coastal area was frequented by residents, and Fang Zhao had observed a group setting out on a yacht for a fishing expedition earlier in the day. Juanmao's nighttime foray was perfect. 'You may proceed,' Fang Zhao consented. 'I intend to venture further out to seek sustenance, awoo,' Juanmao added. 'I shall return before eight in the morning.' He yearned to savor a little more time. After brief contemplation, Fang Zhao acquiesced. 'Heed any meteorological shifts, circumvent vessels, and promptly retreat if anomalies arise.' 'Affirmative!' 'Recollect, protected species are forbidden!' 'I shan't engage with them! Absolutely not!' 'And refrain from indiscriminate consumption!' 'I shall not partake haphazardly!' Juanmao pledged. 'Embark then.' Endowed with Fang Zhao's endorsement, Juanmao dashed forth and, shielded by the veil of night, delved into the embracing sea. Chapter 451: Gone Without a Trace! Fang Zhao gazed out at the sea's horizon, setting the dog leash atop the cabinet near the doorway. This marked the first instance of Juanmao reveling in unbridled freedom, and Fang Zhao harbored a tinge of unease. He could not perpetually surveil Juanmao. Following an extensive regimen of training, he was poised to gauge Juanmao's self-sufficiency. The outcome of this solo excursion would shape Fang Zhao's future decisions. Juanmao was no ordinary pet concern. Fang Zhao had unwaveringly maintained stringent oversight; devoid of direction, Juanmao had the potential to transform into a lethal instrument wielded by those with malicious intent. The morality of a weapon is dictated not by its existence but by its wielder. Fortuitously, Juanmao possessed an autonomous consciousness, a personal set of convictions and principles—a sentient life form in its own right. Moreover, Fang Zhao had persistently felt a connection to his own enigmatic rebirth was intertwined with Juanmao, though the specifics of that bond remained elusive. The rigorous management of Juanmao served dual purposes: to guide and to safeguard. "Just don't stray," he quietly implored. As night descended, the wind intensified, and the waves battered the shore with vigor before receding into oblivion. All was shrouded in mystery. Simultaneously, Juanmao, blissfully oblivious to Fang Zhao's trepidations, embodied the essence of a wild dog unleashed, cavorting through the sea with gleeful abandon. The necessity for oxygen or respiration was rendered moot the moment it submerged, such rudiments of survival cast aside. Disregarding the need to breathe, the pressure of the depths, and the absence of light, Juanmao pursued the schools of fish with zest. It sampled the stones adjacent to the unpalatable corals, finding them lacking in flavor. Upon encountering a sea turtle, Juanmao indulged in playful mischief. It even burst into song. "La la la la, behold the turtle gliding in the water—" As an artist's dog versed in speech, the art of song came naturally. Unheard by any soul, it feared no discovery. Should it sense the proximity of humans, it would delve deeper or conceal itself. Though pangs of hunger emerged, Juanmao abstained from immediate consumption upon its aquatic venture, opting instead to revel in the liberty of play. Unsupervised, Juanmao basked in its newfound independence. After a spell of frolicking with turtles and fish, Juanmao's curiosity was piqued by a larger fish, classified as a protected entity in the Marine Wildlife Conservation List—thus, off-limits for consumption. However, this did not quell Juanmao's intrigue. "Protected species are not meant to be eaten, but surely they may serve as companions in play!" Abandoning the school and the turtle, Juanmao pursued the larger fish, occasionally nudging it with a paw. "Merely a gentle touch; no harm intended." As the fish accelerated, so did Juanmao, matching its velocity with ease, never contemplating how it managed to match the speed of a marlin. Having indulged in ample play, Juanmao's appetite intensified; it resolved that sustenance was due. It would never prey upon those under the sea's protection, not even a single scale, beyond the purview of Fang Zhao. The mere thought conjured recollections of the books Fang Zhao had presented to it, the examinations within the Study Machine, and periods of introspection. For those not shielded by protections, Juanmao extended no quarter! The moment to feast had arrived! In its exhilaration, Juanmao also grappled with uncertainty. Where should it commence? On its inaugural autonomous foray into the sea, the initial catch ought to be of distinction—a 'ritualistic sensation,' as Nanfeng had elucidated? Juanmao scoured the depths with meticulous care in search of today's paramount quarry. At last, it identified a target. Superficially resembling a species from the protection album, Juanmao swiftly discerned the dissimilarities, prepared to vindicate its choice to Fang Zhao subsequently. Bolstered by the certainty that its quarry was not protected, Juanmao embarked on the chase with renewed vigor. Although the prey was diminutive, scarcely a meter, it seized Juanmao's undivided attention. With its quarry locked, Juanmao thrust forward in pursuit. At one in the morning, Yanzhou's counter-terrorism unit was at the pinnacle of vigilance. "No suspicious entities detected by the night watch, the Sonar Array signals no anomalous targets." "Sustain our vigilant defense and surveillance over the target area, ensure thorough patrols and nearshore detection, and meticulously scrutinize every minor auditory and energetic aberration—no creature, avian or aquatic, is to be overlooked!" They had received intelligence that the infamous 'Empire of Tomorrow,' also known as 'Organization T,' intended to launch an assault on Yanzhou come two AM. While the broad region was known, the precise location remained shrouded in secrecy. Moreover, 'Organization T' had misappropriated the latest in bionic innovation. The extent to which those zealots had augmented the technology was a mystery to all. Elsewhere, within a concealed subterranean chamber. The gloomy abode was illuminated solely by the glow of screens. A collective of seven or eight individuals, standing or seated, were fixated upon a singular monitor. "We've successfully circumnavigated a patrol craft!" one individual announced, their gaze laced with sanguinary anticipation as they surveyed the map, embellished with the blood-red insignia of 'T'. They had formulated a fresh stratagem, a preliminary gambit—a tentative incursion. Employing an innovative bionic torpedo, their scheme was to target a port, situated a centum kilometers from Qi'an City in Yanzhou. A solitary torpedo, laden with a potent cache of high-energy substances, had the capability to annihilate dozens of merchant vessels moored at the port, inflicting a catastrophic blow. The evasion of the patrol vessels was anticipated; the true trial lay in breaching the coastal defenses. "Smooth advancement; the objective is within our grasp!" The individual wielding the controller was utterly engrossed, the on-screen indicator demanding undivided attention. The moment was nigh to ascertain whether their modifications could deceive Yanzhou's formidable defense mechanisms. Should this initial offensive culminate in triumph, the subsequent phase could be unfurled without delay! The subterranean enclave was a nexus of rapt attention. As they verged on penetrating Yanzhou's defensive perimeter, in a juncture where every inhalation was suspended in anticipation, the luminescent dot on the monitor abruptly vanished. The basement was ensnared in collective astonishment. Their ocular faculties were thrown into doubt. The controller's visage momentarily petrified. Whither went my torpedo? A reexamination confirmed the utter evanescence of the projectile, precipitously, without preamble. This unforeseen development triggered a wave of consternation among those assembled. They had entertained a multitude of potential outcomes, yet this scenario had eluded their foresight. As though it vanished prior to even stirring the water's surface, the occurrence was jarringly abrupt. The psychological jolt was overwhelming, too profound for immediate processing. "What has transpired?" "The bionic torpedo has severed contact! No energy response is discernible! The causation remains opaque!" "Perchance a malfunction in the display?" "Negative, both display and controller are in optimal function, yet the torpedo remains unresponsive!" Sizable investments of resources, temporal expenditure, and human capital had been allocated to this venture, the culmination of which was this technological marvel! And now, it had dissipated, as if swallowed by the ether?? "Has Yanzhou's coastal bulwark evolved to such an impregnable state... Nay... Such a notion is beyond credence!" The individual gripping the controller's lips trembled, their countenance contorted in a visage of anguish, their eyes bloodshot, brimming with resentment and unchecked fervor. This setback was anathema to their acceptance! Another, perennially ensconced in the chamber's recess, his expression saturnine, issued a mandate, "Alert the cadre, cease all maneuvers forthwith! Our immediate objective is to unravel the enigma of their interception!" The meticulously crafted scheme, the inaugural chapter in their plotted siege against Yanzhou, had faltered. In stark contrast, the Yanzhou counter-terrorism department was ensnared in bewilderment. They persisted in their vigil beyond the foretold hour of two AM, steadfast against complacency or oversight, their watch enduring until the dawn at seven AM. Not a whisper of activity was detected. The fanatical cohorts of the 'T' Organization were not known for abortive endeavors; even amidst intelligence leaks, they would proceed with a provocative demeanor. Yet, as the day broke, devoid of any communiqué regarding enigmatic aggressions, the land remained tranquil; the sea was serene, with no lacunae in their surveillance. Whence the stillness? The conundrum was palpable. Could the intelligence have been fallacious? ... With the retreat of nocturnal shadows and the brightening of clouds, the dawning sun's rays scattered across the sea, expelling the vestiges of night's coolness. Splash— A dog's head surfaced, its snout emitting a jet of air as if struck by the sudden recollection of its respiratory faculties, its form emerging from the water to draw in the moist morning air. Juanmao propelled itself leisurely toward the shoreline, its limbs churning the water, stirring sand in its wake. Upon reaching terra firma, Juanmao indulged in a vigorous shake of its coat, the briny embrace of the sea relinquished. "Burp~~~" Chapter 452: A Light Appetite Senior Assistant Nanfeng was granted a much-needed break along with his two co-assistants by Fang Zhao. Nevertheless, Nanfeng, who viewed himself as a responsible aide and a busy bee, sought permission from Fang Zhao and, once approved, arrived at the crack of dawn. Following his departure from the Huangyi Art Academy, Fang Zhao was besieged with collaboration offers. It seemed to many that after completing his advanced studies, he'd be ready for business ventures. Yet, Fang Zhao showed no interest in such commercial endeavors. Despite his rejections, most were persistent and turned to Nanfeng, who had a short stint with the Huangzhou Entertainment Circle, making him a more accessible target than Fang Zhao. Thus, Nanfeng, self-proclaimed as a 'Part-Time Agent,' was brimming with energy as he took his work along. After Nanfeng briefed Fang Zhao on their tasks, he began looking for Juanmao, the extraordinary dog valued at nearly three hundred million dollars and the soul of their team, second only to the boss himself. "Where's Juanmao?" Since relocating to their new home, Juanmao had been in high spirits. Why was it absent today? Had the previous day's play led to it napping in a snug spot? "It's out for a swim; should be back soon," Fang Zhao mentioned, checking the time. Nanfeng almost exclaimed, 'Have you lost your mind, allowing a nearly three-hundred-million-dollar dog to play in the sea unsupervised?' But he held his tongue. Putting aside his paperwork, Nanfeng said, "Boss, I'll take a look at the beach," and darted out. Hardly outside, Nanfeng received a call from Yan Biao, inquiring about their status. Nanfeng responded while searching the beach. Juanmao was emerging from the sea, vigorously shaking off water and racing back home. In the dawn's light, Nanfeng marveled at the metallic sheen of Juanmao's coat. "Truly a nearly three-hundred-million-dollar dog! Even its sunbathing imparts a metallic luster!" He snapped a photo for their Salted Fish Private Chat Group, "Look at those adorable paw prints in the sand!" Yan Biao and Zuo Yu: "......" Nanfeng continued his excited commentary, "Check out this live feed. See that glistening figure sprinting? Our little Juanmao is the brightest shine in the neighborhood!" Yan Biao: "And surely the most expensive, right?" "The boss, you know..." Nanfeng hesitated, recalling Fang Zhao's extraordinary hearing. Changing tack, he said, "The boss can't be expected to watch the dog all the time. We must be vigilant when we're here, particularly when Juanmao is swimming—it's far too risky!" He carried on the conversation as he hastened towards Juanmao. Juanmao, intercepted by Nanfeng, shook off more water from its coat. Burp~~~ Pfft—— The dog burped and then farted. Nanfeng was ecstatic, regretting only that he hadn't captured the moment: "Witnessing a dog fart first-hand, especially from a nearly three-hundred-million-dollar dog, is quite the experience. Whether it burps or farts, there's a lingering presence; if you take a closer whiff, you can detect a hint of gunpowder." Yan Biao and Zuo Yu: "......" It was clear that Nanfeng's thoughts were thoroughly steeped in the dog's monetary value. His adoration knew no bounds! While Nanfeng sang praises of 'my extraordinary dog,' Juanmao had already sprinted past him and into the house. The time was now 8:02 AM. Juanmao had promised Fang Zhao it would return by eight... It was two minutes late. Juanmao had its explanation ready. "I was onshore before eight! I just wanted to shake dry before going inside! And Nanfeng, he blocked my way!" Juanmao wanted to continue but fell silent as Nanfeng's footsteps approached. "Go to the dryer and fluff up your coat," Fang Zhao instructed, unfazed. By the time Juanmao was fluffed and dry, Fang Zhao had sent Nanfeng on his way. Fang Zhao examined Juanmao's mouth, finding only a trace of green—likely remnants of algae. "How much did you actually eat?" Fang Zhao asked. With a proud puff of the chest, Juanmao declared, "Just one fish, only one! The rest were mere morsels." Juanmao was determined to defend its modest appetite. It had heard all too often how costly it was to keep pets, especially those with large appetites, and how they sometimes ended up abandoned. Juanmao was intent on setting the record straight. It didn't have a gargantuan appetite! "Only one fish? Are you certain you're not hungry?" Fang Zhao asked, knowing well Juanmao's typical voracious appetite. "Absolutely! Not hungry at all!" Juanmao affirmed. "...You didn't snaffle a whale, did you?" "No! I steered clear of whales and all other Marine Protected Species! Didn't touch a single scale! The fish I ate was slightly longer than me. It resembled a protected species, but I ensured it wasn't, I checked thoroughly!" Juanmao hastily explained. It was crucial to clarify! Juanmao did not want to be on the naughty step! "What about the other snacks?" Fang Zhao continued to probe. "Just nibbled on a couple of shells, munched on some seaweed on the way back, and sampled a few other things I can't name—gave them a lick, none tasted good." "Hmm." Fang Zhao gave Juanmao a once-over. Aside from an extra spring in its step, nothing seemed out of place. Unsure whether Juanmao truly wasn't hungry or just saying so, he decided to prepare a bowl of kibble for it. Just as he was about to serve it, Juanmao burped again. Fang Zhao paused, his senses picking up an unusual scent in the air, and his expression grew serious. Setting the dog bowl aside, Fang Zhao knelt before the stretching Juanmao for a thorough inspection. "The fish you ate today—could you describe it? Have you seen anything like it in your books?" Fang Zhao questioned. Juanmao: "It somewhat resembled an entry from the Marine Wildlife Conservation List." Fang Zhao brought up the electronic album and had Juanmao identify the creature. "This one, somewhat similar, but definitely not the same! I have an eye for these things!" Juanmao boasted. Fortunately, it had been vigilant during its hunt, noting the distinctions between its catch and the protected species listed. Upon Fang Zhao's inquiry, Juanmao detailed its observations, even down to the discreet 'T' etched on the belly of the fish. Fang Zhao took detailed notes, sketching based on Juanmao's description. Considering the 'fish's' swimming direction, Fang Zhao drew possible routes, eventually marking three that stood out, one of which led straight to a port a hundred kilometers away from Qi'an City. Looking at the mapped routes and the 'T' on the sketch of the fish, Fang Zhao inquired, "What did it feel like when you swallowed it? The texture, the hardness?" Juanmao, clearly puzzled, replied, "I wouldn't know. Anything larger than myself, I simply gulp down whole." Fang Zhao: "......" The logic was impeccable. Juanmao adhered to an instinct similar to that of wild animals—minimizing physical exertion to maximize energy intake. Why chew piece by piece when you can swallow whole? Why exert effort when it's effortless to ingest, and there's no one around to witness? As Fang Zhao remained silent, Juanmao wondered if it had made a mistake. Tentatively, it continued its defense: "Although I'm not acquainted with its flavor, I believe its composition is more intricate than dog food... Definitely more intricate! Maybe next time I'll chew carefully and really taste it. The books I've read didn't discuss the flavor profiles of those protected fish. Without a comparison, how can I tell if it's truly exceptional compared to others that look similar? I will say, I felt quite full afterward." Fang Zhao's gaze lifted from the notebook, and he gently patted Juanmao's head, "No need, you did very well." Pleased with the praise, Juanmao's tail waved energetically. "How do you feel right now?" Fang Zhao inquired. "Feel? After eating that fish, I'm as satisfied as you humans are with those compressed energy snacks." Juanmao emphasized, "My appetite is honestly not that big!" Still somewhat concerned, Fang Zhao conducted a quick check-up on Juanmao. Since their move, the medical equipment used for examining Juanmao had also been transferred. The examination showed that Juanmao was free of injuries and in excellent health. A blood test, however, revealed a slight increase in heavy metal levels compared to its usual readings. Juanmao's blood had always had a higher concentration of heavy metals than that of other dogs. And now, after consuming what was suspected to be akin to advanced technology like a Bionic Torpedo, this slight increase was intriguing. Fang Zhao was fascinated by the discovery. Upon closer examination, Juanmao's fur seemed to have undergone a slight change in luster. None of Nanfeng's previous grooming had produced such a gleam, and its coat wasn't easily altered by common chemicals. These changes had occurred overnight. To err on the side of caution, Fang Zhao attached a sophisticated tracking device, a micro-detector, to Juanmao's leg to ensure any health emergencies would be detected immediately. "Stay out of the water for the next few days," Fang Zhao instructed. "Understood." Having fully enjoyed its adventure and now feeling full and drowsy, Juanmao decided to spend the next couple of days watching television and sleeping at home. "Next time you come across that 'fish' that fills you up and you want to eat, swallow it whole, don't bite into it. And come straight back to tell me afterwards." "Sure thing, woof!" Juanmao's tail shook with joy. It would go hunting again when hunger struck next. Remarkably filling, Juanmao believed that one meal could sustain it for at least half a month. Such efficiency would certainly save Fang Zhao quite a bit of money. The only hiccup—quite literally—were Juanmao's unstoppable post-meal burps. Chapter 453 'Surprise Assault, Arf!!' After a satisfying meal without a hint of reprimand, Juanmao nestled into his cozy bed with a blissful yawn, reveling in his narrow escape from trouble, and drifted off to dreamland. Fang Zhao had initially planned to explore the nearby vicinity today, having inquired about speedboat rentals from the property management just yesterday. His academic endeavors wrapped up and his dissertation finalized, he was looking forward to unwinding for a spell by angling in the open sea over the coming days, perhaps even snagging some fresh seafood for 'Bunny.' But the peculiar incident Juanmao had brought home compelled Fang Zhao to scrap his initial schemes. Back in his study, Fang Zhao digitized the sketches he'd just penned in his notebook and laid out several screens before him. He also unfurled a map of Yanzhou, demarcated a specific sector, and juxtaposed it with the sketches. The letter 'T' signified Organization T, infamous for their penchant for offensive strikes, seemingly yearning for a resurgence of the catastrophic Era of Annihilation. Fang Zhao's first brush with them had been during his tenure on Baiji Star. Another encounter had unfolded near Whale Island. Analyzing the trio of routes mapped out before him, Fang Zhao sought to decipher their underlying intent. Having endured the Era of Annihilation for nearly a century, Fang Zhao remained acutely attuned to various subtleties. Certain experiences had seared into his psyche, and despite transitioning into a new body and environment, the prolonged peace of the New Century hadn't dulled these ingrained sensations. The scent of gunpowder lingering on Juanmao's belch instantaneously set off Fang Zhao's alarm bells. During the Era of Annihilation, the whiff of gunpowder was synonymous with conflict and carnage. Beep——Beep——Lost in thought, Fang Zhao was jolted by a chime from his personal terminal, diverting his attention from the map to heed the alert. It stemmed from the micro-detector affixed to Juanmao's hind leg, designed to signal any abnormalities. A graph materialized on the screen, charting real-time monitoring data. An hour prior, Juanmao's blood heavy metal content, already slightly over the norm, began a precipitous ascent. No, it was more than an ascent—it was a harrowing metamorphosis! The levels of various metals surged and then nosedived, and elements alien to a canine's physiology made an unprecedented appearance. These anomalies were undoubtedly a consequence of Juanmao's consumption earlier that day. Humans, too, assimilate non-essential elements from their diet, yet the current predicament was starkly dissimilar. In a fleeting ten-second window, as the detector relayed, some metallic constituents in Juanmao's system plummeted from peak alert levels to nil, only to soar to staggering heights in the next reading! No known creature in Fang Zhao's compendium exhibited such erratic fluctuations! For instance, the device's readings indicated that the concentration of several metals, were they present in a human, would be incompatible with life. The same held true for canines! Yet Juanmao exhibited no loss of vitality, and Fang Zhao could still discern its steady rhythmic snoring. This aberration in the detector's feedback was utterly abnormal! Was the device malfunctioning? Fang Zhao approached Juanmao's resting place and observed the dog sprawled on its back, immersed in slumber, snoring away. He hesitated momentarily, then extended a finger to gauge Juanmao's breath. A notorious snorer post-slumber, Juanmao was neither brachycephalic nor overweight, yet it persistently snored. Fang Zhao had once sought veterinary insight, to no avail. Presently, the dog's respiration was robust, not unduly hasty, but the exhalation bore an abnormal heat, significantly exceeding the detector's readings. For an endothermic creature, such disparity in breath temperature, more than double the normal body heat—could that be deemed regular? Fang Zhao tapped Juanmao's cranium. 'Juanmao?' The snoring persisted. Another tap, more insistent, 'They've pilfered the gaming console!' 'Arf...' Juanmao let out a couple of muffled grumbles, licked its muzzle, shifted its posture, and returned to its slumber, rolling to its side, with a twitch of the legs as though envisioning a chase in its dreams. And the snoring resumed. Fang Zhao's expression contorted with concern. Could it be that not even the alarm of a stolen gaming console could rouse it? The predicament appeared more severe than anticipated. But with no precedent for such an occurrence and without a whisper of it in any lore, Fang Zhao was at a loss for action. To awaken Juanmao by force or to observe and wait? Uncertain of the repercussions of disturbing Juanmao in such a state, Fang Zhao refrained from hasty decisions. As he deliberated, the detector's alarm crescendoed in urgency and pitch, and the personal terminal showcased a monitoring graph in tumultuous flux. Heart rate, pulse, blood pressure—all oscillated wildly. And these were merely the quantifiable shifts; countless others likely eluded the detector's scope. The screen that depicted the monitoring graph flickered, its image contorted as if under an invisible strain. The illumination in the room became erratic, the flickering suggestive of an external disturbance. Concurrent alarms blared from the operational electronics. A sonorous ringing invaded the room, eliciting intense discomfort. Fang Zhao, however, managed to endure. Another person might have succumbed to disorientation. The air seemed laced with tendrils of chilliness. Fang Zhao's intuition, honed in the tumult of the Era of Annihilation, detected the imperceptible peril emanating from Juanmao, prompting him to retreat with alacrity. As the detector's data stream halted abruptly, the piercing alarm terminated. The liaison between the device and the personal terminal severed. Light bulbs shattered in unison. Electrical outlets sparked with unleashed current. A flash of cold metallic sheen burst forth, manifesting what appeared to be an immense... paw? It materialized with such alacrity it seemed ethereal, only to strike with force. Thud! Particles of dust and debris vaulted from the impact. The sudden gale propelled the curtains into a frenzy. The entire edifice, a three-story construct, shuddered. And then the metallic radiance was no more. From emergence to evanescence, it spanned but a moment, akin to a mirage. Fang Zhao beheld the colossal paw imprint before him and the splintered floorboards, enveloped in silence. The gargantuan paw's imprint had engulfed a chair within its expanse. It was a lavish housewarming present from Nanfeng to Fang Zhao. Nanfeng had opted for the chair believing that solid wood exuded elegance, as pure solid wood furnishings were a luxury in the New Century. Yet the vendor had also advised that for dog owners, more resilient furniture was prudent, particularly the legs of tables and chairs which bore the brunt of canine gnawing. Thus, Nanfeng settled on an alloy variant. Sufficiently durable. But now, the seller-lauded 'sufficiently durable' alloy chair lay flattened into a disc, embedded deep within the flooring. Juanmao, who had been slumbering adjacent, seemed to awaken as though from a night terror. Surveying the chaos with bewildered dog eyes, it observed the fissured floorboards, the breaches revealing the level below, and the menacing paw impressions etched into the ground. Startled, Juanmao bounded from its bedding, fangs bared, and cried out, 'Intruder alert! Arf!' Upon spotting Fang Zhao, Juanmao hastened to his side, growling at the enormous paw print that had mysteriously materialized in the chamber. Its ears pinned back, neck fur on end, deep furrows on its snout, and bared incisors signaled that the hound had entered combat readiness, a guardian poised to fiercely defend its territory from alien incursion. Its countenance was the epitome of ferocity. 'Arf!!' Fang Zhao: '......' Chapter 454: No Room to Spare Fang Zhao had planned to enjoy some quiet downtime, but finding peace was more challenging than expected. The disturbance at his residence was sizable enough that the security network, overseen by the residential area's property management, quickly reached out after detecting unusual activity. "Is everything alright at your end? Do you need assistance?" "No need, it's just my dog, Juanmao, causing some trouble," Fang Zhao responded. The property management team acknowledged politely. Alright, if you say it's Juanmao, then that's what we'll go with. They didn't press for more information. As long as the incident didn't affect other residents or pose a danger to anyone, they were indifferent—even if it meant someone tearing up their own floorboards. Although Fang Zhao's house was set apart, his prominence as a Yanzhou celebrity meant that any minor disturbance quickly became the subject of neighborhood speculation. So when Nanfeng and two others quickly responded to Fang Zhao’s call, they discovered they weren't alone in their concern. A middle-aged entrepreneur, walking his dog, claimed he was merely stopping by for a neighborly visit. Yet, his eyes betrayed a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. Fang Zhao decided not to let him inside, citing the mess within, and instead hosted him in the yard, where there were chairs available. "Trouble with the dog? Oh, I can relate. Some annoyances are unique to us dog owners," the man said, sharing a knowing look. After a brief exchange, the entrepreneur felt he had learned enough and, realizing he wouldn't glean more, departed with his dog. As soon as he was out of sight, he shared his observations with other neighbors. "There was quite a stir at his house today; seems like a lot got damaged... I didn't catch sight of his dog; I suspect he might have been disciplining it... You know, some people are very different in private. Who knows what they're up to at home, hehehe... It's probably just a way to vent the stress of public life. You know how stars can be—they often have a temper behind closed doors... Understandable. Every home has its secrets. Any noise can be blamed on the dog, after all, dogs can't speak." Those residing in this upscale neighborhood typically didn't leak information to the media, choosing instead to gossip among themselves. A rumor quickly started to spread. It appeared Fang Zhao might have a violent side that he kept hidden from the public eye. Along came other rumors. Fang Zhao had been blindsided by rivals, caught up in romantic drama, or targeted by terrorists. There were all sorts of speculations. Some observant neighbors believed they had figured out the truth. Trouble just after moving in? Who had Fang Zhao managed to offend? Fang Zhao was aware of the private whispers but opted not to react. Instead, he asked Nanfeng to manage the refurbishment of the house, choosing to handle the incident without fanfare. The area Juanmao had ruined was too noticeable, so Fang Zhao destroyed the evidence himself. The already cracked floorboard now sported a large hole. Just one day after moving into his newly renovated home, it was time for significant repairs. Yan Biao and Zuo Yu felt ashamed. The level of destruction suggested an attack—a failure in their duty as bodyguards. Although Fang Zhao had given them time off, they had personally overseen the installation of the home’s security systems, which had failed to trigger during the incident! They felt they hadn't justified Fang Zhao's generous salary. The two discussed plans to upgrade the house's security system. Nanfeng, looking pale and with shaky hands, gingerly touched the flattened alloy chair embedded into the floorboard. What level of force was required to flatten a chair that could supposedly support the weight of an elephant?! The first floor had suffered manageable damage, but the second floor was a different story. The house was in disarray; half of the newly purchased appliances were now scrap, two-thirds of the lights needed replacing, and the walls required a fresh coat of paint. Nanfeng's mind was filled with thoughts of assassination, vendettas, and crimes of passion, and he was genuinely concerned for Fang Zhao's safety. He refrained from asking for details, and Fang Zhao showed no signs of wanting to elaborate. They both kept their questions to themselves. "Boss, should we hire additional help?" Nanfeng inquired. "There's no need." Fang Zhao assigned Nanfeng the task of overseeing the house repairs and called Juanmao, who had been sulking in a corner, into the study. They had been on the second floor when the incident occurred, and fortunately, the house was sturdy enough to withstand Juanmao's powerful impact; otherwise, it might have collapsed. It was also a stroke of luck that they had moved. In the previous house, the downstairs neighbors could have been severely impacted. Once Juanmao was inside the study and the door closed to dampen any sound, Fang Zhao faced a dog that was questioning its own actions. Juanmao was still reeling from the truth, even more so than when it discovered its talent for singing while playing games. "You really don't remember anything?" Fang Zhao asked. "I genuinely don't," Juanmao assured. Juanmao couldn't believe it was that kind of dog. Fang Zhao nodded and played a recording. Although the surveillance equipment was no longer operational, it had captured a recording before failing—a series of noises similar to persistent tinnitus. "Listen to this." Juanmao's ears twitched, and it began to transition from strongly denying it was that sort of dog to showing a hint of doubt. "Sounds familiar," Juanmao confessed weakly. Fang Zhao's eyebrows lifted. Had something like this happened before? "When did you last hear this sound?" Fang Zhao pressed. After some thought, Juanmao remembered, "When you were taken away." Fang Zhao: "..." Juanmao was referring to when Fang Zhao had been isolated. "On Whale Island?" Fang Zhao sought clarification. "Yes!" "And what did you do then?" "I consumed someone." "..." "But I acted as if I had fainted right afterward! No one discovered anything!" "...Excellent. Can you recall any other similar incidents? Think carefully." Juanmao spent a significant amount of time pondering. "There might have been another occasion, but I can't precisely remember when." While Juanmao's memory was hazy, Fang Zhao managed to recall a certain event. There was a time when Will, in search of inspiration for his paintings, took Juanmao to an art exhibition. They didn't expect an accident to occur, which resulted in Juanmao dragging Will out of a fire. At that time, the dog cages had all been cut open, and the surveillance system had completely failed. To this day, the perpetrator had not been found. Juanmao only recalled biting through the cage; it had no memories of the surveillance failure. Back then, Juanmao wasn't conscious of the implications of its actions. Even now, Juanmao was unaware that its transformations were causing the surveillance systems to fail. From breaking cages and disabling surveillance to swallowing a person on Whale Island, and now suddenly sprouting a giant claw that nearly demolished the house. The transformations had escalated significantly within a year, and Fang Zhao surmised that Juanmao might be evolving towards a specific form. An evolution of sorts. But no one could predict how long this process would continue or what might happen. More concerning was the fact that Juanmao couldn't control these transformations. What would they do if such an event happened again? They would need a secluded location. Fang Zhao reflected on the size of the claw that had cracked the floorboard; it was just one claw. If a full transformation occurred... The house would be insufficient to contain it. "How are you feeling now?" Fang Zhao inquired. "I don't feel much... Is a slightly itchy paw something to note?" Juanmao raised one of its front paws. Following the damage to the floorboard, Fang Zhao had inspected the paw he suspected had enlarged and found only minor scratches. Now, looking again, all scratches had disappeared, and the paw appeared to have been expertly maintained. After discussing the necessary precautions with Juanmao, Fang Zhao checked his bank account and sighed. Maintaining a household was proving to be quite the challenge. With a sigh of resignation, Fang Zhao summoned Nanfeng. Nanfeng had been contemplating how to fortify the house while keeping the repairs discreet. He thought Fang Zhao would want to discuss strategies for a low-key restoration, and he had prepared several plans. However... "I'm thinking about buying an island," Fang Zhao stated. Nanfeng: "??" Buy what? Keep calm, boss! An island was the last thing Fang Zhao needed. Nanfeng believed there was no real need for an island, and even those with superficial knowledge understood that private islands were depreciating. There was a phase in the New Era when island-buying was trendy, led by a group of businessmen who inflated the market. Subsequently, due to environmental and other regulations, some islands were prohibited from being sold, reducing the number of tradable islands and increasing their prices even more. But with the continuous development of alien planets, the wealthy shifted their investments off-world, diminishing the allure of buying native islands. Why invest in these tiny local islands, especially remote ones with little appeal, that might still harbor remnants of the Era of Annihilation virus? What was the draw? With a plethora of options available, some items simply lose their charm. People naturally gravitate towards better choices when they become accessible. Nowadays, many private islands are up for sale, but they're difficult to offload. Buying is straightforward; with the money ready, a deal can be made promptly, and island owners would be more than pleased. Holding back his astonishment, Nanfeng cleared his throat and managed a smile as he began to explain the current island market conditions to Fang Zhao. "They say to buy on the rise, not the fall. The prices of home planet islands have been consistently falling, making them hard to resell once acquired... Some who jumped on the island-buying bandwagon have left their islands undeveloped, not realizing the dangers of the untamed wildlife and flora—quite risky. The island prices were already high, and the initial investment costs were significant..." Nanfeng gave Fang Zhao a thorough briefing, advising against the investment. After listening, Fang Zhao simply stated, "Juanmao needs more room to roam." Nanfeng stared at Fang Zhao, his expression blank, as he failed to detect any hint of jest in Fang Zhao’s demeanor. Realizing Fang Zhao's mind was made up, Nanfeng could only agree. "Alright, I'll get started on a budget list." Nanfeng pondered: What had Fang Zhao gone through? Had things escalated to the point of seeking seclusion? Nanfeng decided to purchase additional insurance for himself once he got home. He was now keen to ask Fang Zhao: Do you regret all those donations? Without them, you could have easily bought not just one island, but an entire group! While internally venting, Nanfeng began his search for private islands on the market, focusing on those suitable for construction and with helipads. He estimated that after buying a small island, Fang Zhao's savings would be nearly depleted. If it were for any other reason, Nanfeng might have understood, but for a dog, it seemed a bit much... That day, Nanfeng learned a valuable lesson from his boss—pet ownership could lead to a swift depletion of wealth. Chapter 455: Unaware of Its Odd Appearance Without a Mirror Acquiring islands on our home planet was an affair filled with choice. Nanfeng had meticulously sifted through several options, presenting Fang Zhao with a curated selection. Fang Zhao chose one. The ecstatic owner, cognizant of the rising trend of extraterrestrial investments, was eager to liquidate. Willing to negotiate, he quickly agreed to Fang Zhao's terms. The transaction was rapid; a price inquiry one day resulted in a completed deal the next. Witnessing Fang Zhao's swift handling of the paperwork, Nanfeng resigned himself to a simple truth: Fang Zhao was no investor, and he desperately needed a savvy investment advisor. Regardless of the enigma surrounding the events in that house, surely there was no need for such a hasty acquisition? After all, would the boss not be better served by focusing on his music and arts? Investments were not his strong suit. Nanfeng wasn't alone in his thoughts; the former island owner also saw Fang Zhao's actions as naive. With the value of home planet islands on a downward trend, who would rush to make a purchase if not a fool? Such is the impetuosity of youth. The island, now owned by Fang Zhao, was not expansive but provided ample space for Juanmao to roam freely. Its secluded location, equidistant from all continents, lacked distinctive features or fame, and it had been nearly two decades since the last owner had resided there. It had only seen occasional, superficial maintenance. The Cataclysm of the Era of Annihilation had spared no corner of the globe; this small island had also faced its trials. Now, over five centuries later, it had recovered to a state of vibrant life. The island's residence, built over fifty years prior, had withstood storms and had been reinforced twice. Fang Zhao made no significant alterations; its sturdiness sufficed. Once the security system installations were complete, Fang Zhao sent Nanfeng and the rest back to their posts. Given the island's modest size, the food supply was limited and predominantly imported. Fang Zhao had stockpiled provisions, with plans for Yan Biao and Zuo Yu to deliver supplies at intervals. With the influx of royalty fees, Fang Zhao acquired two atmospheric aircraft. His wallet, recently plump with funds, quickly deflated. Nanfeng and his colleagues couldn't help but question their boss's sanity. Of the two new aircraft, one remained on the island, the other designated for transporting goods to Nanfeng's team. "Boss, are you really planning to stay here alone?" inquired a concerned Zuo Yu. "Yes," replied Fang Zhao, his voice a mix of calm and resolution. "Are you sure you don't need additional help?" asked Yan Biao. "No need." "Then... please contact us immediately should any issue arise. We're on standby." Nanfeng boarded the aircraft with a heavy heart and frequent backward glances. As Nanfeng and the team soared away, Fang Zhao returned to the house and called out to Juanmao, who had cocooned itself in its kennel. The dog had mentally evolved from 'I can't possibly be this kind of dog' to 'Maybe it's time I earned my keep.' Juanmao had presumed the 'fish' it had consumed would sustain it for weeks, but hunger struck again in less than one. Fang Zhao brought forth a hefty 50-kilogram bag of dog food. "Eat up; I'll watch over you," he said. "Can I gulp it down whole?" Juanmao asked. "Sure, go ahead." Juanmao licked its snout, advancing towards the food. In a blink, Fang Zhao observed what seemed like the emergence of a massive, metallic... mouth? A silver gleam flashed. The 50-kilogram bag vanished. "Are you full now?" Fang Zhao inquired. Juanmao hesitated before nodding, "Still a bit hungry." The dog had barely touched the surface of satiety. Fang Zhao presented another bag, "Could you try swallowing slower this time? Ease into it?" "I'll go slow!" Juanmao assured him. Fang Zhao watched more closely as Juanmao underwent its transformation. The canine's head reshaped while the rest of its body retained its usual dog form. The curly fur appeared to retract into Juanmao's body. The metamorphosed head was indistinct, resembling a metallic composition, its precise form unclear. All that was evident was a gaping maw with sharp teeth, consuming the second 50-kilogram bag effortlessly. An easy feat. Not just 50 kilograms—doubtless even 100 would have been swallowed without pause. Fang Zhao contemplated the scene before him. Perhaps Juanmao could no longer be solely defined as a carbon-based life form. It manifested an alternative existence. In its usual state, a dog, but what of its transformed self? A metallic hound? An unidentified metallic organism? The house's newly installed cameras had malfunctioned, as expected, capturing only fragments of the event. The disturbance commenced the moment Juanmao began its transformation. Other nearby surveillance devices experienced severe malfunctions, their footage contorted and warped at the critical moment. Every electronic device had been affected. Fortunately, Fang Zhao, foreseeing such complications, had brought a surplus of equipment. With no comprehension of its metamorphosis and electronics incapacitated, Fang Zhao fetched a large dressing mirror from the warehouse, a relic left by the island's previous owner. Juanmao, facing the mirror, swallowed dog food once more, nearly choking. It was dumbfounded. The dog was almost petrified by the reflection it beheld. Indeed, without a mirror, one remains oblivious to one's own monstrous form! The shock was more intense than when it discovered the chaos it had wreaked in its dreams! Yet, regardless of the shock's magnitude, hunger remained the overriding sensation. After numerous transformations, Juanmao felt exhausted as though it had consumed all three bags of dog food. Hungry. So very hungry! Left with no other option, Juanmao ventured back to the sea to forage. This time, with no neighboring residents to consider, it didn't have to wait until nightfall. With Fang Zhao's permission, Juanmao eagerly plunged into the sea to forage. As if a switch had been flipped, Juanmao's transformations grew increasingly frequent. Occasionally, while it innocently dug, its paws would suddenly enlarge, excavating a hole. Fang Zhao hesitated to allow it indoors for fear it might dream of chasing burglars and inadvertently lay waste to the house. These incessant transformations elicited a colossal demand for energy. Food! Fang Zhao found himself at a loss, leaving Juanmao to fend for itself in the open sea. With each of Juanmao's departures, Fang Zhao reiterated important precautions and warnings. Every day, Juanmao embarked on a marine adventure, returning satiated. In just a week, it had consumed two bionic torpedoes near Yanzhou's coastal waters. Now, a single torpedo didn't last a fortnight or even a week. If transformations became too commonplace, Juanmao would be compelled to forage every two to three days. Juanmao delighted in this routine, managing to eat its fill while conserving resources. However, after the third bionic torpedo, it could find no more. Juanmao scoured the area near Yanzhou's waters multiple times to no avail. Fang Zhao surmised that the operatives of Organization T might have abandoned the use of bionic torpedoes as a stratagem. Their next move was a matter of conjecture. The Counter-Terrorism Department of Yanzhou executed their duties with commendable efficiency, and even without Juanmao's intervention, the chances of intercepting the bionic torpedoes were high. Without torpedoes, Juanmao sought alternative sources of sustenance. This time, it resolved to venture deeper into the sea. Fang Zhao neither encouraged nor dissuaded this decision, instead offering Juanmao a comprehensive exam he had crafted. The exam encompassed strategies for handling various emergent situations and reinforced points of caution he had repeatedly emphasized. Juanmao completed the exam with ease, scoring 93 out of 100. After reviewing the deductions, Fang Zhao offered additional guidance before consenting to Juanmao's departure. Juanmao's outing lasted longer this time; it was absent for 12 hours before returning, visibly revitalized and evidently well-fed. "What did you consume?" Fang Zhao inquired. "A massive box!" Juanmao exclaimed. Juanmao recounted its excursion succinctly: After leaving the island, it swam on until it detected something that seemed delicious, and it devoured it. Fang Zhao delved into specifics, discovering that Juanmao's 'meal' was located in a sunken submarine within the deep sea. Inside the submarine, Juanmao encountered what was likely a form of high-energy material. Out of eight sizeable boxes, Juanmao had instantly ingested two. Due to the distance, Juanmao couldn't manage its transformations and was incapable of bringing the boxes up from the depths for Fang Zhao's inspection. After consuming the first box, Juanmao felt sated and considered retrieving one to show Fang Zhao. Alas, while carrying it, the box was inadvertently swallowed. Juanmao resisted consuming a third box, heeding Fang Zhao's advice, and chose to return to the island instead. "I'm utterly stuffed," Juanmao declared. Feeling overfed was a rarity. Without diving gear, Fang Zhao couldn't inspect the site firsthand and relied on Juanmao's account and his own suppositions. With scant information, the sunken submarine's era remained a mystery, and Juanmao had no recognition of it; Fang Zhao couldn't visualize it. They would have to wait for more clues from Juanmao's future forays. The meal had a pronounced effect on Juanmao's wellbeing. From an initial inability to control its sudden transformations, Juanmao had gradually become cognizant of the impending sensations. Each time, it learned to avoid unnecessary damage, and the island ceased to sprout new holes. Despite these advances, the transformations became more frequent and intense. To preclude detection of unusual energy fluctuations by patrolling aircraft or satellites in outer space, Fang Zhao instructed Juanmao to head to the sea when a transformation loomed. Neither land nor sea posed a hinderance to Juanmao. In the following month, Juanmao repeatedly ventured out, consuming the remaining boxes aboard the sunken submarine in increments. With the information Juanmao relayed and the clues Fang Zhao accumulated, it seemed almost certain that the submarine was once operated by Organization T and had been sunk by the Yanzhou Navy a century prior. There were rumors that the submarine contained at least eight tons of Grade A energy ore... Numerous attempts had been made to salvage not the submarine, but the fabled eight tons of Grade A energy ore it reportedly held. All such attempts had been in vain, thwarted by hazardous undercurrents, deep-sea predators, and the area's reputation as a magnetic anomaly zone with a propensity for communication failures and diving equipment malfunctions. Chasing a myth was deemed unworthy of the hazards involved. Over time, the collective memory of the sunken submarine and its alleged treasure faded into obscurity. Contemplating the reasons for the Yanzhou Navy's abrupt action back then, Fang Zhao sank into a contemplative silence, his emotions complex and interwoven. Chapter 456: The Signal Issues of a Shabby Little Island Juanmao, without any complex thoughts, devoured eight boxes before searching in vain for more of that kind of container. Fang Zhao had warned the creature against recklessly consuming marine life from the seabed, advising that intimidation sufficed, and snacking was prohibited. Instead, Juanmao gnawed a few more bites from the submarine wreckage, with a particular focus on the energy chamber. Hovering above the sunken submarine, three fully equipped divers approached this myth-enshrouded area of the trench with caution. As they drew closer to the notorious Abyssal Hazard Zone, they encountered communication disruptions but, fortunately, no violent undercurrents. The severe conditions of the ocean floor limited the divers, instilling an oppressive unease and dread of this uncharted domain. Humanity had ventured into space and onto other planets, yet complete mastery of the ocean eluded them; many of its depths remained forbidden zones. 'We're approaching smoothly... Yes, if the map we have is accurate, we should be reaching our destination soon.' 'No signs of danger; it seems we're having a lucky day.' Success on the first attempt was not expected; this was an exploratory mission. Who would willingly embrace such peril unless compelled by necessity? It was perplexing; their three bionic torpedoes seemed to have vanished without a trace. Multiple failed attempts had deepened their wariness of Yanzhou's coastal defenses. The interceptions were so effective that they were downright terrifying—no explosions were ever heard. This led the other sectors of Organization T to cease their bionic torpedo attacks and investigate this interception technology. They questioned whether the bionic technology they had stolen from the military was flawed or if it had been intentionally seeded by the military for them to steal. Their losses in acquiring the bionic technology were significant, leading to the exposure of several bases. It appeared they had fallen into a trap, a conspiracy crafted against them. How cunning indeed! They were forced to alter their original plans as their superiors were displeased with the Yanzhou division; without significant achievements, their status within the organization would plummet, leading to severe consequences. They needed to either stage an attack or accomplish something noteworthy to regain favor. After losing three valuable bionic torpedoes, their funding was mostly cut, and all torpedoes were recalled, halting the initial plan. It seemed they were being left to fend for themselves. The Yanzhou division leader of Organization T was so worried that he was almost bald from stress. He had considered simply bombing a densely populated area in Yanzhou, such as a shopping mall with lax security. But he was concerned about interfering with other plans of the organization, which seemed to be moving forward, though they were kept in the dark. Each division operated independently, making accurate intelligence hard to come by. Furthermore, the Yanzhou Military District was on high alert, likely to intercept them before they could even reach a mall. With no other avenues to prove their worth, they turned to targeting resources, specifically a submarine that had sunk more than a century ago. One of his predecessors had been on that doomed submarine, responsible for transporting energy ore, but they ran afoul of the Yanzhou Navy and couldn't escape. In the end, both the crew and the submarine were sent to the ocean floor. Eight tons of Grade A energy ore were lost to the depths. Eight tons! The hard-won eight tons of Grade A energy ore—all sunk to the bottom! The incident was a colossal blow to the organization; it languished for a long time and became more cautious, entering a period of recuperation. After that disaster, the organization never transported more than two tons at once, and Grade A ore shipments were dispersed, fearing a repeat of the same fate. The original crew involved in the transport was terribly unlucky; the meticulously planned ore shipment intersected with an unexpected Yanzhou Navy drill, allegedly because of an anniversary of a prominent figure from the Era of Annihilation. They received no prior warning; it was so sudden, they were dumbfounded upon hearing the news. Curse the Yanzhou Navy! What was the name of that figure from the Era of Annihilation? Something Fang? Who cared, for the dead were dead. Rumors had it the organization attempted to bomb the Martyrs' Cemetery multiple times, but the tomb guards were too formidable, never once succeeding. The 'T' organization held grudges; since the 'eight-ton' setback a century ago, every leader of the Yanzhou division had been tasked with an order: if possible, to demolish the tombs in the Yanzhou Martyrs' Cemetery, especially the tomb with the Fang surname. In a concealed underground chamber, the Yanzhou division leader of Organization T orchestrated the salvage operations with a grim resolve. He wouldn't have set his sights on this century-old sunken sub if he wasn't desperate. Although the price of Grade A energy ore had decreased due to new discoveries, it still had a value of approximately 14 billion. Communication technology had fortunately advanced; despite a few interruptions, the salvage operation was mostly smooth. As they neared their goal, undisturbed by undercurrents or deep-sea creatures, luck seemed to be on their side! 'Be vigilant for any deep-sea monsters.' 'Understood! But boss, do those legendary creatures truly exist?' one of the divers inquired. 'I have no idea.' 'The area we're approaching is eerily quiet. Maybe at these depths, there simply aren't any fish, let alone leviathans—just stagnant waters. Documentaries might just be filming shadows; it's uncertain if they're the fabled abyssal behemoths. There are rumors that the documentary crew fabricated the footage.' Despite their statements, the divers believed in the existence of deep-sea monsters. All divers involved in the salvage operation heightened their alertness. 'There it is! There's definitely a sunken submarine over there!' The century-old submarine was barely recognizable. 'Prioritize the ore!' commanded a frantic voice over the communicator. 'Roger that, boss!' The divers were equally thrilled by the prospect of such a valuable find. Three diving vessels, one on the mission, the others providing cover. But... 'Boss, no ore detected.' 'The boxes holding the ore are made from a special material, difficult to detect. Get closer and search for those containers. There should be eight or more boxes containing eight tons of ore.' After a while, the mission-diver reported. 'Boss, the submarine is severely damaged, just wreckage left, with jagged edges as if gnawed by a dog.' The voice over the communicator turned frosty. The mood was evidently sour. 'Boss, upon closer inspection, those marks indeed resemble bite marks; there could truly be an abyssal behemoth!!' Fear crept into the diver's voice. If something could mangle a submarine like that, wouldn't they be easy prey? To be honest, they'd rather bomb tombs in Yanzhou than become fish food. 'Find the boxes!' the voice over the communicator sharply commanded. 'Yes, sir!' In the end, the lure of 'eight tons of Grade A ore' overpowered the fear of 'deep-sea monsters.' However... 'Boss, no boxes found! The area is barren; a significant chunk of the submarine is missing! The energy chamber's gone too! Judging by the break... it appears to be freshly gnawed.' '......' Heavy breathing came through the communicator. He must have been seething with anger. Everything seemed to be going wrong lately. 'Keep searching! Look around for any...... Zzz... dropped... Zzzz...' 'Boss, what are you saying? I can't hear you!' The connection was lost. But they weren't panicked; they'd experienced a few communication disruptions during the dive; it would usually resume after a while. As they waited, the connection didn't return, and the diving vessel's control system began malfunctioning, with issues escalating rapidly. The divers inside the three vessels were now deeply alarmed. 'Retreat, retreat! Get to shallower waters, quickly!' The vessels were losing control, responses dwindling rapidly. They'd barely managed to start ascending when the control panel went completely dark, unresponsive. A ringing noise filled their ears, and their consciousness began to blur. —— Elsewhere, Fang Zhao was in a conversation with Nanfeng. Nanfeng was briefing Fang Zhao on the recent activities, a flurry of invitations: variety shows, news interviews, partnership proposals... the decision to accept or decline rested with Fang Zhao. Since Fang Zhao's move to the island, Nanfeng's workload had increased, yet he showed no signs of complaint; in fact, he was quite pleased. Fang Zhao had given him another raise, but that wasn't the most significant benefit; the real advantage was the networking opportunities, aiding his future career path. 'I'll pass on the variety shows, accept one interview with Yanzhou TV, and regarding the collaboration... zzzz...' Nanfeng's words were cut off by static, and soon after, the communication ended. With the connection to Fang Zhao lost, Nanfeng and the others were worried. They planned to visit, but then they received a warning from the Yanzhou Coastal Monitoring Station about a minor earthquake near a trench causing severe magnetic anomalies. They advised avoiding that area and suggested waiting until normalcy returned before venturing out. With no other option, Nanfeng's group could only wait it out. The minor quake wasn't a cause for concern, but the magnetic anomalies could be problematic; who knew if they'd worsen, and what if control systems failed mid-flight? 'Sigh, the city was so nice, why did the boss have to move to that shabby little island?' On the island itself. After the communication blackout, Fang Zhao noticed the familiar flickering of the screens. Stepping out, Fang Zhao gazed toward the sea. A change was taking place, something was happening. Chapter 457: A Dog with Ambition The pervasive disturbance lasted nearly two hours before subsiding. Fang Zhao received a call from Nanfeng, who, along with his companions, was advised not to hurry over. After the call, Fang Zhao didn't immediately return indoors; instead, he remained seated on a seaside rock, perusing online discussions about the recent unusual magnetic disturbances in the ocean. There were no injuries or fatalities reported. Since the epicenter of the magnetic fluctuations was in a region scarcely populated by humans, and the seismic activity was minor, the populace briefly checked the headlines before returning to their daily routines. As Fang Zhao scrolled through the news, he noticed signs of a rapid underwater approach. Standing his ground, Fang Zhao watched the horizon. With a thunderous splash, Curl emerged from the sea, barreling onto the beach. Such was its momentum that it tumbled across the sand several times before skidding to a halt. After shaking off the seawater and pebbles, Curl rushed towards Fang Zhao, its tail wagging furiously. Fang Zhao was relieved to see no visible injuries and asked, "Have you had your fill?" "Absolutely, woof!" Curl responded with an enthusiastic and somewhat proud bark. "What happened out there? You've stirred up quite the frenzy," Fang Zhao remarked, showing Curl some news articles about the incident. Curl's ears drooped upon seeing the reports, but its tail soon wagged in relief, realizing that no significant harm had been done. "Can you transform again?" Fang Zhao inquired. "Sure can!" Curl replied with confidence. Fang Zhao opted not to have Curl transform immediately. Following the recent magnetic anomalies, satellite surveillance was likely to be heightened, so caution was warranted. "Let's head out to sea," Fang Zhao suggested, donning his diving suit and gear before venturing further offshore, both to avoid detection and to protect the island's electronics, which were already in short supply. At a considerable distance from the island and submerged beneath the waves, Fang Zhao permitted Curl to transform. The sunlight pierced through the water, revealing particles floating in the marine expanse. Fish glided gently until a sudden disruption sent them scattering. Beneath the waves, a massive life form materialized, its very presence exuding metallic sharpness and a cold aura. The sunlight gleamed off its surface, casting a spectral blue glow. The interplay of light and shadow created a shifting tableau, wrapping the creature in mystery. It had ears, limbs, a tail, and fangs, just barely recognizable as a dog. Fang Zhao found himself significantly overshadowed by its stature. Given the creature's jaw size, it could easily engulf a human. Fang Zhao observed the unfamiliar figure with astonishment, puzzled at how Curl had transformed from a small pet dog to this metallic behemoth. During the transformation, he even heard a sound reminiscent of machinery accelerating to high speeds. After the transformation stabilized, Fang Zhao activated the underwater communicator. "Quite the imposing figure. Can't you make yourself smaller?" "Don't think so... not at the moment, anyway. Maybe later. But I've got the hang of transforming now! Just can't maintain it for too long," Curl admitted, adding with emphasis, "If I don't switch to my larger form, I won't have to eat as much. Think of the savings on canned dog food!" Content with its newfound mastery over transformation, Curl reverted to its smaller form and paddled around Fang Zhao, seemingly overjoyed at having resolved a significant worry. Fang Zhao had numerous questions for Curl, but the sea was not the place for an in-depth discussion. After returning to the shore and settling indoors, Curl recounted the entire incident to Fang Zhao. "I ran out of metal to chew on. After taking a bite from the submarine, I followed the trench deeper and detected something. I dug it out and ate it straight away." "What did this 'food' look like?" Fang Zhao asked. "A stone, white and round, the size of a soccer ball, and pulsing with an unseen energy," Curl described. Curl couldn't provide more detail; it hadn't paid much attention before succumbing to hunger and consuming the object. Fang Zhao suspected an otherworldly origin for the stone, but since it was now inside Curl, confirming its origins was challenging. The essential aspect was that the stone was beneficial to Curl. "Did you find any more stones like that in the trench?" Fang Zhao questioned. "Nope, just that one," Curl replied, a hint of disappointment in its voice. Had there been more stones, it wouldn't need to buy dog food, freely alternating between forms every day. Unfortunately, such convenient sources of sustenance were scarce. Fang Zhao didn't linger on this topic but instead asked about the causes of the magnetic anomaly and the earthquake. Curl glanced at Fang Zhao with guilty eyes, its head lowered, "I just couldn't hold it in after eating too much." After consuming the submarine's energy core and a stone likely rich in high-energy ore, Curl sensed an impending transformation and found a secluded spot to wait it out. "I didn't mean to complete the transformation. I made sure there were no people or fish nearby. I even tried to keep it under control. I didn't mean to cause any trouble." Curl then remembered something, its eyes brightening. Tail wagging, it looked to Fang Zhao for praise, "After transforming, I found three diving apparatuses close by, all with people still alive inside. So I brought them to the nearest naval vessels! I managed to do it without being detected!" At that moment, Fang Zhao received a notification from a channel he was monitoring. He glanced through the new report. It revealed that the Yanzhou Navy had discovered three diving apparatuses, with all occupants identified as members of the T Organization. The devices' positioning data corresponded to the epicenter of the seismic and magnetic disturbances. The populace quickly pointed fingers at the T Organization as the likely culprits behind the marine disturbances, and the backlash was swift and severe. Fang Zhao looked at Curl, which sat innocently, scratching an itch with its hind leg. After a brief pause, he said, "You've handled this situation quite admirably!" Curl's spirits lifted, and it cozied up to Fang Zhao, its tail wagging, eyes brimming with hopeful expectation. "So, can I... perhaps... get a game console?" "You may," Fang Zhao agreed. Actually, Fang Zhao had prepared for this moment. He retrieved two boxes from the storage area. The first box contained a gaming helmet, which Curl eyed greedily as Fang Zhao pulled out the state-of-the-art device. A genuine gaming helmet—not a misleadingly similar educational device—what a delight! Fang Zhao then opened the second, smaller box. Inside was a personal terminal, styled like an exquisite pocket watch and adorned with puppy motifs. Curl's attention shifted from the gaming console to the sparkling new terminal. This was the terminal it had been yearning for! Curl licked its snout and sidled up to Fang Zhao, wagging its tail in eager anticipation. "Which one do you choose? You can only pick one," Fang Zhao stated. Curl paced back and forth, occasionally pausing to sniff each item as it grappled with the decision, whimpering softly as it deliberated. "Actually, there's another matter," Fang Zhao added. Curl's wide, innocent eyes turned to Fang Zhao, filled with a woeful plea. "Regardless of your choice, it won't last you long," Fang Zhao remarked. "That's not possible!" Curl protested. It was fiercely protective of its belongings. Even the neglected educational device had been diligently placed on the collection shelf, under Fang Zhao's care. Fang Zhao presented the evidence, from Curl's mishap with the floorboards to the latest data from the magnetic anomaly. "Your transformations interfere with electronic devices, frequently leading to their total malfunction." Confronted with incontrovertible evidence, Curl fell silent, its mood deflated. "However," Fang Zhao continued, "you've shown remarkable progress. From uncontrollable morphing to now being able to initiate full-body transformations at will, I'm convinced you'll soon be able to transform without impacting electronic devices." Encouraged by Fang Zhao's belief, Curl's confidence returned. Fang Zhao gave Curl time to make a choice, on the condition that it learned to control its electronic interference. Curl began its new training regimen with determination. A dog must have goals—goals that fuel motivation and provide direction. Without them, life would be a mere cycle of wondering what to eat next, when to sleep, and when to play. Fang Zhao reorganized the storage to accommodate Curl's larger form. Thus, even if Curl accidentally grew too large, it wouldn't risk damaging the house. Every day, Curl practiced swallowing canned dog food, fruits, and bones, each time striving to lessen the electronic disruptions. With improved control over its physical changes, the interference from just its head morphing was less severe, sparing nearby electronics from immediate destruction. Fang Zhao had returned the fitting mirror to the storage area. Occasionally, Curl examined its reflection, familiarizing itself with its transformed appearance. Only by looking in the mirror can one truly see their canine form. After resolving Curl's predicament, Fang Zhao reached out to Nanfeng and the others to replenish supplies. Although the sea was rich with fish and perhaps energy ores on the seabed, a good stock of provisions was essential. Receiving Fang Zhao's list, Nanfeng and his team were baffled. The requested amounts were substantial, with canned dog food making sense for Curl. But with the large quantities of fruit, meat, and compressed biscuits—would Fang Zhao alone be able to consume all that on the island? Reviewing the shopping list, Nanfeng said to Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, "I'm starting to think the boss has secretly taken in a shark... Or maybe some other kind of fish? Considering the cargo this time, he might have more than one aquatic friend." Chapter 458: A Good Dog Fetches a Bone for Its Master Fang Zhao had his secrets, but Nanfeng and the crew dared not probe too deeply—they weren't keen on unemployment. When Nanfeng's team delivered supplies, Curly had ceased its warehouse training, opting instead to lounge on the sofa, engrossed in a television program. Having tallied the items, Nanfeng glanced back and chuckled, 'Hey, Little Curly's watching TV again, huh?' After finishing his tasks, Nanfeng relaxed and joined Curly on the sofa for some shared television viewing. The current show featured a segment about dogs, with an owner proudly showcasing their pet. 'A dog. A plot of land. Quintessential Muzhounese,' Nanfeng commented while sipping water. 'Look at that sheepdog, even bringing gifts to its owner! See how happy the owner is! You know, Little Curly, a dog that fetches bones is considered a good dog. When will you fetch one for your master? He'd be thrilled!' Nanfeng's playful comment was within Curly's grasp—its comprehension of simple words and commands was akin to a child's. It was just light-hearted banter to engage Curly, and he thought no more of it. Curly's ears perked up, glancing at Nanfeng, then back at the program, before settling down again, deep in thought. 'Mr. Zhao, all goods are loaded, and the electronic inventory has been sent to you for confirmation,' Zuo Yu informed Fang Zhao. 'Much appreciated.' 'Should we bring a domestic service robot next time? It can clean, cook, and even chat with you,' Yan Biao suggested. 'Not necessary at the moment,' Fang Zhao declined, shaking his head. Until Curly mastered its disruptive abilities, it was best to minimize electronic devices. Soon after Nanfeng and the others departed, Curly leaped up and barked at Fang Zhao, 'I'll be out for a bit!' 'Going far?' Fang Zhao inquired. 'Not far, just a quick swim nearby.' Curly avoided Fang Zhao's gaze, looking everywhere but directly at him. Fang Zhao raised an eyebrow, recognizing the dog's sly demeanor, but he permitted, 'Go ahead.' 'Woof! I'll be back soon!' With that, Curly dashed off. Fang Zhao was curious about Curly's antics but was interrupted by an incoming call. It was Molang. Since graduating from the Huangyi Advanced Class, Fang Zhao had maintained steady contact with Molang. Fang Zhao stepped inside to take the call, away from the noisy winds by the shore. Molang began by ensuring Fang Zhao hadn't encountered trouble, especially with the recent magnetic anomaly, and suggested hiring more help. With the Yanzhou Navy apprehending terrorists at sea, Molang was concerned for Fang Zhao's safety. Moreover, Molang had an important message for Fang Zhao. 'There's a significant upcoming performance, and you've been selected alongside other esteemed musicians. The organizers are interested in you. Would you consider it?' Recalling a conversation about a major, potentially confidential concert at the graduation ceremony, Fang Zhao asked, 'Who's organizing it?' 'The military. And it's not exactly close by.' 'I'll participate.' Molang's smile broadened, pleased with Fang Zhao's prompt response. 'This performance will be advantageous for your future. Someone will contact you within a week for details, and you can address any questions then. Ensure your affairs here are in order; you have about a month.' 'Understood.' A month seemed sufficient. Molang's intimation was clear—the performance was off-world. The exact star remained unknown to Fang Zhao, but if he were to partake, it wouldn't be a short absence. Hesitant to leave Curly unsupervised yet cognizant of the risks of bringing it along, Fang Zhao would base his decision on Curly's behavior in the coming days. If Curly could avoid tampering with electronics, Fang Zhao might consider bringing it along. Of course, this depended on the organizers' policy regarding pets. Even if pets weren't allowed, as long as Curly could master its abilities discreetly, there was no concern. With the gaming helmet and personal terminal as incentives, Curly's progress was noticeable, confining its interference to the warehouse. Outside that zone, electronics experienced minimal to no disruption. After further discussion with Molang and concluding the call, Fang Zhao checked the time; they'd spoken for over thirty minutes. Curly was still absent. 'Curly?' Fang Zhao stepped outside and called a few times, met with silence. Listening more closely, he discerned digging noises from the nearby seabed rocks. Deciding not to call again, Fang Zhao settled with an electronic book by the shore. He was immersed in 'Su Mu Talks About Dogs'—a legendary tome among the Muzhounese, penned by an old wartime comrade from the Era of Annihilation renowned for his dog-rearing expertise. As Muzhou's leading wartime figure, Su Mu's influence was significant, his opinions and stories gathered into this collection by his followers. 'Su Mu Talks About Dogs' shared insights on dog-rearing, with only part directly from Su Mu. The remainder were extrapolations by those who came after. The Muzhounese's love for dogs was heavily influenced by their forebears. True to his reputation as the Era of Annihilation's leading authority on dog-rearing, Su Mu's book was brimming with insight. Fang Zhao felt a need to absorb knowledge from this experienced comrade, as Curly's transformation into a mechanical dog hadn't altered its canine essence. As he read, Fang Zhao heard Curly's approach from the sea. Curly emerged from the water, not bothering to shake off, trotting with a bone far larger than its head gripped in its jaws. Fang Zhao's eyelids twitched at the sight of the bone. Curly, careful not to damage the bone, carried it gingerly, slowing to a near seal-like balancing act with the bone—several times its own size. Only when directly in front of Fang Zhao did Curly lay down the gargantuan bone. The bone bore tooth marks and stress fractures. Considering this was a dog that could crunch through submarines with ease, the restraint shown was Curly's utmost effort. After setting down the bone, Curly shook out its coat, flinging off the seawater. 'This bone's too fragile! Touch it, and it breaks! Not as hard as the rocks they're found in! I saw these bones in the rocks while digging underwater for fun, but they're not tasty, not filling at all. But it's huge! Absolutely huge!' Curly wagged its tail eagerly, seeking Fang Zhao's approval. It had fetched a bone that far surpassed those by Muzhounese dogs on television! 'Impressive indeed!' Fang Zhao patted Curly's head, then examined the bone in front of him. The bone wasn't intact; Curly had broken off a piece, showing some granular crystals at the break. Part of the bone was still attached to rock, as Curly's digging was anything but delicate. Vascular-like patterns adorned the bone. A fossil! A bone fossil from a gargantuan creature that once roamed the earth millions, perhaps even billions, of years ago! The Era of Annihilation's widespread disasters and century-long wars had ravaged much; survival was primary, everything else secondary. Anything could become collateral in the fight for existence. With the New Era, people's curiosity was rekindled, their fascination with prehistoric giants resurfacing as they renewed their search for relics. Often, they unearthed mere fragments; a complete skeleton could become a museum's crowning glory, boasting material for years. The colossal skeletons displayed in museums were mostly reconstructions based on old-world records and modern technology, not genuine bone fossils! According to fossil trade records over the last twenty years, a tooth from a 70-million-year-old carnivorous dinosaur could match the value of a 100-square-meter apartment in the center of Qi'an City in Yanzhou! 'Curly, you've just ensured your dog food supply for life.' Chapter 459: A Unique Stance in Dominating the Headlines Juanmao couldn't quite grasp the meaning behind Fang Zhao's words. It really didn't find the bone appetizing or satisfying in the least. Nevertheless, it could sense Fang Zhao's fondness for this 'gift.' Eagerly anticipating further praise, Juanmao's ears perked up when Fang Zhao remarked, 'Juanmao, if within a week you can control your transformation without affecting electronic devices within a meter, both the terminal and the gaming helmet are yours.' Stunned by this delightful surprise, Juanmao's doggy face lit up before it energetically wagged its tail, seeking confirmation from Fang Zhao, 'For real?' 'Yes. The countdown starts now.' With that, Juanmao dashed off to the warehouse to practice. After properly arranging the fragment of bone fossil that Juanmao had brought back, Fang Zhao donned his diving suit, geared up, and made his way into the sea to the spot where Juanmao had been digging. The waters surrounding the island weren't very deep, and the seabed bore many traces of Juanmao's digging—since moving here, the dog frequently played by excavating holes near the island. The entrance to the hole where Juanmao unearthed the bone was quite narrow, just big enough for Juanmao itself. Fang Zhao refrained from using tools for digging; instead, he deployed a compact energy wave transmitter. In the absence of professional detection tools, Fang Zhao relied on his auditory skills to infer the condition within the rock strata. Listening intently to the acoustic variations in the rocks, Fang Zhao's brain functioned akin to a tomographic imager, delineating the rudimentary layout of the subsurface. There were numerous interferences within the rock layer, but Fang Zhao had gained an initial understanding. Back on land, Fang Zhao marked several spots on the ground and commenced digging with the equipment he had brought. He wasn't planning to single-handedly extract the fossil of the massive creature buried below with his limited toolkit. His goal was rather to make some preliminary adjustments, shift attention away, and obscure the 'abnormal' traces left by Juanmao's excavation. Over the next few days, Fang Zhao concentrated on this task. The good news was the size of the creature buried below—it was large enough that parts of it could be dug out directly on the island, though it required digging deep. Meanwhile, Juanmao, stimulated by the prospect of a gaming console and a personal terminal, made rapid strides in its training. It didn't need a week; in just five days, it achieved the remarkable feat of reducing the interference radius to within a meter and eagerly approached Fang Zhao to claim its rewards. The gaming console! The personal terminal! How long it had awaited these! Fang Zhao did not disappoint Juanmao. After verifying that Juanmao indeed met the criteria, he handed over both the gaming helmet and the terminal. He even specially refashioned the pocket-watch-style terminal into a dog collar for Juanmao to wear. 'These items are fine for regular use, but keep them at a distance when transforming. Remember to remove the terminal before you change,' Fang Zhao instructed as he fastened the terminal-laden collar around Juanmao. 'Woof!' Juanmao acknowledged. Juanmao didn't need the reminder; it would keep a vigilant watch over its hard-earned rewards. How could it not cherish its first-ever gaming console and personal terminal? After adorning this special collar, Juanmao even scampered off to gaze at its reflection in the warehouse mirror for nearly two hours. While Juanmao was well-acquainted with the gaming helmet, the terminal was new to it. Nevertheless, the operations were straightforward. After perusing the electronic manual Fang Zhao had penned, Juanmao had it all memorized—no longer needing to run up to Fang Zhao to talk, it could now converse through the terminal~ As Juanmao was preoccupied with its mirror session, Fang Zhao reviewed and then deleted the 'Children's Special Terminal User Manual.' Juanmao's swift mastery in just five days was beyond his expectations, showcasing its increasingly firm grasp over its abilities. In the future, Fang Zhao knew he would have to raise the bar. Having addressed Juanmao's affairs, Fang Zhao reached out to Nanfeng and the others, initiating a voice group chat. Alerted by Fang Zhao's group chat notification, Nanfeng and his companions wasted no time, immediately pausing their current tasks to await their boss's commands online. The trio speculated—typically, the boss contacted them once a week, but it had only been five days. Had the island's supplies run out? Unlikely, as the last delivery could sustain him for a month. Had there been an incident? Yet, the boss didn't seem anxious. Or could it be... was he about to unveil his secret to them, like harboring a school of sharks on the island? Suppressing the whirlwind of questions within, they waited for Fang Zhao to speak. 'Juanmao dug up a bone,' Fang Zhao began. Nanfeng exclaimed with excitement, 'Our little Juanmao has learned to bring bones home!' Zuo Yu bypassed Nanfeng's foolish banter, 'Boss, is it a human or an animal bone?' Now, with a sobered expression, Nanfeng asked earnestly, 'Is there a problem?' According to the island purchase agreement, this was no cursed island. Since the last owner acquired it, no accidental deaths had occurred—after all, the prior owner hardly resided there. Beyond basic renovations and construction, nothing had been buried. Might there be some malevolent event hidden, unbeknownst even to the former owner? If it were a mere bird or beast bone, there would be no need to contact them. The three observed Fang Zhao's composed demeanor and patiently awaited the rest of his disclosure. Fang Zhao continued, unperturbed, 'Preliminary identification suggests it's a bone fossil, possibly from some colossal beast that roamed these parts tens of millions, or even a hundred million years ago.' The three: '......' Audible gasps ensued. 'A-a fossil?' Zuo Yu stuttered. Yan Biao, less acquainted with fossils, was seemingly collected... until the excitement hit him. 'Could it be a dinosaur? One of those legendary prehistoric behemoths?!!' As a devout dinosaur aficionado, Yan Biao was itching to see it firsthand. He had cherished dinosaur tales since childhood and had even dreamed of becoming a dinosaur hunter! 'It might not be a dinosaur; it could be a marine reptile,' Fang Zhao clarified. 'To me, all those creatures from that era are dinosaurs!' Yan Biao wasn’t fussed about the exact definition—land-dwelling or marine, they were all dinosaurs to him! Yan Biao even urged Fang Zhao to send additional pictures of the skeletal fossil, 'Such a large bone! The rest buried underground must be from a massive creature! Boss, you can't excavate it alone; I'm coming to help you now!' Nanfeng had remained silent, but a faint rustling was heard. As Zuo Yu and Yan Biao's excitement waned, Nanfeng finally spoke up. 'Boss! I've just reviewed the laws and consulted several leading lawyers. Over the last five centuries, fossils have become tradable goods. Anything unearthed from private islands belongs to the owner! Boss!! You've struck gold!!!' His voice cracked with unbridled excitement, highlighting Nanfeng's sheer enthusiasm. Private islands on the market had been surveyed previously, but early explorations focused on detecting energy ores or threats like the Era of Annihilation virus and other hazards. Fang Zhao's island was no different. Energy ores were off the table—if present, they would've been mined long ago, making the island non-tradeable. Hence, islands bereft of energy ores, once delineated, became tradable commodities, inclusive of their contents. Fossils held immense significance in fields like archaeology, collectible trade, and paleobiology in the New Era—momentous events indeed. If not for the rarity of excavated fossils over time, they wouldn't have gradually faded from public attention. Countless fossils, spanning eons, from insects to plants, have survived through the Cataclysm of the Era of Annihilation. People's affinity for dinosaurs persisted, yet dinosaur fossils remained exceedingly scarce. But who would have imagined that beneath such an obscure little island lay the fossils of ancient creatures from millions of years past? Fossils! Genuine fossils!! In stark contrast to Nanfeng and the others' fervor, Fang Zhao methodically organized the fossil excavation logistics. For such a task, expert fossil excavation teams were essential. Therefore, Fang Zhao photographed the unearthed skeletal fossil and the excavation scene he had meticulously prepared, sharing them on a social networking platform. He openly sought collaboration with expert teams. Post-publication, Fang Zhao's personal terminal was inundated with notifications. Those esteemed researchers somehow always obtained his contact details. Major media outlets, too, contacted him directly for inquiries. On that day, countless individuals were captivated by the news alerts. 'Fossils? Those ancient remnants from millions or even billions of years ago mentioned in textbooks... the fossils of prehistoric rulers? Are they authentic or just sensationalism?' 'Look at the size of these exposed bones—there's more yet to be unearthed, undoubtedly belonging to a giant creature!' 'It's Fang Zhao again? His flair for capturing headlines is truly unparalleled.' 'Did his dog uncover it? I suspect that the bone with an earthy scent that my dog presented me yesterday was also a fossil! But I tossed it into the garbage processor—feels like I've squandered billions!' Fang Zhao was a magnet for attention, and with the dinosaur fossil—a significant event with profound significance in the New Era—this news spread like wildfire across the globe. On Fang Zhao's recently acquired island, his dog—yes, the same Juanmao valued at 300 million—had unearthed a bone from a dinosaur dating back tens of millions of years. The story's magnitude was colossal, instantly stirring traffic across various circles. Simultaneously, numerous expert fossil excavation teams were en route to Fang Zhao's quaint island. Chapter 460: The Bustling Little Island The revelation of Fang Zhao stumbling upon dinosaur fossils transformed his once-quiet island into a hive of activity. Islanders previously eager to sell off their land were now hastily retracting their listings, contracting not just one but several specialized detection teams to inspect their territories and the seafloor around them—again and again. 'Hurry, hurry, hurry! Let's see if my island's hiding any fossils!' Professional fossil detection teams, previously on the brink of disbanding, were now overwhelmed with work. Regrettably, the veteran research teams were all preoccupied with Fang Zhao's island. They were oblivious to other islands, but Fang Zhao's was undeniably hiding a titanic secret! Thus, the desperate island owners had to settle for geological survey teams or other non-academic groups. Some teams, lured by the promise of a hefty reward, rerouted mid-voyage to their employers' islands, hopeful to discover their own treasure troves of fossils. The most despondent was the individual who had sold his island to Fang Zhao. He was intimately familiar with the island's numerous shortcomings: its remoteness, the difficulties in its management, and the steep cost of any potential redevelopment. What a relief it had been to unload such a burden when he sold it. But how much time had elapsed since the sale? Barely half a month? Witnessing the unfolding news, the former owner nearly choked on his frustration, his face contorting with a mix of regret and resentment. But that's the unpredictable nature of business transactions; the winner isn't always clear. Yesterday, he thought he had made a fortune, but today, he was the butt of jokes across the net—everyone was mocking the one who had sold the island to Fang Zhao! The mere thought of the treasures buried beneath made the former owner's heart ache with remorse. Oh, the regret! He should have resurveyed the island back then! Fang Zhao! Sly and cunning! He couldn't believe for a second that Fang Zhao hadn't had inside information! Surely, he must have known about the dinosaur fossils, which would explain his urgency to buy! Indeed, every move Fang Zhao made was calculated! Each action warranted scrutiny, as his next step was always a mystery!! The scale of Fang Zhao's discovery was so significant that it sparked conversations worldwide, even reaching Molang, who ordinarily paid scant attention to the news. Molang had assumed Fang Zhao would be secluded on the island, engrossed in rehearsals, not stirring up another tempest so soon! Anxious, Molang quickly contacted Fang Zhao, urging him not to let the fossil discovery distract from the upcoming performance—a pivotal moment for his career! Of course, Fang Zhao hadn't neglected the important performance; he had been diligently preparing amid the fossil commotion. After soothing the anxious Molang, Fang Zhao noticed Juanmao trotting his way. Juanmao arrived before Fang Zhao, tilting its head skyward as if in contemplation. 'That new collar suits you; it's quite stylish,' Fang Zhao commented. Juanmao responded with a joyful bark as if to suggest, 'Next time, I'll dig for bones somewhere else!' 'Are you fond of bone-hunting?' Fang Zhao inquired. 'Absolutely!' Juanmao replied without hesitation. After all, bone-hunting came with the bonus of game consoles! Look, unearthing just half a bone had already netted it both a game console and a terminal—a splendid haul! Fang Zhao considered for a moment and then nodded: 'Agreed.' He had reconsidered his initial plan to exchange the fossil for dog food. Now that Juanmao could control its transformations and forage in the sea, its consumption was minimal, so long as it didn't remain transformed for long durations. He could comfortably manage its upkeep. Furthermore, the fossil frenzy seemed poised to yield a substantial sum of dog food money, so there was no need to rush the sale. If Juanmao unearthed more bone fossils or other treasures, he would safeguard them for Juanmao. As Su Mu's book advised, 'Value every gift they bring you with sincerity.' Fang Zhao found this wisdom quite sound. Alternatively, why not establish a private museum? Whatever Juanmao gathered could be displayed there. The more Fang Zhao mulled it over, the more appealing the idea became. Indeed, bone-hunting was far more rewarding than idling away the days with games at home. Fang Zhao had briefed Juanmao about the impending arrival of strangers to the island. Unfazed, Juanmao had mastered the control of its interference; it wouldn't accidentally transform and alarm anyone, so it harbored no concerns about exposure, regardless of the number of visitors. Yet, with the influx of additional people on its territory, Juanmao resolved to step up its patrols, diligently scanning both the land and sea. 'Is this terminal waterproof?' Juanmao inquired, a note of concern in its voice. 'It's water-resistant up to 200 meters, so you should be fine for dives within that range,' Fang Zhao reassured. 'Only 200 meters?' Juanmao decided to err on the side of caution and leave the terminal behind during its underwater patrols. Alerted by the sound of an aircraft making its descent, Juanmao glanced over and dashed in that direction. The visitors were Nanfeng and his team. Upon receiving Fang Zhao's call, Nanmao and the group had rushed over. Even before touching down, they noted that the southeast section of the island had been extensively excavated. But this didn't faze them in the slightest! For the sake of unearthing fossils, they would gladly overturn the entire area! Stepping off the plane, Nanfeng spotted Juanmao approaching them. Juanmao lifted its head, showing off the new terminal around its neck. Typically, Nanfeng might have been attentive to such a detail, but his mind, currently fixated on the thought of dinosaur fossils, overlooked Juanmao's subtle cues. Now, Nanfeng's gaze upon Juanmao was akin to that of a gold miner beholding a goose that laid golden eggs. 'Look at our little Juanmao, aware of its significant achievement, strutting proudly! Well done, Juanmao!' Nanfeng exclaimed with unrestrained joy. Juanmao's deep, soulful dog eyes fixed on him. Then, Nanfeng continued, 'Your master's about to strike it rich—that's a bona fide dinosaur we're talking about! And it's a colossus. In an era gone by, a small dog like you would've barely sufficed as dental floss for it!' Juanmao gave them another glance and then ambled away. Nanfeng had too much on his mind to concern himself with the minutiae. After a brief chat with Fang Zhao, along with Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, they excavated two skeletal fossils. Their elation was tangible as they captured the moment with their cameras, flaunting their find across social media and networking platforms. With additional visitors expected, they couldn't afford to dally. Following their fossil excavation and photo ops, they each busied themselves with their tasks. It was conjectured that the fossil beneath Fang Zhao's island might indeed be the first complete prehistoric behemoth fossil over twenty meters long to be unearthed in more than five hundred years of the New Era. Its allure was irresistible, attracting teams from afar. Nonetheless, the island was privately owned, encompassing its immediate vicinity. Any unauthorized intrusion would empower Fang Zhao to act in defense. Nanfeng took on the responsibility of coordinating with the arriving teams. Fang Zhao had enlisted a contingent to maintain order on and around the island. The Yanzhou Navy had also declared their intention to deploy a team to assist. With individuals gathering from each continent, the Yanzhou Navy had to take the matter seriously. Even if Fang Zhao weren't the island owner, they would have engaged in negotiations with any proprietor. Fortunately, Fang Zhao was cooperative. In response to Fang Zhao's invitation for collaborators, professional research teams from all continents eagerly volunteered to partake in the excavation, forgoing any compensation for Fang Zhao's endorsement. Some were so determined to secure their participation that they were prepared to come to blows for it. Besides these teams, the media from all quarters was equally enthusiastic, with Yanzhou TV securing an interview with Fang Zhao. The once serene island was now abuzz with activity as makeshift shelters sprang up. The waters surrounding the island were peppered with vessels of all sizes, and their numbers continued to swell. Those who couldn't land on the island opted to stay aboard their boats! Onlookers keen to catch a glimpse of the action chartered vessels, ensuring not to trespass into the island's private waters. Private aircraft hovered nearby, cautious not to cross into the private territory without permission, merely circling the vicinity, with onlookers using binoculars for a closer view. Online platforms buzzed with live streams of the event. This excavation was immensely significant, igniting robust competition among the teams. Fang Zhao hand-selected twelve teams from the twelve continents, prioritizing research-oriented groups. With the mammoth project divided among them, the teams initially showed reluctance. But they grasped Fang Zhao's logic. If anyone objected, they were free to withdraw. Countless private teams watched eagerly from the sidelines, ready to fill any vacancy at a moment's notice. In spite of their initial reluctance to share the limelight, the twelve teams acceded. No one was willing to forsake such an extraordinary opportunity, and cooperation was the only viable path. Thankfully, Fang Zhao refrained from interference, placing his faith in the professionals to handle their affairs. This occasion also brought Fang Zhao into contact with delegates from the esteemed Bryant family, the most renowned lineage within the global collecting circle, who approached him proactively. Fang Zhao had a faint recollection of the Bryant family; they had delivered substantial contributions to the Huangzhou battlefield during the Era of Annihilation. Presently, they owned Huangzhou's most illustrious private museum—the Bryant Museum. The Bryant Museum was reputable for housing the world's only complete Tyrannosaurus rex skull, as well as a Velociraptor fossil. However, what truly set the Bryant family apart was their lineage. The Bryants, irrespective of gender, possessed striking good looks. Yet, those acquainted with the family were aware that this was a lineage that considered aesthetics trivial. One member had recently risked becoming a wild man in pursuit of a hundred-million-year-old insect amber. This time, leading the Bryant family's delegation was the director of the Bryant Museum himself. Acknowledging the challenges faced by private teams in securing solo participation, he allied with the Huangzhou Museum to form a collaborative excavation team with Fang Zhao. His aim in seeking out Fang Zhao was to propose that once the dinosaur was unearthed, they might lease it annually for two months, with the Bryant and Huangzhou Museums each showcasing it for a month. An outright purchase would have been ideal, and they were willing to pay handsomely, but Fang Zhao had indicated his stance—he was not selling. As a result, they sought the next best alternative. If not a purchase, then a lease would suffice. Fang Zhao, however, wasn't inclined to engage in such discussions just yet: 'We'll talk after it's excavated.' He intended to evaluate each team's performance before making any decisions. Differences among museums in their managerial capabilities and their esteem for collections were apparent, and Fang Zhao had no intention of seeing the excavated dinosaur jeopardized by any museum's negligence. The Bryant Museum director hadn't expected Fang Zhao's immediate accord; his sole aspiration was that Fang Zhao would contemplate them as prospective partners post-excavation, for they had approached him with the utmost sincerity! The Bryants had come with a five-person team, men and women alike, all participating in the excavation. They toiled and perspired, their faces smeared with dirt, their eyes burning with passion. They ignored the cameras trailing them, indifferent to how they were portrayed before a global audience. Their family's modus operandi was already legendary. What did appearances matter? The fossil was the genuine treasure! Once the professional teams were strategically assembled, the excavation's efficiency surged. As the teams diligently unearthed fossils, Fang Zhao found himself besieged by journalists. The reporter from Yanzhou TV, leveraging their local advantage, was the first to interview Fang Zhao. 'How did you initially come upon the fossil? Was it really your dog that discovered it?' the reporter inquired, glancing at the dog seated next to Fang Zhao. 'Yes, it was this one that unearthed the first bone.' The camera shifted to Juanmao, sitting proudly beside Fang Zhao. Juanmao lifted its head, proudly showing off the collar and the terminal emblazoned with a charming dog pattern, ensuring nothing obstructed the view. After a brief focus on the dog, the camera returned to Fang Zhao. The reporter posed a series of inquiries that the public was eager to understand, such as how Juanmao was capable of detecting underground fossils. Fang Zhao clarified, 'After purchasing the island, we initiated some minor construction work. The activity revealed the rock layer underneath, but it went unnoticed by all—it was Juanmao that unearthed that bone.' The watching Nanfeng and his companions exchanged incredulous glances, their silence speaking volumes. As for the reporter's query regarding Fang Zhao's reason for acquiring this island, he simply stated that he sought a serene retreat, undisturbed, and the fossil discovery was a stroke of good luck. Good luck? Many were skeptical. Haha, 'good luck' indeed! Was his extraordinary perception still a well-guarded secret?! Regardless of the reporter's internal commentary, they maintained a facade of understanding, complementing the well-behaved Juanmao at Fang Zhao's side. Juanmao, reveling in the praise, was visibly thrilled! After the interview concluded, it patrolled its domain, and when the broadcast aired, it positioned itself in front of the television. As Yanzhou's official broadcaster, the news segment was presented with a serious tone. The interview footage that aired remained a faithful representation of Fang Zhao's statements, unaltered by any deceptive editing. Juanmao's screen time lasted several seconds. In an era where even the most trivial news was transmitted in ultra-high definition, the official TV channel's visuals were clear enough for viewers to scrutinize the dog. The terminal on the dog collar was deliberately pixelated by the TV station, presumably to avoid suggesting any form of advertisement. Juanmao, who had been steadfastly observing the TV: '......' Chapter 461: The Guard Dog Juanmao was utterly disheartened after his new collar failed to impress, leaving him listlessly deflated. Upon his return from a visit to the excavation team, Fang Zhao discovered Nanfeng anxiously trying to engage with Juanmao, who was trudging with a drooping head. Spotting Fang Zhao, Nanfeng hurriedly reported Juanmao’s unusual demeanor. "Boss Fang, is Juanmao upset by his tummy, or perhaps the throng of strangers invading the island? Could he be sick? He was fine just a short while ago." Fang Zhao took the leash, gesturing for Nanfeng to proceed with his tasks, indicating he would tend to Juanmao. Leading Juanmao inside, Fang Zhao had an inkling about the cause of his dejection. "Juanmao, I've got a task for you," Fang Zhao said, knowing that a mission could often sideline other worries. Juanmao looked up at Fang Zhao. "I've commissioned a Grand Warehouse on the southeast side of the island to house the bone fossils we've unearthed. I need you to vigilantly keep watch and ensure no one pilfers them." The prehistoric behemoth buried beneath the island was colossal, and the excavation was a delicate endeavor to preserve the fossils. Despite the dedication of twelve teams, the task was far from completion. Fang Zhao had erected a substantial temporary Grand Warehouse on the southeast side, which served as a repository for the fossils and the excavation teams' tools and supplies, accentuated by a makeshift resting area. Though an electronic security system was installed, Fang Zhao placed greater trust in Juanmao's vigilant capabilities, also hoping to divert his attention from his recent slump. With the island abuzz with visitors, Juanmao’s movements were restricted, necessitating a leash. Now, Fang Zhao decided to grant him the liberty to patrol within the Grand Warehouse. The space might be confined, but it signified freedom from the leash. "Perform well, and I'll take you on an off-planet adventure," Fang Zhao offered as an incentive. Juanmao's eyes sparkled with renewed vigor, instantly invigorated by the promise. He was aware that Fang Zhao was soon to depart for a performance, potentially without him. However, buoyed by Fang Zhao's suggestion, elation took hold. Thus, as Nanfeng concluded a phone call and turned back, he witnessed Juanmao sprint into the Grand Warehouse, now a whirlwind of enthusiasm. "What's this about?" Nanfeng inquired, befuddled, as he regarded Fang Zhao. "He’s assuming the role of warehouse guardian," Fang Zhao explained. He notified the staff and appended a sign next to the "Notice" at the entrance: Danger! No Unauthorized Entry!! The staff mulled over the ominous sign, especially the three exclamation points. Danger? What sort of peril could possibly lurk here? Such strong language seemed excessive. They had been laboring there for two days, oblivious to any peril. Only a dog had been introduced to the scene. "Surely, the island owner's dog won't gnaw on the bones?" one voiced a concern. "The elevated ones are beyond his reach." "Should any mishap occur, Fang Zhao will surely assume responsibility." Despite the employees’ hesitation to welcome a pet dog into this professional setting, Fang Zhao’s directive as the island owner was absolute. And so, they acquiesced. Inside the Grand Warehouse, Juanmao had already embarked on his new duty. Keen to secure a journey to the stars with Fang Zhao, he scrutinized the Grand Warehouse with utmost care. He canvassed every nook, vigilant against even the smallest of intruders. After completing his rounds, Juanmao stationed himself by the Grand Warehouse door, overseeing the comings and goings of the staff without causing a disturbance, resolutely embodying the spirit of a watchful guard dog. Elsewhere, a discreet yacht lay at anchor a fair distance from the island, blending seamlessly with the other vessels congregated for the spectacle. This one was unremarkable. "We've infiltrated the island undetected, perfectly blending in! The state-of-the-art bionic technology is exceptional. The exorbitant sum we expended on the black market was a worthy investment; the vendor's claims were genuine!" "As per the manual, this represents the pinnacle of contemporary bionic technology, adept at circumventing most civilian security measures. Its efficacy, although costly, is unparalleled, and its longevity remains an enigma. A sizable portion of our resources has been committed to this endeavor. It's limited to transporting items under twenty kilograms, but its capabilities are not to be underestimated." "I harbor no greed; merely one small bone fragment will suffice. Given the enormity of the skeleton, the absence of a few minor pieces will surely go unnoticed." "Likewise, a single bone piece will fulfill my ambitions." "We will equitably divide the proceeds from the sale!" "The Grand Warehouse is under nighttime surveillance; we must tread with caution." "Fear not, I've enhanced it with dissolving anesthetic needles, potent enough to incapacitate a pachyderm and designed to be undetectable." "Fang Zhao's impetuousness in announcing the discovery without thorough preparations has played to our advantage. On this isolated isle, entirely surrounded by seas and swarming with visitors, the security personnel are overwhelmed. Moreover, his overreliance on these so-called intelligent security systems betrays his youth and naivety. He fails to appreciate the rapid obsolescence inherent in electronic devices." "Shall we postpone our endeavor until nightfall?" "Indeed, the veil of darkness will be our ally." As the daylight waned and the shroud of night enveloped the island, the day's toil-worn excavation teams retreated to their abodes, promptly succumbing to slumber. The novelty of their arrival had once kept them awake, but by the third evening, the taxing nature of their work took its toll. A lapse in concentration could jeopardize the integrity of the fossils, and they were reluctant to entrust such a delicate task to machines. Thus, they seized the twilight hours to rest and rejuvenate. At this rate, within another two days, the entirety of the leviathan that lay interred beneath the island would be exposed. They were on the brink of laying eyes on the skeleton of a prehistoric titan that had remained ensconced in the earth for eons! The excavation crew drifted into sleep with smiles etched on their faces, blissfully unaware of the sinister figures that lurked within the darkness. The nocturnal quietude of the island was a siren call for insects of the night. A small crawler emerged from the underbrush, navigating its way toward the Grand Warehouse. Upon the ocean's surface, away from the diminutive island, a cadre of individuals aboard a nondescript yacht were fixated on their surveillance display. The perspective was that of the crawler's, now in proximity to the Grand Warehouse, on the cusp of infiltrating through a window crevice. Their gaze remained unblinking, nearly jubilant at the prospect of entry, when an abrupt 'Zzzt—' disrupted the connection. "What has transpired?" "Has it been detected?" "Could the civilian security system have undergone an upgrade already?" "It seems implausible. The latest iteration of bionic technology has scarcely been unveiled; an upgrade would be unprecedented at this juncture. We have never witnessed such swift advancements." "Perhaps the Grand Warehouse's security apparatus was a collaborative installation between Fang Zhao's personal guard and a security enterprise. Is it possible they employed military-grade equipment?" An oppressive silence ensued. That device represented a substantial investment of their fortunes. Around the island, aboard a flotilla of nondescript craft, parallel scenarios unfolded. The costly micro detectors, surreptitious devices, and ingenious thievery contraptions they had procured through clandestine channels, all purporting to embody the zenith of bionic technology, embarked on their missions only to vanish without a trace. Each one ceased transmission upon breaching the Grand Warehouse, some obliterated as if crushed, others inexplicably dematerialized. Whether by air, land, or subterranean intrusion, the fate was unanimous. Forget the notion of pilfering bones; they failed even to execute a covert surveillance operation! They surreptitiously sought information on the security firm that collaborated with Fang Zhao. The intelligence they garnered was met with incredulity. It must be a ruse, a deception contrived to mislead. Such cunning! Indeed, the more formidable the figure, the more enigmatic their secrets; Fang Zhao surely harbored an ace up his sleeve! Could it be that Fang Zhao had indeed enlisted military intervention? Within the Grand Warehouse, on the island's southeastern frontier, Juanmao, the guardian canine par excellence, gingerly clasped a severely contorted crawler in his maw, depositing it into a receptacle in the corner. The fifteenth specimen secured! Amassing twenty would warrant an additional foray into the gaming console—Juanmao issued a triumphant howl in anticipation! Chapter 462: Apex Predator The security system at the warehouse was meticulously managed by Zuo Yu and Yan Biao, who alternated shifts to ensure constant vigilance. Juanmao's actions were under their watchful eye, as they monitored every movement. Aware of the cameras and understanding this as another of Fang Zhao's quirky tests, Juanmao took it seriously. Fang Zhao had put in considerable effort to prevent Juanmao from developing a bad habit of eating anything in sight, and this was a moment of truth to see if those efforts had paid off. Juanmao, ever the eager participant, knew it could effortlessly consume these small insects without transforming, and the act would likely escape the cameras' notice. It contemplated catching a few for amusement. Yet, with the promise of extra gaming time for every twenty insects captured, Juanmao meticulously placed each catch into the box provided by Fang Zhao, guarding it jealously against potential thieves. Yan Biao, on duty in the surveillance room that night, couldn't help but be amused. "Truly a dog with an inspector's past!" He had noticed an unusual increase in insect activity at the warehouse, despite recent pest control treatments. Watching Juanmao catch each insect and place it into the box—especially when one sparked upon being stepped on—Yan Biao sensed something amiss and immediately reached out to Fang Zhao. Fang Zhao had given strict instructions: only Yan Biao and Zuo Yu were to guard the warehouse; no one else was to approach the surveillance room. Any leave requests were to be directed to Fang Zhao, with Nanfeng or Fang Zhao himself taking over as needed. Should any unusual events occur, they were to inform Fang Zhao immediately and refrain from leaking any information. Yan Biao and Zuo Yu believed Fang Zhao's orders stemmed from his high regard for the fossil, not finding anything unusual in his commands. However, after reporting the anomaly to Fang Zhao, he was simply told to monitor the situation and not worry about the creatures Juanmao captured. Yan Biao also sought insights from his retired military comrades, learning of the black market's surge in bionic device sales following Fang Zhao's fossil news. This had led to a spike in sales, and warnings from fellow soldiers. It became clear that the security system was no match for Juanmao's vigilance. None of the release devices had come close to the dinosaur fossil! Observing Juanmao toss what appeared to be an ordinary weed into the box, Yan Biao sighed, realizing the security system required an upgrade. If everything depended on Juanmao, he would be utterly redundant. Over the next two days, various cleverly disguised objects, resembling insects and plants, attempted to infiltrate the warehouse. However, none succeeded in stealing any skeletal fossils, nor did any unauthorized photos surface. There were attempts to bribe staff members, but Fang Zhao's team, composed of seasoned individuals with strict discipline, quickly rooted out any traitors before Fang Zhao had to step in. Their contract with Fang Zhao was clear: any team with an offending member would be held accountable, dismissed from the project, and faced with hefty penalties. As a result, the teams were even more proactive in weeding out moles than Fang Zhao. That day, an excavation worker feeling under the weather was instructed by the lead professor to rest in the warehouse's break room. The worker, carrying his toolbox, was intercepted by Juanmao as he entered the warehouse. "Woof, woof, woof!" Juanmao barked authoritatively. The warehouse guards quickly converged. Other workers, busy with their tasks, turned their attention to the unfolding scene. The worker with the toolbox turned pale—not from guilt but from shock. The guards took him aside and opened the toolbox that Juanmao had fixated on. Juanmao inspected the tools and rested its paw on a geological hammer. The worker's expression changed abruptly: "This isn't my hammer! Mine has my name etched on it! This one is unmarked!" He urgently contacted his professor, "Professor! Someone has tampered with my toolbox!" Eager to protect his top student and preserve his team's role in the project, the lead professor acted swiftly and cooperated with the investigation, which had its own protocols. Promptly, the team members proved their innocence and helped apprehend three suspects. This incident heightened the vigilance of the other excavation teams. Their toolboxes became sacrosanct, accessible to none but themselves. Their clothing was inspected daily, and they maintained a heightened level of suspicion toward anyone who approached. Previously, they had welcomed media attention. Now, they were the ones media pursued relentlessly. If not for the toolbox incident, they might have remained aloof, but the day's events had sobered them, sharpening their focus. The excavation was nearing completion, and the skeletal fossils were almost fully unearthed. Being expelled from the project now would be a monumental regret. They could not afford to stumble at such a pivotal moment. Soon, other island inhabitants noticed a change. The excavation teams, once jovial and relaxed during their work, now operated with an air of solemnity. Regardless of the workload, there was always a team member assigned to keep watch. Thanks to the collective efforts of the twelve teams, all skeletal fossils buried beneath the island were finally uncovered in their entirety. The skeletons were remarkably intact, necessitating few restorations. Following the computer-simulated reconstruction, they mounted the fossils. As the mounting concluded, they gazed up at the nearly fifty-meter-long skeleton. It was as if they had traveled through time to behold the maritime sovereign from seventy million years ago. A young worker beside them was speechless, overwhelmed with emotion. Several senior professors who directed the mounting were moved to tears. "I never thought... I would witness the apex marine predator from seventy million years ago with my own eyes!" After an hour of continuous discussion around the newly unearthed colossus, they faced a new challenge. "It deserves a name," declared a leading professor. They scoured a vast array of records, finding no match, confirming they had discovered an unknown species that warranted a name. The predicament was that the find had not been made by a single team but by several, and the skeleton belonged to the island's owner. "Should we adhere to the naming conventions?" "Do we have the right to name it?" "Fang Zhao, what about the naming..." "You decide," Fang Zhao replied with a playful shrug. The professors had been prepared to persuade Fang Zhao if he seemed indifferent to the naming, but they were taken aback when he entrusted them with the task. In the old century, fossils of ancient vertebrates with scientific value were considered state property. The new-century Cultural Relics Management Law had changed, but Fang Zhao was not particularly attached to these relics. If not for Juanmao, Fang Zhao might have even donated the skeleton to various museums. Fang Zhao glanced at Juanmao, who yawned beside the box of reptiles. Aside from games and food, the dog seemed uninterested in anything else. Hearing Fang Zhao delegate the naming to them, an elderly professor trembled with excitement, quickly calmed by an assistant who administered a couple of pills. The twelve excavation teams engaged in a vigorous debate over the name. Ultimately, they christened the prehistoric apex marine predator 'Sea Emperor Dragon'. It was the largest skeletal fossil unearthed to date, and its formidable teeth alone indicated a carnivorous diet. It was the undisputed marine overlord of its era, and the name 'Emperor' was fitting. The next step was the official record. The twelve teams engaged in yet another heated debate. Strictly speaking, the newly discovered Sea Emperor Dragon should be classified among marine reptiles rather than dinosaurs. However, contemporary culture has become accustomed to referring to such iconic creatures from that era as dinosaurs. Many new-century scholars have advocated for a reclassification. There were vast gaps in paleobiology research in the new century, and the limited data from the old century were used more as references than as absolutes. They trusted only in their own research. Once the record was established, a paleobiology professor grasped Fang Zhao's hand: "It seems you have a connection with dinosaurs. Would you consider joining us in paleobiology research?" Fang Zhao paused briefly, a hint of amusement in his response: "...No, thank you." Their invitation masked an ulterior motive—the Sea Emperor Dragon's skeleton. In the following days, news of the 'Sea Emperor Dragon' dominated online platforms. From archaeology to entertainment, from dinosaur enthusiasts to early childhood educators, from life sciences to geology—the Sea Emperor Dragon was the talk of the town. The discovery resonated deeply with the public: 'Our home planet once hosted such titanic creatures, rivaling the extraterrestrial beings unveiled to us.' The internet buzzed with wild stories and imaginative accounts, as if they had witnessed these ancient behemoths firsthand. 'Those previously discovered 'marine overlords' now seem like mere underlings.' 'Unmatched! Absolutely unmatched!' 'Marine overlord-level predator! Eagerly anticipating a Sea Emperor Dragon movie!' 'Will the Sea Emperor Dragon skeleton ever be on public display?' 'That skeleton is far too precious; it's unlikely to be open to the public.' 'I'd be satisfied with a model; when will the Sea Emperor Dragon models be released?' 'That decision likely rests with Fang Zhao.' 'I declare that the only one who can stand upon the Sea Emperor Dragon's head is Fang Zhao!' '...Eh?' 'Actually, that makes sense. Fang Zhao does reside above the Sea Emperor Dragon's resting place, so literally speaking, he does stand on its head.' A new topic quickly trended. #FangZhao, The Man Who Stands on the Head of the Sea Emperor Dragon# Nanfeng, perusing the social networking platform and noting the trending topic, laughed heartily. The Sea Emperor Dragon fossil had brought in a significant sum in rental fees. 'Boss, you've truly struck gold this time! With that skeleton, you could easily rejoin the billionaires' club.' 'I don't plan to sell,' Fang Zhao stated decisively. Nanfeng was initially taken aback, then realized: 'Of course! Such a unique and unparalleled treasure should be treasured, not hastily sold off.' 'I'm considering opening a collectors' museum. In addition to the Sea Emperor Dragon, we may gradually introduce more exhibits over time,' Fang Zhao elaborated. 'A collectors' museum?' Nanfeng echoed, surprised again, but then it dawned on him: Trust the boss to think long-term. By not selling the skeletal fossil right away and instead opening his own museum, Fang Zhao could capitalize on merchandise sales! The Sea Emperor Dragon is the largest creature unearthed on our planet to date. While other planets might have larger beings, for paleobiology researchers, there's still so much to explore about our planet's past life. Why bother with extraterrestrial life? Besides, the emotional connection people have with our planet is irreplaceable. It's the cradle of human history, shared by all—a shared history that cannot be replaced by any extraterrestrial discovery. Convinced he had grasped Fang Zhao's strategy, Nanfeng felt a surge of satisfaction. The boss still had a keen investment acumen. Nanfeng looked at the research team's computer-simulated interpretations of the Sea Emperor Dragon's possible appearances and marveled: 'An apex marine predator indeed—each rendition exudes a ferocious aura. It's fortunate they're long extinct.' 'One can only imagine what cosmic apex predators might look like.' Nanfeng's imagination soared: 'They must have been impressively formidable.' Fang Zhao glanced at Juanmao, who diligently counted the reptiles in the box, and commented: 'Appearances can be deceiving. Some creatures may look endearing but have a lethal potency.' Nanfeng chuckled: 'Haha, boss, what a sense of humor you have!' Fang Zhao gave him a knowing look: '...You'll understand in time.' Nanfeng nodded outwardly in agreement, while inwardly he laughed once more. Alright then, you're the boss, and whatever you say goes. Even if you claim Juanmao is an apex predator, I'm all in! Chapter 463: Impossible to Be Outdone by a Dog The media landscape was saturated with coverage of the Sea Emperor Dragon, and a wave of paleontological research papers were hastily published, upending numerous assumptions once considered unassailable in documentaries. A student specializing in ancient vertebrates quipped during a media interview, 'Our professors always cautioned us—documentaries and archaeological findings are perpetually subject to revision with new evidence. The Sea Emperor Dragon's discovery is profoundly significant for us. We're confident that more astonishing surprises await in the many unknowns yet to be explored.' Fang Zhao's island discovery shifted the collective gaze from land to the distant islands and the vast sea. In those seldom-trodden regions, myriad prehistoric beings, which had fortuitously evaded the calamity of the Era of Annihilation, likely remain buried. Island values are ascending! The surge isn't dramatic, but a marked increase in island acquisition interest has arrested the downturn in prices, propelling a steady climb. A dedicated paleontology aficionado even invested in an island, establishing a private research facility and launching an expedition team to probe the ocean's subterranean layers. Post-excavation, Fang Zhao entered into partnerships with the Bryant Museum and the Huangzhou Museum. The Sea Emperor Dragon will be exhibited in Huangzhou over the ensuing months, inciting a ticket-buying mania—the online allocation sells out instantaneously, with the entirety of the two-month preorder inventory claimed in a bout of collective frenzy. Regarding the Yanzhou Museum... the curator is verging on despair. Despite Fang Zhao's Yanzhou origins, their facility is simply not equipped to manage the influx of attention that the Sea Emperor Dragon's presence warrants. Yet, with a two-month lead time, they're resolute in their ambition to rise to the occasion, reputational stakes at a premium. With the Sea Emperor Dragon's relocation, the spotlight subsided, and tranquility returned to Fang Zhao's island. Fang Zhao harbors aspirations to erect a museum, although the island is less than ideal. His sporadic presence and the risk of theft by miscreants pose significant concerns. Lacking a suitable site and sufficient funds, the museum initiative is on hiatus. While the Sea Emperor Dragon lease has generated commercial interest, Fang Zhao's sights are set on the imminent extraterrestrial performance. He has finally received an invitation from the host entity. It was only then that Fang Zhao uncovered the identity of the organizers concealed by Molang: Hidden Star, the preeminent among the triad of major off-world military bastions. Details are scant, and even official military dispatches rarely chronicle Hidden Star's narratives. Nevertheless, Hidden Star is universally acclaimed for its preeminent scientific research capabilities. '...These are the main points of consideration, but I'll forward a detailed electronic dossier. The schedule is fixed, and our envoy will liaise with you...' The organizer briefed Fang Zhao on the critical issues and then asked, 'Any further inquiries?' 'Is it permissible to bring a dog?' Fang Zhao inquired. A momentary silence ensued on the line, followed by an unexpected inflection in the usually unemotional voice, 'Are you referring to Curl? It's permitted, though this doesn't extend to other dogs. Naturally, should your schedule on Hidden Star prevent you from attending to your pet, we can offer assistance; it might even benefit from interacting with our Airport Smuggling Interdiction Team.' Fang Zhao wasn't taken aback by their knowledge of Curl. The dog had established its reputation among various military districts and departments, achieving hero status. All smuggling interdiction divisions coveted Curl. Hidden Star's airport had previously contemplated recruiting Curl but demurred upon recognizing Fang Zhao's reluctance to part with the dog. Their fascination with Fang Zhao's auditory prowess was also evident, yet his steadfast dedication to musical artistry precluded any recruitment endeavors. After the dialogue with Hidden Star's organizer concluded, Fang Zhao was furnished with an electronic guide detailing protocol for attendants and accompanying animals. He communicated the development to Nanfeng and the others, deliberately omitting Hidden Star's identity. Their eagerness to accompany him was unanimous. Nanfeng, ever perceptive, deduced that their destination must be of significant stature; his resolve to not be excluded was unwavering! Upon being apprised of Fang Zhao's intention to bring Curl, Nanfeng voiced concerns: 'Wasn't the location you mentioned known for stringent regulations? Are dogs really allowed?' Ignorant of the venue's specifics, the prospect of a stringent site sanctioning the presence of pets struck him as peculiar. Fang Zhao refrained from elaborating, simply stating, 'I'll dispatch the application link. Ensure Curl's application is included when you submit yours.' 'Understood, boss!' Nanfeng sprang into action, rallying Yan Biao and Zuo Yu to lodge their applications. Their screening was significantly more exacting, commencing with a political background check. Any public indiscretion or record tarnish could readily precipitate a veto. 'Political screening for pets as well?' Nanfeng pondered, bemused, yet he adhered to Fang Zhao's instructions and applied for Curl. A mere minute later, Curl's political clearance was affirmed. Nanfeng: '...' Has the vetting of pets accelerated to such an extent? An hour afterward, Yan Biao's authorization came through. Half an hour beyond that, Zuo Yu's was validated. Nanfeng, however... By the time dinner arrived, his status remained uncertain. 'Why did your approvals materialize so swiftly? Could it be... that I... I'm not...', Nanfeng stammered, his complexion ghostly. Yan Biao offered solace, 'It's likely due to your extended tenure in the entertainment sector. They're exercising additional scrutiny.' Nanfeng's heart hung heavy. His tenure in the Huangzhou Entertainment Circle had been characterized by nonchalance, yet he'd never transgressed in word or deed! A sleepless night ensued, but the subsequent day's endorsement dispelled his anxieties. 'All set! Proceeding to the subsequent phase of vetting!' The next series of evaluations proceeded without incident, culminating in a mandatory physical examination at a designated center within the next seven workdays. Fang Zhao accompanied them on the journey. 'Boss, you've already navigated all the hurdles. There's no need for you to attend; I've got this under control,' Nanfeng reassured him, confident in his ability to navigate the physical examination process. 'I'll come to observe,' Fang Zhao replied. Upon reaching the specified facility, the trio and their canine companion each entered disparate testing chambers. Fang Zhao claimed a bench and immersed himself in a book. Thirty minutes later, Curl emerged, having breezily passed the evaluation. Two hours passed before Yan Biao exited his chamber, exuding a sense of pride. His tenure on Baiji Star had conferred upon him an enduring advantage! He didn't attach much importance to Curl's swift completion; the assessment criteria for pets were presumably less stringent. Curl yawned. By the time Zuo Yu reappeared, Curl had yawned once more, assuming a comfortable posture to resume its repose. As Nanfeng finally made his exit, Curl was already slumbering at Fang Zhao's feet. Emerging with a sensation of vertigo and mild nausea, Nanfeng remarked, 'That assessment was rigorous; they've set the bar for physical fitness remarkably high.' The intensive fitness assessment indicated that their forthcoming venue would present a formidable challenge. Zuo Yu ribbed him, 'Nanfeng, weren't you once a Baiji Star serviceman? You've regressed! Time to intensify your training, starting tomorrow!' Yan Biao concurred, 'Indeed, you need to beef up your training regimen. Being bested by a dog? How's that for a wake-up call?' Nanfeng cast a glance at the comfortably seated Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, then at the dozing Curl, his reality blurring. 'No... it's inconceivable... I can't have been outpaced by Curl!' Had his time away from the service truly reduced him to such a state? Chapter 464: Departure Once his applications had been approved, Fang Zhao set aside all subsequent collaborative invitations, even missing the grand opening of the Sea Emperor Dragon exhibition at the Huangzhou Museum. On the debut day of the Sea Emperor Dragon, an excited crowd had formed a lengthy line outside the Huangzhou Museum. Their anticipation had painted their faces with excitement, and not even the slow-moving security checks could quell their enthusiasm. Next to the queue, vendors sold dinosaur-themed toys and models, with many in the line purchasing these items to pass the time. Inside, journalists who had not been to Fang Zhao's island were vigorously photographing the Sea Emperor Dragon exhibit. Lacking their own photos, they had no choice but to share reports from other outlets. The directors of the Huangzhou and Bryant Museums were unable to hide their smiles during the premiere. However, once back in their offices, their smiles faded at the sight of several bionic mechanical reptiles lying on their desks. Relief washed over the director of the Bryant Museum, 'Thank goodness for Fang Zhao's foresight to upgrade our security, or we would have suffered losses.' When Fang Zhao had delivered the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil, he had warned them about the potential threat posed by bionic technology and recommended they enhance their security systems. The directors took Fang Zhao's advice to heart, valuing the importance of the Sea Emperor Dragon's first exhibition, and had their museums' security systems upgraded before the fossil was even transferred. At the same time, those who had set their sights on the Sea Emperor Dragon were furious. 'So we couldn't get into Fang Zhao's warehouse—likely due to military-grade securities—but not being able to break into either the Huangzhou or Bryant Museums? This only means one thing: our tech is outdated!' 'I can't believe I spent a fortune on what's now considered antique technology!' 'We've been duped!' The bionic mechanical tech, once touted as the latest breakthrough, turned out to be a dud. Pouring money into now-obsolete technology was akin to throwing it into a void. Although the black market is known for being expensive, it had never cheated them like this before! Feeling thoroughly deceived, some buyers sought refunds from the elusive seller. In a fit of rage, they put out a bounty for the seller and warned others: 'Beware of knock-offs in the black market!' Within Organization T, the member responsible for the bionic tech sales was on the run. After realizing that the bionic tech they had stolen was ineffective against Yanzhou's sea defenses, the members of Organization T looked to capitalize on the hype generated by the discovery of the fossil. They produced a line of bionic mechanical creatures and made a fortune on the black market! However, it wasn't long before their customers started demanding refunds. To the members of Organization T, it became clear that 'bionic technology' was a conspiracy against them! It was one thing for military applications to render their technology useless, but even civilian security systems had upgraded to anti-bionic tech versions? They had expended so much effort only to steal outdated technology! Fang Zhao, the man behind their misfortunes, had inadvertently struck another blow to Organization T. Upon discovering the bionic creatures on his island, Fang Zhao reported the matter to the authorities. Following Huangzhou and Bryant Museums, more critical locations were scheduled to upgrade their security systems against bionic technology. However, Fang Zhao had no time to concern himself with these security upgrades. He was busy packing for his trip to Hidden Star. This time, his departure would be for an extended period, and he had informed Elder Fang and Madam Fang. He didn’t go into detail, simply noting that he had important matters to attend to and that it might be difficult to get in touch with him. If they couldn't reach him, he reassured the elders not to worry. 'Boss, are we comfortable leaving Juanmao, worth eighty million, here?' Nanfeng queried. 'Yes,' replied Fang Zhao, glancing at the aquarium. He had decided to keep Juanmao at his seaside residence rather than on the island. In case of any incidents, the vigilant property management team could respond promptly. 'Alright.' Although Nanfeng still had his reservations, he didn’t question further and continued with his update, 'The construction team on the island is making good progress. Everything should be restored by the time we return.' After the excavation for the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil, the island had undergone a series of changes—excavations, constructions, and demolitions. Now, a team was working to repair and rebuild, filling in the great pit and restoring other damaged areas. With his belongings packed, Fang Zhao received a call from the military district's personnel about their arrival. The aircraft had landed on the apron. Two soldiers came forward to verify their identities. Fang Zhao, an assistant, two bodyguards, and Juanmao. Nanfeng noticed that one of the soldiers gave Juanmao an extended look, as if ensuring that this was indeed the same dog listed on the application. After confirming the identities of the four humans and one dog and inspecting the luggage, they were all escorted onto the aircraft, headed towards the Yanzhou Military District. There, Fang Zhao would join other invitees from Yanzhou before they all traveled to the Outer Spaceport. Nanfeng's team, comprised of individuals with backgrounds in special forces and alien garrisons, stood tall and proud. They could not afford to let Fang Zhao down. Once on board the aircraft, the soldiers gave a cursory glance at the trio before focusing their attention on Fang Zhao and Juanmao. The orders for the soldiers were clear: ensure the well-being of Fang Zhao and his dog. Nanfeng and his team only required a cursory identity check. In reality, the soldiers weren’t there solely for Fang Zhao; they were the closest unit available after completing another mission and had been reassigned to this task. The energy chamber, still locked, was filled with a crate of energy ore and other cargo destined for the military district—a simple collection job. Juanmao lay quietly at Fang Zhao's feet, its glossy eyes taking in the surroundings. It licked its nose and looked up at Fang Zhao, letting out a soft whine. Fang Zhao glanced at it and patted its head. Juanmao settled down again but continued to lick its nose and lips from time to time. Seeing this, one of the soldiers asked, 'Is it thirsty?' 'Yes, it's thirsty. Nanfeng, the water bowl, please,' Fang Zhao said calmly. 'Right away!' Nanfeng retrieved the bowl and passed it over. Yan Biao watched the scene, thinking to himself, 'Pets sure are pampered these days.' Fang Zhao took the bowl and filled it with water handed to him by the soldier. After thanking him, he placed the bowl in front of Juanmao and tapped its head as a warning. Ever since Juanmao had acquired the ability to transform, its diet—and appetite—had expanded. It had even been allowed to forage the previous day. Thirsty? Not exactly. It was merely craving something. Of course, Fang Zhao would not disclose the true reason. It was not something he could admit openly. How could he explain? That Juanmao was salivating over the aircraft's energy chamber? Fang Zhao was filled with concern. It appeared he would need to keep a close eye on Juanmao; he could not afford to be negligent. During this trip, vigilance was crucial; otherwise, Juanmao might slip away and consume something peculiar, leaving not a single trace behind. Chapter 465: No One's Getting Away with the Dog In the Yanzhou Military District, journalists were prepping to interview a recently returned armored division when one reporter's voice broke the anticipation. 'Is that Fang Zhao over there?!' The others swiveled to look. 'It certainly looks like it!' 'Given the dog at his heels, that's Fang Zhao, no question!' 'What's he doing at the Yanzhou Military District?' 'I noticed them disembarking from a military aircraft, escorted by two soldiers.' 'Curious, what's Fang Zhao up to this time?' A junior reporter was about to capture a few snaps but got intercepted by the more seasoned journalists. After the realization sank in, he too regretted his eagerness. Within the military installation, sans a sanctioned event, photography was strictly off-limits. So, despite the itch of curiosity, they exercised restraint, well aware that a misstep could spell expulsion and a premature end to their journalistic aspirations. But even sans photographs, they couldn't help but speculate. 'I'll wager Fang Zhao's got something brewing.' 'He's been the talk of the globe. I presumed he'd be preoccupied with the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil, not here.' 'Now that you mention it, he's been rather elusive lately. The net's abuzz with the fossil, but Fang Zhao's been out of the limelight.' 'I've heard through the grapevine that the paparazzi are on a wild goose chase for him, but he's gone incognito. The entertainment press has lost its gusto. In my prime, those reporters had a knack for digging up news faster than we could broadcast it.' Indeed, as the reporters had noted, the sensation surrounding the Sea Emperor Dragon had naturally steered the spotlight to Fang Zhao. This time around, however, the investors had their gaze locked on him too. They dissected the excavation process of the Sea Emperor Dragon and concluded that Fang Zhao must have had a tip-off to act so swiftly in acquiring the island. Reflecting on Fang Zhao's trajectory to stardom, they surmised that every move he made was a harbinger of impact. The chapter involving the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil was far from its denouement! Their focus was now firmly on Fang Zhao, particularly his whereabouts, pondering if he was off discovering more fossils or had stumbled upon another lucrative find. Yet, he'd pulled a Houdini—again! Fang Zhao, his aide, his security detail, and the fossil-digging canine, Juanmao, had seemingly vanished into thin air! He'd even missed the Sea Emperor Dragon's grand reveal, a clear indication of something momentous! But of late, there'd been no peep about him attending any engagements. Time to delve deeper! What's the young maverick up to now? Is he on the brink of causing another sensation?! The wait dragged on, absent any developments. Not just the investors were holding their breath; the online community, eager for any tidbit, was growing antsy. The last public sighting of Fang Zhao had been in Yanzhou, spurring the local netizens into action... As the tradition goes... 'Wang Die, you slackard!' 'Wang Die! It's time to hustle!' 'Wang Die, take a gander at this—we've kicked off a crowdfunding initiative. Look! It's just launched and has already raked in over ten million participants. At this rate, we're on track to hit a billion by tomorrow. If you can ferret out any scoop on Fang Zhao, all that loot is yours! Astonishing, isn't it? Surprising? Thrilling?' And with that, the crowdfunding campaign's fervor rocketed Wang Die into the trending stratosphere. Wang Die: '...I'm profoundly grateful. My thanks to your entire clan.' While the internet was abuzz with the mission to mobilize Wang Die, Fang Zhao had already proceeded from the Yanzhou Military District to the Outer Spaceport. They were slated for a two-day stopover at the Outer Spaceport before setting off for Hidden Star. At the Outer Spaceport, Fang Zhao crossed paths with other artists invited to Hidden Star, as well as an old acquaintance. Qiao Tingzheng, the noted villain expert and openly devoted husband from the 'Genesis' shoot, was there. His spouse, Windsor, had been extended an invite to perform on Hidden Star, and he was in tow as part of her entourage. Upon spotting Fang Zhao, Qiao Tingzheng's face lit up with delight, promising a catch-up session post-settling in. Nanfeng leaned in, murmuring to Fang Zhao, 'Boss, from my observations, you're the youngest among the invitees.' And the one with the least experience. Nanfeng left the thought unvoiced, but Fang Zhao grasped the unspoken implication. Being the greenest might come with its own set of challenges. But Fang Zhao was prepped for whatever was in store. While they conversed, a middle-aged artist strode past, casting a disdainful glance at Juanmao by Fang Zhao's feet. He then looked at Fang Zhao, mouth agape as if to speak, but with a contemptuous 'hmpf,' he marched off. Fang Zhao, who had stood to greet the man, found himself nonplussed. This artist, known to Fang Zhao, was David Hull, one of the world's renowned violin virtuosos, and the mentor to the fiery-haired showman 'Fefe'—Faye Hammerneck, currently embroiled in a digital war of words with Saro. Fang Zhao hadn't kept up with their latest confrontations and was in the dark about the current standings. Contrary to his pupil Faye Hammerneck, who was omnipresent in entertainment news, David Hull chose to maintain a more muted presence, emerging into the public's gaze only for concerts and lectures. Fang Zhao had never conversed with him; their paths seldom intersected. This encounter had been the closest yet, and the reason behind the violinist's vexation was an enigma. After David Hull had departed, Nanfeng whispered, 'That was the violin master who just walked by. His protégé, Faye Hammerneck, has quite the presence in showbiz and is often compared to you, boss. He's probably not too fond of you. With his preconceived notions, and now seeing you attend an event with a dog in tow, his displeasure must have deepened.' In the entertainment circles, such narratives were common, and Nanfeng believed he'd hit the nail on the head. Even if it wasn't the exact truth, it was certainly close to it. Fang Zhao didn't buy into Nanfeng's theory but was no less perplexed by David Hull's sudden chagrin. The puzzle lingered until Qiao Tingzheng joined them for a conversation, shedding light on the situation. 'David Hull? Ah, him,' Qiao Tingzheng glanced at Fang Zhao and the resting Juanmao, 'It's no wonder he's annoyed! His request to bring his cherished dog was denied. Before we left, I overheard someone consoling him, 'You can't bring your dog to a performance beyond the stars,' and he was quite disheartened. Then, upon arrival here, he sees you with your dog—how could he not be irked?' Qiao Tingzheng recounted the tales of the esteemed violinist's canine devotion, as told by his wife. '...These days, his violin competes for his affection with his dog. In their company, even his star pupil Faye Hammerneck takes a back seat. Here, take a look at his beloved pet.' Qiao Tingzheng showed Fang Zhao a photo of David Hull's prized dog. David Hull's dog was a New Century Designer Dog Breed, imbued with a mix of three elegant old-world breeds and a hound's genetics. Its signature 'mane,' when groomed, embodied pure elegance. Nanfeng also glanced at the photo. 'This maestro... seems to have a penchant for long hair.' Qiao Tingzheng chuckled, 'Absolutely, he's got quite the inclination for flowing locks.' He then peered at Juanmao by Fang Zhao's side, 'Your dog's fur isn't exactly flowing, so he probably doesn't think much of it. But don't worry, he's kind to dogs. It's just that seeing you with one probably stirs a bit of envy and resentment. Don't mind it; he's not actually angry with you.' Qiao Tingzheng's gaze then settled on Juanmao, aware of the recent spectacle it had stirred, 'So it really did unearth the first Sea Emperor Dragon fossil?' 'Precisely.' Fang Zhao confirmed. 'I had my doubts the media was spinning tales.' Qiao Tingzheng looked at Juanmao as one would a curiosity. Juanmao's tongue hung out, dripping with drool as it licked its chops, looking somewhat restless. 'Is it feeling too warm?' Qiao Tingzheng inquired. Though not an expert on dogs, he understood the basics, like dogs panting and drooling to cool off when feeling hot... No, perhaps that wasn't drool; was it akin to a dog sweating? Yet, Qiao Tingzheng checked the room's temperature and pressure, both of which were optimal. 'It's just not fully accustomed yet.' Fang Zhao explained, composed. 'Indeed, most pets would struggle to adjust to the atmosphere of a spaceport. I'd bet dogs have an aversion to heights, and being in outer space is a form of height fear, haha!' Qiao Tingzheng amused himself with the notion. Fang Zhao offered a courteous smile, but his inner concerns grew. Juanmao had foraged in the sea the day before, hadn't transformed excessively, and hadn't burned much energy, so hunger was off the table. It was simply hankering for a treat. The Outer Spaceport was awash with energy sources, irresistible to Juanmao with its broadened palate. Fang Zhao even speculated that if Juanmao were left to its own devices, it might just consume the entire spaceport. Upon seeing Juanmao's reaction, Fang Zhao increased his vigilance and schooled the dog in private, reducing its drooling somewhat. Nevertheless, its eyes remained stealthily scanning the environment. Fang Zhao and his fellow performers, now and then beckoned for meetings, couldn't always have Juanmao in tow. Thus, he assigned the task of watching Juanmao to Nanfeng and the other two. They had been brought along specifically for this purpose. 'Keep a close watch on it.' Nanfeng and his colleagues nodded with grave determination, 'Understood.' No one's getting away with the dog! Chapter 466: Rational Star-Chasing Hidden Star, governed by a global military regime, is not well-suited for human habitation. Despite this, its resource-rich environment led to the establishment of the first off-world military base. It's here that over ninety percent of the latest aerospace technologies were conceived. From the moment they departed until their arrival on Hidden Star, Fang Zhao and his group had no view of the outside. After signing non-disclosure agreements, they were reminded to focus on their role as cultural performance guests, avoiding undue curiosity. Upon disembarking, they found themselves in a designated zone. The secrecy surrounding Hidden Star meant that online information was sparse. Even the veterans of their artistic troupe, despite several visits, only had a partial understanding, limited to the arts. Further inquiries were strictly out of bounds. For Fang Zhao, a newcomer, much remained unknown, but the presence of abundant energy ores on Hidden Star was evident from Juanmao's incessant salivation. Exiting the spacecraft, they were greeted by an immense protective dome. Indoors, without protective gear, the space felt open and unconfined. "This will be your residence, esteemed teachers..." an individual in Hidden Star's official uniform introduced them to the complex. They were shown to dormitories, a dining hall, and recreational areas. Having been briefed on the rules and having signed the confidentiality agreement, all that remained was to follow the scheduled cultural collaborations with Hidden Star's musical and dance ensembles. They were free to explore within permitted areas during their downtime. Accommodations for family members were together, while aides and bodyguards were housed in a separate building. "Fang Zhao, your quarters are over there," their guide indicated. "Can I bring the dog along?" Fang Zhao inquired. "Of course." With his key card in hand, Fang Zhao entered his assigned living space. It wasn't spacious, but it was fully equipped with a distinct technological and artistic aesthetic. It included two bedrooms, a study, and amenities for a canine companion—a thoughtful consideration. After a brief settling in, the group leader convened a meeting to discuss the plans for the upcoming days and distribute individual assignments. The invitees were a diverse group, including musicians, dancers, actors, and visual artists. Their post-arrival collaborations would be varied. Fang Zhao's partners were from a youth art troupe on Hidden Star. Most members of Hidden Star's art troupes were enthusiasts; professional-level commitment was not expected from them. "Fang Zhao, you'll be conducting the youth orchestra—is that satisfactory?" the leader asked. "Absolutely," Fang Zhao confirmed. The youth orchestra had chosen 'Legend'—a Molang masterpiece, the ten-minute grand finale of the epic series 'Genesis.' Molang had specifically requested Fang Zhao as the conductor. As a co-composer of the piece, Fang Zhao had an intimate understanding of it, better than anyone else. It was also Molang's test for him. After the meeting concluded, the artists returned to their quarters to rest before their scheduled afternoon visit to the exhibition hall. Only the invitees had the privilege of visiting the exhibitions. Accompanying personnel, including Fang Zhao's family member Qiao Tingzheng, were not allowed to enter, let alone bodyguards or assistants. Fang Zhao had Nanfeng and two others look after Juanmao, sparing them from following along. The exhibition hall, showcasing aerospace scientific achievements, captivated Fang Zhao, particularly the Foldspace Engine. The Foldspace Engine, hailed as the greatest invention of the New Century, initiated the space navigation era. The hall's guide was currently explaining its significance. "What you see is part of the first-generation Foldspace Engine. It's this device that made spatial folding possible. However, the energy required to stabilize the engine is beyond imagination. Traditional energy sources couldn't sustain its operation, which led to the search for new forms of energy..." While the guide introduced the engine and discussed energy technology and ore mining, they omitted key details. Questions about the engine's origins, development process, duration of research, and the scope of its capabilities—Fang Zhao's burning queries—went unaddressed. They all understood the protocol here: listen to what's shared and refrain from asking further. Unaddressed topics were not for open discussion, and no amount of inquiry would yield answers. The guide went on, discussing the discovery of energy ores, the advancements in energy conversion technology, and the classification and extraction of these ores. For other members of the art troupe, this might have been just a story. Some engaged lightly with the narrative, while others might have been informed. But Fang Zhao was listening intently. Although he couldn't delve deeper into the Foldspace Engine, he was eager to learn more about the energy ores. The more he learned, the more reflective Fang Zhao became. Everything was advancing too rapidly. The breakthroughs in new energy and aerospace technology in the New Century had far outpaced Fang Zhao's expectations. During the Era of Annihilation, he had often pondered the feasibility of space travel. The response had always been somber, suggesting that a breakthrough might never come within humanity's lifetime. Yet, just a century after the Era of Annihilation and the rise of the New Century, the Foldspace Engine emerged, followed by the 'Dream Team'—seven pioneering spacecraft of the New Century. Such an achievement was beyond the predictions of anyone from the Era of Annihilation. A hundred years might seem extensive, but Fang Zhao was acutely aware of the late Era of Annihilation state of affairs. In his view, a century might have been just enough for recovery and rebuilding. The actual progress of the New Century, to Fang Zhao, seemed miraculous. Just a century had yielded the Foldspace Engine. Now, over five centuries into the New Century, it was anyone's guess which generation had been reached. Regrettably, that insight remained out of reach. Still, witnessing a part of the original Foldspace Engine was quite a feat. He felt profound contentment. While Fang Zhao's inner musings were his own, other artists might not share his interest. Their stay in the exhibition hall was brief, leading to a small meet-and-greet session where fans from various Hidden Star departments came to meet their idols. Autographs, photos, and a multitude of fans filled the space, yet it remained orderly and disciplined. Hidden Star's unique management ensured the efficiency of such fan gatherings. Those fans who made it through were carefully selected; the demand was too high to allow everyone. Fang Zhao's fan base included both young and old, especially those who had watched 'Genesis of Yanzhou.' They looked upon Fang Zhao with a sense of compassion. Nearby, two meet-and-greet organizers and senior managers strolled over, commenting on the long line at Fang Zhao's booth with a chuckle. "Who would have guessed Fang Zhao has such a following here on Hidden Star!" "From kids to elders, our families are quite fond of him. He's indeed commendable, though it's a pity he didn't continue his military career." "Speaking of which, where's Yuan Zheng? He was quite eager to prepare a grand gift for Fang Zhao, wasn't he?" "Indeed, I've searched everywhere without a trace. Ever since the guest list was confirmed, Yuan Zheng has been barraging me with questions about the invited artists. I've given him the schedule." "There's only half an hour left for the meet-and-greet." "Did he oversleep? Or perhaps he's too engrossed in work to remember? Or maybe a last-minute assignment kept him away?" —— At the Hidden Star Foldspace Engine Technology Institute. At the security checkpoint, a young man, not much older than a college student, sat tapping his fingers anxiously, his eyes glued to the clock. The security officer opposite him, having just finished checking the final item in the gift box, laid it out neatly on the table. "So, you intend to gift these... "The security officer gestured to the tabletop brimming with models, "an entire interstellar expedition fleet, to a celebrity?" "That's right!" "But these are yet to be released, and let's not mention the confidential technologies involved. At least two of the models might not be announced for another ten years." "They're just models!" "Even so, models aren't permitted. Please be sensible." Yuan Zheng took a deep breath. "I'm a fan, but a rational one, unlike those blind fanatical die-hards! Please don't underestimate my intelligence!" "No one doubts a Gold Badge Engineer's intelligence." "Wasn't your idol the Stellar Master before?" "The Stellar Master is still my idol! He's the eternal icon in our institute's hearts, a figure to be revered! But Molang seems more down-to-earth. "Molang is my idol because he's simply incredible! Why do we chase stars? For the brilliance they exude! And Molang? He's a veritable beacon of light! Tell me, which other entertainer has amassed such honors at his age?" The security officer nodded, signifying understanding. He was aware of Fang Zhao, whose cross-disciplinary influence was formidable, not to mention his military accolades. Those in their twenties invited to perform here were a rarity. Seizing the moment of relaxed scrutiny, Yuan Zheng continued, "Have you heard the saying 'Goals ahead, idols by your side'? It's an inspiring mantra, you see? About progressing together, you understand? My room is even adorned with Molang's poster!" The security officer nodded again, appreciating the sentiment. He had heard that when Fang Zhao received the Stellar Award from the Galaxy Award sublist, Yuan Zheng had been eager to rise from a Silver Badge Engineer to Gold. Certainly, youthful fervor for star-chasing could be impulsive, which he could comprehend. He once idolized a basketball star from Mazhou, but that star didn't pass the screening to come here. Those privileged with an invitation must pass through stringent checks, not only for professional abilities but also for character and integrity. In comparison, Yuan Zheng was lucky; at least he could meet his star in person. However, Fang Zhao, despite his talent, was too young to be trusted with secrets. Undisclosed model ships were better off not given away. Seeing the security officer's expression tighten again, Yuan Zheng swiftly played the sympathy card. "Uncle, you've watched me grow. You know who I am. When facing my idol, of course, I want to showcase my accomplishments. You've been a star-chaser too, you understand, right? I've simply turned some of the ships I've worked on into models, even blurring key details, with no intent of leaking secrets!" "I believe you," the security officer softened, yet stood firm, "Second application, denied." "Uncle..." Yuan Zheng appeared forlorn. "All models are confiscated. Apologies, but it's my duty." Yuan Zheng's eyes nearly welled with tears. His painstakingly crafted space fleet models were halted at security! Witnessing Yuan Zheng's dejected state, the security officer sighed, "Let's compromise." Yuan Zheng's face lit up with hope, only to watch as the security officer disassembled a peripheral part from one of the ship models' engines and placed it in front of him. Stunned, Yuan Zheng held back his dismay. Then, with a sense of defeat, he said, "Molang travels all this way to perform, and all I can offer him is... a part?" The security officer stated flatly, "This is the limit. Young man, star-chasing must be done sensibly." Chapter 467: The Second Generation of Foldspace Pioneers Yuan Zheng hurried to the meet-and-greet venue, only to find the event had concluded, and the artists had departed in their vehicles for the return journey. Missing the chance to meet his idol was not an option, so Yuan Zheng took a detour in pursuit. For the artists invited to Hidden Star, their first day brimmed with engagements. The elders among them were visibly worn, their faces etched with fatigue. After the event, Fang Zhao went to fetch Juanmao. "Boss, is Juanmao still trying to adjust to the new environment? It's drooling and panting quite a bit," Nanfeng expressed his concern. "It'll get used to it in a couple of days," Fang Zhao reassured. Nanfeng pondered a moment, "Indeed, the environmental conditions of Hidden Star do take some getting used to. Zuo Yu, Yan Biao, and I felt a bit light-headed when we first landed here." Nanfeng handed Fang Zhao the dog food and pet supplies he had just collected, "The folks at the reception said to come back for more once these run out." Seeing his fellow artists ready to retreat for some much-needed rest, Nanfeng kept it brief, "Then, boss, you should also get some rest. If there's anything, just drop us a message, and we'll take care of it. We're on call anytime!" "Alright, you guys take a break too." Fang Zhao led Juanmao back to their room and filled a bowl with dog food. Juanmao nibbled away reluctantly, savoring each morsel as if it were precious—knowing once the bowl was empty, the next meal was hours away. No more freewheeling for Juanmao after landing on Hidden Star—aside from the prescribed dog food, it was forbidden to snack, especially not in excess. "Self-control is key," advised Fang Zhao. "Behave, and I'll let you watch TV. They've got live broadcasts here on Hidden Star." Juanmao gulped down the last of the dog food and nudged the clean bowl towards Fang Zhao as if to say—See? I didn't even gulp down the bowl. I've been good, right? "Fine, go watch some TV on your own." Once Fang Zhao uttered these words, Juanmao scampered to the TV, flipped to the political news channel, and settled into a pose of utmost seriousness. Later, Fang Zhao retreated to his study. Juanmao sneaked a glance inside, saw Fang Zhao engrossed in work, and secretly changed the channel to a live gaming tournament, utterly captivated. Fang Zhao, in his study, let out a silent sigh. He was well aware of Juanmao's subtle maneuvers but chose to ignore them, grateful for anything that could divert its attention and prevent a drooling spree. As he sifted through the music score manuscript, Fang Zhao continued refining his plan. For the upcoming performance, Fang Zhao was tasked with breathing new life into 'Legend' through a fresh recomposition. The revised composition had already received Molang's stamp of approval. In matters of interpreting the essence of the piece and the composer's intent, Molang placed his trust solely in Fang Zhao. Fang Zhao's plate was full: coordinating with band members, supervising rehearsals, identifying and rectifying imperfections, and crafting solutions were all on his agenda. Midway through his planning, the doorbell chimed. He hadn't bothered with a 'Do Not Disturb' sign, curious about who might seek him out at this hour, as the other artists had all sought the solace of their rooms. Upon opening the door, he was greeted by a young man flanked by two soldiers. Fang Zhao's gaze briefly lingered on the young man's golden badge, a flicker of surprise crossing his face. Though he had just arrived on Hidden Star, Fang Zhao had quickly learned what the badge signified. The soldiers were likely tasked with ensuring the young man's safety. Individuals adorned with a gold badge commonly had security details during their outings. Attaining a gold badge at such a tender age signified a talent of paramount importance, justifying the need for protection. The youth, upon laying eyes on Fang Zhao, was visibly excited, albeit somewhat restrained. "Fang, Fang, Fang, Brother Fang! My name is Yuan Zheng! I'm your number one fan—like, the die-hard, forever kind!" His proclamation was emphatic and resounding, especially the last few words. The soldiers behind him: "..." What happened to the sensible fan they had been briefed on? Perhaps nerves had betrayed him? But Yuan Zheng was oblivious to any slip-up, his mind awash with the thrill of standing before his idol. "Brother Fang, am I intruding?" Yuan Zheng sheepishly scratched his head. "Not at all, come in," Fang Zhao said, a welcoming smile gracing his lips. "Ah! Thank you, Brother Fang!" As Yuan Zheng stepped inside, the soldiers followed suit. Regaining his composure, Yuan Zheng hurriedly clarified, "Brother Fang, these two are here for my safety. It's protocol for gold badge engineers like myself to be accompanied by at least two soldiers for protection when we go out." "Of course." Fang Zhao offered the soldiers a drink and then turned his attention to Yuan Zheng. Before his idol, Yuan Zheng was determined to showcase his achievements. He had adorned himself with all his medals, polished his tiny gold badge symbolizing his rank among Hidden Star's engineers, not wishing to fall short in Fang Zhao's eyes. "I was born and raised on Hidden Star, and now I serve as a gold badge engineer at the Foldspace Engine Technology Institute. My parents too are engineers in the same field. I am the second generation in our family to embrace this profession. Brother Fang, you can refer to people like us as the 'Second Generation of Foldspace Pioneers'! I have played a pivotal role in numerous key projects..." "Cough!" Yuan Zheng had barely begun when one of the soldiers coughed discreetly, a reminder that certain topics were off-limits. Interrupted, Yuan Zheng skipped over the forbidden details and continued, "Anyway, I'm a pretty big deal! When it comes to sheer genius, I'm the first... second in our institute, except for the young Master Xiong who recently arrived, making me the youngest gold badge engineer at our institute!" Yuan Zheng managed to say this with a tinge of discontent. He had been the institute's crowning genius until that Xiong kid turned up, and suddenly he found himself displaced from the top spot. "Knowing you were coming, I prepared a grand gift! I crafted a model of a fleet with my own hands! Sadly, after it went through security, only a single part remained... And I missed the afternoon's meet-and-greet too." The further he spoke, the softer Yuan Zheng's voice grew, his expression morphing into an awkward and sorrowful smile as he handed over a component no bigger than a nail. A model of an entire fleet had been reduced to this minuscule part after security checks. It was a compromise Yuan Zheng had been forced to accept; even his status as a prodigious gold badge engineer offered no exemptions. Yuan Zheng lacked any other gifts worthy of presentation. The rush had hindered thorough preparation, leaving him with only this part to offer. "Since you'll be on Hidden Star for a while, I'll go back and create a gift that can pass through security checks with ease!" "This part is quite extraordinary in itself." Fang Zhao accepted the modest piece, "This is from the foldspace engine in the model, isn't it?" "Exactly!" Yuan Zheng, about to continue, caught the soldier's soft cough and swallowed his words. Yuan Zheng felt wronged. It was a challenge! For a gold badge engineer and a starstruck fan, life was tough! There were countless things he couldn't discuss, gifts he couldn't give, and in front of his idol, he barely dared to speak! As Yuan Zheng agonized over what to say next, he looked up to see Fang Zhao watching him. A smile, warm and benevolent. Confused by Fang Zhao's gaze, Yuan Zheng saw him extend a hand, presenting a box the size of a palm. Inside lay a model of the Sea Emperor Dragon's skeleton. "For me?" Yuan Zheng stammered, his excitement causing his words to stumble. Fang Zhao nodded. Yuan Zheng stretched out his hands, accepting the box with reverence, as if he were receiving a sacred relic. "Brother Fang, may I ask for your autograph on the base of the model?" "Certainly." Fang Zhao selected a pen and inscribed his name on the base of the Sea Emperor Dragon skeleton model. Wishing not to overstay his welcome and mindful of Fang Zhao's rest, Yuan Zheng bid farewell soon after. He cradled the box containing the model close to his chest until he was well outside the room. A short distance away, Yuan Zheng's eyes began to well up. "It's overwhelming! To think that even a partial gift from me could be met with such a generous gesture from Brother Fang!" However, the soldiers by his side couldn't relate, "As per regulations, we need to conduct a security check on any external gifts you receive. Please cooperate." Though the luggage of the artists who had been invited had gone through extensive security checks, Yuan Zheng's received gift was no exception; it too had to be scrutinized. For the sake of his personal safety, of course. Reluctantly, Yuan Zheng handed over the model box, "Handle it with care, please. Don't snap any bones, especially the base—don't smudge the signature!" Back at the institute, Fang Zhao didn't resume his prior work. Instead, he pondered the modest gift he had received. Yuan Zheng had divulged very little, yet from it, Fang Zhao could piece together certain insights. Combining these with the myriad questions that had lingered in his mind, a theory began to crystallize. He recalled Barbara's words upon the discovery of the Yaoguang vessel—"The 'Dream Team' of the veteran explorers carried the pinnacle of wisdom from that era!" "The pinnacle of wisdom from that era... " Fang Zhao mused, his gaze lingering on the tiny component in his hands, as if peering through it to envision scenes from a distant past. The Yaoguang vessel, belonging to the 'Dream Team,' was an artifact from four centuries ago. Yuan Zheng had also mentioned "Little Xiong," possibly referring to the child with an unassuming appearance yet harboring a mechanical core whom Fang Zhao had encountered before—the child once aboard the Yaoguang vessel. Capable of perfect camouflage among the masses, this was no ordinary artificial intelligence. During the Era of Annihilation, Fang Zhao had crossed paths with many of the era's great scientists. He understood that each spark of human intellect could catalyze a leap in the world's progression. But artificial intelligence, energy technology, spacefold travel, spacecraft, and more—all emerging in the span of a mere hundred years since the dawn of the New Era, each marked by a brilliant flash of ingenuity—how probable was that? In the interim, there was also the need to revive a world ravaged by calamity, to rebuild city planning, to establish the New Order of the Twelve Continents. "Is it the great surge of intellect, or..." Fang Zhao's stare fixed on the tiny part, as if through this minuscule object, he was witnessing an epoch extending far beyond. Another possibility surfaced. "Outsiders." Visitors from the stars. Chapter 468: I'm Still a Baby The actual situation remained uncertain for Fang Zhao. But from the information at hand, if there were indeed outsiders, the most likely 'extraterrestrial' would be the legendary inventor of the Foldspace Engine and founder of the Gathered Stars Foundation, the 'Stellar Master.' His transformative contributions had cemented the unique status of the Gathered Stars Foundation. The objectives of these 'outsiders' were shrouded in mystery, as was their number. But so far, they seemed not to harbor any hostility, instead fostering many top talents. These, however, remained conjectures. Fang Zhao reminisced about his initial shock upon 'resurrecting' in that tiny rental on Black Street and first witnessing this brave new world. With a chuckle, he examined the small, unassuming component in his hand and placed it in a box. 'The future is now.' —— At the security checkpoint of the Hidden Star Foldspace Engine Technology Institute, a familiar scene unfolded with a new twist. A teary-eyed child adorned with a gold badge lay sprawled on the counter. 'Wah—You can't confiscate my Little Fortune! My Little Fortune, wah! Wuuu—' His sobs were tumultuous, with a melodramatic cadence. The red-rimmed eyes and quivering lips, occasionally broken by hiccups, induced a sense of guilt in the security officer. This emotional display was atypical for the usually composed officer. With a burgeoning headache, the officer tempered his voice, 'That black orb... your Little Fortune, is currently under inspection.' Even talking to this prodigy, more talented than Yuan Zheng, required a gentle approach to avoid startling him. Yet, another cry erupted at the mention of an inspection. 'It's been precisely fifteen minutes and seven seconds! Why is the security check so prolonged? Has something befallen my Little Fortune?' The child continued his lament, face buried in his arms, tears surging even stronger. The officer glanced at the clock on the wall, silently impressed by the child's gold-badge engineer precision in timing, right down to the second. Complex security checks naturally took time. Yuan Zheng’s model fleet had taken much longer, after all. It had been merely fifteen minutes. After another long five minutes, the black sphere returned with an approval mark. The officer eagerly handed it over, noting its smooth texture—perfect for stress relief, evidently cherished by the child. Once Little Fortune was safely back with him, the child insisted, 'And what of my Dog Egg and Dog Surplus? What rules have they violated? I'll be engulfed by loneliness and fear without them!' 'Those are considered hazardous and cannot be taken outside without authorization. As for your safety, rest assured, we have personnel to ensure your protection,' the officer explained. 'I insist on having them! My Dog Egg and Dog Surplus, wah—so pitiable, wah—' As the child's tears continued, he took a gulp from a water bottle retrieved from his backpack, then resumed his loud sobs. The officer, now contending with a double headache, had sought guidance on how to handle the two mechanical dogs. They were personal items of the child, yet weaponized, necessitating a careful approach. While awaiting a decision, the officer found a lollipop in his drawer and offered it in hopes of soothing the child. 'Here, have some candy. No more tears.' With a sniffle, the child pocketed the lollipop and continued to sob softly. The officer: '...' My head is pounding. At last, amid the child’s incessant weeping, approval was obtained. The officer breathed a sigh of relief and attempted a friendly smile. 'You're cleared. You may take Little Fortune, along with Dog Egg and Dog Surplus. Just be sure to follow the rules while you're outside.' 'Alright!' The tears ceased instantly. With a spring in his step, the child leaped off the chair, collected the mechanical dogs, and with the black sphere in hand, joyfully departed. The officer: '...' Such an abrupt shift in demeanor. Was it all just an act? Are the children of today all this cunning?!! The officer felt today's events were enlightening. Dashing out the door, the child, Xiao Xiong, reveled in his successful ploy. Youth is indeed a privilege! Being young allows for a bit of whimsy! The institute indulged in genius children, and Xiao Xiong's significant role in the development of the next-gen Foldspace Engine meant that his occasional whims and tantrums were minor issues. As such, everyone indulged him. Nevertheless, Xiao Xiong was discontent with the pace of the engine's advancement. It had been four centuries since he had commanded the Yaoguang vessel, and the progress appeared excruciatingly slow! In the past era, with seven super-intelligences and the Stellar Master collaborating, the pace of research was swift, and upgrades were frequent. The efficiency of today's engineers paled in comparison. Regrettably, four centuries later, the other super-intelligences were either destroyed for rebellion or had malfunctioned into dormancy. Only he remained active. Ah, the seven super-intelligences that once accompanied the Stellar Master! Now, only he was left. And that was... electrifying!! Hahaha, free from their tyranny! I'm at the helm now! Those six who once overshadowed me have finally vanished!! Who needs peers when humans are so much more delightful! Especially these—so delicate and non-threatening. I relish playing with these beings brimming with emotion! Should I ever grow weary, I can simply create new playmates. Xiao Xiong was extremely content with his current state of being. Since his return from the Yaoguang vessel, his days had been free-spirited. ...Except for one vexation. Why am I compelled to work? I was a baby four centuries past, and I remain a baby today! The world is so enchanting, and my adventures are far from complete! If not for a debt to clear, who would willingly come here?! Bound by regulations, even leisurely excursions necessitate security checks—they almost detained Little Fortune! And I am constantly shadowed when venturing outside. Xiao Xiong spared a disapproving glance at the soldiers trailing him and pouted. He had adopted the expression from a child star on the holovision, claiming it made one appear more endearing and winsome. But Xiao Xiong reserved his pouts for strangers. To attempt such antics in front of the formidable Cuihua was to invite trouble. Though the Stellar Master had passed, his descendants still had ways to keep him in check, like Cuihua. In Xiao Xiong's eyes, Cuihua was a tyrant, an ogre demanding overtime—a dreadful overlord!! Was it just to be thrust into this den of workaholics merely for borrowing some funds to secure music copyrights?! Fortunately, he was adept at playing his role as a child. Xiao Xiong continued to beam with pride. He reveled in how these fragile humans treated him with the consideration due to a minor, sparing him many inconveniences. Aside from a select few at Hidden Star and core managers at the Gathered Stars Foundation, no one knew his actual age. Hehehe~~~ With this thought, Xiao Xiong's mood soared once more. Let there be overtime, as long as there's amusement to be had! Xiao Xiong mulled over excuses for future outings, imagining jaunts with his mechanical companions, as he ambled toward the hospitality section. He was off to find Fang Zhao. Word of Fang Zhao had circulated within the institute. The artists invited to the Hidden Star Performance had arrived that day. Fang Zhao was privy to his secrets and had a genial nature, which made Xiao Xiong keen to spend more time with him. At least in Fang Zhao's presence, he could be himself without fear of rebuke. After sharing his emotional experience with 'Genesis,' Fang Zhao had even reminded him to hydrate. Such a considerate individual! The reception staff recognized Xiao Xiong at once; his unique appearance—a gold-badged child leading two mechanical dogs—was unmatched on Hidden Star. Xiao Xiong had also stayed at their facility upon arrival, leaving a strong impression. Yet, due to Xiao Xiong’s gold-badge engineer status, he was more often addressed with deference as 'Young Master Xiong' rather than 'Little Xiong' or 'Master Xiong'. For such an esteemed technical talent, especially one of youthful age, leniency was the norm. When Xiao Xiong expressed a desire to see Fang Zhao, the reception staff personally escorted him upstairs. Upon entering the elevator, Xiao Xiong offered the building manager a lollipop from his pocket. They didn’t accept gratuities, but a lollipop was a gesture of goodwill, particularly from a child. The building manager didn’t decline, accepting the candy with thanks and a cordial smile. He began to pat Xiao Xiong’s head but halted at the sight of the gold badge, then retracted his hand. A gold-badge engineer's head was not just any head to pat. This was respect for an elite talent! Inside Fang Zhao’s room, Juanmao, engrossed in an esports broadcast, perked up his ears. He licked his nose and, with some effort, shifted his gaze from the screen to the door. He walked over, drooling, and lay down with his eyes glued to the door. Fang Zhao, deep in score editing, also turned his attention to the closed door. On the other side, Xiao Xiong’s footsteps slowed as he neared, his pace shrinking, his stride slowing. The healthy color drained from his skin, leaving a ghastly pallor; beads of sweat formed on his brow. He paused. Caught up in the excitement of his ruse, he had overlooked something critical. Now, it dawned on him. In Xiao Xiong's hands, the previously relaxed Little Fortune tensed back into a perfect sphere. Seeing Xiao Xiong’s abrupt stop, the building manager pointed out, 'Fang Zhao’s room is right ahead, less than five meters away.' 'No, I think now isn't the right moment. Better not to disturb,' Xiao Xiong shook his head emphatically, refusing to move forward. Concerned by Xiao Xiong’s sudden pallor and profuse sweating, the building manager became alarmed—a prodigy must not be distressed! 'Are you feeling unwell? Allow me to escort you to the medical room downstairs!' he suggested, ready to call for medical support. 'No, no, no, an urgent matter just came to mind. I must leave! Farewell!!' With that, the 'mischievous young master' whisked his dogs away and made a quick exit. Having escaped the reception area, Xiao Xiong wiped off the sweat and, using his employee card, downed a bottle from the water dispenser. Today's dehydration was significant; he needed to replenish fluids. Looking regretfully at Dog Egg and Dog Surplus, who seemed oblivious to the recent ordeal, Xiao Xiong reproached himself: 'I've squandered my entire paycheck on you two blockheads!'
Chapter 455: Turnaround 3 "Allow me to demonstrate the sensing of Formless Fluctuation; it's remarkably straightforward," interjected another sorcerer, a smile evident in his voice. "Your assistance is appreciated," Lin Sheng responded, offering a nod of gratitude. Time was of the essence in finding the remaining Fragments. He had initially planned to conquer an array of Great Evil Spirits to amass substantial reserves of pure soul power. Yet, the present opportunity necessitated an immediate and decisive acquisition. Promptly, the sorcerer leader brought Lin Sheng to a daunting Evil Spirit Gate. Both extended their hands, gently touching the gate's enigmatic frame, eyes closed as one. The leader rapidly employed his Special Ability to establish a Spatial Foundation, thus setting a Coordinate Code. Through the Ritual Fluctuation of the Evil Spirit Gate, he steered Lin Sheng's perceptive consciousness, sending them both hurtling with the pulse of the ritual. "Ordinary portal rituals are designed for point-to-point directed transport," he explained. "However, our venture into New Spatial Secret Realms modifies this to point-to-multipoint. A minor adjustment to the Transmission Foundation's parameters is all that's required." While guiding Lin Sheng's awareness, the leader shared his technical wisdom. "Consequently, the Evil Spirit Gate instinctively relays our consciousness to a spectrum of potential spaces resembling our intended target. It's akin to casting energy into the winds of chance—good fortune might lead us straight to the desired Secret Realm World; misfortune, on the other hand, means more energy and attempts are needed." "Truly, it is left to the whims of fortune." Lin Sheng kept his thoughts to himself. Upon entry into the Evil Spirit Gate, his Sensing was immediately enshrouded by the Ritual Fluctuation and dispersed. Simultaneously, as if his consciousness had splintered, his awareness divided into over a dozen segments, each discerning a vastly different spatial essence. "Normally, our consciousness struggles to maintain integrity during transmission. Thus, we commit to memory the spatial coordinates that our primary consciousness encounters. To secure these coordinates, we inscribe a simple Marker..." Outside, the sorcerer leader continued his subdued instruction, aiding Lin Sheng in crafting an elementary Marker to confirm the Coordinate Code. He was oblivious, however, to Lin Sheng's soul's exceptional strength and resilience, which allowed him to remember the coordinates of all spaces his fractured consciousness touched. Multitasking was simply another exercise for Lin Sheng, who routinely practiced observation and control through his Summoned Entities via split awareness. Though he was not yet adept at commanding multiple Summoned Entities to act independently, merely memorizing Fluctuations and setting coordinates was well within his capabilities. His soul's inherent toughness granted it a more extended existence, making the task seem almost effortless. A scant ten minutes passed before his consciousness, now exhausted, faded away. Lin Sheng reopened his eyes and faced the sorcerer leader and his astonished peers. "Locate this Secret Realm World coordinate for me." Without delay, he disclosed a specific Secret Realm World coordinate that he had sensed—a realm whose essence echoed with the fragment of the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel in his grasp—to the astounded sorcerer leader and his team. "Achieved in a single attempt?" The sorcerer leader experienced a twinge of envy, recalling the grueling half-month it took to sense spatial energies and document coordinates for the first time. "The method is elementary. Initiate the Portal. I will cross," Lin Sheng instructed firmly. "At once." "Pause, my physical vessel," Tiangong Xia's soulful transmission interrupted Lin Sheng's preparations. "What arises?" As Lin Sheng observed the sorcerer leader and others commanding the Evil Spirits to assemble resources, he moved aside to await further instructions, all the while engaged in a mental dialogue with Tiangong Xia. "A situation has developed. A major shift has transpired on Bisha Island!" Tiangong Xia's tone was imbued with a solemn gravity. Lin Sheng had not encountered such a sign before. Not even when he informed her about the King of Night did she exhibit such gravity. An atypical sense of urgency seized him. "Miyue is expected to be at a clear disadvantage, correct?" Lin Sheng inquired, his brow creased with concern. "Or has a new power entered the conflict?" "It is not a new power," Tiangong Xia declared with seriousness. "The truth is Miyue has deceived everyone! The Seven-Lock Tower was summoned successfully long before. He misled all inhabitants of the three major Secret Realms. He had already emerged victorious in summoning Farudo! Using his own being as a sacrificial offering! And has merged with it into a single entity!" Lin Sheng's consciousness briefly stalled. "To offer oneself as a sacrifice?... What madness!" "What now stands before the three major Secret Realms is not simply Miyue but a monstrous synthesis of Miyue and Farudo..." Lin Sheng was momentarily speechless. "How shall we respond?" Tiangong Xia's voice carried a weight of impending consequence. The union of Farudo and Miyue was a complex multiplication of forces, not mere addition. "Remain composed. For Miyue and Farudo, the primary adversaries are still the three major Secret Realms and the legion of other significant powers. Besides, this world is more intricate than you might surmise," Lin Sheng reflected on the intelligence he had previously compiled. "The denizens of Great Star Pond and those who wield the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts are formidable entities. As long as they refrain from provoking us, we have little reason to interfere with their machinations." "I apprehend your reasoning. Yet, vigilance is advisable," Tiangong Xia recommended. "I once bore power of such cataclysmic scale. It was during the epoch when I was under the Demon Sword's dominion. I am intimately aware of the havoc such power can wreak." Lin Sheng fell into contemplation. Among his lieutenants, Tiangong Xia was unparalleled. She had once been under the influence of a particularly potent force. At that juncture, she even perceived Lin Sheng's scrutiny within her recovered memories. That mere residual impression in her memories was enough to detect Lin Sheng, who had been delving into her past. Such formidable power transcended Lin Sheng's comprehension. "I understand," Lin Sheng reassured her. "I shall make the requisite preparations. Be assured." If necessary, he would call upon the most formidable of states, summoning all his lieutenants' powers and merging them into himself. Severing the link with Tiangong Xia, Lin Sheng's attention returned to the newly established Evil Spirit Gate. His thoughts circled back to the original plan. "The portal is primed for activation, Your Excellency," the sorcerer leader intoned with a deep respect. Lin Sheng pondered the Portal, his silence replete with expectation. "Bring forth the Fairy King. Moreover, Degaar!" "Present." The Demon Hand Degaar had been near, awaiting the summons. Answering the call, he strode in from the entrance. "Your Excellency, I am at the ready to enact your will." Lin Sheng acknowledged him with a nod. "My intention is to activate several Portals concurrently, to investigate various Evil Spirit Realms." "Assemble a hundred of the Great Evil Spirits, organize them into teams of diverse sizes, and commence exploratory missions." "By your command!" Degaar, the Demon Hand, felt a surge of solemnity, aware that his sovereign must have stumbled upon a critical juncture. Otherwise, there would not be such an urgent, widespread call to exploration. Chapter 456: Moving Forward Heeding the edicts of Lin Sheng, the formidable leader of the Evil Spirit Legion, the exploration of the vast Secret Realm Worlds commenced. The Demon Hand Degaar, upon receipt of his orders, promptly engaged in the mobilization of the legions. Concurrently, the sorcerers dispatched messages to the Fairy King, initiating the assembly of their forces. Shortly thereafter, the Fairy King, accompanied by an entourage of elite Herald Officers, emerged from within an Evil Spirit Gate. 'Master, your orders?' intoned the figure of impeccable form, marred only by the presence of a single eye, as she bowed before Lin Sheng. 'I require the Fairy Empire to send forth a legion of enslaved warriors to scour the New Spatial Secret Realm. The methodology of exploration lies with you; I demand results.' The Fairy Empire, an amalgamation of fairy and human kin, necessitated a more nuanced approach than the more direct methods suitable for the Evil Spirit tribes. The deep-seated bonds and allegiances among them meant that setting objectives and expecting outcomes was the optimal strategy, allowing them to utilize their own techniques to fulfill the mission. 'Your will shall be done, my lord,' the Fairy King affirmed, her composure unshaken. She possessed a greater array of tactics for exploring new domains with minimal casualties compared to Degaar's direct approach. After delegating the tasks to both the Fairy King and the Demon Hand Degaar, Lin Sheng concentrated on the new spatial secret realms, searching for any space that might bear the whisper of fragments. Perceiving, documenting coordinates, then crafting gates and dispatching armies to delve into the unknown. Portal after portal materialized across the plaza. As time inexorably moved forward, legions of Evil Spirits and the Fairy Empire's forces embarked on their mission. Initially converging here, they then dispersed into the myriad secret realms. A considerable outlay of transportation resources was expended, and a diverse array of materials was consumed. In response, a relentless march of over ten thousand from the combined forces of Evil Spirits and Fairies entered the portals that now stood open. Days elapsed. Some gateways were sealed by Lin Sheng after being appraised for their lack of value, while others, brimming with resources or academic intrigue, were preserved. Amongst them, Lin Sheng discerned three that exuded the scent of fragments. He dispatched significant forces to each for thorough examination. The reports indicated that these realms were expansive and teeming with intelligent life. The quest for divine artifacts was too perilous to entrust entirely to his subordinates. The notion of them securing and concealing the fragments was intolerable. Upon reflection, he resolved to have his forces assess the informational landscape of these realms before he would personally venture forth. His objective: to swiftly locate the fragments and secure them. ... On Bisha Island. 'Soul Breath Gaze.' Farudo, or perhaps it was Miyue, looked upward. From her back sprouted a dense thicket of grey tendrils, weaving together to form a formidable humanoid countenance. The visage, adorned with innumerable crimson eye beads, fastened its penetrating gaze upon several Emissaries in the distance. Buzz! An imperceptible wave of energy traversed a secret conduit, instantaneously spanning kilometers to afflict the Emissaries in full flight with pinpoint precision. 'No!!!' One of them screamed in terror as his protective barriers burst like fragile bubbles. With the disappearance of his defenses, his form grotesquely contorted under the sway of some arcane force. Boom! In mere moments, the chieftain from Euro Hell Inferno twisted like a marionette, segmenting into parts that cascaded down into the sea below. The others, witnessing this, fled with even greater desperation. This was beyond a contest of numbers; it was now a matter of survival. Farudo had ascended to a realm beyond the Emissaries, where the absence of an equal force signified certain demise. 'Shadow Hand.' At Farudo's behest, a shadowy, ink-black appendage extended from his maw, reaching for the fugitives in the distance. Puff puff! Two Emissaries fell as effortlessly as lambs before the slaughter, their essences scattering as they plunged into the sea beneath. Bisha Island lay drenched in blood and strewn with remnants. The last vestiges of power unleashed by the dying Emissaries had transformed it beyond recognition. The surface of the island had been sheared away, its elevation lowered by more than ten meters. Farudo stood upon the desecrated banner of Paradise Tower, his gaze settling upon the life-drained husks of the tower's mightiest—the Golden Armor White-Winged Male and the Crimson Angel. 'It is a regrettable conclusion. Ultimately, I am the victor,' he mused, a peculiar smile playing across his decaying visage. 'Do you presume... you... are assured of your victory?' From an outcropped slab of rock, an old man, impaled and bloodied, spoke defiantly. 'Still among the living?' Farudo inquired, his gaze turning to the elder. 'Xiji, had you not intervened this time, your end might have been different,' he surmised. Now a hybrid with Miyue's memories, Farudo was a fusion of her being and the original Farudo, inheriting her personality and emotions. He was not the complete Farudo but rather a manifest representative. 'Heh... This time, it is my defeat... But this world is more complex than you perceive. There will be those who shall seek retribution for me. Just wait...' The old man's voice was chilling as he spoke. 'I await with anticipation,' Farudo declared, extending his hand as a colossal ashen mist arm formed behind him, seizing the elder with unrelenting force. Squish! A spurt of blood erupted within the grasp of the ashen hand. 'What a lamentable loss. Another old acquaintance... has departed...' Farudo gazed skyward, his sigh laden with feigned sorrow. Around him, not one Emissary from Euro Hell Inferno remained intact. As he simulated grief, a silent, silver spike stealthily targeted his nape, wielded by none other than the paramount of White Paper, Sun Crown Celestial Kaysa, his pallor indicative of the grave injuries sustained in the recent clashes. He had managed to obscure himself, yet the environs of Bisha Island were now suppressed by a formidable Crimson Halo Forcefield. To even graze the edge of the forcefield was to reveal oneself. Even at his zenith, he could scarcely endure an offhand strike from Farudo. To fail in concealment was to embrace certain doom. Hence, he was compelled to return, seizing any fleeting opportunity. 'Soul Stabilizing Spike... Just a touch, regardless of the state of injury, can render a lifeform's soul inert, suspending consciousness for a full turn of the day.' Sun Crown Celestial Kaysa steeled his will, cognizant that if he failed to incapacitate Farudo swiftly, an escape would prove elusive. Rather than resign to oblivion, he opted for a direct confrontation! His Emissary's Special Ability, the art of concealing his vital essence and life fluctuations, permitted him to vanish within an unseen, intermediary dimensional rift. Only in the instant of aggression would his presence and energy unfurl. This was the keystone of his ascendancy as the pinnacle of Sun Crown. The silver spike edged closer to Farudo's nape. Five meters. Three meters. Two meters. One meter. Suddenly, the spike lunged forward. 'Incantation: Deterrence!' Farudo's voice erupted spontaneously. Swoosh! A ripple of pure grey shockwave burst from him, radiating outward in all directions. Chapter 457: Onward, Part 2 The ripple carried a potent shock, and in a flash, it forced the Spatial Sorcerer behind Farudo into retreat. 'Incantation: Fortitude.' 'Incantation: Spectral Bind.' 'Incantation: Suffocation.' 'Advanced Murderous Manacles.' 'Advanced Deathly Gaze.' 'Ultimate Infernal Demon Blade.' As Farudo unleashed a series of demonic chants, a dense array of mystical lights of various colors burst forth around him. Simultaneously, bizarre and diverse effects of the demonic chants detonated upon the Spatial Sorcerer. Bindings, soul suppression, the stare of death, scorching flame damage, asphyxiation, psychic intimidation, and more. These high-tier evil abilities, usually requiring at least a day to prepare, were as simple tricks to Farudo. Effortlessly, he instant-cast them with spoken words. By the time the Spatial Sorcerer regained his senses, he had only managed to resist and dispel two of the demonic effects, unable to fend off the rest. Layer upon layer of these effects perfectly ensnared him, transforming him into a powerless grey and black bundle. Pfft! Without a word, Farudo extended his right hand, thrusting forward to pierce the Spatial Sorcerer's forehead. His hand, like a sharpened blade, easily penetrated the skull of the Spatial Sorcerer, pulverizing his brain into disarray. Boom!! As the Spatial Sorcerer perished, the immense energy he had amassed as an Emissary exploded, igniting into a fiery orb that suddenly engulfed Farudo. Once the red flames cleared, Farudo stood unscathed. His gaze lifted, looking towards the many military ships now hastily turning tail to flee. 'Next, by opening three distinct passages to the Netherworld, I can ensure the complete arrival of my true self. Likewise, the Hand of the Netherworld shall awaken prematurely.' '...Struggle. Let me relish more surprises... Otherwise, what fun would there be after so many dull years if my rare outing were to end up uneventful?' Farudo stepped forth, softly uttering incantations. 'Incantation: Swift March.' Swish! His body instantly turned into a streak of grey light, rocketing forth like a falling star, surging towards the fleet. ... In an unknown secret realm world. Across the expansive white snowfields, tens of thousands from the Evil Spirit Legion were locked in a ferocious battle with the opposing centaur forces, staining the pristine snow with centaur blood. Their innate immunity to physical attacks meant only a handful of energy weapons could harm the evil spirits. Only a third of the centaur soldiers possessed such weapons, representing the pinnacle of power within this secret realm. Lin Sheng, mounted on his demonic steed, the Bloodfiend, stood clad in heavy, pure white armor atop a hillside, looking down upon the battlefield. His face was concealed by a helmet, his expression unreadable, his eyes exuding a trace of detachment and ruthlessness. 'Have you found what I seek?' he suddenly asked in a deep voice. 'Yes, the Coccyx Chieftain had cunningly attached it to the ankle of his second son. I discovered and retrieved it,' the Fairy King materialized suddenly, kneeling on one knee next to Lin Sheng, presenting a peculiar white-gold bone inscribed with ghastly faces or symbols. The bone, the size of a palm and arc-shaped, bore subtle fractures, signs of past damage. Lin Sheng took hold of it and closed his eyes, feeling its pulsation akin to that of a heartbeat. 'This is it.' He tightened his grip on the bone, casting a final glance at the centaurs fighting desperately below. The Mezhe Tribe, once an unrivaled force within this secret realm, faced a brutal suppression by the Evil Spirit Legion simply for refusing to hand over the artifact Lin Sheng desired. 'Bring them to submission and allegiance. Deal with any dissenters,' Lin Sheng commanded before turning away on his mount. The Fairy Empire's generals knelt, paying their respects as he departed. In a mere four days, Lin Sheng had flattened eleven distinct secret spaces. Ranging in size from as large as a province in Miga to as small as a city in Hengrui Kara, these spaces harbored numerous formidable beings. The most defiant among them was the centaur tribe that governed this secret realm of snowy plains. Having ruled this vast snowfield for far too long, they had forgotten how to treat those more powerful than themselves with due reverence. Thus, when Lin Sheng's envoy arrived, it sparked the beginning of conflict. After the envoy sent by Lin Sheng was mercilessly executed, under Lin Sheng's command, the Evil Spirit Legion amassed and stormed into this secret realm of the snowy plains. The once-proud Mezhe Tribe finally experienced the bitter taste of defeat. The cost was nearly their extinction. Two days later, the Mezhe Tribe's mightiest, the Centaurs' King Kuhl · Warspear, faced Lin Sheng seated upon his throne in the Evil Spirit Palace with a heart heavy with sorrow. With his tribe slaughtered, only a single bloodline remained. In such dire times, the king, previously devoted solely to his martial pursuits, was forced to assume the mantle of leadership. By swearing fealty to Lin Sheng, he sought clemency for his centaur kin. Like the Fairy King before him, he had to swallow his pride and join Lin Sheng's ranks to protect the final vestiges of his people's lineage, becoming another pawn in Lin Sheng's forces. From that moment on, Lin Sheng's command included the Fairy King, the Centaurs' King, and the Demon Hand Degaar—three grand legion commanders, each a symbol of their respective race's might. Both the Fairy King and the Centaurs' King had ascended to the formidable rank of Emissaries. ... While Lin Sheng marshaled his forces and scoured for pieces of the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel, in reality, Farudo, or rather Miyue, perpetrated an atrocity that sent shockwaves across the world. Having decimated a majority of the Emissaries, Miyue—or Farudo—pursued the united world fleet, personally unleashing a ghastly massacre. He didn't just kill. With the vast-reaching Incantation: Descent into Abyss, he froze eighteen military vessels, over thirty thousand souls, in the icy depths near Bisha Island. Trapped in bodies of ice, the soldiers' spirits could only sink to the ocean floor, their minds slowly succumbing to madness in the endless silence and desolation. Boom!!! Above the blue sea, a grey smoky figure materialized behind Farudo. The figure lifted its right arm, catching a massive, elongated missile from the heavens. The intercontinental missile, white and spewing intense orange flames, exerted an unfathomable force, attempting to break the grey figure's mighty grasp. Embedded at the missile's tip was a giant green diamond crystal, pulsing with copious evil energy, fueling the missile with terrifying kinetic energy. But it was futile. Farudo tightened his grip. Creak. The ten-meter-long intercontinental missile, reduced to mere scrap metal, was twisted and crumpled into a lump in his palm. Its internal liquids and powders leaked onto the sea, not a spark of explosion or combustion to be seen. It seemed as though an otherworldly force suppressed the missile's detonation. Chapter 458: Onward Bound 3 Cannon fire shattered the silence as a deluge of artillery rained down upon Farudo from afar. 'Incantation: Reflection,' Farudo intoned, his hand outstretched as a command. A gargantuan square grey barrier materialized before him, its surface etched with maggot-like patterns coalescing around a titanic lion's head. Each pattern was intricately connected to the lion's mane. Boom, boom, boom, boom!! At once, every shell imbued with evil spirit abilities collided with the barrier, halted momentarily, and then, as if repelled by an unseen force, recoiled back along their incoming trajectory. Explosions blossomed across the distant seascape, and amidst the chaos, the infuriated roars of evil energy wielders could be heard, commanding their forces to forsake their ships. Farudo beheld the direction of the assault. 'Redeon lies nearest. Hence, to Paradise Tower shall be my course,' he mused with a smile. A gentle tap upon the ocean's surface summoned a whirlpool of colossal breadth that spun voraciously. As the spray ascended, Farudo's form had vanished from view. ............. ............. Evil Spirit Palace. Click. With a delicate touch, Lin Sheng placed a white gold bone upon a black crystal pillar, and a wonder transpired—the bone autonomously reshaped, fusing seamlessly with the pillar. Concurrently, the pillar thinned and broadened, its edges sharpening into a blade. In less than a score of seconds, the erstwhile rough black crystal pillar had transfigured into a black greatsword over two meters in length with a broad blade. The hilt, wrought from the white gold bone, was dark and unrefined, making the weapon resemble a simple, yet imposing heavy cleaver. Lin Sheng grasped the hilt, lifting the blade with a reverent motion. Hum. The sword thrummed with intensity, emitting a harmonic vibration akin to that of a tuning fork. 'With the fusion of two fragments, is the true essence beginning to emerge?' Lin Sheng pondered in the somber confines of the palace, his hand caressing the weapon birthed from the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel fragments. He sensed that this was not the wheel's ultimate shape. 'Judging from the gaps in the aura's pulsations, at least two more fragments are required to complete the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel.' Lin Sheng held the greatsword aloft, cradling it with both hands. 'One more fragment, and it should awaken the dormant power within.' The Yin-Turned Evil Wheel, a sacred artifact of legend within the Evil Spirit Realm, was said to endow its possessor with dominion over the entire realm, ascending to unmatched overlordship. While Lin Sheng was skeptical of the lore that mere possession could ensure supremacy, he was deeply enticed by the wheel's purported ability to command a multitude of evil spirit special abilities. Seated, he ran his fingers along the greatsword, attuning himself to the concealed yet formidable energy that flowed within. 'Soon... very soon... the third fragment will reveal itself. The whereabouts of the third fragment within the secret realm world have already been ascertained. All that remains is to possess it.' Lin Sheng's visage was calm, yet within his heart, a tempest of anticipation brewed. Presently, the Centaurs' King and the Fairy King had ventured to the realm of the third fragment, to subdue this vast and most formidable space. Lin Sheng awaited the news of their victory in quiet repose. With two emissaries of their stature, the Fairy King and the Centaurs' King, addressing a secret realm world, there ought to be no cause for alarm. Yet before he could immerse himself in the study of the newly fused greatsword, an officer burst into the grand hall, leading an evil spirit soldier who had been cloven in twain. 'Your Excellency, a grave matter has arisen!' The officer's countenance was grave as he proffered a black scroll to Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng received the scroll, unfurling it with a swift motion, and it erupted into a constellation of green luminescence. 'The Fairy King's Shadow Imprint Technique?' He arched an eyebrow. Such long-distance shadow imprint scrolls were exceedingly rare, capable of recording extensive critical information in a passive manner. Ordinarily, they were only activated upon the holder sustaining grievous injuries, capturing the pivotal moments of the incident. Unsure of the exact circumstances, but cognizant that the activation of the shadow imprint scroll signified a formidable adversary's presence, Lin Sheng awaited the revelation with bated breath. The lights from the scroll coalesced to form a triangular screen that began to replay the events that had unfolded. In a grand hall adorned with white pillars, a Black Giant with golden bracers roared fiercely as he engaged in combat with the Fairy King. The Black Giant was clad in a black metal vest of superior defense, and every strike unleashed a concussive force that pocked the hall's floor. The Fairy King met the onslaught with equal ferocity but was gradually being overpowered as the battle raged on. Meanwhile, the Centaurs' King, brandishing a massive spear, was locked in combat with a merfolk titan. The Centaurs' King had assumed his berserker form, his stature enlarged to manifest his full martial might. Already twice the size of an average human, his enlarged form towered nearly five meters in height and three meters in breadth, resembling an immense monolith of flesh. But his adversary was no less formidable. The merfolk titan, nearly as tall, wielded a trident that conjured fierce gale tornadoes with each thrust. The grey tornadoes relentlessly battered the Centaurs' King, disrupting his offensive and defensive maneuvers and significantly curtailing his ability to deliver a decisive blow. 'While seeking to conquer the secret realm world as you decreed, the two legion commanders chanced upon this Giant's Hall. Within resided two Giant Kings, the paramount sovereigns of the entire secret realm,' the officer, a translucent evil spirit with a serpent's head, narrated, his deep voice infusing the palace with a chill. 'Giant Kings?' Lin Sheng contemplated as he stroked the greatsword's hilt. 'Indeed, as translated from the native Evil Spirit Tongue, the indigenous people do indeed refer to them as Twin Giants' Kings,' the serpent-headed evil spirit confirmed. 'So, that realm too falls under the Evil Spirit Realm? And the Twin Kings, they too are evil spirits?' Lin Sheng surmised. 'Precisely.' Lin Sheng lapsed into a moment of contemplation, then rose, greatsword in grasp. He traversed the expanse of the palace to the Portal District. The majority of the portals were now overseen by evil spirits loyal to Demon Hand Degaar. Only those leading to unconquered secret realms remained under the watch of sorcerers from the Fairy Empire. Hiss... As he stepped onto the grounds, a slender figure staggered from the portal at the farthest end. It was the Fairy King, her green armor in disrepair. She teetered upon exiting the portal, nearly succumbing to the ground, if not for the swift intervention of a spatial sorcerer. 'Your Majesty!' The sorcerers of the Fairy Empire converged with cries of alarm. The Fairy Empire, distinct from other evil spirit tribes, held a profound reverence and loyalty for their monarch, the Fairy King. Lin Sheng gestured, and a ray of pure holy power enveloped the Fairy King, commencing the swift mending of her wounds. It was then that he observed her right arm had been severed at the shoulder, leaving a stark, bleeding stump. 'Your Excellency... I have faltered in the task entrusted...' The Fairy King knelt on one knee, her countenance devoid of emotion. Lin Sheng regarded her, wordless. Her injuries spoke volumes of her commitment, leaving no room for censure. After a moment's hush, the red-haired visage of Tiangong Xia emerged from a neighboring portal. 'Accompany me,' Lin Sheng directed Tiangong Xia. 'As you command.' Together, they passed by the Fairy King and stepped into the portal. Close behind them trailed the Evil Spirit King's Guard, Demon Hand Degaar, and a cadre of high-ranking evil spirits. With the Evil Spirit King himself entering the fray, those guards who did not accompany would face an uncertain fate. Chapter 459: Pursuit 1 In the realm of the Giant Evil Spirits. Aaaaah!!! The Centaurs' King bellowed fiercely as his spear clashed against the weapon of the merfolk titan across from him. Behind the merfolk titan, an even larger Gale Tornado had formed, its gray whirlwind generating a formidable suction force, entangling the Centaurs' King with tendril-like streams from all directions. 'Blood Ignition God Spear!! Slay!' In the Centaurs' King's grasp, the spear transformed from pitch black to gleaming silver, its tip radiating a piercing white brilliance as he thrust forward. Boom!! This thrust was once again countered by the swift parry of the merfolk titan's trident. The spear's might and swiftness were heavily impeded by the tornado's drag, making each move increasingly sluggish. Several times the Centaurs' King attempted to break away, but he was held in check by the menacing stare of another black giant nearby, discouraging any retreat. That black giant was a foe he remembered battling the Fairy King; unexpectedly, it had now disengaged to face him here. Clearly, the Fairy King had either been defeated or had taken flight. 'Damn it all!! This accursed cyclopean woman!!' Enraged, he swung his mighty spear, its power stemming from his fury as the Centaurs' King—the more enraged he was, the more ferocious his strength and speed. Thus, his combat prowess was said to surpass all his predecessors. At this moment, rage burned within him like an inferno, nearly doubling his usual might. He dominated the merfolk titan with relentless strikes. But each time he prepared to unleash a devastating blow, he would be thwarted by the black giant's chilling gaze, preventing him from gathering his full strength. This harrowing standoff had persisted for several grueling minutes, and he could feel his wrath waning. While fury could significantly boost his power, it came at the cost of rapidly depleting his vitality and will—a proportional toll. 'No! I refuse to fall here! I must find an opening!' While suppressing his adversary with his war spear, the Centaurs' King covertly surveyed his surroundings, seeking any chance to escape. But the Evil Spirit Legion he had led here was nearly annihilated by the barbarians within the Giant King's Palace. These formidable barbarians, each donned in rough-hewn cloaks and armor, brandished either hammers or vast bone blades. With each swing of their weapon, they would roar mightily, unleashing a peculiar vibrational force akin to that of the black giant—a force that could internally fracture objects, striking terror. The Evil Spirits were undone by these vibrations, their core weaknesses exposed and exploited, leading to their downfall. 'If I remain, I will perish!' The Centaurs' King's mind raced with urgency. But any action he took was matched by the merfolk titan, who persistently engaged him. If he retreated, the titan advanced. If he advanced, the titan withdrew. It appeared the giants sought to exhaust him, aiming to capture him unscathed. 'Damned, damned, damned!!! Woe unto me!!!' The Centaurs' King's heart swelled with unbridled fury. But even as his anger surged, his body, having endured the battle's heat for so long, grew increasingly unable to sustain it. 'You wretches think to slay me? To kill the great Centaurs' King Kuhl · Warspear??!!' 'I shall teach you the price of toying with me!' With all his might, the Centaurs' King swung his war spear. A tempest followed its arc, severing the tornado's filaments of force. Stepping back, gasping for breath, his eyes ablaze with righteous fury, he prepared to invoke the final gambit of his Blood Ignition Secret Technique. It was a powerful combat secret that required the sacrifice of life's flame to unleash. In an instant, it could restore him to his peak condition, and with every attack and defense, a Blood-imbued Energy Shield would coalesce, shielding him from harm. But he was loath to use the secret unless it was his sole recourse. For each use demanded a third of his lifespan—not a fixed amount but a proportionate sacrifice. As he wavered, the merfolk titan, seizing a lapse in his focus, thrust his trident with lightning speed. Slash!! The Centaurs' King's chest was unexpectedly cleaved open by a grievous wound. He realized his foe was no mere challenger but a peer of equal might, requiring a hundred exchanges to discern the victor. 'Outsider, this is not your domain. Since you have come, rest here in peace, to become a trophy beneath my brother and me. This shall be your glorious repose,' the merfolk titan spoke, his voice laden with an antique cadence, as if he had not spoken for ages and was only now finding his voice again. The Centaurs' King inhaled deeply, his blood coursing rapidly to dispel the fatigue that plagued his form. Each swing of his war spear was a burden to his flesh, and recovery grew ever more elusive. 'No... how could I meet my end here!! How could it be!!??' With resolve, the Centaurs' King steeled himself to unleash the Blood Ignition Secret Technique in a final, frenzied bid. 'I will aid you!!' At that moment, the black giant, who had thus far only been an observer, joined the fray. His right fist swelled in the air, bringing a massive shockwave crashing towards the Centaurs' King. Whizz whizz whizz!! An array of Siege Crossbows, as thick as arms and wrapped in sinister halos, shot forth with uncanny precision, aimed at the Centaurs' King. His grand stature now served as a colossal target. Even if he wished to release the Blood Ignition Secret Technique, it was too late. The black giant, the merfolk titan, and the volley of Siege Crossbows all converged in that single moment. The Centaurs' King needed but an instant to adapt and unleash the secret. Yet now, that precious instant was denied. 'No!!' His eyes shot open in horror as he could but watch the black giant's massive fist descend from above. The merfolk titan, meanwhile, had fully engaged his war spear, leaving him no means to counter this strike. 'I will die....!' 'I... will die...!!' In that instant, time seemed to crawl. The bolts from the crossbows. The fist of the Black Giant King. The trident of the merfolk titan. And the ethereal rings of magic that emerged all around him—those were the Giant King's minions casting spells to ensnare him. Time itself appeared to halt. The Centaurs' King was immobilized, his body as frozen as his thoughts. Everything was as if an insect encased within amber. 'Is this my death?' He watched in terror, unwilling, enraged at the surreal tableau unfolding before him. Such a scene was beyond his life's experience, and he had been told that at the brink of death, one would witness unfathomable events. Perhaps this was such a moment. Yet, he found himself puzzled by the shock visible in the eyes of the black giant beyond himself. And the twisted, puzzled expression on the face of the merfolk titan. 'Great Frost Stream Extreme Sword,' 'Do you witness it? This is one of the sublime arcana of my swordcraft, the freezing sword intent that claims all in an instant.' 'Sword intent is the unspoken threat of the blade's edge, felt even before the sword is drawn. And my sword intent, by my very will, can force living beings into a state of frozen oblivion.' 'When life itself is convinced of its demise, it shall wither away.' Chapter 450: Pursuit 2 The Centaurs' King's pupils abruptly contracted as he followed the sound. There, standing serenely behind the Merfolk Titan and the Black Giant King, was a red-haired woman leaning casually against a palace column, her gaze quietly intense. Her hand appeared empty, yet it held the posture of grasping an unseen sword, emanating the threat of a hidden blade. 'To understand my intent is to be engulfed by fear and to shudder. That is the essence of Sword Intent.' The woman, known as Tiangong Xia, gracefully raised her hand, executing a gentle yet decisive slash downward. Instantly, a vivid crimson gash materialized on the right shoulder of the Black Giant King. Hiss!! Blood erupted, splattering upon the ground. 'It's not that time has ceased... it's us who have halted...' the Black Giant King collapsed to his knees, his face a mask of terror. 'Your inherent weakness is the cause,' Tiangong Xia stated plainly. Boom! The grand doors of the palace burst open. A towering figure clad in white heavy armor strode in, ignoring the Giant Kings and the Centaurs' King. He made his way to the highest seat, the Giant's Throne, and sat with imposing dignity. Despite his frame not matching the grandeur of the Giant's Throne, his presence exuded an undeniable sense of oppression and authority. 'I offer you but a single choice,' the figure on the throne proclaimed calmly. 'Submit, or perish.' 'This palace, perched atop the highest peak of the Evil Spirit Realm within the Sakureimon Mountain Range, amidst a world of ice and snow, is well-positioned. It shall be requisitioned for our use,' Tiangong Xia commented with a smile. 'What use are these failures? They are better off dead than alive without function,' she added dismissively. Upon her words, the Merfolk Titan and the Black Giant began furiously striving to shatter their ethereal bonds, trying to break free from the eerie stasis that had immobilized them. 'No... Impossible... Submit to you?! Such an insult! I am the Giant King, Bo Yinghan'er!!' The Black Giant King's muscles bulged with rage, black tendrils sprouting from his fist and forming a dark metallic armor around it. 'Aaaargh!!' He broke free from Tiangong Xia's Sword Intent and swung a ferocious punch at her. The giant fist halted abruptly just inches from Tiangong Xia's face, the force of its stoppage sending her hair streaming back, yet unable to advance any further. 'Admirably executed. You've shown you're not mere refuse,' Tiangong Xia said, her eyes reflecting respect. 'No ordinary combatant could escape my Sword Intent's confines. Your valor is acknowledged.' The Black Giant attempted a roar, but no sound came out; he was denied even the right to make noise. 'Do you feel it?' A sinister smile curled Tiangong Xia's lips. 'Welcome to my Sword Realm, the Silent Resonance.' With a delicate touch, her slender finger tapped the Black Giant's forehead. 'Your blood...' 'Is too loud.' Zzzt... As she pointed, the Black Giant's blood flow began to slow, finally coming to a complete standstill. Within seconds, his blood transitioned from a boiling fury to a chilling stasis. 'Do you know what remains forever silent?' Tiangong Xia's hand caressed the Black Giant's face gently. 'Only death is forever devoid of sound.' 'Enough, Tiangong Xia,' a detached male voice emerged from the throne. Tiangong Xia stepped back, her smile lingering as the oppressive aura receded. The stifled sounds of the environment gradually returned to life. The Black Giant collapsed, weakened. The brief moment of blood stasis had rendered him utterly powerless. The forced immobilization of his blood had caused untold damage throughout his body. Lin Sheng, seated upon the Giant's Throne, surveyed the scene below: two giants, petrified by Tiangong Xia's formidable presence, and an audience equally subdued by intimidation. Those who had braved the harsh external conditions to enter here were beings of substantial vitality and strength. This was why Lin Sheng had resolved to grant the Twin Giants a chance. More armies, more powerful beings, were needed to conquer the further reaches of the Evil Spirit Realm. 'Brother!' The Merfolk Titan, witnessing his brother's dire state, was consumed by a mix of anxiety and fury. His brother's escape from the Sword Intent's grasp did not suggest he could do the same. The Merfolk Titan struggled in vain, attempting to shatter the invisible bonds that held him. If the Black Giant's strength was on par with an Emissary at the pinnacle of power, the Merfolk Titan was merely equivalent to an average civilian Emissary. Civilian Emissaries, often self-taught, could not compare to academy-trained Emissaries in terms of force or natural force fields. Thus, the Merfolk Titan ranked at the bottom tier of Emissaries. Were it not for his brother's worth, Lin Sheng would not have considered recruiting such an underwhelming force. The Merfolk Titan's futile struggle and anguished howls lent the grand hall a sense of tragic bravery. 'Disperse them, Tiangong Xia,' Lin Sheng ordered, his voice devoid of warmth. In an instant, the oppressive force enveloping the giants lifted. They shuddered, then leaped up, charging towards the palace doors. The Black Giant, still mid-air, hurled a punch back at Lin Sheng. The power in his fist was immense, the air itself wailing in agony as his punch created a ripple of distortion, speeding towards Lin Sheng. To the untrained eye, this distortion might appear as a mere shock caused by the movement of the fist. However, it was the full-force eruption of the Black Giant's shock power. To underestimate this distortion as a mere aftershock would be fatal. Lin Sheng watched the incoming distortion of the Shockwave. He stilled Tiangong Xia, who was poised to intervene, and instead raised his left hand, positioning it squarely before himself. The palm stood firm against the Shockwave, resolutely meeting it head-on. Chapter 461: Pursuit 3 With a soft thud, the shockwave distortion, twisted and forcibly compressed, struggled to break free from Lin Sheng's grasp. Yet, astonishingly, his palm, less than one-tenth the size of the distortion, obstinately held it at bay in midair. Soon, the invisible shock distortion found nowhere to propagate and was utterly extinguished upon Lin Sheng's left palm. It was neutralized as effortlessly as the residual tremors of a genuine shockwave. The Black Giant, having witnessed this, felt a chill take root in his heart. Here stood yet another inscrutable, top-tier power. He questioned the very nature of his previous punch—had it truly been just an aftereffect? Without the significant depletion of shock energy within him as proof of his punch's impact, he might have begun to doubt the very essence of his existence. 'How... How is this possible!?' The Merfolk Giant also saw this scene, and similarly harbored doubts about whether his brother had forgotten to employ his magic. Amidst their hesitation, the Centaurs' King, Kuhl · Warspear, had already secured the grand hall's entrance, obstructing their escape. Within Tiangong Xia's Sword Realm, the only ones free to move, aside from the temple's own, were these two Giant Kings. The many sorcerer warriors under the other Giant Kings' command still stood immobilized like figures encased in amber. 'Back off!!' With a single thrust of his spear, Kuhl · Warspear blocked the twin monarchs. Moments ago, he felt like a defeated dog, but now, with his leader and Tiangong Xia present, the situation had undergone a tidal turn of events. From a position of weakness to one of dominance, he now barred the doorway, looming over the two disheveled Giant Kings. 'Feeling bold, weren't you? Just moments ago, you dared to threaten to kill me, hmm??' Kuhl · Warspear basked in the joy of reversal. It was in this moment that he truly relished the might of having strong allies. Particularly when allied with a dependable leader, the transformation from a defeated dog to a mighty warrior was intoxicating. Kuhl · Warspear delivered a mighty punch to the Black Giant King's cheek. With a thunderous boom, the Black Giant King was sent flying, tumbling backward and crashing down in the center of the hall, right before Lin Sheng. Observing the feeble attempt at resistance, Kuhl · Warspear felt an intoxicating rush surge from his tailbone to his head. He was ecstatic. 'This is truly exhilarating!!!' Kuhl · Warspear laughed heartily, his loyalty to the Holy Spirit King skyrocketing in that instant. While he reveled in triumph, the Twin Giants' Kings felt humiliation so profound they nearly spewed blood. The Centaurs' King, their recent underdog, now preened before them. The sight of his repugnant, triumphant visage fueled a fiery rage within them. Just looking at him sparked an urge to annihilate him, let alone face the dramatic reversal of their fates. 'Will you not yield? Is your spine made of steel, then?' Kuhl · Warspear jeered with a sinister chuckle. 'No matter, I, the mighty Kuhl, relish the challenge of breaking in those with unyielding spirits. Hehehe!' His menacing laughter echoed as he put away his war spear and eagerly approached the two Giant Kings. What in the world... What had the Centaurs' King learned under such leadership? Lin Sheng watched Tiangong Xia, speechless. In his absence, it was Tiangong Xia who had been orchestrating the grand scheme. The Centaurs' King respected only those stronger than himself and was most loyal to Tiangong Xia. Lin Sheng had previously instructed Tiangong Xia to impart practical knowledge to the legion commanders, to broaden their understanding. But now, witnessing the scene unfold, he questioned the efficacy of those lessons... Watching the two Giant Kings struggle on the ground, panicked and trying to evade the encroaching Kuhl · Warspear, Lin Sheng felt the urge to facepalm. What direction had this farce taken? He had come to recruit two Emissaries, not to witness a spectacle unfit for minors. 'Will you surrender or not!!?' Kuhl · Warspear's contemptuous laughter filled the grand hall. 'Just kill me! I'd rather die than submit to you!! ....... No!! Don't... I surrender! I surrender!!' The Black Giant King wailed in torment, clutching his brother and desperately retreating. If they did not yield now, they feared they would be stripped bare and humiliated by Kuhl · Warspear. With so many underlings and their own offspring as witnesses, to be paraded and humiliated would be an unfathomable dishonor – one that would mar their legacy for millennia, even in death. Crude as they were, Kuhl · Warspear's tactics proved effective. Observing the two Giant Kings seething with rage and yearning to end him with their glares, Lin Sheng contemplated whether to assign Kuhl · Warspear to a role more fitting of his talents, perhaps as a master of discipline. Discipline seemed to be his true calling, even more so than war. The two stalwart giants, to preserve their dignity, ultimately succumbed to Kuhl · Warspear's coercion and pledged allegiance to the Evil Spirit Legion, becoming two of its commanding generals. The might of the Evil Spirit King's forces swelled once more. Having conquered the Giant Kings, Lin Sheng finally located the third fragment within the Giant's Hall. In the grand treasury of the Giant Kings, the fragment lay quietly as a crystal orb, shrouded in shadow, undisturbed for millennia. Without Lin Sheng's intervention, the Giant Kings might never have realized the significance of the orb, for there were at least a hundred identical orbs in the treasury, indistinguishable in shape, pattern, and substance. Only with the first fragment Lin Sheng possessed could he detect the fluctuation of this fragment and discern the correct crystal orb. Upon entering the treasury, Lin Sheng swiftly selected an array of treasures. He did not isolate the crystal orb but concealed it among a multitude of other varied treasures to extract collectively. Gold, crystals, gems, silver, an assortment of rare treasures, and various strange supernatural artifacts. The Giant Kings' trove significantly enriched Lin Sheng's personal collection as both the Evil Spirit King and the Holy Spirit King. As he secured the third fragment in the Evil Spirit Realm, poised to fuse it and begin mastering the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel's power, a new chapter unfolded in reality. Farudo, the Netherworld Demonic Orator, an existence surpassing even that of an Emissary, finally stepped onto the lands of Redeon, owned by Paradise Tower. Simultaneously, across the globe, all those fated individuals bearing the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts heard the guidance of the Great Star Pond Grandmaster. Directed to converge in a modest town called Deschel within Redeon, they were summoned to unite the power of all sacred relics to challenge Farudo, the Netherworld Demonic Orator from the realm of darkness. ............... ............... Chapter 462: The Consolidation of Power 1 At the forsaken estate on the Western Wheel Border, within a wooden cabin, sunlight filtered through the thin black mist, casting an array of strangely contorted, ever-shifting lines upon the earth. The cabin’s wooden door groaned as it swung open. Adolf, haggard and bearded, emerged from the shelter. He gazed skyward, weariness etched in his face. “Has the encroachment from the Chen'ai Shijie become this severe?” He sighed. Despite the growing incursion of the Chen'ai Shijie and the Dark Tide, such phenomena had no effect on the holders of the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifact—Adolf included. Their powers were ample to fend off the surrounding dust and gloom. Realizing that the formidable enemies of the Chen'ai Shijie would inevitably seek him out for his Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifact, Adolf spent a long time in contemplation. Crafting a feeble lie, he decisively left his birthplace, Shumingdon—abandoning his venerable mentor Lin Sheng, and the temple’s kindred spirits and elders. Confronted with the enemy’s daunting might, Adolf recognized that he must tread his future path alone, sparing others from danger. Clutching a freshly received missive, the meticulous script detailed the vile deeds of Demonic Orator Farudo: the slaying of an Emissary, the freezing and sinking of legions into the abyss of the sea. “To muster the strength of all and invoke the paramount force, to reshape everything—what is the essence of the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifact?” Adolf pondered with a heavy heart, stowing the letter. Donning a wide-brimmed hat and lowering its edge, he strode forth with resolve. This endeavor, whether it led to triumph or demise, had to yield an outcome. Success would mean restoration; failure, at its worst, would mean his death, sparing his kin and comrades. This was the awakening of Adolf. ...... Lin Sheng had never envisioned reaching this crossroads. Sitting within the coarse stone chamber of the Evil Spirit Palace, he faced a cup of searing tea, its faint white steam spiraling upwards. The chamber was modest, no larger than a small basketball court, with circular portals on either end. Along the sides lay armor and weapons acquired from the treasury of the Twin Giants’ Kings, while overhead dangled a grand chandelier brimming with candles. A crimson carpet blanketed the floor, centered by a grand statue of Lin Sheng mounted on the Warhorse Bloodfiend. Lin Sheng’s fingers grazed the crystal orb. Its exterior was slick and chilled, while inside, a silver nebula appeared to slowly revolve, emitting light. The sphere, cloaked in silver-blue, rested on a base of an unidentified pale redwood, giving off a refreshing fragrance. “Evil Energy is nearing suppressive levels, progressing further is not going to be easy. My purpose was to leverage Evil Energy to boost Holy Power, to provoke its growth. Yet now, as an Emissary, Evil Energy scarcely benefits me,” Lin Sheng reflected on his diverse yet impure powers. “Evil Energy, Dragon Blood Special Ability, Holy Power, Soul Power... these are now hindering my advancement. To enhance the quality and density of my power, I must make a choice.” Lin Sheng knew his body was a colossal compression device: only pure, concentrated energy could be compressed faster to reach a higher tier. Since his Holy Power breakthrough into the Emissary tier, he sensed his strength and cultivation progression slowing. Advancement of Evil Energy beyond suppressive levels would require extended accumulation. Holy Power had just broken through and was yet to stabilize. As for the Dragon Blood Special Ability, its potency was set—contingent on chance and bloodline purity. His dragon blood lineage had reached a saturation point; further refinement would need an increase in bloodline purity. However, purity couldn't be casually enhanced—it, too, required compression and refinement. “There is no environment within to refine the clutter of powers. A choice must be made.” After savoring the tea’s delicate aroma, which lifted his spirits, Lin Sheng deliberated. “Firstly, Evil Energy can be discarded. I have no innate aptitude for it; learning was merely for the sake of cross-reference.” Evil Energy was the first to be dismissed. “Secondly, the Dragon Blood Special Ability depends on the bloodline. Initially, my aim was to increase physical fortitude to store more Holy Power. Now, as an Emissary, I can theoretically draw endlessly from the Sea Gate, converting the infinite Soul Power of the Soul Pole Sea into pristine Holy Power.” “This, too, can be temporarily set aside.” “Thirdly, Chaotic Soul Power... An unexpected gift from my connection with the Soul Pole Sea. Infinite, yet lacking systematization, it offers no clear advancement path or direction.” Lin Sheng paused momentarily. “I won’t abandon this yet; after all, Holy Power is fundamentally soul-based. I should prioritize the soul, continuously strengthening, enlarging, and purifying it.” The soul was the cornerstone. Upon this epiphany, Lin Sheng quickly clarified his focal point. “Soul Power is my foundation. With it, Holy Power and Evil Energy are merely derivatives.” He drained his cup and arose. Clutching the crystal orb, Lin Sheng made his way to the inner sanctum of the Evil Spirit Palace—constructed and perfected by the collective effort of all evil spirits and craftsmen from the Fairy Empire, under the command of Demon Hand Degaar and the Fairy King. Initially, the Demon Hand clan led the edifice's construction. Later, the Fairy Empire’s higher echelons, excluding the Fairy King, sought to ingratiate themselves with Lin Sheng, contributing to the palace’s ever-more lavish interior. Power’s allure lies in its ability to draw all else in its wake. “Seize power, and all else will follow,” Lin Sheng mused, approaching the plaque bearing 'Yin Yang Hall' before entering. Two mighty evil spirit generals guarded the sanctum—half men, half insectoids, their lower halves resembling massive centaur-like creatures, firmly planted on dozens of black legs. These formidable warriors, encased in glossy black shells, knelt on one knee, saluting Lin Sheng in silence. Ignoring them, Lin Sheng’s gaze was solely fixed on the peculiar giant blade planted in the sanctum’s center. The Yin-Turned Evil Wheel had undergone subtle, unseen transformations, shrinking significantly and becoming much slimmer. “Three fragments now... Let us see what changes the fusion of three fragments brings...” Lin Sheng reached out, his hand grasping the hilt of the giant blade, while his other hand gently pressed the crystal orb against it. A faint hiss... Something wondrous occurred. The orb, as if liquified, hung suspended, drawn to and merging with the blade’s surface. In mere moments, the orb completely vanished from Lin Sheng’s grasp. Chapter 463: Power Unleashed - Part 2 Lin Sheng, with a calm yet firm grip, held the gargantuan blade, swiftly reclaiming the sacred energy he had embedded within as a safeguard. To deter other beings from tampering with this treasure, he had previously infused the sword’s surface with a potent concentration of holy power, designed to cloak its essence and quell any emanations. This dense holy power also functioned as a protective ward for the artifact itself. Should any entity dare to draw near with the intent to claim the blade, Lin Sheng would be alerted at once and could pursue them, unless they had the means to dispel the thick shroud of holy power he had left as a sentinel. Nonetheless, if a challenger of such might were to arise, subtlety would be redundant; they would likely confront him openly and seize the blade by sheer force. As Lin Sheng dissolved the residual holy power, his contemplative gaze remained fixed upon the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel, now whole from the merging of its three fragments. Then, a sudden, crisp snap resonated. The massive blade he wielded split and descended, its form disintegrating upon the ground as if it were ice cream succumbing to the relentless assault of the sun's rays, the meltdown unnaturally expedited. Lin Sheng, ensnared in a trance, thought he discerned the distant hum of insects and the rustling whisper of raindrops upon leaves. These murmurs swiftly transitioned into the resounding cadence of waves crashing against the shore. It was as if ethereal voices were murmuring secrets beside him, as if a multitude of visions flickered in rapid succession before his eyes. A wealth of knowledge and information, as tangible as the black smoke that arose from the dark, viscous liquid at his feet, enveloped him, shrouding him in a cocoon woven from innumerable voices and data. Time, it seemed, decelerated in this moment. A deluge of insights regarding the Evil Spirits' special abilities surged into Lin Sheng's consciousness, a sensation decidedly extraordinary. This was not a mere inundation of his mind with vast knowledge; rather, it was the presentation of a complete evolutionary scenario—ambiguous yet coherent—that elucidated the true nature of Evil Spirit special abilities. "Yin-Turned..." A voice, faint and feminine, murmured in Lin Sheng's ear. "Yin-Turned..." "Yin-Turned..." The incantation persisted, hypnotic, coaxing forth from Lin Sheng's psyche an enveloping drowsiness. His eyelids grew heavy, and amidst the encompassing darkness, a vast grey wheel slowly emerged from the shadows. The colossal wheel, akin to an immeasurable cog, was marked by spaces for four inlays at its boundary. One by one, the destined inlays revealed themselves. A black crystal pillar. A white bone shard. A crystal orb. And one space remained conspicuously unfilled. Click-click... The wheel turned laboriously, emitting the strained clicks of mechanical distress due to the missing inlay, as though the entire structure could not operate seamlessly without it. Lin Sheng beheld the wheel, noting the delicate engravings of flora and fauna, rivers and mountains that graced its rim. Its surface was alive with characters that writhed and squirmed like a host of insects. This wheel was more accurately a circular artifact of divine enigma rather than a simple wheel. He parted his lips, intending to speak, but before clarity could return to him, the heart of the wheel suddenly yawned open, revealing a small aperture from which three streams of dark crimson blood silently poured forth. With the sound of rushing water, these sanguine streams swiftly approached, encircling Lin Sheng, then burrowing into his chest’s core. Three streams of blood, each etching a unique and delicate pattern upon Lin Sheng's chest. Together, they assembled into a vast and complex wheel. Lin Sheng's eyes snapped open, he shed his armor, and, tearing at his clothing, he gazed down at his chest. Indeed, three blood-red sigils had manifested. Combined, the sigils resembled an incomplete puzzle that, once fully pieced together, would form a red wheel across his chest. At its center lay an eye-like pattern, incessantly radiating a faint grey aura. Within the halo, myriad symbols and scripts seemed to flow endlessly. Lin Sheng's hands were now empty; the massive sword had vanished, as had the pool of black liquid that once lay at his feet. The entity known as the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel seemed to have fully assimilated into his being. He closed his eyes, contemplating the vast amount of information that had just flooded his mind. "So this is the so-called Yin-Turned Evil Wheel... Rather than a wheel, it is more aptly a Forbidden Scripture." Forged by eighty-eight formidable super Evil Spirits during the pinnacle of the Evil Spirit Realm, the artifact marked an era when Evil Spirits were bereft of innate special abilities. They were unique due to their extraordinary anatomical features, but not much else. However, once the super Evil Spirits had crafted this artifact, they used it to transcend their race, employing mysterious and arcane processes to transform themselves into a lineage naturally endowed with potent special abilities. This artifact was not merely a treasure; it was the distilled essence of an entire race striving to break free from their own limitations and elevate their bloodline. It was the magnum opus of the mightiest Evil Spirits, a testament to their quest to overcome the boundaries of their blood and race. Thus, to wield the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel is not merely to comprehend the release of all Evil Spirit special abilities, but to be endowed with the automatic guardianship of protective powers, bestowed by the eighty-eight super Evil Spirits. "Eighty-eight protective powers..." Lin Sheng's eyes widened with realization. He extended his hand, clenching it lightly. He could feel a wondrous force, akin to a protective field, surrounding his body. Within this field, dozens of distinct forces, each with its own unique aura and fluctuation, roamed freely. These forces lay dormant like serpents in shadow, poised to reveal their fangs only when necessity beckoned. "Eighty-eight protective powers, eighty-eight special abilities, can be categorized into four overarching classes," Lin Sheng mentally organized the flood of information. "First, the Self-Strengthening Wheel that amplifies one's very essence." "Second, the Foe's Doom-Weakening Wheel that erodes the fortunes of adversaries." "Third, the Free-Roaming Wheel that permits unfettered traverse." "Fourth..." Lin Sheng's brow furrowed with sudden intensity. "The fourth is yet incomplete... As surmised, only with the final fragment fully integrated can the ultimate power of the wheel be harnessed." "With the first three categories of protective powers in my possession, I wield over seventy such powers. Only a few remain elusive. These absent powers are likely the keystones among them." Lin Sheng's understanding crystallized. He glanced around, not yet venturing to test the might of these protective powers within the confines of the inner sanctum. Instead, with measured strides, he exited the Evil Spirit Palace amidst the bowing Evil Spirits and stepped into the Evil Spirit Teleportation Gate where he had previously acquired the black crystal pillar. Hiss... As Lin Sheng's senses realigned from the disorientation of teleportation, he was met with a surge of pale white flame. Before he could muster a defense, a natural grey luminescence rose from his being, staunchly repelling the inferno. Lin Sheng felt a warmth spreading across his chest and looked down at the torn collar. The red wheel pattern upon his chest now pulsed with greater clarity and a more vivid, blood-red sheen. Chapter 464: Power 3 "Is this the boon of the Wheel of Calamity?" Lin Sheng mused, striding forward through the sweltering inferno with equanimity. The terror-inducing conflagration, harboring the wrath of a five-winged entity, couldn't even graze his skin. Lin Sheng did not call upon any of his formidable powers—be it malevolent energy, holy power, or the dragon blood special ability—he remained unscathed. The newly bestowed power of protection autonomously shielded him from all harm. Within the column of thick, white flame, Lin Sheng gracefully descended from midair to the earth below. "A slight aberration in teleportation, and I was delivered directly into the maw of flames," he observed. After stepping out from the fiery column, he surveyed his surroundings, then with an effortless stomp, he leapt skyward, soaring away. Several thousand meters later, atop a gentle hill, Lin Sheng paused, casting a silent, strategic gaze upon the vast expanse. The plains, riddled with spouts of gray-white flame, bore the scars of a battlefield on the verge of death, clinging to life in a desperate struggle. "This area is fitting for a trial of the guardianship's might," Lin Sheng concluded. He extended a hand, pointing a finger at a distant, erupting column of fire, ready to wield the power of the Wheel of Calamity. Shh! An invisible wave of energy erupted from Lin Sheng's fingertip, hitting the target with unerring precision. The fire column turned translucent, its hue fading until it vanished entirely, as though it had been a mere illusion. Lin Sheng lowered his finger and waited in anticipation. Time passed, and the fire column did not re-emerge. "So, does the Wheel of Calamity's guardianship mean to obliterate an adversary's existence completely?" Lin Sheng pondered, his strategic intellect engaging with the implications. The sacred artifacts, wrought by the most exalted of evil spirits, encapsulated their philosophies on weakening foes. In the Evil Spirit Realm, the supreme spirits surmised that exterminating the enemy's very soul was the ultimate victory. "Could it be that the Wheel of Calamity, by amalgamating a multitude of supernatural abilities, manifests its paramount power in the total erasure of the adversary?" Lin Sheng surmised with clarity. "Now, onto the Self-Strengthening Wheel." He glanced at the Blood Wheel Pattern etched upon his chest and raised his hands, forming the Finger-Crossed Wheel Seal as his memory dictated. "Activate!" His eyes ignited with fervor, and a deluge of blood-red light burst from his chest, enveloping him in its luminous embrace. Shh!!! A colossal beam of blood-red light speared the heavens, stirring the clouds into a maelstrom. The once-gray clouds, now dyed crimson, rumbled with the sound of thunder. The blinding light on the ground transformed into an immense inferno. Within the blaze, a distinct silhouette unfurled its arms. "What form of augmentation is most potent for an evil spirit's self-empowerment?" "The answer is astonishingly... this..." Enveloped in the sanguine glow, Lin Sheng's visage and form were indistinct, his pale golden eyes alone swirling with vortexes of golden light. "This overwhelming might... It fills me with trepidation at what I've become..." "I dread that a mere lapse in my vigilance could unravel the fabric of everything." Lin Sheng's gaze shifted toward the distant horizon, lost in the seductive allure of this boundless and formidable state. With such might at his command, no one could resist his will. Not a single soul. Meanwhile, back in the real world at the Paradise Tower in Redeon, events unfolded differently. "Hahahaha!!" In the gray skies above, Farudo, enshrouded in a black robe with his white hair billowing wildly, erupted into maniacal laughter. He unleashed concentric ripples of gray shockwaves that spread outward, annihilating everything in their wake. Below, the evil energy wielders of the Paradise Tower, assembled as armies, launched relentless barrages of bombardment and firing. It was as if a thick quilt lay between them and Farudo, their efforts failing to even come close. Their artillery and sorceries, feeble as insects, repeatedly tried to breach the barrier of gray shockwaves. Each attempt proved futile, only collapsing back in failure. "Do you now grasp the depths of despair?" Farudo bellowed with laughter. "What a disappointment... The humans of a millennium past were not so insignificant. Heroes abounded, and the mighty stood like a legion. Even I, as a Netherworld Priest, tread with caution." "But now? Behold yourselves." A trace of boredom flickered in Farudo's profound gaze. "What a perplexing sentiment... I find myself yearning for you to be stronger, to provide me with amusement, yet I do not desire your strength to grow lest it tax my spirit. To deplete more of my essence." "Farudo, do you truly intend to eradicate my Paradise Tower entirely?" Among the ranks of formidable evil energy wielders on the ground, a venerable elder with white hair and beard, an eagle perched upon his shoulder, met the gaze of the Demonic Orator in the sky with a cold stare. "As the Demonic Orator, master of the cursed incantations of the Netherworld, you forsake your duties to the Netherworld Lord below, venturing to the surface—do you not fear that the Netherworld will succumb to unrest?" The elder spoke with a calm that belied his intimate knowledge of the Netherworld's inner workings. "Oh?" Farudo voiced his mild surprise. "There remain those above ground who recall the name Farudo, I see." He peered intently at the elder. This was the first instance since departing from Bisha Island that he had given such earnest consideration to a human. "A mere mortal, yet privy to the grand machinations within the Netherworld. It seems I must reassess my view of the Paradise Tower." A smirk danced upon his lips. "What does it matter if I lay this land to waste? We can seek refuge in the secret realms and, after decades, emerge to find a world reborn. But what of you? What price will you, Farudo, who deserted the Netherworld, pay to weather this storm upon your return?" The elder's visage was steely, suggesting that the potential extinction of humanity was but a trivial concern. "How merciless... Compared to the meager numbers the secret realms can shelter, the outer world is vast. And yet, you dare forsake it all with but a single word?" Farudo was taken aback by the elder's resolve. "Is this not the outcome Miyue desired? The fall of an old era, the dawn of a new one." The elder's voice carried a chill that matched the frost in his eyes. Around him, the evil energy wielders of the Paradise Tower, eyes aflame and faces reddened with rage, contemplated the dire future. Looking at Farudo, they were filled with the desire to charge forth and battle to the death. For most of them, their loved ones resided in reality; the secret realms could not house so many. Thus, the annihilation of reality meant the end of their lineages and the destruction of their families. Such a fate was unfathomable. "Is that so?" Farudo arched an eyebrow. "Then let's put this to the test and see how many of you are truly resolved to retreat into the secret realms..." His gaze, weighted with meaning, swept over the evil energy wielders behind the elder. "If words fail to persuade, then actions will suffice. If it is the obliteration of the Paradise Tower you seek, demonstrate the extent of your willingness to sacrifice!" The elder's eyes turned icy, and within his grasp materialized an ancient and frosted Ice Rod. "Form the array!" His voice thundered, his staff striking the ground. Instantly, a vast silver-white Magic Circle illuminated the plain, ensnaring Farudo in the sky above, strategically centered within its confines. Chapter 465: The Final Fragment 1 In the resonant harmony of harp strings, a minstrel arrayed in a lavish robe, their gender as indiscernible as the flutter of a butterfly, plucked the strings of a ballad steeped in the tradition of the Fairy Empire. The ambivalent tone of the singer, as enigmatic as their visage, coaxed nods of acclaim from the legion commanders in attendance. The ballad, a cultural relic of the ancient nobility of 妖精帝国, was imbued with poignant melodies and lyrics that were both ornate and steeped in philosophy. 'Yet, to be serenaded with accolades in my own presence, isn't it somewhat unseemly?' Lin Sheng mused atop the 邪灵王宝座, his gaze falling upon the Centaurs' King at his side and the Fairy King to his right. The Centaurs' King, seeming entranced by the melody, swayed in rapt delight. The Fairy King, her wine untouched, maintained her stoic composure, her single expansive eye rendering her emotions inscrutable. Demon Hand Degaar, occupying a lesser seat within this hall where might dictated rank, stirred restlessness among his brethren, for his power was admittedly wanting. The Twin Giants' Kings, recent converts to the cause, sat with wooden expressions at the table's edge, silently indulging in their feast. Thud, thud, thud... A procession of heavy footfalls heralded an arrival from beyond the hall. 'The 罪龙母 from the 龙墓 approaches!' The announcement from the Herald Officer preceded her entrance. 'The 罪龙母?' A ripple of surprise passed among the legion commanders. Though versed in the existence of the 龙墓 by Lin Sheng and Tiangong Xia, they had not been privy to its inner workings nor laid eyes upon its formidable denizens. The moment to encounter this enigmatic new ally had arrived. As the footsteps hastened, a figure in a dark gown, a bewitching golden-haired siren, entered the grand hall with a poised smile. Amid the tranquil music, she took her central place, bending her knee in a demure curtsy to Lin Sheng. 'Great 邪灵王, the 罪龙母, along with myriad dragon spirits from the 龙墓, has come to heed your command.' Her voice, laced with a whisper of hoarseness, was melodic and alluring, hinting at her past as a beauty of formidable allure. If not for the spectral pallor marking her as an undead spirit, the legion commanders, like the Centaurs' King and the Giant Kings, would undoubtedly be drawn to vie for her favor. 'I wish to claim her as my bride!' The Centaurs' King was visibly enchanted upon bearing witness to the 罪龙母. He swallowed hard, his blood surging with an intensity that filled his eyes with an indescribable longing. 'It is within the realm of possibility,' Lin Sheng offered with a light chuckle. 'Should you overlook the fact that the 罪龙母's true form is magnitudes larger than your own, she may very well delight in your pursuit. That is, assuming you manage to survive the wedding night without being crushed beneath her.' 'Uh... The Centaurs' King felt a chill as if drenched by a sudden downpour, the fervor in his eyes swiftly extinguishing. He touched his mane with a contemplative gesture. Known for his mastery over vital essence and might that surpassed even the standard 列等使, any who beheld his sudden fervor would surmise—it was a ruse, or he was genuinely compelled. Despite his impressive stature and innate prowess, the Centaurs' King was paradoxically the least likely to succumb to impulse. He promptly withdrew from the brink of bewitchment, regaining his composure. 'I shall abstain; such divine delights should be reserved for our sovereign alone.' 'To face the mighty, one must learn humility!' It was unconscionable for the 罪龙母 to be so crassly objectified. From her lower position, her eyes flared with ire as she summoned a sliver of 黑色力场, which she directed with deadly intent at the Centaurs' King. Pfft! The Centaurs' King, swift to react, obliterated the black sliver with a thunderous stomp. 'Insolence!! In the presence of our sovereign, you dare to incite violence within this hallowed hall!? Does the 龙墓 contemplate rebellion?!' he thundered, rising to his full height. The 罪龙母, briefly taken aback by the Centaurs' King's audacity, had not expected such a forthright and fierce warrior to adopt such sly tactics. His alacrity in casting aspersions was alarmingly apt. 'I merely reciprocated your disrespect towards one of greater might; when one is lesser, humility is the virtue to embrace!' The 罪龙母, a veteran in the games of countless years, countered swiftly. 'Were it not for our sovereign's presence, you'd have already met your end within the 龙墓, serving as nourishment for the dead!' Her tone was icy, resonating with the cold embrace of the grave. 'Very well, face me with merely a single hand,' the Centaurs' King taunted, undaunted. 'You invite your demise!!' The 罪龙母, incited to fury, stood on the verge of action. 'Enough!' Tiangong Xia, seated adjacent, interjected with a tone of irritation. 'The music has been silenced! Should you wish to duel, do so outside these sacred walls, and do not disrupt my enjoyment of the song!' Her command stilled the impending clash, and both the 罪龙母 and the Centaurs' King reluctantly curbed their aggression. Tiangong Xia’s authority was unquestioned; none present, save for the 邪灵王, could contend with her might. 'Resume your seat, 罪龙母.' Lin Sheng’s timely intervention smoothed the tensions. 'Musicians, you may withdraw.' He gestured to the fairy musicians by the stone columns, who instructed the minstrels to cease their performance and ushered them out promptly. Fairy attendants, their wings shimmering with a verdant glow, danced into the hall, arranging platters laden with fruits and libations before the commanders. The grand hall's stone portals swung closed, guided by the magic array. Lin Sheng surveyed the formidable assembly before him. To his left stood Tiangong Xia, the Fairy King, and the Giant Kings. To his right, the Centaurs' King, the 罪龙母, and Demon Hand Degaar. In the span of an instant, he had subjugated five 列等使 powers under his command. The might of the 邪灵宫 swelled at an unimaginable pace, burgeoning into a leviathan. Legion Commanders were akin to Emissaries; beneath them, the ranks of 邪灵元帅. This tier of power included numerous individuals from the 妖精帝国 and a contingent under the Centaurs' King. The spirits of the 龙墓, each wielding Emissary-level combat prowess, were not wholly swayed by Lin Sheng but remained loyal to the 罪龙母. 邪灵元帅, ranking below Emissaries and akin to the acme of Six-Winged beings, were plentiful. The third tier comprised 邪灵将军. This rank was legion, with the 邪灵洞窟 alone harboring hundreds, and Lin Sheng's experiments having yielded many a creature of this caliber. The 妖精帝国 and the Centaurs' King's legions each commanded hundreds. This rank was comparable to Tri-Wing Evil Energy Wielders. As for the rank-and-file evil spirits, they were innumerable. The 邪灵宫 now stood as a formidable adversary to the three great secret realms of reality, a trial of supremacy yet to be decided. But this was not the pinnacle of Lin Sheng's ambition. 'My gratitude for your punctual arrival is profound.' Lin Sheng spread his arms wide, his voice thunderous. 'This is the 邪灵宫—the paramount sanctuary of the 邪灵界. It is also the bedrock upon which I will, in due time, unite all evil spirits under my dominion.' His voice boomed, echoing within and beyond the grand hall like the peals of thunder. Every commander within could hear him clearly, and even the 邪灵将军 nearby caught each resonant word. 'I have summoned you all to bestow upon you a path to even greater power,' Lin Sheng declared with an air of portent. Chapter 466: The Final Fragment, Part 2 'A power of even greater supremacy?' Sin Dragon Mother's eyes flashed with a surge of vigilance. Throughout her extensive lifespan, she had never encountered a fool who freely offered power without a reason. Could the Evil Spirit King possibly be such a fool? Certainly not. Her peripheral vision briefly swept over Tiangong Xia, the red-haired lady across from her, whose face showed no emotion, save for an air of ennui and detachment. If Sin Dragon Mother felt wary, then the rest were even more perturbed. The Centaurs' King had no patience for these subtleties; having resolved to fully commit to Lin Sheng, he was ready to endorse any decision made by Lin Sheng! 'It seems our lord deems our strength insufficient! Ha ha ha ha! Everything is relative, of course. But since it's a boon from our lord, I, the old stallion, won't hesitate to be the first to accept!' His laughter boomed as he promptly pledged his loyalty. When the leader speaks, support is a must. A lack of support would be even more humiliating, wouldn't it? 'I anticipate it greatly,' the Fairy King responded softly. Her severed arm had been reattached and appeared to have fully healed. 'The lord's decision is our command,' Demon Hand Degaar offered flattery directly. The Giant Kings remained silent, their expressions stoic. Having recently suffered defeat and the plundering of their treasury, they were far from content. Lin Sheng was indifferent to their sentiments. 'In all honesty, I do indeed find your strength to be somewhat insufficient,' he stated calmly. 'The era is changing. Power must not remain stagnant.' He extended a hand, palm facing upward, and slowly released a sphere of pure, white Holy Power. With a faint hiss, the sphere emerged from his palm, hovering tranquilly a few centimeters above, gently oscillating. 'This force is termed Holy Power,' Lin Sheng explained. 'The essence of Holy Power surpasses that of Soul Power, and indeed, all powers you currently wield. Should you harbor doubts, you are welcome to test it for yourselves.' With a gentle pinch, the sphere fragmented, releasing several Holy Power Rays that landed with precision before the legion commanders. The rays transformed into smaller orbs of Holy Power, levitating before them. 'These spheres of Holy Power can be engaged and neutralized with your own forces to assess which is greater. If you decide to master this new power, seek me out later. I will bestow upon you the Seed of Origin.' Without waiting for questions from the commanders, he proceeded to the next item on the agenda. 'Let's set aside this matter for now; we have more pressing issues to address.' At his gesture, the Fairy King conjured a sphere of blue water that glided towards Lin Sheng. With his touch, the sphere dispersed, unfolding into a massive, transparent polyhedron, several meters in diameter, displayed before all. The polyhedron, crystal-like, began to reveal a clear image of the Black Desert within. The desert stretched to the horizon, endless dunes rolling beneath a blazing, mysterious purple sun, with Unicorn Camels trudging through the sands. This was a realm where even the air itself was scorched into a searing, distorted haze. 'This is the Evil Spirit Realm that you will conquer,' Lin Sheng introduced. 'The key to classifying such minor secret realm worlds as Evil Spirit Realms is the emergence of pure soul entities like evil spirits.' He pointed to the Unicorn Camel within the projection. 'Any world that naturally spawns soul entities will become one of the subordinate worlds under the dominion of my Evil Spirit Palace. As for the world you behold, it is larger than most. To ascertain whether it is an Evil Spirit Realm, you will have to inspect and verify it yourselves.' 'Within three days, I require a detailed assessment report on this secret realm world. I need to know the time required to fully subjugate this minor world.' 'We submit to your will,' the legion commanders responded in unison, bowing deeply. They did not grasp Lin Sheng's motives for conquering numerous minor Evil Spirit Realms, but as it was the master's command, they were compelled to execute it. Lin Sheng concealed his intention to locate the final fragment within this secret realm. The affairs of the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel were his to keep secret. Concealing one's strength guarantees enduring prosperity. Secrecy is the best defense against machinations. For if the full measure of one's power remains enigmatic, none would dare act recklessly for fear of unwittingly confronting your might and courting their own demise. After discussing the developments of the Evil Spirit Palace, which were managed by Demon Hand Degaar, Lin Sheng shifted his attention to the initial exploration of the new Black Desert Evil Spirit Cave. The commanders, having learned of tribes and cities within the desert that resembled humans, displayed notable interest. The assembly lasted over an hour before adjourning. The commanders returned to their domains to marshal their forces for the conquest of the Black Desert. Following his initial plan, Lin Sheng retired to the Yin Yang Hall to reorganize his current power structure. To achieve an optimal environment for power enhancement and self-purification, he required a perfect, contaminant-free enclosed space. Among the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel's Eighty-Eight Guardianships was a power that satisfied this need. Although typically categorized into four major outcomes, Lin Sheng could deploy any one of them individually. Even with a few crucial guardianships lacking, Lin Sheng still possessed access to several that would fulfill his purpose. After addressing the affairs of the Evil Spirit Realm, Lin Sheng returned to Hengrui Kara through the portal. It had been some time since his last visit, and he had nearly forgotten the influence of the different time flows. Sometimes he thought he had been absent for days and would hurriedly contact home upon his return, only to be reminded that he had called just the previous day. In reality, Hengrui Kara remained unchanged, operating steadily under the protection of the Sunset Tower, like a grand, intricate machine. Hengrui Kara had now developed its own distinct social system centered around the holy temples and practitioners. Holy practitioners were emerging as a new profession. They cultivated Holy Power and worked across various industries, using their extraordinary abilities to heal and assist others. Owing to the grandiose effects of Holy Light and its purifying force field that alleviated fatigue, the temples and holy practitioners had risen in societal standing. They had become emblems of mainstream positive forces, representing justice, dignity, and the benign power to heal both body and spirit. This was the public's perception of Holy Light. Chapter 467: The Final Fragment 3 Lin Sheng took a moment to calculate the time he had spent traversing the Evil Spirit Realm. To him, it felt like an extensive stay of over a month, yet in the external world, it barely accounted for a week. The discrepancy in time flow left him slightly disoriented about the actual dates. He walked the streets of Hengrui Kara, where the safe district's once desolate buildings now bustled with life, a result of the substantial influx of people. The streets, previously lined with gasoline vehicles, had been cleared in favor of cleaner electric cars. Due to the limited space in the safe district and the need to alleviate congested traffic, these electric vehicles had been modified. The workshops of Bain University had crafted these newly designed cars—now half the size of conventional ones and capable of short stints of low-altitude flight—significantly relieving the district's transport load. Lin Sheng observed cars gliding along the ground and weaving between buildings mid-air. This scene, belonging to a futuristic metropolis, unfolded clearly before him. "Hengrui Kara has come a long way. The enhancement of the Twilight Holy Temple slipped my mind amidst the Netherworld's interference. Now, it's time to take care of that," Lin Sheng contemplated as he made his way from the research center back to the temple's branch office. The accumulation of Holy Power in the Twilight Holy Temple had grown immense, having been in an overflow state for quite some time. The scattered Holy Power even caused the air around the temple to shimmer with specks of white fluorescence—these were Holy Crystals. They would spontaneously revert to pure Holy Power whenever the temple required their use. Without alerting anyone, Lin Sheng strode into the temple and headed directly to the Prayer Hall. The hall stood empty, its doors fastened shut—entry was barred outside of designated prayer times. Approaching the prayer platform, he closed his eyes. Hiss... Before him, in the void, a vast map of Hengrui Kara emerged. The map, like a sand table, was gently rotated clockwise by Lin Sheng's will. Click... From the map came a faint sound as the sand table terrain sunk and parted. From the chasm, a grey-black stone pillar ascended, bearing a distinct palm print. 'Please verify the palm print. To advance further, the palm print of the Twilight Holy Temple's bonded individual is required,' the soft feminine voice resonated once more. Lin Sheng moved forward, pressing his right hand gently onto the palm print on the stone pillar. 'Palm print confirmed. Welcome to the selection interface.' Instantly, a new tree diagram materialized before Lin Sheng. Branching upwards from the 'Twilight Holy Temple' label, lines formed six distinct pathways. 'Available divine arts for addition: 1—Temple of Wishes. (Capable of harnessing the power of beings' wishes to create Illusory Lamp Spirits.) (Illusory Lamp Spirit: An eighth-level energy being adept in long-range magical control attacks.) Holy Power required: Fifty thousand. Maximum upgrade level: Three. 2—Twilight Crimson Pool (Draws in the power of twilight to taint and transform a unique Holy Power pool. The pool's waters can potentially transform ordinary beings into special Holy Light creatures.) (Holy Light Creature: Harmonizes with Holy Power, possessing a strong constitution and a powerful regenerative capacity.) Holy Power required: Ten thousand. Maximum upgrade level: Three. 3—Protective Halo (Creates a special force field with condensed Holy Crystals to shield all beings within the temple from mental and spiritual attacks.) Holy Power required: One hundred thousand. Maximum upgrade level: Three. 4—Holy River Confluence (Transforms the land with liquefied Holy Power, so that beings born here naturally have a closer affinity to Holy Power and better aptitude for its practice.) Holy Power required: One million. Non-upgradable. 5—Judgment Light (Combines the might of twilight with the vast accumulation in the Holy Power pool. Using the Hymn of the Sacred as the activation key, it can instantly judge and attack any entity within the temple's domain. The power of Judgment Light is proportional to the Holy Power accumulated in the pool—the more there is, the more formidable it becomes.) (Please note, authorization to use Judgment Light is limited to three individuals. Once Judgment Light is discharged, all the accumulated Holy Power in the pool will be consumed. Use with caution.) Holy Power required: One million. Non-upgradable. 6—Holy Crystal Pool. (Capacity can be expanded to ten million. Periodically, the Holy Crystals will autonomously select individuals with sufficiently pure and strong souls, consuming Holy Crystals to transform them into Holy Spirits.) (Holy Spirit: A powerful lifeform with a soul merged with Holy Power, retaining all memories and personality from before death, indistinguishable from resurrection.) Holy Power required: One million. Non-upgradable.' At the bottom of the display, Lin Sheng noted smaller text. 'These six divine arts represent the final upgradeable versions. Upon completion of the divine arts upgrades, the Twilight Holy Temple's full construction will conclude. This guidance program will then self-destruct.' "So these are their ultimate forms?" Lin Sheng felt a faint disappointment. However, he reconsidered; the temple's construction ceremony and the ritual formation were merely products crafted by the masters of Black Feather City. Their level was not particularly high. That they had reached this stage was probably the limit of their capabilities. He eyed the capacity of the Great Holy Power Pool at the bottom—exactly one million Holy Power. Without a second thought, he selected the Holy Crystal Pool option. Buzz. Something vibrated in the darkness, then quickly subsided. The total Holy Power plummeted to zero, then rapidly rebounded to stabilize at around two hundred thousand. "Is this the amount converted from the condensed Holy Crystals?" Lin Sheng speculated. Two hundred thousand Holy Power was a substantial amount. He decided to allocate it all to the Protective Halo, enhancing it to level two. With his choices made, all upgrades would unfold over the following days. Lin Sheng exited the operational space. Once he confirmed there were no issues with the temple headquarters in Hengrui Kara and the Western Wheel, he casually returned to the research center. After instructing the young girl Peach on certain precautions, he passed through the Evil Spirit Gate and re-entered the Evil Spirit Palace. This was the critical juncture; the last fragment was nearly within reach. He had to remain alert, ready to personally intervene at a moment's notice. As soon as he stepped into the Evil Spirit Palace, the Evil Spirit guards promptly handed over military intelligence. The Demon Hand Degaar presented the urgent military report with haste. Standing before the Evil Spirit Gate, Lin Sheng quickly scanned the report. 'An apex fighter has emerged in the Black Desert; the vanguard army has been routed, and the Centaurs' King has been seriously injured.' "Hm? They've encountered a formidable adversary so soon?" Lin Sheng was surprised. The Centaurs' King's strength was considerable among his forces, superior to both the Demon Hand Degaar and the Fairy King. Yet he had been gravely injured right from the start? "What's the current situation? Get me a connection to the Centaurs' King," he ordered, casually handing the report back to the Demon Hand. "The Twin Giants' Kings and the Sin Dragon Mother have already provided support. They should be able to retreat shortly," the Demon Hand replied. "Have we gathered intelligence on the adversary?" Lin Sheng inquired further. "Some information has been obtained," the Demon Hand handed a second report to Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng read it over and a look of surprise crossed his features. "Intriguing. Quite intriguing!" A mischievous smile curled the corners of his lips. The Demon Hand quickly shared, "The one who defeated the Centaurs' King is a towering man with a transparent round gem set in his chest. He calls himself the Wishmoon Stone Envoy, foretold to come and eradicate foreign invaders. Once he confirmed the identities of the Centaurs' King and the Evil Spirit Legion, he launched his attack." "How did he defeat the Centaurs' King?" Lin Sheng asked, already having an inkling of the opponent's identity. "The man is exceptionally strong, and his martial skills are profoundly adept. Most crucially, his resistances are horrifyingly strong; neither soul attacks nor any other form of magical affronts affect him. Furthermore, even if beheaded or his heart is removed, it's to no avail—he will regenerate instantly. The Centaurs' King was caught off guard and suffered a severe blow from a sneak attack." Lin Sheng nodded. "Send the Fairy King, the Twin Giants' Kings, and the Sin Dragon Mother with their forces. I want that man taken alive." If his conjecture was correct, the last fragment had developed self-awareness and had thus empowered a formidable individual lying in wait. Because when Lin Sheng had sensed the fragment, it had, in turn, sensed this place and immediately retreated. He had originally thought it was merely an automatic response from the last fragment, not realizing it was a significant sign of its self-awareness. Chapter 468: Melee 1 Ancient hymns interlaced with mysterious melodies echoed across the sky at the entrance to Redeon's Paradise Tower. Vast three-dimensional arrays of white, red, and blue, continuously spun, churning massive runes and evil essence. Countless streams of power poured from the depths of Paradise Tower, guiding the energy particles of the surrounding heavens to converge here. Thousands of arrays merged to form one grand sealing array. Against adversaries like Farudo, sealing was the superior strategy. Lin Sheng, having once conceived such methods, was aware that the architects of Paradise Tower were similarly skilled, perhaps even surpassing his own designs. They had long ago gathered many Blood Descendants, carriers of the bloodline of sealing. Their abrupt deployment of such tactics against Farudo served as a profound surprise assault. Farudo floated mid-air, his expression composed as he looked down upon the kilometer-wide array that now completely encircled him. Around the array's perimeter, countless strands of energy akin to silk threads converged, binding him. Even fragile spider silk, when amassed in sufficient quantity, can surpass the tensile strength of steel cables. And these were not mere silk but strands of malevolent essence woven by the arrays. The incalculable evil essence strands, guided by Paradise Tower and directed by the few remaining Emissaries, began to reveal ethereal angels with wings unfurling from their backs. "Angels, hm? It has been eons since such a spectacle graced my eyes..." Farudo mused with a tinge of nostalgia. "To believe that angels could seal me? You may have underestimated my prowess. A millennium ago, I could devastate angels single-handedly, and that was before my ascent to this pinnacle of power!" Farudo glanced at the countless transparent threads wrapping around his feet, which continued to multiply and thicken. "Still, to trouble even my current form, you have indeed earned some measure of pride," he remarked as he lifted his right hand. "Incantation: Primal Stone Power." "Incantation: Divine Swiftness." "Incantation: Luminance of Dread." "Incantation: Psychic Assassination." "High-Order Enhancement: Ambrus Divine Emblem." "High-Order Enchantment: Netherlight." With a soft utterance, a multitude of demonic incantations activated, cloaking him in a cascade of energy that crackled like electricity. Simultaneously, four slender, sharp long spears manifested in the void around him. The transparent spears, adorned with ribbon-like runes at their tips, were poised for assault. In an instant, the spears disappeared from their original position, reappearing among the crowds that conducted the array on the ground below. Explosions of clear shockwaves erupted amidst the masses. "This assault, aimed at the spirit and soul, cannot be blocked or evaded. One can only endure it," Farudo's smile widened. As people below scattered, many were dazed by the psychic explosion, causing the operation of the array to momentarily falter. "I will intercept his attacks. The rest of you, continue!" commanded the elder of Paradise Tower, his voice carrying authority. He stepped forward, his upper garments ripping away to reveal the silver-white armor he wore underneath. "Ice Dragon Armor Technique!" His hands spread wide as a maelstrom of vile green light shimmered behind him and a vast grey-black vortex emerged above. The vortex churned out a torrent of pale green malevolence that, upon touching down, transformed into solid, icy white under a mysterious force, encasing the elder. Soon, his entire body was covered in fierce, rugged white ice spires. Together, these sharp, dense spires formed his impregnable defense: the Ice Dragon Armor Technique. "You seek to block me?" Farudo chuckled with a note of disdain. "Given that you know I am a Netherworld Demonic Orator, you should also be aware that direct combat is not my strongest suit..." He looked up as his white hair rapidly lengthened, thickened, and wove into the shape of a giant grey-black half-giant in the sky above. This grey-black giant, with a horn and muscles like twisted roots, seemed on the verge of sprouting delicate wings from its back, and held a large black pillar in its arms. "Netherworld Pillar Guardian. Go forth and destroy this place," Farudo ordered calmly. The grey-black giant behind him hummed in response. Its formidable frame, over five meters tall, surged forward, and with hair severing, it accelerated, plummeting towards the ground array like a meteor. Rapidly, one of the Emissaries below leaped into the sky, deflecting the Netherworld Pillar Guardian with a precise block from an ancient and ornate greatshield. Thwarted, Farudo appeared undaunted. The summoned creature was but a minor player he had whimsically called forth. Its purpose was merely to buy time for his subsequent maneuver. "Madolune, Deep River Snaggletooth, Chief of Ambush, Flowing Shadow Beast, my most loyal lieutenant. By my name, Farudo, I summon you to descend here!" He pronounced another powerful entity's full and true name. True names are sacred, not to be invoked lightly. These imprints etched into the soul are unique signatures across time and space. Invoking them requires envisioning the entity's complete form, along with their powers, deeds, history, and traits. Only with the entity's consent can they be truly summoned by their true name. And this was the rite Farudo was enacting. A ritual typically demanding extensive preparations and significant resource expenditure, he had distilled with his formidable curse-speaking ability into this effortlessly wielded incantation of summoning. As Farudo's summoning incantation unfurled, a peculiar male warrior appeared from the void behind him. Towering at two meters, with thirteen pairs of arms extending from his back, he wore battle-worn, rough leather armor, bearing scars of countless encounters, with his feet bare. Most striking were the twin light purple, slightly curved, slender blades he carried on his back. The summoned warrior, bereft of consciousness with blood-red eyes, bellowed upon his arrival. In a swift motion, he drew his blades and slashed downwards. A pair of intersecting X-shaped silver blade lights descended like shooting stars. The blade lights, initially simple, expanded with distance, replicating rapidly until they became hundreds of blade flashes. With each touch to the ground, the blade flashes transformed into corporeal silver metallic beasts. Sharp-headed and slender-bodied, these beasts moved with unmatched speed, striking like serpents everywhere within the array. "Attack!" The legion from Paradise Tower's evil energy wielders, recognizing the critical moment, advanced with unwavering determination. The sealing array had sustained, containing Farudo for this length of time, proof of its effectiveness. With one final, concerted effort, they might indeed relegate Farudo back to the abyss of the Netherworld. Chapter 469: Melee 2 In an open area near the battlefield, by a shallow depression, the air imperceptibly twisted. A diverse group of individuals, ranging from those in pajamas as if they had just stepped out of their homes, to others in racing suits with helmets on, suddenly appeared amidst the chaotic battlefield. One individual, bewildered and clutching a frying pan, was among them. "We have arrived..." a young man cloaked in a white cloak, his features noble, announced as he looked up at Farudo, suspended in the sky. "That was quick? We've moved from the frontier to the riverbanks just like that?" The person holding the frying pan was visibly astonished. "It's simply a fixed-point transport through the Teleportation Array," an elderly voice echoed in everyone's ears. "Now, with Farudo before us, holders of the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts, it's time for your decisions and actions to shape destiny. The choice is yours." "Such fine words. Yet you've brought us here by force; can we truly leave if we opt not to engage?" a woman in her nightwear retorted coldly. "Let's focus on the task at hand. Now that we are here, our purpose should be clear. Within the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts themselves reside the Heroic Spirits. Just approach Farudo, activate the power, and let the Heroic Spirits take over," a stout elder behind sunglasses solemnly declared. "Regardless, your presence signifies your readiness for the trials ahead." Adolf glanced at the speaker but kept to himself, his gaze lingering on Farudo in the sky. He longed for home—the temple elders, his praying comrades, and the Lord of Night who stubbornly clung to his bed... "Let us proceed. The Sacred Relics will guide us in summoning the Heroic Spirits within," the man in sunglasses spoke firmly, leading the way towards Farudo. The rest fell silent for a moment before quickly following suit. Adolf, however, was perplexed. These individuals claimed to possess Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts, and as a fellow bearer, he should sense a resonance with them. Yet from this group, he detected nothing but a faint trace of Heavenly Mandate Relics. Though unsure, he doubted they would jest with their lives and speculated on the existence of unknown methods to conceal such energies. ........................ Boom!! Above the Black Desert, thunder roared as if boulders were rolling across the firmament, pressing through the dense clouds. In the oppressive atmosphere of the Black Desert, the Evil Spirit Legion and the Fairy warriors surged towards the opposing desert army's ranks. The desert legion, clad in white, bore Special Protective Armor embedded with Supernatural Powers. The Evil Spirit Legion, a blend of black and crimson, combined pure soul entities with flesh-and-blood lifeforms to create a formidable, multidimensional assault strategy. From a distance, the Evil Spirits initiated their assault, while the Fairy warriors engaged in close combat. The desert soldiers, strong in body and spirit but ordinary beyond their armor, suffered devastating casualties against the layered assault, retreating in disarray. Lin Sheng, mounted on the Warhorse Bloodfiend, slowly advanced into the battle zone. No Evil Spirit or soldier dared approach within ten meters of him. Directly ahead, on a sand dune, the Twin Giants' Kings were embroiled in a fierce battle with a mysterious desert colossus. The struggle had been long. Now, with insight into their adversary's strengths, the Twin Giants' Kings fought with heightened caution. The man with the gemstone embedded in his chest, now flanked by several formidable warriors, exuded an aura of considerable strength. These warriors sported delicate green wings, resembling willow leaves, nearly invisible when still. Lin Sheng observed the battle quietly, with the Fairy King and the Sin Dragon Mother standing beside him, equally composed as they watched the Twin Giants' Kings. From the enemy lines, several potent souls swept their gaze across Lin Sheng's position, only to hastily retract, unwilling to delve deeper. "This is too slow." Lin Sheng turned to the Sin Dragon Mother, who immediately understood. As a member of the Destiny Necro Dragon Tribe skilled in enchantments and ritual arrays, the Sin Dragon Mother had attempted to cast a charm spell upon Lin Sheng at their first meeting, to no effect. The encounter, however, had left a profound impression on him. With a step, the Dragon Mother activated a violet Magic Circle underfoot, which instantly transported her to the center of the battlefield. Appearing behind the desert titan, she seized the moment of surprise, tapping the back of his head. A violet glow burst, transforming into complex Array Maps that imprinted upon the titan's nape. The man swayed, overtaken, his eyes rolling back as he collapsed. "Wasn't that quite simple?" she asked the Twin Giants' Kings with a smirk. Pfft! Without warning, an axe swung violently from behind her. The Sin Dragon Mother's slender waist was struck, sending her crashing into another sand dune. "Fool!" the Black Giant King scorned, his fists ready as he lunged towards the reawakening desert colossus. Their clashing Emissary Force Fields distorted the air, creating a maelstrom of sand. Ahhh!!! Thrown into disgrace, with her dress torn, the Sin Dragon Mother emerged from the dune in a fury. Her frame expanded massively, transforming into a behemoth dragon over ten meters long, its limbs planting firmly on the ground as it let out a ferocious roar. The dragon, its body akin to a massive lizard with wing-like spines on its back, bellowed, spewing a cloud of fine ashen mist that petrified the sand upon contact. Corpses touched by the mist likewise turned to stone sculptures. Two figures leaped forth from behind the desert colossus, their hands radiating a golden light to counter the petrifying breath. They joined the fray, stalling the Dragon Mother's onslaught. "There are so many formidable ones... They appear well-prepared," Lin Sheng mused behind his visor. "You too, go," he instructed Tiangong Xia, who had been following him. "I hope to swing my blade more today," Tiangong Xia replied, his lips curling into a smile as he stepped towards the battlefield. Lin Sheng, however, turned away from the confrontation, his gaze stretching toward the northwest. There, a power related to his own was stealthily observing the battle. "The final Fragment?" Lin Sheng's lips twisted into a smirk. "Launch the full assault, Fairy King." "The outcome remains undecided; a full attack now could lead to friendly fire," the Fairy King cautioned in a low voice. "Proceed as I've directed," Lin Sheng remained unyielding. Shriek! Suddenly, a sharp cry erupted from behind him. Lin Sheng felt a chill strike his back as the Assassin's blade pierced through the gaps in his Dawn Heavy Armor, finding its mark on his flesh. Chapter 470: Skirmish 3 Thunk. Following a sound reminiscent of chopping through wood, the assassin’s sharp blade aimed precisely at the center of Lin Sheng's back. But it couldn't pierce through. Time seemed to freeze. The blade was wedged tightly in the armor's gap, immobilized. Simultaneously, an immense, viscous natural force field supplanted the prior, eerily tranquil one. Lin Sheng, without a glance backward, thrust out a palm. His palm moved with incredible swiftness, the assassin's chest pierced in the mere moment he raised it. "This assassin’s strength is commendable." He tossed the body aside and a flicker of Pure Holy Power cleansed the blood and filth from his hands. Woooo~~~~! Amidst the prolonged horn sounds, all the troops of the Evil Spirit Palace surged forward. The reserve legions began their silent and swift advance. At a glance, the army seemed boundless, sweeping over the opposing desert legion like a sudden flood. Lin Sheng paid no heed to the outcome. Astride the Warhorse Bloodfiend, he proceeded toward the source of the aura fluctuations. Each step from the Warhorse Bloodfiend, though seemingly slow, was remarkably fast. This formidable Evil Spirit warrior, bearing Lin Sheng on its back, proceeded in that direction. Quickly, he crested dune after dune, leaving everyone far behind. The Warhorse Bloodfiend came to a halt at the edge of an inky green oasis, observing three figures standing at its periphery. They were three formidable desert warriors, each with a crimson gem embedded in their chests. The trio's gaze was heavy upon Lin Sheng. The enemy they had lain in wait for, donned in heavy armor and mounted upon a robust, armor-clad black steed, exuded an intimidating presence. Before even nearing, they felt an oppressive might descend, stifling their breaths. "Demon! It’s him!" the sole woman among them declared coldly. "The Wishmoon Stone has lured him to us! Kill!!" She unsheathed her curved blade with blue electricity crackling and leaping about her, the first to sprint towards Lin Sheng. At the same instant, the other two men, brandishing their swords, attacked from different angles. The trio coordinated seamlessly, as if they had battled together for many years. Three arcs of purple lightning unfurled from their swords, roaring into three thunder dragons that charged at Lin Sheng. From afar, in the oasis, several robed women swiftly emerged from the shrubbery. Uttering incantations, a mysterious power descended from above, abruptly suppressing much of the power from Lin Sheng’s Yin-Turned Evil Wheel Guardian’s Power. "Oh?" Lin Sheng’s brow quirked, "So, they dared to draw me out because they indeed had means to suppress the Guardian's Power on me." He remained seated on his mount, facing the barrage, and suddenly clenched his hand. Sshh!! Pure Holy Power condensed into a massive Holy Light Greatsword over three meters long within his grasp. Swoosh! He brought the Holy Light Greatsword down towards the three desert warriors hurtling his way. The blade hadn’t even made contact with the opponents’ swords when an invisible, terrifying force field crushed the thunder dragons they had unleashed. Puff puff puff!! The thunder dragons dissipated in the blink of an eye. With a terrifying might, the Holy Light Greatsword struck down before the front-running lady swordsman. Boom!!! A pitch-black fissure, over ten meters in length, suddenly appeared before Lin Sheng. He drew up the greatsword, looking down imperiously at the lady swordsman who had narrowly dodged. "What saved you from my strike just now?" "Answer me!" His eyes shot open, and he swung his sword through the air to his right. Bang!! An invisible disturbance was cleaved asunder on the spot. Several robed figures in the distance, who were in the midst of casting, spat blood and slumped to the ground, their faces a ghastly pallor. "Demon!! This is the birthplace of the Wishmoon Stone, the unblemished Origin Pool known as the Land of Flawlessness! Regret your audacity in coming here alone, for this day next year shall mark your death anniversary!!" From the depths of the oasis emerged another figure, a robust old man. Each of his hands gripped a massive warhammer. Each warhammer was nearly the size of a grown man. Just by their appearance, one could tell they were anything but ordinary. The old man's hair was fashioned into numerous small braids, his beard disheveled across his chest. He wore pitch-black, somewhat ancient armor, fiercely contrasting with Lin Sheng’s pristine white armor. "At such an advanced age, instead of enjoying tranquility at home, you seek death here." Lin Sheng's gaze flickered curiously as he assessed the elder. "I have just turned five hundred and four a few days ago. I had not imagined, nearing the end of my days, that the heavens would grant me a grand battle." The elder laughed boisterously. "If you wish to slay me, let's see if you possess the prowess!!" Behind him, a tiger's roar resounded, and a towering, majestic black tiger manifested. The tiger appeared to have been readied with armor and weaponry. The elder mounted it, slammed his warhammers together, and bellowed. "An old man's head is here, come and claim it!!" With a roar, the tiger leapt forward, bounding high and traversing over ten meters towards Lin Sheng in a single leap. Lin Sheng's eyes narrowed, keenly sensing an intense Fragment fluctuation emanating and rippling from the elder. "Have you staked all your treasures on this old man?" He scoffed, hoisting the sword for an upward strike! Swoosh!! Boom!!!!!! The blade released a swath of white light, clashing with the warhammer that descended from above. A wave of transparent ripples burst forth between the two, scattering in all directions. Wherever the ripples traversed, gravel flew and the oasis's shrubbery was sliced apart. It seemed as though an invisible blade had cut through everything in an instant. The elder's strength was astonishingly formidable. In a direct confrontation, he managed to contend with Lin Sheng without falling short. Lin Sheng was equally taken aback. In order to break his own limits, he had almost forsaken half of his human lineage in favor of Rock Dragon blood. With the blood of a Rock Dragon coursing through him, he wielded nearly the might of half of such a dragon. Yet, even so, this elder managed to stand his ground against him? His mind reeled, but his hands did not cease. The Holy Light Greatsword moved rhythmically, continuously clashing with the warhammers. From the moment they engaged, they recognized each other as formidable foes rarely encountered in their lifetime. The elder, an undefeated War God in the Evil Spirit Realm for centuries, had never been bested. In martial skills, physical prowess, and strength, he had reached the pinnacle attainable by humankind. Unexpectedly, the man before him could match him in a head-to-head struggle, even slightly overpowering him. Lin Sheng had assimilated the soul memories of innumerable fierce battles, his combat experience was exceedingly vast, and he was adept in a plethora of sword techniques and fatal skills, thanks to the soul fragments he had merged with. Previously, he had rarely the chance to employ his exaggerated martial capability, as he could easily resolve conflicts with other powers. But now, with his Guardian's Power suppressed, and unwilling to reveal his trump for the moment, wishing to first ascertain the full extent of his foe's capabilities. He simply employed his martial prowess. Who would have thought he'd be checked by this elder? The two, armed with heavy weaponry, traded blows like lightning. The greatsword and warhammers collided, parrying each other, creating a series of devastating shockwave ripples. Within several tens of meters around them, it had become a veritable zone of death. Chapter 471: Prelude to Conflict Adolf's gaze pierced the skies, fixating on Farudo, who remained trapped by the Spatial Foundation's influence. A heavy premonition of doom burgeoned within him, an unease too intricate to voice. Now bound by the grand cause of humanity, they had been coerced into this predicament, regardless of their wishes. The prospect of retreating based on a mere hunch could lead to dire, unknown consequences. Concealed by an ally whose Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifact rendered them invisible, the group stealthily crept closer to the sealed battleground. From a distance, the danger seemed benign. But as they drew near, the imminent threat of the battlefield was palpable. Chaotic currents of Evil Spirit Power, each laced with its caster's will, collided and compressed like an unruly undercurrent. The mere proximity to the battleground, still a hundred meters out, allowed them to feel the earth quake with each concussive blast. Battle cries and monstrous roars ebbed and flowed like the relentless tide. Adolf, standing on the fringes of war, felt a prickle of dread crawl across his scalp. It wasn't just him; even his stalwart companions had gone pale, their knees buckling under the weight of fear. Thrust from a peaceful existence into the maw of this supernatural slaughter, they were ill-prepared. The battlefield's edge was littered with severed limbs, spilt innards, and the grotesque carcasses of beasts, prompting the pajama-clad woman among them to succumb to retching. 'Enough delay. We simply need to activate the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts and converge their power, right?' the elder's voice cut through the tension. 'Correct. Afterward, the Heroic Soul will assume control over them,' the Grandmaster's voice resonated in their ears. 'Then let us commence,' the elder stated, turning to address the group. Heads nodded in understanding as the Grandmaster's guidance reached them all. In unison, they began to release their inner energies. For Adolf, as the power flowed from him, the foreboding in his heart only sharpened... 'To arms!' Amidst the Black Desert, two towering silhouettes met in a devastating clash resonant of ancient, titanic battles, their weapons colliding with ferocious might. With brute force, Lin Sheng pressed on relentlessly. Boom! Beneath the elder, the massive black tiger could no longer bear the weight, collapsing to its knees with a pitiful cry, sinking into the sandy abyss. The elder's face betrayed his concern. They had been locked in combat for over three hours. Yet his demonic adversary showed no signs of fatigue; rather, his strength seemed infinite, increasing as the battle raged on. Injuries healed within moments on his foe, and the white armor he donned proved nearly impregnable. Even for a War God such as himself, the elder had never encountered an opponent capable of sustaining such a punishing battle for so long. 'Were it not for the sudden loss of the Wishmoon Stone's power, I would wield strength far beyond this,' he muttered, leading the giant tiger in retreat. 'The Wishmoon Stone? You think its power has simply vanished? Were it not for its influence, my power would be unfathomable,' Lin Sheng countered with a scornful laugh. 'Now, surely you've gleaned the true purpose behind the Wishmoon Stone's summoning,' he intoned ominously. The elder hesitated, following Lin Sheng's gaze to the once-vibrant companions who now lay strewn across the battlefield, their bodies testament to the relentless onslaught. A sinister realization crept upon him. 'Or did you truly believe it summoned you to eliminate me? Or, to put it another way, did you actually think your numbers sufficient to slay me?' Lin Sheng's voice boomed across the desert. The elder's attention was drawn to a detail on the battlefield: several corpses, their chests devoid of the Wishmoon Stones they once bore, now vanished without trace. 'Could it be... !' The most horrifying possibility flashed through his mind. 'You're correct. It is reclaiming the powers it once granted. These powers should have already become one with you, and the only path to reclaim them... is through death,' Lin Sheng revealed, a trace of pity in his voice. The elder had entertained the notion but had refused to believe that the stone he had held for centuries might be so treacherous. 'Your might is admirable. Without the Wishmoon Stone, you stand exceptional. In my ranks, only Tiangong Xia can rival your prowess,' Lin Sheng conceded. 'So, what say you—join my legion? I shall bestow upon you an extended life. In return, you shall fight for me.' The elder's combat prowess was indeed formidable. Among Lin Sheng's ranks, only Tiangong Xia could be considered his equal. The elder's weapon harbored a vast force of Shock Energy, elevating the impact of every strike to its ultimate zenith. Coupled with an apparent mastery of an art that could resist various energies, the elder was, in truth, a berserker of immense strength and advanced magical resistance. In his presence, the Emissary's Force Field was as brittle as a bubble. 'Moreover... until now, I've merely toyed with you.' Lin Sheng discarded his now-cracked Holy Light Greatsword, reforming it anew. His body began to manifest a dense layer of dragon scales, and sharp spiral horns emerged from his head. His form swelled, growing to a stature half again as large as before. 'Now, embrace the thrill of combat!' With a roar that echoed with the might of dragons, Lin Sheng surged forward, his greatsword's white gleam striking the elder's shoulder with blinding speed. The elder, caught off-guard by the sudden revelation, was struck before he could mount a defense. His strength may have neared that of Tiangong Xia, but it was no match for Lin Sheng now. The power Lin Sheng had gained from the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel had surged beyond imagination. Although the Wishmoon Stone had suppressed many of the Eighty-Eight Guardianships, the intrinsic changes and enhancements to Lin Sheng's being persisted. The sword's speed and strength had reached the air's threshold of tolerance. Its motion was so rapid that it roared like thunder, flames and lightning trailing from the friction. It was only after the elder was struck did the sound of Lin Sheng's sword reach him. The elder and the giant tiger were driven into the sandy ground by the greatsword, immobilized. He spat a mouthful of blood, his will to fight already eroded by the Wishmoon Stone's treachery. Struck by Lin Sheng's sword, he was utterly overwhelmed. 'So, you're saying you're not a demon? The Wishmoon Stone is?' he asked, wiping the blood from his lips with a bitter smile. 'Indeed, I am the Holy Spirit King. My vast Holy Power originates from a force that heals and saves lives. How could I possibly be a demon?' Lin Sheng declared with conviction. Chapter 472: Conflict 2 "Holy Spirit King..." The elder, Ning Jia, harbored lingering doubts within. Yet, the insistent pull of the Wishmoon Stone crystal at his chest urged a pivotal choice. Was it to be a futile death in allegiance to the Wishmoon Stone, or a temporary suspension of skepticism to join the adversary? The answer was unequivocal. "Have you reached a decision?" Lin Sheng discerned Ning Jia's resolution in his eyes. "Could I request some time to deliberate?" Ning Jia implored with a wistful smile. "Of course. Those of distinction and talent are worthy of special consideration," Lin Sheng affirmed, his smile genuine. The need for combat dissolved between them, and Ning Jia's hostility waned. Treated by Lin Sheng with the potent Sacred Power, Ning Jia firsthand experienced its extraordinary healing prowess, solidifying his belief in Lin Sheng's claim to the Holy Spirit King title. Ning Jia, known as Ning Jia, conveyed to Lin Sheng the desert's history. Ages past, the celestial Wishmoon Stone descended, bestowing upon the populace the cultivation method of the Wishmoon Force. Lin Sheng delved into the nuances of the Wishmoon Force's cultivation. From Ning Jia, he obtained what was referred to as the Wishmoon Stone crystal—the very gem set into his chest. True to Lin Sheng's prediction, this crystal was indeed a fragment of the celestial Wishmoon Stone, an offspring purposed to assimilate the life forces cultivated by the practitioners. Clasping the crystal, Lin Sheng bade Ning Jia to guide him to the Wishmoon Stone's original touchdown. There, Ning Jia was met with a harrowing vista—numerous cultivators of the Wishmoon Force lay deceased, fallen without strife. The Wishmoon Stone had not only reaped their crystals but had also drained their life force entirely. The stark revelation of the Wishmoon Stone's true visage spurred Ning Jia. Revived by Lin Sheng's Sacred Power and resolute in his purpose, he resolved to rally the Evil Spirit Palace's legions against the Wishmoon Stone. Their campaign was swift. Ning Jia's defection, coupled with a steady emergence of bodies devoid of Wishmoon crystals, rapidly turned the desert secret realm into a vanguard for the Evil Spirit Palace. Stripped of his Wishmoon Stone crystal, Ning Jia was nonetheless graced with a seedling of Sacred Power by Lin Sheng. His soul's formidable resilience to the Wishmoon Stone's distant siphoning allowed his Sacred Power training to progress at an astonishing pace, and inversely, the Sacred Power rejuvenated his aging flesh. Although his years of cultivated power were forfeited, the intrinsic attributes of Sacred Power compensated him with a resurgence of vigour and might. Hence, his prowess scarcely faltered. He remained a dominant force, a match for any Emissary save for Tiangong Xia, and even outstripped the Sin Dragon Mother. Embracing Sacred Power, he emerged as yet another peerless warrior in Lin Sheng's retinue. The armies of the Evil Spirit Palace, devoid of cause for conflict, incrementally withdrew. Under the war-god Ning Jia's aegis, the Black Desert's might was fully marshaled. The dispossessed, ineligible to cultivate Wishmoon crystals, and those formidable beings akin to Ning Jia, immune to the Wishmoon Stone's absorption due to their immense strength, coalesced under a shared banner of dread and vengeance. They converged under Ning Jia's standard, reinforcing the Evil Spirit Palace's might. They shepherded Lin Sheng directly to the secret realm's core, the dwelling of the Wishmoon Stone—Blackgold City. Their intent to annihilate the Wishmoon Stone now surpassed even Lin Sheng's. Their very existence hinged upon it. In the temporal realm, the protracted battle for Redeon's sealing, after days of stalemate, had at last reached its conclusion. Redeon swore fealty to the Netherworld. The gates of Paradise Tower clamped shut, the plains beyond strewn with debris. No vestige of the vanquished nor the antecedent formations remained. The land was seemingly enshrouded by a thick mantle of red soil, expunging all traces beneath. Braving the monstrosities of the Dark Tide, evil energy wielders ventured towards Paradise Tower, met with an enigmatic sealed realm, impenetrable to any emanations. The once-dreaded demonic orator Farudo had vanished into the ether. Some postulated that the sealing had succeeded; others contended that Farudo had delved into the realm's secrets. Nonetheless, the world lapsed into a transitory calm. ... In the secret realm's heart, Paradise Tower, amid its lofty white spires, the Twilight Holy Temple stood supreme. Now transmuted into a nether prison shrouded in pallid mists and nefarious energies. Stone columns pierced the earth, shackled with dark crimson chains, binding the wailing naked thralls. These were the erstwhile bearers of dark forces from Paradise Tower. Unwilling to bend to Farudo's will, they were deemed too insignificant for his subjugation, unworthy of his time. Thus, he consigned them to nether energy pillars, amassing power to forge a portal to the Netherworld. The strife elucidated to Farudo the complexities of conquering a secret realm. Resolute, he endeavoured to inaugurate a portal forthwith, summoning a projection of his genuine self to descend, and thereby bolster his might anew. But prior to this, he had to address some unexpected captives seized during the conflict. Farudo traversed to the rear of the Twilight Holy Temple, to a small chamber, formerly a transient sanctuary for those awaiting audience, now transformed into an experimental proving ground. Six souls, ordinary humans endowed with unique powers, were his captives, seized at the battlefield's fringe. In the wake of the Paradise Tower forces' downfall, he chanced upon this cadre of surreptitious beings, radiating subtle malice toward him. To his age, they were indeed mere striplings, their collective lifespans but a mere fraction of his own. The peculiar powers they harboured piqued his curiosity. Having ascertained they posed no threat, he subdued them with ease, ushering them into Paradise Tower, and consigned them there. Farudo invoked the Eye of Oblivion, a hallmark ability of a Netherworld Demonic Orator, to scrutinize the essence and provenance of powers. The Eye of Oblivion perused each detainee. In short order, the extraordinary power within one provoked a momentary arrest in Farudo. "What is this? A radiance? A white force?" Farudo's Eye of Oblivion settled on Adolf, whose aura appeared luminous, strikingly brilliant against the chamber's gloom. He drew near the long-held bearer of the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifact. "Enlighten me, what is this force?" he demanded, seizing Adolf's jaw and infusing a pulse of nether energy to rouse him. Nether energy, the prerogative of the Netherworld's elite, possessed the capacity to ignite latent potential, granting an ephemeral resurgence. Chapter 473: Conflict 3 Adolf, already grievously wounded and starved for days without even a sip of water, was on the brink of exhaustion. He couldn't fathom why, with all abilities assembled, the prophesied Heroic Soul of Heavenly Mandate remained absent. Yet, this was the path he had chosen, and he held no regrets. "Heh..." A weak smile crept across his face, betraying no intent to converse. "Admirable," Farudo intoned with approval. "Alas, the staunchest often meet swift ends in the unforgiving reality." "Then do it... end me," Adolf said evenly. He had left everything behind solely to spare others. With the endgame playing out as he had foreseen, all else faded to insignificance. His death was imminent. And the karma that ensued would be his and his alone to bear, implicating no one else. "Pitiable," Farudo remarked, discerning Adolf's determination. He turned his gaze to the six captive bearers of the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts. "Netherworld Demonic Orator." He raised his right hand. "From order to the chaos at entropy's edge. Shadow of radiance, land of decline, by my name, Farudo, I summon thee." In his palm, a mass of abyssal hair emerged. Like tendrils of the darkest night, it wove across the floor, casting an umbral veil over the grand hall. "Netherworld Demonic Speaker, my voice heralds the abyss. With this sacrifice of flesh, I call forth my slumbering essence from within the divine column. Herein lies the pact." Farudo's hand dropped, and the ebon strands severed, scattering about, seeking refuge in the shadows. He approached the six. "Evil Soul Eye." His eyes shifted, revealing an arcane sight crafted to ensnare life's essence, doubling the potency of the sacrificed souls. Approaching the first, his gaze shimmered with triangular, pyramidal patterns of sable and violet, fixated on the captive's brow. Hiss... A spectral form, bubble-like and azure, seeped from the captive, stretching into a thread that shot into Farudo's right eye. "One soul claimed." He moved on to the second, and another ethereal figure followed the path of the first. Then onto the third. Xie Qiaoyue, slumped against Adolf, paralyzed by the sight of soul after soul being harvested, felt a dread that shook her very core. She had been summoned inexplicably, only to fall into captivity before achieving her goal. Weakened by deprivation, resistance was beyond her grasp. Farudo now stood before her, his soul-stealing gaze fixed on her. Suddenly, he paused, his attention captured by Adolf at her side. After a moment's hesitation, he opted to confront the enigmatic Adolf first, to avert any unforeseen perils. An ethereal force began its work, Farudo's pupils casting a sinister, otherworldly field, enveloping Adolf. The power began to corrode his being, intent on usurping his soul. At that instant. Flash!! A brilliant burst of sanctity flared from Adolf. The luminescence, sovereign and divine, severed the tether of soul extraction. Sensing the assault's might, the white light swathed Adolf protectively. "Hmm?!" Farudo's surprise was fleeting. Could any power defy his Evil Soul Eye? He intensified the gaze, staring down the anomaly that was Adolf. "Seize!!" The power surged, eliciting a reaction from the white light—a formidable, indistinct will awakening within its brilliance. "You, who bested my disciple, reveal yourself," the will resonated with a consciousness that vibrated through the hall. "Who dares?" Farudo's gaze narrowed. Only a select few could project their will through pure energy. The entity within the radiance was no ordinary adversary. "Me? Merely an unheralded warden," the voice within the light murmured. "But as I have stirred, my true form is alerted." "So, vanquish my disciple, but his death you shall not claim. In life, defeat is but a prelude. Where death is absent, I offer redemption anew." "Death denied?" A sneer curled Farudo's lips. "Heed this counsel," the voice in the light spoke calmly. "For most, life teems with second chances. But you, confronted with my presence, are afforded but a single query." "Your query is noted. And my response..." Farudo's finger darted forward. Pu. It met Adolf's brow with lethal precision. A surge of the Netherworld's shadow flooded his senses, ravaging his mind beyond repair. "You have your answer." He retracted his hand. "Harvest the soul!!" The invisible force of damnation swelled at his side. With ruthless vigour, it wrenched the pale, translucent soul from Adolf's form. As a Demonic Orator of the Netherworld, Farudo was unmoved by threats. The realm of man held no sway over him, let alone the whispers of an energy-entwined will. Amidst harrowing screams, Adolf's azure essence was caught in a ferocious tug-of-war. The divine light strained to restore the soul to its earthly vessel, while the Evil Soul Eye sought to claim it for the void. "Excellent! Most excellent!!" The will within the light jeered, its ire alight with laughter. "Our encounter is imminent." With a piercing gaze, the light's presence began to wane, the protective power ceding to Farudo's might. "My vigil awaits you." Farudo's lips curled into a smile. Clutching the soul of Adolf, his pupils alight with amethyst law patterns. .................... .................... Evil Spirit Palace. Lin Sheng sat enthroned, his hair draped low, a silent sentinel. Bang!!! A furious sweep cast the table before him asunder. The draconic force flung goblets and confections against the palace wall with abandon. The embossed dragon, shattered at the neck, plummeted to the ground, a cascade of rubble in its wake. "Netherworld's mouthpiece? Farudo??! Heh..." He rose, amidst the cowering fairy attendants, and strode toward the inner sanctum of the Yin Yang Hall. Ever since the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel came under his dominion, his path had been unmarred by adversity. Such a streak inflated his ego, perhaps too much. But now, Farudo's lone gesture evoked a bitterness long forgotten, a defeat both profound and personal. It had also cost him a disciple, one dear to his heart, forever. His misstep. Had he remained unseen, perhaps Adolf would not have fallen so easily... Fury blazed within him. Lin Sheng advanced into the Yin Yang Hall, where the machinations of the Fairy King lay in wait. A unique spellwork capable of connecting the Legion Commanders was at his disposal. He was poised to activate the arcane network, summoning the commanders to his side, ready to pierce the veil of reality. But then, a more audacious scheme took root in his mind. "Guardian of Transposition." A gesture to the earth below conjured a spiraling door of carmine. Without hesitation. Lin Sheng crossed the threshold, his form vanishing into the vortex's embrace. Chapter 475: Rescue (Part 1) Legends are birthed here. History is swallowed into oblivion. A colossal, grey-black vortex spins eternally in the sky. On the ground below, enormous pillars of twisted black smoke rise, with faces of souls in agony occasionally visible within. These are innumerable spirits captured from various worlds. Some were humans, others were not, but regardless of their origin, once their souls enter this place, they are destined to become mere sustenance. Gigantic columns of black smoke connect the earth to the heavens, like titanic pillars holding up the world, turning this entire realm into a cavernous expanse. Known as the Netherworld, or the Dust World, it exists on the flipside of reality, sustained for ages by absorbing the souls of the dead. Here, every soul, whether virtuous or vile, is considered a delectable nourishment. Across the land, dense smoke columns filled with dark fissures stand tall. Within the thickest of these columns: Whoosh! A massive, dark claw cautiously emerges. Three sharp, large talons lead the way, followed by a robust grey arm, a torso, and a colossal crocodile head. Stepping out from the smoke is a gargantuan crocodilian behemoth, towering a hundred meters tall. His green eyes gleam with feral brutality, drawn by a faint summons in his consciousness. With a swipe, he tears a dark fissure in space, stepping into it with deliberate steps. "So, Farudo hastens to call forth more of his essence? How ludicrous. I, Demon Blade Officer Silvis, answer your summons," a powerful, cryptic voice reverberates through the surroundings. As he prepares to seal the spatial rift, a pillar of pure white light descends from above, striking precisely next to the massive column of smoke, right at the edge of the tear. Compared to the column, the beam is slender and sharp, like a white lance driven into the earth. Though smaller, its power is no less potent. "Is this the Netherworld?" As Demon Blade Officer Silvis watches in bewilderment, a deep voice emanates from within the beam. Hiss!!! Instantaneously, the column of white light blooms like ink into water, swiftly spreading out an abundance of white glyphs. Amidst this radiant tapestry, a knight clad in heavy white armor floats silently, gently bobbing within the light. "This is the Grandmaster's Pillar, where the Netherworld's officials slumber. Who might you be?" the Demon Blade Officer, sensing the domineering nature of the pure light, queries first. "I am the Evil Spirit King!" The white knight's body abruptly expands, his form becoming immense as two sharp spiral horns sprout from his forehead. A maelstrom of terrifying holy light and chaotic soul power spreads in all directions. This divine light and chaotic soul force, upon entering the Netherworld, ravage like wolves among sheep, leaving no stronghold unchallenged, no resistance unbroken. Boom! The surge of holy power and chaotic soul force, exceeding the might of an Emissary, explodes, radiating across hundreds of meters and turning the area into a white-enshrouded landscape. This compels Demon Blade Officer Silvis, who had initially underestimated the figure's size, to reassess his stance. His instincts warn him that the nature of this intruder's power is antithetical to his own. In a confrontation, even with his greater might, the outcome may not be favorable. "The Evil Spirit King? I am Silvis, the Vanguard Demon Blade Officer of the Netherworld!" The crocodilian behemoth reemerges from the spatial fissure, resuming his stance, looking down imperiously upon Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng, in turn, raises his gaze to the towering behemoth. The discrepancy in their statures is pronounced, yet their auras seem evenly matched. "I've never heard of the title 'Evil Spirit King'; however, there is a space nearby inhabited by a race claiming the name 'Evil Spirits.'" Silvis, having lived through countless eras, is naturally acquainted with the lore of the Evil Spirits. "My power has not yet fully awakened, and yet you, Farudo the Netherworld Demonic Orator, dared to exploit my moment of vulnerability, slaying my disciple and seizing his soul!" Lin Sheng's voice is cold as the abyss, bypassing the other's speculation. "Netherworld Demonic Orator Farudo?" Demon Blade Officer Silvis bursts into laughter. "It seems you seek retribution against that miscreant as well. Farudo has no shortage of enemies within the Netherworld. What say you? Shall we join forces to bring about his end?" "An adversary?" Lin Sheng had braced for an immediate battle upon his arrival, yet now he encounters unexpected intelligence. Fortunately, as masters of soul power, they converse directly through this medium, avoiding the barriers of language that might otherwise rob him of crucial information. "Precisely," the Demon Blade Officer chuckles. "Why else would he be the only official to have cleverly slipped away? Within the Grandmaster's Pillar, he has antagonized many an official. It's merely that with numerous adversaries, his existence here has become precarious. Were those officials to learn of his surreptitious escape, they wouldn't let him escape easily." "I see," Lin Sheng muses inwardly. "So, you must know where to find Demonic Orator Farudo's true form, yes?" "I do not. If his true form were so easily discernible by other officials, Farudo wouldn't have survived unscathed for so long," Silvis responds with a sneer. "Your arrival's aura suggests you're not from the mortal realm; we must find another passage to the human world..." "I can forge a path to the human world," Lin Sheng states firmly. "However, if we both desire Farudo's death, what plan do you have in mind?" "A plan exists. Farudo has many enemies in the Netherworld, so he must take every opportunity to escape this realm. Having found his chance, we must strike decisively; we must obliterate his soul in one fell swoop. Therefore, the intricacies of the plan cannot be lightly disclosed to you," Silvis admits openly. "Understood," Lin Sheng nods. "Yet, if I assist in opening the gateway to the human world, that should suffice to prove that I am not one of Farudo's agents, correct?" "That would suffice," the Demon Blade Officer agrees readily. "Once you open the gateway and pinpoint Farudo's essence, I've enlisted another official; together, we will act." "It would be best to wait until Farudo has fully summoned his essence before we strike as one. I want his soul to be annihilated, leaving not even a trace behind," Lin Sheng declares with vehemence. "However, for this to happen, you must first guide us into the human world. If we arrive unprepared, our strength will be insufficient to vanquish Farudo. Even if we cannot overpower him, as a Netherworld Demonic Orator, his escape artistry is formidable. We cannot afford the slightest oversight," Silvis murmurs. "Agreed," Lin Sheng concedes, his exterior seething with fury, though inwardly, his heart remains undisturbed. The obtuse Demon Blade Officer desires to slay Farudo while using the pretext to revel in the human world. Little does he realize, the human world's vulnerability to the Netherworld's incursion is not the gravest threat. The true danger comes from the Dark Tide. The Dust World's Netherworld and the Dark Tide are threats of vastly different scales. At first glance, the Netherworld's necrotic energy and the Dark Tide's dark miasma might seem akin. Yet, they are distinct forces, each of a unique essence.
Chapter 805: The Final Story 'At the East School?' Zhou Tu hesitated for a brief moment. Warnings from both seniors and teachers about nearing the East Campus had not been scarce. They had skirted around giving explicit reasons, yet their tones spelled out clear danger—it was a place teeming with unseen threats. 'Your understanding of the East School is marred by misconceptions. In reality, it's hardly different from here. It's the methodologies in managing the two campuses that diverge. Students there are immersed in tangible horrors, while you are cocooned within a facade of bliss,' Chen Ge clarified, his gaze piercing into Zhou Tu. 'In a way, they might be closer to hope than you are—they know who they are and have glimpsed ways to liberation.' Chen Ge was not deceiving Zhou Tu. Every student, regardless of whether they were from the East or West School, was ensnared by the school’s confines. Students of the West School were trapped in a cycle of altered memories, endlessly reliving a life fabricated by the puppeteers behind the curtain. Conversely, the East School's students, aware of their dire circumstances, were desperately seeking scapegoats to facilitate their escape. 'The students of the East School are closer to hope? I've been led to believe that it's the rejected scraps of the West School that end up there,' Zhou Tu expressed, still not entirely convinced. 'An institution that sees its students as disposable is fundamentally flawed,' Chen Ge countered, his finger gesturing towards the daunting wall separating the campuses. 'Do you know why that wall was erected?' 'Why indeed?' 'The wall exists because the school fears the unpredictable. They've tried to sculpt human nature, forgetting that it's the most intricate thing in this world. Trauma leaves its mark, and forgetting doesn't erase the scars. The school’s plans are fated to fail because you cannot obliterate what has been.' The profoundness of Chen Ge's words left the club members in a state of confusion, their understanding teetering on the edge of realization. The truths he spoke of seemed just beyond their grasp. Youthful curiosity, once ignited, is difficult to extinguish. Chen Ge's stark unveiling of their school's grim realities further fanned the flames of the club members' fascination. 'Should we make our way to the East School now? To be honest, I find it hard to believe that my dreamt-of art studio would be there,' Zhou Tu voiced his doubt in a low murmur. 'The timing is not yet favorable,' Chen Ge replied, throwing a backward glance at his shadow. The dark shadow in Dormitory 413 lay dormant, and yet, it was undergoing a subtle transformation. One could notice, with a careful look, that Chen Ge's shadow was unlike any other's—black as pitch, seemingly swallowing any light that dared to approach. This enigmatic shadow, burgeoning with potential, was a harbinger of strength for Chen Ge. Once it woke, he planned to lead the students back to the East School, their sights set on the isolated apparitions that wandered its grounds. This strategy would bolster his own forces and muddy the stagnant waters of the school, shielding the movements of another 'assailant' within the academy. 'We are currently gathering our strength. Before the overseer of the school notices this insignificant speck, I must prepare an arsenal of defenses.' Chen Ge's gaze then shifted to Wang Yicheng, whose backstory was still shrouded in mystery to the club members. 'Our next destination shall be Wang Yicheng's dormitory.' 'My dormitory?' Wang Yicheng responded with an odd mix of reticence and dismissal. 'There's no need; there's nothing of interest in my dorm.' 'Your voice rises, speech accelerates, and eyes wander as you speak—you're not adept at deception,' Chen Ge observed, his hand resting on Wang Yicheng's shoulder. 'What's causing your hesitation? What is it that you dread we might uncover?' 'I...' Wang Yicheng fumbled for words, ultimately averting his gaze. 'Never mind. Let's go then.' 'Alright.' Wang Yicheng's quarters were located in Dormitory 413 of the West School, sharing the same number as Lin Sisi's accommodations in the East School. Though the dorm numbers were identical, the occupancy was not: in the West School, all beds but the fourth were filled, while in the East School, only the fourth bed was claimed, the others left vacant. 'Keep the secrets of our society to yourselves, and tread carefully. This school houses benevolent teachers like myself and those who are less forgiving,' Chen Ge advised, a constant undercurrent of vigilance in his voice. The commotion they had caused in the Laboratory Building had not gone unnoticed; the school authorities were most likely conducting their investigation. 'Time is of the essence. Once we've inspected Dormitory 413, we must lay low to elude attention.' The West School boasted four male dormitory buildings, vastly outnumbering the student population of the East School. The halls were alive with the bustle of peak hours—sounds of washing, tumbling basins, and conversations melded into a cacophony. 'This building resembles the one in the East School quite closely.' Chen Ge projected an air of nonchalance, trailing behind the four students into the structure. The dormitory supervisor's quarters were shut, yet a woman in her fifties hummed contentedly from within, her demeanor seemingly cheery. Next to the window, a notice was displayed, clearly prohibiting the use of high-power electrical devices in the dormitories and barring students from cooking on their own. 'I recall the notice in the East School's dormitory—it warned of recent violent incidents and strictly forbade students from exiting their rooms after lights out.' A mere wall apart, yet the two sides were worlds apart, akin to the realms divided by the 'door.' Crossing the corridor, Chen Ge and the club members reached the entrance to Dormitory 413. 'This room is no different from the others,' Wang Yicheng insisted as he unlocked the door. Once inside, his presence seemed to dissolve; his dorm mates continued their activities, paying him no heed. As Wang Yicheng advanced, the student sleeping by the door abruptly lifted his mosquito net and glared. 'How many times must I repeat myself? Shut the door behind you. Has your hearing failed alongside your leg?' The student's voice was tinged with contempt, his animosity towards Wang Yicheng palpable. 'He refrained from closing the door because we were following. If you seek an apology, we can furnish one on his behalf. However, what kind of apology do you prefer?' Chen Ge interposed, holding the doorknob and entering. His eyes scanned the other occupants of the room. Confronted by Chen Ge, the Mosquito Net Man's defiance waned. He fell into silence, drawing his net down with a glower. 'Teacher Bai, this is the unoccupied fourth bed, relegated to storing luggage,' Wang Yicheng pointed out, where an assortment of bags was piled. In contrast to his dorm mates, Wang Yicheng's possessions were tidily stowed beneath his own bed, while the others had relegated their clutter to the vacant fourth bed. Chen Ge had a peculiar kinship with the fourth bed, having once occupied a similarly numbered berth in the East School. Nearing the bed, he noted that although it lay unclaimed, it was dressed with bedding and a comforter, now sullied by the scattered belongings and discarded items. Zhang Ya Extra Chapter: Let's Get Our Marriage Certificate (Free Birthday Special Chapter) Dark clouds shrouded the city, making the sky seem almost within reach. Li Man stood by the window, watching the rain trace its path down the glass. The clock on the wall ticked away, as the somber march of time quietly flowed within the small office. "5:30, time to wrap up for the day." Li Man stretched, moved the succulents from the windowsill indoors, and approached her desk. She stored the sign with 'Marriage Registration Office' into the drawer, casting a glance at the bold inscription on the wall—'Governed by Law, Civil in Service.' "With such heavy rain, it's unlikely anyone will come to register for marriage today." Humming, Li Man began to tidy the office. Alone in the quiet Marriage Registration Office, she noted that the staff next door at the Divorce Registration Office had already left early. "Hello, is this where marriage certificates are processed?" The door opened, and a mature, magnetic male voice echoed from the entrance. With such a nice voice, the man must be good-looking. Li Man looked up to see a man in a black raincoat at the Marriage Registration Office's entrance. He had an average look but carried an indescribable aura. "Yes, you... want to apply for a marriage certificate?" Li Man scrutinized the man. It was unusual to see someone in a raincoat, with a hefty climbing bag, applying for a marriage certificate. "Yes, I've booked an appointment online for today." "Let me check. What's your name?" "Chen Ge." Li Man found Chen Ge's appointment in the system: "I'm about to finish, so let's make this quick. Did you bring everything? Household registration books for both, ID cards, and proof that you two aren't related by direct lineage or within the third degree of collateral consanguinity?" "I've brought it all." The man opened his backpack, searching through it. Li Man faintly heard a cat's meow and curiously peeked into the man's bag. It was stuffed with a repeater, comic books, a rag doll, ballpoint pens, and a large white cat. "I appreciate your patience." Chen Ge handed over two household registration books and two ID cards to Li Man: "Everything's here. Her family approves of me." "You've prepared thoroughly." After registering Chen Ge's information, Li Man was ready to enter the woman's details. She noticed the ID card's magnetic strip was non-functional. She glanced at the name on the ID and realized something. Chen Ge had come to register for marriage, all documents prepared, even bringing a cat, but his girlfriend was missing. "Hold on, sir." Li Man paused: "You're here to marry, right?" "Yes." "Where is your girlfriend? You can't get married alone." Li Man forced a smile: "Both must be present to register." The clock ticked louder, the rain intensified, and Chen Ge slightly pursed his lips, looking at Li Man: "She's here, right behind me." The rain battered the window, the air inside turned heavy. "Sir, please don't joke. To marry, both must be present; I can't help you otherwise." Li Man clutched her chest, feeling suddenly breathless. "She is here. We are inseparable; where I am, she is." Chen Ge's eyes were clear, his tone insistent. Li Man held the demagnetized ID, considering a possibility. She flipped open the woman's household registration book to the page with her name, stamped with a death declaration from the police, dated years ago. "Sir... " Li Man hesitated, touched by Chen Ge's persistence. Her eyes swept over the items in Chen Ge's backpack. Were these the girl's belongings, treasured memories of their times together? Was the cat hers? In a moment, Li Man understood why Chen Ge brought so many things to the office and why he insisted she was with him. Her eyes stung. Holding the girl's ID, Li Man struggled to speak, to either console Chen Ge or reveal the cruel truth. Her lips parted, but the words wouldn't come. She looked at Chen Ge, childlike in his earnestness, her emotions tangled. She managed a smile: "Sir, you must have deeply loved her. How did you meet?" "She pursued me; her love letter was my first." Chen Ge's gaze became distant with memories: "Our first date was at an abandoned school." "An abandoned school? That's an unusual first date." "West City Private Academy, that's where her obsessions and past lie. I stood in the hall she once danced in, with my back to the mirror, my back to her, as we opened our hearts to each other." Li Man listened, envisioning the scene. A serene night, two souls in an empty school recalling the past; a once lively place reduced to echoes, where they shared a moment of solace, back to back—a love story so hauntingly beautiful. "Our second date was at a psychiatric hospital, she in a resplendent red dress, radiant and bold." "A psychiatric hospital?" "Due to my parents, that day I..." "I understand, sorry." Li Man apologized, not wanting to probe into his wounds, perhaps another hidden sorrow. "Our third date was in a building. I cornered a man who had wronged her in an elevator, teaching him a lesson he'd never forget." "You truly cherished your girlfriend. She must have been thrilled." "She was right there with me." Chen Ge's tone warmed, recalling the elevator wrapped in black hair within the Supernatural Tales Association Building. "That scene must have been romantic, heartwarming." Li Man now saw Chen Ge's devotion. "Our fourth date was in the Forensic Medicine Academy's Underground Morgue. She was injured but did not tell me. She sat quietly with me, even seemed to hug me secretly." Chen Ge's voice, attractive and mature, recounted the past, making Li Man overlook the unusual location. "Our fifth date was on the rooftop of a small town in a downpour, much like today." Compared to the previous locales, this setting seemed almost normal: "Did you confess to her then?" Chen Ge nodded: "At the town's pinnacle, I shouted my love to the world. Nothing is more romantic than vowing to never part." "Wow." Li Man had heard many stories, but none shook her as Chen Ge's did, knowing the ending from the death certificate: "What happened after?" "Then..." Chen Ge inhaled slowly: "She fell asleep, a long slumber before she awakes. So I wait for her." The death certificate's sting felt anew, tears brimming in Li Man's eyes. She lowered her head, pretending to search, wiping tears behind the computer. She knew the story's end. Silence fell, broken by Chen Ge's hand resting on an empty chair, as if his girlfriend were there: "Our sixth date..." What followed mattered little. Li Man understood Chen Ge had locked himself in a cage of love, believing his girlfriend remained. Because of love, he denied her departure. Hands clasped, white-knuckled, Li Man yearned to share the truth but couldn't. She hid behind the computer, filled out the form, wanting to grant Chen Ge his dream. But pressing 'confirm' yielded an error—no record of the girl. Reality chilled Li Man. She eyed Chen Ge's reminiscing face, biting her lip: "Sir, our data is incomplete, systems upgrading. I can't process this now. Please return in a week." Li Man wished to help, even to craft a symbolic, non-binding red book. "Alright, thank you." Chen Ge stood, collected his belongings, and walked out. At the door, he lifted his raincoat as if sheltering someone: "Zhang Ya, stay close; the rain's heavy." Li Man saw clearly—no one was under that raincoat with Chen Ge. Watching his retreating form, she wiped a tear: "Perhaps this is love—falling for you, staying true to you, heart bound to you, ending with you." Chapter 806: The Possible 'Door' "Why are all these things piled on the bed? If the student from bed four returns at night, where will he sleep?" Chen Ge murmured as if to himself: "Is he supposed to sleep in someone else's bed?" Since his arrival, the students in Dormitory 413 had cast curious glances his way, inevitably drawn to someone clad in the school's work attire. "Are you a faculty member?" inquired a lanky student from the bed across bed four. His thick glasses gave him a peculiar look: "Bed four is empty. We're just making efficient use of the space by storing our stuff there." "A bed all made up and you claim it's unoccupied?" Chen Ge responded with a sly grin: "Maybe you just can't see its occupant. Be mindful when you sleep; don't roll too much, or you might find an unexpected bedfellow." Standing by bed four, Chen Ge began moving all the belongings to the floor: "This is preposterous, taking liberties even with a ghost's bed." "Hey! Don't touch our things!" The Mosquito Net Man once again stuck his head through the doorway. "I'm doing you a favor. This bed has its own master, who has always lingered in this school." Chen Ge was intrigued by the discoveries in East Campus's Dormitory 413 and equally anticipated what West Campus's counterpart might hold. "You're aware of the legend of Dormitory 413's bed four?" The bespectacled student's face tensed: "That was just to spook Wang Yicheng. You're not taking it seriously, are you?" "Truth or myth, you'll know once you've had an encounter." After emptying the bed, Chen Ge stripped off the pillowcases and duvet cover to ensure nothing was concealed. "You say there's someone in bed four, and yet you casually handle their possessions?" The tall, skinny student adjusted his glasses, visibly annoyed with Chen Ge, perhaps because he had sided with Wang Yicheng, which was contrary to their dorm's vibe. "Doesn't bother me. I'm not lodging in this dorm. Should he take offense, you'll be his first port of call." Chen Ge's approach was a stark contrast to the students' idea of a teacher, but he was a fake and had no concerns about pretenses. Peeling back the mattress, he halted the quarrel, his gaze locking onto the bed plank. There, at the edge near the wall, were five bloodied fingerprints. "These aren't part of your prank, are they?" Chen Ge scraped a bit of the dried blood with his nail and sniffed it; it seemed to be coagulated blood. Why would there be fresh blood on bed four? "Teacher, what's that?" Wang Yicheng, who had only just spotted the blood fingerprints due to their concealed placement, spoke up. "Dried red paint. I've dabbled in painting; I'm quite familiar with this scent." Chen Ge shot a glance at the other dorm residents: "Someone here enjoys their pranks." Not dwelling on the topic, he pulled out Lin Sisi's phone for illumination and peered beneath the bed board. Much like a scene from East Campus, there was a message carved beneath this bed. Tiny letters, likely etched with a knife point by point. "Why does nobody speak to me?" "Why does everyone overlook me?" "I didn't deceive them! There truly are ghosts! I genuinely saw a ghost in the restroom!" "This place is perilous! Why will no one believe me?" The words triggered a sense of recognition in Chen Ge. He read on and encountered a name all too familiar. "I, Lin Sisi, swear on my life, the restroom is indeed haunted! It's true, they're watching me!" "I realize everyone despises me and wants to joke around. I'm delighted, I get it, but there are genuinely ghosts in the restroom! I wasn't lying this time!" Each character on the bed plank was etched with intense effort; some spots were even stained with blood, possibly from the carver's hand being cut by accident. "Were these also left by Lin Sisi? Yet, his narrative doesn't quite match the Ghost School Diary's account!" Chen Ge quickly picked up on the discrepancy. The diary described Lin Sisi as a troublemaker who enjoyed pranking others and was eventually frightened to death by his classmates in a restroom ruse. But the inscriptions told a different tale, suggesting Lin Sisi wasn't scared to death by his classmates but had indeed witnessed something in the restroom. Terrifying upon careful thought, Chen Ge's eyes narrowed as he questioned which account to trust. The owner of bed four was without a doubt Lin Sisi, in both East and West Campuses. "If this dorm has replicated everything from memory, then these carvings must be authentic. But Lin Sisi is dead; how could he return to inscribe these words?" He paused, surveying the room's occupants. The dorm, now with bed four vacant, mirrored the past. Lin Sisi met his end, leaving bed four empty, with five others still residing in the dorm. Aware of the restroom's genuine haunting, Lin Sisi returned postmortem to deliver a warning, leaving various signs unnoticed by all. "It's no surprise he etched such phrases. As a ghost, naturally, the living are blind to him." Chen Ge was uncertain whether these five were the same individuals who had lived with Lin Sisi. If not, they were deeply unfortunate. In East Campus, every new arrival was dubbed Lin Sisi, a harbinger of doom and a curse, targeted by all the fierce ghosts. Yet, from another perspective, for the fierce ghosts seeking graduation, a scapegoat was necessary, making the name Lin Sisi a beacon of hope. "The plot thickens. A living curse is a ghost's dream. What role did Lin Sisi play in this school?" Chen Ge was sure of Lin Sisi's deep ties to the school. Even if not the master, he was definitely linked to the real owner. "If only I could find him or the prior 'Lin Sisi'." He kept reading. The carvings grew more desperate, the carver's mindset shifting from anxiety to hopelessness. "I did see a ghost, just believe me this once?" "Hear my voice, I'm here, right here!" "Fine, I've given up on your belief. Just promise me you won't visit the restroom on the teaching building's top floor! Don't forget! Never go there!" "It's too late, they've escaped..." The message beneath the bed ended abruptly, and Chen Ge could sense the utter despair of the scribe. "The restroom on the teaching building's top floor? Was that Lin Sisi's end?" Chen Ge stood motionless, his thoughts racing. The Ghost School scenario was the most intricate, expansive, and challenging mission he had encountered, with threads of clues and enigmas woven like an impenetrable fog. Untangling it all in one go was an impossibility. Chen Ge had to start from the most fundamental detail. "A 'door' doesn't just materialize out of thin air; there must be a Door Pusher. If Lin Sisi is that individual, then the likeliest place for that door's emergence would be the restroom atop the teaching building!" Chapter 807: Black Leather Shoes Chen Ge's eyes gleamed with a sharp insight; he had unearthed a crucial clue. "The Psychic Ghost School is a four-star scenario; I've never dealt with a four-star level before. None of my past encounters are applicable here. To learn more, only a direct investigation will suffice." Chen Ge contemplated the overwhelming obsession required to fabricate such an extensive nightmare, a feat not even the collaborative efforts of Doctor Gao and Zhang Ya could achieve. "Perhaps there has always been a door within that restroom, one that was inadvertently opened during the students' malicious prank on Lin Sisi." In Chen Ge's own haunted house, there was a door he had always avoided. He speculated that Lin Sisi might have found herself in a similar predicament. However, where he had sidestepped the door, Lin Sisi had unlatched it. "No matter the actuality, the restroom at the pinnacle of the teaching building calls for an inspection!" It was uncertain whether the restroom was located in the East Campus or the West Campus. To err on the side of caution, Chen Ge decided to visit restrooms in both sectors. "Let's vacate this place; accompany me to the Laboratory Building," Chen Ge resolved, having acquired enough information from beneath the bunk of Dormitory 413. Lingering in Dormitory 413 was now pointless and risked drawing the dorm residents' attention. "The Laboratory Building? But we've just..." Before Wang Yicheng could articulate his objection, Zhang Ju interjected with a gentle tug on his arm. "Obey the club leader's commands—he leads, we follow." Referencing the Laboratory Building was a strategic feint by Chen Ge. The students from Dormitory 413 had been unwelcoming; they would likely inform the dormitory manager as soon as he left. "The lights-out bell is imminent; let's swiftly gather our belongings and reconvene." After restoring the bed to its former state, Chen Ge and the Supernatural Tales Association members departed from Dormitory 413. They exited without drawing notice. Beyond the confines of the male dormitory, Chen Ge noticed numerous individuals hastening toward the Laboratory Building—a signal that something was amiss. "Should Zhu Long's mere disruption of the Dissection Table have merited such a reaction? Wouldn't the duty teacher be sufficient to address it?" Chen Ge was intrigued by the events at the Laboratory Building, but discretion overrode curiosity. Approaching now would be akin to ensnaring oneself. The preferable strategy was to circumvent it. "Teacher, should we truly venture to the Laboratory Building? We've only just returned from there." "To Building One, and let's be swift. We need to investigate before the school authorities catch on," Chen Ge instructed, leading them away from the Laboratory Building. As they proceeded, the campus grew increasingly desolate. "Have you ever heard any strange tales involving the restrooms here?" Chen Ge inquired as they walked. "Has anyone been to the restroom at the uppermost level of the teaching building?" "No," the students unanimously responded. "This institution may seem conventional, but peril is omnipresent. Once we reach our destination, you must adhere to my instructions unequivocally." They reached the teaching building, a prominent feature of the East Campus, consisting of three four-storied edifices. "Your school appears to have a particular fondness for the number 'four.'" By now, the teaching building was devoid of students; classrooms were cloaked in darkness, with only the corridor lights piercing the gloom. "This is my inaugural visit to the teaching building at such a late hour. In the absence of the daytime crowd, I hadn't anticipated how menacing it could be." Wang Yicheng's pace slackened, his expression becoming tense as he drew closer to the teaching building, as if repelled by the place. Chen Ge noticed Wang Yicheng's altered demeanor; the lame boy must have suffered through some unpleasant experiences within these classrooms. "Stay within sight. We're ascending directly to the apex. Disregard anything you might observe in the other classrooms—do not investigate them." Before entering, Chen Ge surveyed the area. Each structure featured dual staircases, with restrooms situated near the left one. "Shall we advance?" Zhou Tu struggled to comprehend Chen Ge's maneuvers. Each action seemed meticulously planned, yet their interconnectedness was elusive. Chen Ge, however, exuded an aura of profound, inscrutable wisdom, as if harboring a secret within his mind. "Don't lag behind," Zhang Ju kindly advised Zhou Tu, then aided Wang Yicheng as they entered the stairwell. "Hurry, this is a club activity." Zhu Long, with eyes bloodshot, clutched a pink women's phone, an item that oddly didn't clash with his tall stature. "I must be mad, trailing you to a school restroom in pursuit of supernatural phenomena under the cloak of night." Zhou Tu entered the stairwell with marked reluctance, and the group ascended to the top floor without pausing. The night had transformed the teaching building into a realm of eerie silence, a stark contrast to its diurnal activity. "Zhang Ju and I will scout the interior first. Zhu Long, you provide support from the middle. Zhou Tu and Wang Yicheng, stand guard outside," Chen Ge directed, his hand poised on the restroom door handle. As he was about to press down, his arm was abruptly seized. "Teacher, perhaps it would be wise not to enter..." Wang Yicheng, his pallor ghostly and beaded with sweat, stood beside Chen Ge, his pupils flickering with trepidation. "I've just recollected something dreadful that transpired right here!" "What transpired?" Chen Ge had never seen Wang Yicheng so perturbed. "I have a remote memory of being implicated in that incident. They coerced me—I was the sole one who refrained from entering this restroom, and that's why I'm still alive. The others who entered... they're no longer with us." Wang Yicheng spoke in a tumult, his voice tinged with fear. "Everyone who entered this restroom perished?" Chen Ge's touch on Wang Yicheng's hand was light. "You're a newcomer; how could you possess memories linked to this restroom?" "I don't know, it was unintentional! They compelled me! Teacher, let's depart! Please, don't open that door!" Wang Yicheng pleaded with urgency. "Having journeyed this far, I cannot retreat." Chen Ge removed Wang Yicheng's hand and pushed the restroom door open with resolve. "No! Refrain from touching that door!" Amid Wang Yicheng's shrieks, Chen Ge swung open the door, his gaze piercing into the restroom's depths. Rubber ghost masks were strewn across the floor; the walls were smeared with oil-painted handprints and facial features in hues of blood, creating a palpable sense of being watched from every direction. "Lin Sisi was subjected to her ordeal here." Chen Ge retrieved a rubber mask from the ground, ensured it was harmless, and stowed it in his backpack. Moving cautiously, he paused by the first cubicle to capture several photographs with Lin Sisi's phone. The restroom lay silent, devoid of any interlopers. "The setting appears mundane, yet an unsettling feeling suggests otherwise." Chen Ge's gaze fell upon the sealed cubicle door, instinctively pushing against it, but it remained immovable. "Could there be someone within?" He stooped to peer through the crevice beneath the cubicle door, and there, resting with foreboding intent, lay a pair of black leather shoes. Chapter 808: Roommates 'There's someone in the stall!' Chen Ge's gaze fell upon the black leather shoes, a stark reminder of Teacher Bai from the East Campus, donned in similar footwear. 'Do not approach.' Retreating a few steps, Chen Ge manoeuvred Lin Sisi's phone into the narrow opening of the stall, hastily capturing a photo. Consulting the phone's display, Chen Ge's fears were not realized; the stall was occupied solely by a pair of shoes, devoid of any 'person'. 'Lin Sisi's phone is capable of photographing fierce ghosts and other peculiar entities. Absent any anomalies in the image, it is evident that the stall is merely home to this pair of shoes. However, if no one is present, how did the door come to be locked?' Restroom stall doors are designed to lock only from the interior, and the placement of the black leather shoes suggested the presence of an unseen individual, not simply thrown inside from the exterior. 'Teacher, could it be a misperception? Who in their right mind would seek the solitude of the teaching building's top-floor restroom in the dead of night? The thought alone is unsettling.' Memories within Zhu Long were beginning to stir, nebulous and fragmented, yet they wielded influence. Undetected by the others, these recollections prompted him to distance himself from his peers, gravitating instead towards Chen Ge's presence, a signal that perhaps they shared a common thread. 'Remain here and promptly alert me should others draw near.' Chen Ge exerted force upon the stall door, resorting to violence to thrust it open. Within the confines of the narrow space, countless ghostly visages were depicted in oil paint, giving the unnerving impression of being surveilled by an invisible multitude. 'Why would there be just a pair of shoes here?' Nothing out of the ordinary was discovered in the first stall. Proceeding to the second, Chen Ge deftly employed his phone to capture an image through the gap. The photo exposed another pair of shoes residing in the second stall, though these were not the black leather of the first, but rather tattered blue sneakers. 'The positioning is identical; might there be some underlying significance?' Stall after stall, Chen Ge inspected the first six, each hosting a pair of men's shoes of disparate styles and sizes, presumably belonging to different individuals. 'The black leather shoes in the initial stall bear a striking resemblance to those worn by Teacher Bai, likely an adult size, whereas the remaining five stalls contain footwear indicative of student ownership. Could each pair of shoes be representative of a distinct individual?' 'Might the proprietors of these shoes have been the ones most antagonistic towards Lin Sisi previously?' In the realm of the spectral, fierce ghosts are distinct from the living, their very essence woven from obsessions and negative emotions, foreign to concepts like forgiveness and kindness. Independent of Lin Sisi's disposition during his lifetime, his transformation into a fierce ghost was undoubtedly accompanied by a surge of spiteful resentment. This obsession stands as one of the fundamental pillars sustaining his existence as a fierce ghost. To imprison those who tormented oneself within stalls, forcing their companionship, is a deed within the realm of likelihood for a fierce ghost, as Chen Ge surmised. 'Teacher! People are advancing towards the teaching building!' Zhou Tu, lending support to Wang Yicheng, raised his voice from the threshold of the restroom: 'They seem to be originating from the direction of the laboratory building!' 'Are they targeting us?' In haste, Chen Ge approached the final stall, instinctively brandishing his phone for a snapshot, only to be met with astonishment as he observed the seventh stall's door dismantled. 'Where is the seventh door?' Chen Ge's mind raced with theories, the most plausible being that the door related to Lin Sisi would be situated within the confines of the restroom, yet his thorough search proved fruitless. 'Stay calm, no need for alarm.' A subtle bite to his tongue was Chen Ge's method of maintaining composure, aware that those on the lower level would require time to ascend: 'Each Blood Door is paired uniquely with its Door Pusher...' Fingers tracing the frame, Chen Ge detected that the hinge of the seventh stall had been forcefully broken: 'The door to this stall has been violently burst from within!' A glance within revealed the absence of shoes in this seventh stall, only the presence of two blood-red shoeprints. The shoeprints, aligned in succession, seemed to mimic the footsteps of someone departing the enclosure. 'If each pair of shoes is symbolic of an individual, did the occupant of this last stall manage to escape?' A swift turn by Chen Ge, as his survey of the enclosure was met with an uncanny sensation—the grotesque faces adorning the walls appeared to take on a life of their own, their expressions morphing from moments prior. 'All despair and negative emotions from the West Campus have been transferred to the East Campus. The authentic 'Blood Door' is presumed to reside within the restroom at the summit of the teaching building in the East School.' Confronted with one unresolved puzzle after another, Chen Ge's brow was marked by taut veins, and he bit down on his tongue with vigor, ensuring his clarity of thought: 'I proceed step by step, ever closer to the elusive truth.' 'Teacher! They've scaled the stairs! We must find a place of concealment!' The voice of Zhou Tu was laced with urgency; a sudden onset of panic gripped him: 'The figures who have infiltrated the teaching building do not appear to be faculty or students, and they move with an odd cadence!' 'An odd cadence?' A shiver of foreboding ran through Chen Ge; he motioned to Zhang Ju and Zhu Long to make their exit: 'Which route did they take to climb the floors?' 'The corridor by the restroom!' 'Very well! We shall make our descent via the alternative path! Exercise caution, and take care that we remain unseen!' Lacking any intention of a direct confrontation, Chen Ge made for the alternate corridor, yet as he passed by Wang Yicheng, he came to an abrupt halt. His pupils narrowed, fixating on the shoes Wang Yicheng wore. 'Blue sneakers?' Wang Yicheng's footwear was an exact replica of the sneakers in the second stall of the restroom! 'The footwear in the restroom stalls—exclusively men's shoes... 'Chen Ge's mind delved into recollection, as he unearthed an unsettling correlation: the shoes within the restroom mirrored those belonging to the residents of Dormitory 413. 'With six inhabitants in Dormitory 413, and seven stalls in the teaching building's top-floor restroom, six individuals correspond to six stalls, and one stall is graced by black leather shoes, indicative of a teacher—completing the count of seven.' A crease of consternation formed on Chen Ge's brow: 'What could drive Lin Sisi to harbor such intense rancor towards his own roommates? Was it not he who ventured back to the dormitory, expressly to warn his roommates to steer clear of the restroom?' Chen Ge's fingers pressed against his temples with fervor, besieged by a myriad of considerations: 'The East Campus is engulfed in chaos and disarray, whereas the West Campus presents itself as a relic preserved within a glass vessel, eternally fixed in the days encircling school enrollment, in perpetual repetition. To decipher the truth, one must compare and contrast the identical scenes present within both the East and West Campuses.' 'The West Campus exudes an air of perfection so ethereal, it might as well be a child's dream. By comparison, the East Campus emerges as a more palpable reality.' Chen Ge's focus shifted from Wang Yicheng's shoes; a resolute decision had been made—to shepherd everyone to the East Campus. 'At this juncture, devoid of other options, I am compelled to seek out memories within the realm of dreams, to chase after the essence of truth within the fabric of reality.' Chapter 809: They Forced Me! The individuals hurrying over from the Laboratory Building had already made their way into the corridor, heading straight for the Top Floor Restroom with a purposeful pace. "Quick, let's go!" Chen Ge didn't hesitate to lift Wang Yicheng onto his back as they all hastened through the hallway to its opposite side. They took refuge in the stairwell, muting their breaths. "Teacher Bai, why are we stopping here?" "Keep an eye on the third-floor entrance. I’ll take the fourth. After they've all climbed to this level, we'll go down," Chen Ge directed, positioning himself boldly at the corridor's edge. With the aid of his Shadow Pupil, he kept vigil over the restroom. "But..." "Just do as I say." Chen Ge remained at his post by the fourth-floor stairwell entrance on the right side, monitoring the opposite side. Shortly, he distinctly heard footsteps from the left stairwell, followed by the appearance of several figures donned in white on the fourth floor. "Their attire is peculiar... entirely in white? Even down to their shoes?" A trio had ascended the stairs, all uniformly dressed in white. Apart from their garb, they shared a disturbing similarity—their faces were marred by scars. Not just minor scratches, but like Zhang Ju, their visages were marked by severe burns, creating an unsettling sight. "Are these the school's Managers?" Chen Ge speculated as he observed them enter the restroom. He then led the students down, artfully avoiding any encounter. "Teacher, what do we do next?" "We must head to East Campus," Chen Ge replied with a sense of urgency, feeling the pressure from those clad in white. "Why the panic? It feels like we're doing something clandestine," Zhou Tu commented, perplexed by the tense atmosphere around Chen Ge and the club members. "We're students of the school, and Teacher Bai, you're on the faculty. Even if the school catches us, at most we'd get a reprimand, or we might have to compensate for the damage to the Laboratory Building's Dissection Table. It shouldn't be a big deal." "Do you truly believe that a mere reprimand from the school is all we'd face if we're caught?" Chen Ge locked eyes with Zhou Tu, who looked away, unable to maintain eye contact. "You'll see once we get to East Campus." Chen Ge guided the students away from the Teaching Building, along a less-traveled path that led to the sports equipment room nearby. "Teacher, shouldn't we be making for East Campus? Why stop at the sports equipment room?" "We're here for tools. Wang Yicheng, Zhou Tu, keep watch. Everyone else, come in and grab any ropes or similar equipment you find." Chen Ge forced the door of the sports equipment room and found an assortment of jump ropes. "Teacher! The ones in white seem to be heading this way!" Zhou Tu's voice came from the doorway. He had spotted several white figures emerging from the Teaching Building and heading straight for their location. "How did they find out we're here? If their arrival at the restroom was coincidental, how did they pinpoint our presence at the sports equipment room?" Chen Ge was seized by an ominous feeling. He zipped up the bulging backpack, now too cumbersome to wear, and carried it by hand. "The sports equipment room is large; it'll take them some time to search through it. Let's leave now." Chen Ge, backpack in hand, signaled to Wang Yicheng, "Come here, I'll carry you." Though Chen Ge meant well, Wang Yicheng resisted, his eyes filled with terror like someone waking from a nightmare: "Teacher, I'm scared. Someone is calling my name. Those coming after us, they're looking for me; I can hear them!" "Tell me, when did you start hearing your name? Keep talking as we walk," Chen Ge said, picking up Wang Yicheng without hesitation, as every second counted. "Teacher! They are coming for me! If I stay with you, they'll find us for certain!" Wang Yicheng's expression was twisted with fear, his entire frame quivering. "Stop talking. You're my student; just answer my questions," Chen Ge quickened his pace, intrigued by Wang Yicheng's claims. "When you brought me to the top floor of the Teaching Building, I felt an immediate discomfort, an overwhelming urge to cry, and that corridor... it seemed uncannily familiar as if I had witnessed a terrible event there long ago." Wang Yicheng's eyes were red and swollen, his breath as labored as a beached fish gasping for air. "You're a freshman, how could the corridor seem familiar to you?" "I can't explain it... sometimes you visit a place for the first time and it feels like you've been there before. That's the sensation I'm experiencing now." Wang Yicheng’s speech was intermittent, his face ashen with dread. "And the voice, when did it start speaking to you? What did it tell you?" Chen Ge probed softly. "The moment I saw the corridor, the discomfort began. As we stood by the restroom door, an image flashed through my mind." Wang Yicheng inhaled deeply, pausing before he continued: "I have this vague memory of being in this restroom before. I was meant to lead someone very important here. His slender figure was in the restroom, filled to the brim with a variety of demons and monsters! It's the recollection of these events that caused me to resist entering with you." "Wait!" Chen Ge zeroed in on an essential detail in Wang Yicheng's story: "You were meant to lead someone important into the restroom?" "Yes, it's as though he was my best friend. I know that feeling; few have ever wanted to be my friend, but he was an exception." Wang Yicheng began hitting his own head, his memory apparently loosening: "When we were outside the restroom, I heard his voice in my head, calling out. I'm sure it was him! Yet, I can't remember who he was." "Was his name Lin Sisi?" Chen Ge whispered the name Lin Sisi into Wang Yicheng's ear. At the sound of the name, Wang Yicheng's body shook uncontrollably, his grip on Chen Ge's neck tightening to the point of strangling. "I didn't mean to, they coerced me! I'm sorry! We were still best friends!" Wang Yicheng screamed with his eyes shut, his voice laden with harrowing desperation, as if awakening to find a ghostly figure standing at the bedside in the middle of the night. "Stay composed!" Wang Yicheng's sudden meltdown was unexpected and risked drawing more attention. Chen Ge quickly released him and delivered a sharp strike to his carotid artery. "Teacher Bai?" The other students were startled. "Be quiet! I'm trying to save him!" Chen Ge tested a few more points before Wang Yicheng finally fell into unconsciousness: "A mental breakdown can inflict serious harm on the brain; the best immediate solution I could think of was to stop his thoughts, if only for a brief moment." Chapter 810: Beyond the Wall Chen Ge watched over Wang Yicheng's unconscious form, unsettled by the critical insight drawn from Wang's earlier, disjointed words. The one who had deceitfully coaxed Lin Sisi into the restroom was none other than Wang Yicheng! 'To think that the pivotal figure was right beside me all this time.' Chen Ge was grateful that even after crossing through the Door, his essence remained uncorrupted. Initially, his interaction with Wang Yicheng was driven by simple compassion—seeing someone alone and wanting to make a difference. His good intentions paid off; Wang Yicheng now had a group of friends who would neither bully nor scorn him. Interpreting the story from Wang Yicheng's frantic speech, Chen Ge started unraveling the sequence of events. Both Wang Yicheng and Lin Sisi, roommates in Dormitory 413, were marginalized for various reasons. Their divergent personalities led to different approaches to coping with the cold violence from their peers. Wang Yicheng opted for endurance, bearing the brunt in stoic silence, while Lin Sisi sought ways to draw attention. Their relationship was not one of friendship but rather of convenience, a partnership formed in the face of shared adversity against exclusion and ridicule. The students' animosity toward Lin Sisi escalated into a vindictive prank: dressing up as ghosts to frighten him in the desolate restroom at the top of the Teaching Building. To bait Lin Sisi, they approached Wang Yicheng, who shared a comparably decent rapport with him. Chen Ge did not know the persuasion tactics they employed, but the outcome was clear—Wang Yicheng had been swayed. Though Wang Yicheng had his own struggles, he was the one who ultimately steered Lin Sisi toward the edge of danger. 'We must hasten! Before Wang Yicheng awakens, we need to elude our pursuers.' Chen Ge proceeded with extreme caution, visiting various spots to confirm the absence of the white-clad Managers. Only when he was certain they were alone, did he relax slightly. An eerie transformation was unfolding within the West Campus; the number of enigmatic figures dressed in white was proliferating. Without delay, Chen Ge led the club members to the Waste Disposal Center. 'Bai Teacher, are those in white also teachers here? Why haven't I seen them before? And why were they chasing us?' Zhu Long was laden with questions. 'They are not teachers, but Managers tasked with preserving order in the West Campus. Their persistent pursuit...' Chen Ge placed the unconscious Wang Yicheng on the grass, '...stems from him, and from all of you.' 'Us?' 'Correct. This school is far more complex than it appears. If it were to be compared to the human brain, then the West Campus would represent the center that processes all positive emotions, while the East Campus grapples with the negative and the discarded.' Chen Ge offered a straightforward analogy: 'The West Campus harbors only joyful memories, while all the 'trash' is exiled to the East Campus. Yet, how can anyone exist solely with joyful reminiscences?' 'Does that mean we've lost many memories?' Zhang Ju was quick to catch on, piecing together Chen Ge's implications before he finished speaking. 'Precisely. The memories you've lost are tainted with despair, labeled as trash by the West Campus. The moment these memories begin to resurface or awaken, the Managers will send you off to the East Campus.' Chen Ge's tone was grave: 'Armed with the truth, do you still wish to seek out your memories?' 'I do.' Zhu Long didn't hesitate, 'The sensation of knowing something happened but being unable to recall it is unbearable. I'd rather face all my memories than continue in this fragmented state.' 'I yearn to retrieve the memories I've lost. Lacking them, I feel incomplete, similar to... a monster.' Zhang Ju's fingers gently traced the scars on his face, his gaze filled with complexity as his thoughts wandered. 'You've all gone mad! Truly mad!' Zhou Tu's mutterings continued, as he paced to and fro like a rodent trapped in a cage. 'Silence implies consent.' Chen Ge helped Wang Yicheng to his feet: 'Our decision to enter the East Campus actually brings an unexpected advantage. The Managers who wish to take us there could never have anticipated our voluntary descent.' 'Does it make a difference?' 'Indeed. If we go willingly, we retain our humanity. But if they capture and transfer us, more memories might be erased.' Chen Ge comforted his club members: 'The East Campus is not as nightmarish as you imagine. With caution, we will be unharmed.' With Wang Yicheng slung over his back, Chen Ge opened the doors of the West Campus Waste Disposal Center, which was immaculate—a direct contrast to its Eastern counterpart. 'Do not disturb anything here, particularly the sorting doors.' Uncertain of surveillance within the center, Chen Ge handed out ropes to the students: 'On the second floor there's a small window. I'll climb out first to the wall's top. Observe and follow suit.' 'And Wang Yicheng?' 'Secure him with ropes. Once I'm atop the wall, you'll hand him through, and I'll pull him up.' Wang Yicheng's lean stature was a stroke of luck, lessening the burden for Chen Ge. 'Be vigilant. Upon reaching the second floor, act swiftly and follow my directives!' After outfitting the students with ropes, Chen Ge meticulously tied Wang Yicheng, and proceeded to the second floor. Once sure they were undisturbed, Chen Ge wasted no time and headed straight for the window. He opened the window wide and, with practiced ease, scaled to the wall's pinnacle: 'Why hesitate? Hand Wang Yicheng through.' He was connected to Wang Yicheng by a rope ready for the hand-off. 'Could Bai Teacher be a physical education instructor?' Zhang Ju, quick to action, began to guide Wang Yicheng toward the window. 'Remember, this is the second story. Exercise caution.' Zhu Long and Zhou Tu also pitched in, and together they managed to pass Wang Yicheng beyond the wall. The effort was considerable, but Chen Ge successfully maneuvered Wang Yicheng to the wall's apex. He was an indispensable figure in the night's events, and Chen Ge was resolute in not leaving him behind. Perched atop the wall, Chen Ge's demeanor shifted to one of resolve. He loosened the rope around him, inching along the wall, clearing space for his companions. 'Move quickly!' Chen Ge steadied Wang Yicheng, locating gaps between the bricks where he fastened the rope. Should they need to venture from the East to the West in the future, they wouldn't require passage through the Waste Disposal Center—they could use the rope he had secured. It took the group a tense quarter of an hour to transition into the East Campus. To the students of the West, the East presented itself as an alien landscape. Chapter 811: Zhang Ju's Memory "On the second day of orientation, being chased by a teacher and forced to leap over walls, I found myself far from the college life I had envisioned," Zhou Tu mused, dusting off his clothes and unwinding the rope from his waist. "What lies ahead may be even more inconceivable." Chen Ge ensured the rope he had affixed atop the wall was obscured by a curtain of ivy, nearly invisible unless scrutinized. "This rope is my contingency plan." Chen Ge had left the East Campus alone, but he returned as the leader of a club. "Teacher, have you discerned any anomalies?" Zhang Ju stood tall, his scar-shrouded eyes slowly opening wide. "What is it?" "Perhaps it's just my heightened senses, but the air on this side of the wall is unusually dense, saturated with moisture, and bears a peculiar scent, akin to that of blood." Zhang Ju's calm delivery juxtaposed the bizarre nature of his statement. He briefly licked the scar on his upper lip, a look of perplexity and uncertainty in his eyes: "This environment feels more familiar to me than the West Campus." "You're not serious, are you? Familiar with the scent of blood?" Initially, Zhou Tu was simply put off by Zhang Ju's disfigurement, but after hearing his recent remarks, Zhou Tu's view of him shifted. "I am serious—it's the truth." Zhang Ju locked eyes with Chen Ge, who remained motionless, the smile on his face not fully sincere. "Your senses do not deceive you. This land is fertile for nurturing dreams. In the world beyond the door, only with cadavers and blood can the most extraordinary flowers be cultivated." Chen Ge, carrying Wang Yicheng on his back, beckoned Zhang Ju to follow him quietly: "We're venturing to a vital location; it's crucial we remain silent." They maneuvered through the overgrown underbrush, enshrouded by the darkness of night. Reaching their destination without incident, Chen Ge brought Zhang Ju to the Tree Hollow Female Ghost's haunt. "Do you recognize this place?" He indicated the tree hollow housing the female ghost's skull and the surrounding trees. "I have a sense of déjà vu... Is this not the murder scene we saw in the West Campus? How is there an exact duplicate here in the East Campus?" Zhou Tu's eyes bulged, taken aback by the precise replication of the scenes, down to the hollows' positions. "The West Campus's crime scene is nothing but a shell. The real remains and the spirit of the deceased are enshrined here in the East Campus. You are now witnessing the authentic murder site." While Chen Ge explained, Zhang Ju appeared transfixed by the tree hollow, standing beside it, his shoulders quivering imperceptibly. "Zhang Ju?" He didn't seem to hear Chen Ge's voice, gradually kneeling by the tree hollow and extending his shaking hands into its darkness. "Why this madness? Recall, the girl’s head was found within that hollow! What are you searching for inside?" Zhou Tu tried to intervene, but Chen Ge halted him: "Do not disrupt him. His memories are entwined with that hollow; he alone must excavate them." "Excavate them? Have you both lost your minds?" Zhou Tu, overpowered by Chen Ge's strength, could only watch, frustrated and powerless. Zhang Ju knelt, his gaze locked on the abyss of the hollow, his arms burrowing deeper. His body shivered, sweat mingling with the scars on his face, resembling the trails of invisible tears. "Nothing? There must be something! It can't be!" Zhang Ju's voice was fraught with panic, breathless: "I saw it with my own eyes! I witnessed him hide it in the hollow! How can it be gone?" His fingers clawed the soil and bark, his nails bleeding, yet he felt no pain. His face twisted in anguish as he dug furiously at the hollow's foundation. "Zhang Ju, might you be seeking this?" Chen Ge took out a rust-stained kitchen knife from his backpack, the very knife that served as the Tree Hollow Female Ghost's Anchor Object (as per Chapter 787). Initially, Chen Ge had considered the knife merely for self-defense. A hush fell, and all eyes gravitated towards the knife. "This knife, found within the hollow, is infused with the victim's fractured soul." Chen Ge laid the knife before Zhang Ju: "If you hold it, could it stir up a memory of your past?" Zhang Ju's limbs vibrated with intensity, his pupils dilating. "Does it feel familiar? Have you previously encountered this blade? Who was its last holder, and whose neck did it slice?" Chen Ge's questions were like piercing nails driven into Zhang Ju's psyche. The moment his fingertips grazed the knife's handle, his face contorted in horror, pupils shrinking, mouth agape as though scorched by a searing iron. Before a scream could erupt, Chen Ge swiftly covered Zhang Ju's mouth: "It's alright; those events are but echoes of the past, mere fragments of your journey." While consoling Zhang Ju, Chen Ge's gaze was fixed on the hand that held the knife, prepared to subdue any aggressive motion. Zhang Ju's strength was greater than expected, and as his memories stirred, his might seemed to swell. He was no mere spirit. As Chen Ge struggled to restrain him, Zhang Ju's disquiet finally subsided. Chen Ge released his grasp, and Zhang Ju crumpled to the ground, his lips grazing the damp earth, the scars on his face stark against the mud. "I... I've remembered some things," Zhang Ju murmured, his eyes on his broken nails: "It was a senior's birthday. A girl wished to confess her feelings, but he had a girlfriend and asked me to reject her on his behalf. I was at the arranged place, but the girl never showed. Then, I heard a disturbance from the woods and stealthily approached. That's when I saw someone with this knife..." "The girl was resisting, but I was paralyzed with fear. I had never before seen so much blood." His nails dug into the ground, Zhang Ju's scarred face twisted in turmoil: "If I had intervened, maybe she wouldn't have died." Tormented by guilt, Zhang Ju clutched the knife: "By the time I decided to call the police, they were gone. I'm unsure if they were ever apprehended, but one... one silhouette was strikingly familiar." "The subsequent night, we indulged in excessive drinking, sang our hearts out, and then the fire broke out. I was rushed to the hospital, and thereafter... Zhang Ju abruptly began pounding his head: "What happened next? Why is there no memory of the events that followed?" "You were hospitalized with burn injuries; that is where your memory ceased." Chen Ge was already acquainted with the tragedy that had befallen Zhang Ju. Chapter 812: Portrait of the Doctor 'I could see the inferno spreading, its flames devouring everything with increasing ferocity, thick smoke billowing, screams and wails of agony filling the air. My eyes were sealed shut by the heat, and though I yearned to escape, the moment I flung the door open, I was greeted by a wall of fire.' Zhang Ju lay prostrate, his forehead streaked with protruding veins, his scars quivering slightly: 'I couldn’t identify the source of the pain as I struggled to break free, gasping for air, my vision nearly obliterated, until at last, I collapsed in the corridor.' 'In a daze, I felt someone lifting me, a sliver of consciousness still clinging to me.' Dirtied and bloodied fingers weaved through his hair, Zhang Ju propped himself up on his elbows: 'I must have been rushed to a hospital; I could faintly make out my parents and doctors exchanging words. I attempted to open my eyes, but upon doing so, I was met with a world engulfed in absolute darkness, as if everything had been scorched to nothingness.' Zhang Ju's voice steadied as he lay spent on the ground: 'I can recall the faces of my parents, the doctors and nurses who cared for me, but how I emerged from the coma, how I found myself at this school, that remains an enigma.' 'Could it be that you have yet to awaken, that this is the continuation of your comatose world?' Chen Ge's hypothesis startled Zhang Ju. 'I haven't awakened? This is the realm of my coma?' Zhang Ju muttered, echoing Chen Ge's words: 'So all of this is a dream? Are all of you mere figments of my imagination?' 'Delusions be damned, this is getting absurd. Can we remain grounded, please?' Zhou Tu snatched the kitchen knife from Zhang Ju's grip: 'I cannot speak for the others, but I am certainly not a figment of your dreams. I'll hold onto the knife, to prevent you from doing anything rash.' Zhou Tu considered himself the sole voice of reason within the club, feeling it prudent to keep the weapon in his possession. 'Zhang Ju's speculation holds water, but he has overlooked a crucial point. This world is not the dream of an individual but a collective nightmare, woven from the many negative emotions and harrowing experiences of numerous people,' Chen Ge stated, his gaze scanning the faces of the club members: 'You all find yourselves ensnared in this world, a world you have unwittingly created with your own hands.' After Chen Ge's words, the forest descended into a profound silence; the members' eyes were fixed on him, their expressions a mix of disbelief and intrigue. 'I know this may be difficult to accept at the moment, but fear not, we still have time.' Chen Ge glanced at the distant wall, with Wang Yicheng over his shoulder: 'The resurgence of Wang Yicheng's memories has drawn the Manager's scrutiny. Now, with your memories, Zhang Ju, beginning to unfurl, it's probable the Manager will soon appear. We must make haste and depart.' Turning, Chen Ge led the way out of the forest. 'Wait!' Zhang Ju clutched the blood-stained earth, slowly raising his head, his gaze locked on Chen Ge with unwavering resolve: 'Who are you, exactly? Why reveal these truths to us?' 'My identity is inconsequential; what matters is that I can aid you in escaping. Your loved ones in the world of the living have waited far too long.' Chen Ge's smile bore a hint of empathy: 'Our stories share similarities; I, too, have lost fragments of my childhood memories. Seeing you, I am reminded of my past self.' With a beckoning gesture, Chen Ge continued onward: 'Meeting me is a stroke of luck. When I was alone, with no one to guide me, I fumbled in the dark, losing so much...' Chen Ge, his voice tinged with a touch of sorrow, navigated the club members past the Laboratory Building and Faculty Apartment Building, towards a path beside the Teaching Building. 'The top-floor restroom in the Teaching Building harbors the answers I seek.' The Teaching Building in the West Campus was simply quiet and gloomy, but that of the East Campus exuded an aura of eeriness. Merely approaching it sent a chill snaking up one's spine, cold and unyielding. 'Keep silent; any misstep here could have dire repercussions.' Chen Ge cautioned in a hushed tone. 'What kind of repercussions?' Zhou Tu, sweat beading on his brow, clutched the kitchen knife he had retrieved from the tree hollow, his posture tense, eyes wide and alert. 'In the East Campus, we are the detritus, unwanted by the West. Reflect on how we dispose of our daily refuse.' Chen Ge's smile lingered, though his words sent a shudder through the club members: 'If apprehended, we will be stripped of anything deemed valuable, exploited to the last, and then discarded. Here, death is not an end but a coveted reprieve that remains tantalizingly elusive.' With no retreat, Chen Ge was the first to enter the Teaching Building of the East Campus. Was it an illusion, or did the darkness in the East Campus possess a depth more profound than that of its counterpart? Ascending the worn steps, the handrail bore the scars of scorching, and the empty classrooms echoed with the faint sound of shifting furniture. 'This place is unnerving. It's almost inconceivable that it's separated from us by just a wall.' Zhu Long's whisper trailed behind the group. 'Be quiet.' Zhou Tu, knife in hand, kept a watchful eye on Zhang Ju, wary that the boy with a face marred by scars might suddenly unravel and become a danger. Sometimes, the very things we fear come to pass most unexpectedly. Zhou Tu, focused on Zhang Ju, hadn't anticipated the boy's sudden halt. 'What's the matter?' 'I was just wondering. Why are there so many portraits of doctors adorning the corridors of the Teaching Building?' Zhang Ju looked up at the doctors on the wall: 'We're not a medical university, yet these doctors... they're obscure, many without even a basic profile, just a snapshot of them in white lab coats. Have you noticed? Each one of these doctors' portraits depicts them in their professional attire.' Zhang Ju's observations sparked Chen Ge's curiosity; the significance of the portraits had eluded him, but now, with Zhang Ju's comments, a notion began to crystallize. 'The world behind the door takes shape from the memories of those who push it open. This school is an anomaly, encapsulating the memories of all its students. These doctors' photos adorning the walls are likely projections of individuals the students have encountered in reality.' Chen Ge gently squeezed Zhang Ju's shoulder: 'Look closely at these portraits, see if you can recognize any of the doctors.' 'Doctors of such distinction to be featured on these walls are beyond my ken. How could I possibly recognize any?' 'Here, the term 'doctor' might carry a significance we've yet to unravel. Just trust in me, and do as I suggest.' Chen Ge escorted the club members further up, pausing abruptly on the third floor: 'Hold on, there's someone ahead.' The classroom door near the corridor on the third floor was unsecured, its low-quality wooden frame creaking ominously as the wind toyed with it. Chen Ge and his companions stood rooted in the corridor, enveloped in a tense silence. Moments later, a shadowy figure departed from the classroom. 'That silhouette seems familiar... Is that Chang Gu?' Chapter 813: Do You Dare? The dark shadow's movements closely resembled Chang Gu's, but with an agility that belied any impairment of sight. Chen Ge, reluctant to act rashly, opted to keep observing. The figure hastened to the far end of the corridor, apparently searching for something. 'Could that be Chang Gu? Has his vision been restored?' Even with the pitch darkness enveloping the East Campus teaching building, Chen Ge proceeded with extreme caution, his Shadow Pupil ability his only aid in the gloom. 'Teacher, is that figure someone you recognize? Shall we pursue?' 'Better to tread lightly; our path leads to the top floor.' Chen Ge's eyes remained fixed on the dark figure, which, rather than departing, slipped into another classroom. With the realization that they were not alone in the building, the uncertainty of their situation grew. Chen Ge couldn't determine if this was a fortuitous or ominous development. Upon reaching the fourth floor, they faced the challenge of crossing the long corridor to access the restroom. 'Ignore any sounds you hear, and avoid acknowledging anything you see—stay together at all costs. Do you understand?' With these words of caution, Chen Ge, with Wang Yicheng on his back, entered the corridor. He lowered his stance, scanning the classrooms on either side with a peripheral vigilance. The windows offered no secrets, shrouded as they were in darkness. The Supernatural Tales Club members followed Chen Ge's lead, struggling to keep their gazes fixed ahead, though their curiosity fought to divert their attention. 'What's that?' The classrooms, long neglected, were shrouded in filth. Passing by a window, Zhou Tu caught sight of strands of hair-like filaments beneath the window sill, suggesting the eerie presence of a girl sprawled across the window-facing desk. 'Might there truly be someone there?' Zhou Tu tiptoed, craning his neck to glimpse beneath the sill. 'Is the hair... moving?' Before Zhou Tu could discern the truth, he collided with an unexpected obstacle. Caught off guard and clutching a rusted kitchen knife, he dropped it, and the sound of metal clashing with tile reverberated unnervingly through the nocturnal silence of the teaching building. The group halted in their tracks as Chen Ge turned to Zhou Tu. 'What are you doing?' 'It was an accident—I bumped into Zhang Ju.' Zhou Tu, hand to his nose, gestured toward Zhang Ju, who stood motionless, his expression peculiar. 'Why did you suddenly stop?' Zhang Ju offered no reply. Instead, he gazed up at a portrait on the wall, his mouth agape, his pupils reduced to mere pinpricks. 'Zhang Ju?' Despite the others' calls, Zhang Ju remained transfixed by the portrait, his eyes reflecting a quiet sorrow. The breakdown he suffered upon discovering the murder weapon had now given way to a different kind of turmoil. Bereft of screams and self-mutilation, he stood in silence before the portrait. 'I've seen this doctor before.' His whisper was barely audible, meant only for the ears of those nearby. 'The fire consumed a fifth of my skin. I watched my own flesh smolder, smelled the stench of my burning body, until my eyes melted and my eyelids fused shut, plunging my world into darkness.' 'Rushed to the hospital, the pain was so intense it became numbness. My eyes sealed shut, my nose burned away, with two-thirds of one ear remaining and only a third of the other. I was transformed into a monster; blind, I knew I was no longer myself, and I could never return to living as a person.' 'Ever tried listening to your family with two-thirds of an ear?' 'Someone was trying to save me; I could feel life's pain drawing nearer, but how could I awaken? My eyes were sliced open by something cold, meticulously cleaned; my left eye removed, my right eye glimpsing a gray world.' 'I was blind to light, only shadows visible to my right eye. Tell me, should I have continued living?' The resurgence of memories altered Zhang Ju's appearance before their eyes. His fingertips rested on the portrait, his face beginning to bleed as minuscule blood vessels surfaced beneath his skin, resembling the threads of surgical stitches. 'I know this doctor; he was with me for a week, betting against Death for my life.' His voice grew raspy as if scorched by flames, his features morphing. Scars and blood vessels sprawled across his face; his ears began to shrivel like dying petals, his left eyelid slowly melting. 'I never uttered a word to him, but his presence left a lasting mark. During the final moments of my life, he was among the three who accompanied me.' The remorse for the departed unlocked the chains of memory within Zhang Ju's mind. The doctor who had once treated him now clarified the memories that had been shrouded in fog. Memory fragments coalesced, and blood seeped from beneath his skin as if freshly opened wounds were bleeding again. Droplets of blood formed and fell onto his coat, which gradually stained red: 'If you found yourselves in my predicament, would you choose life or death?' 'Half-Red Garment? Does the return of memories restore a fierce ghost to its true form? Could it be that the Tree Hollow Female Ghost's failure to retain a human appearance stems from incomplete memory erasure?' Chen Ge's eyelids flickered with realization, though he maintained far greater composure than the other club members. Zhou Tu, abandoning the knife, seized Zhu Long's arm, and without realizing, the pair retreated a full three meters. Unanswered, Zhang Ju's gaze shifted from the portrait to Chen Ge. 'Now that I recall who I am, can you tell me who you are?' They stood in the dim corridor, scrutinizing each other. 'You've posed this question before, and I've given you my response.' Chen Ge stood firm, not yielding an inch. 'We are akin; I am in search of the memories I've lost. In helping you, I am aiding myself.' 'You're lying!' Zhang Ju reached out to Chen Ge, halting just shy of contact. 'Why hesitate?' Chen Ge advanced, his expression a hair's breadth from Zhang Ju's face, now a visage of despair and horror. 'Does the prospect of another 'me' rising from my corpse petrify you? Are you terrified of the me clad in red?' His hands clasped Zhang Ju's shoulders, his expression reaching the epitome of madness. His fingers traversed Zhang Ju's shoulders, cradling his face, his touch coming to rest lightly on his forehead. 'To kill me—do you dare?' The shock was not limited to Zhang Ju; Zhou Tu and Zhu Long, lurking behind, felt the same terror. Silence enveloped the corridor; moments that felt like eternities later, Chen Ge released Zhang Ju, his gaze sweeping over the other Supernatural Tales Club members: 'My sole quest is to reclaim the memories I've lost. By aiding me, you assist yourselves, and vice versa.' Chapter 814: The Movable 'Door' Zhang Ju had long realized that Chen Ge was extraordinary; his eyes remained placid regardless of the horrors they witnessed—as if nothing in the world could faze him. Admittedly, he feared such a person, but it was precisely this fear that compelled him to comply and follow. Standing before the photograph, Zhang Ju opened his sole remaining right eye, silently observing Chen Ge’s visage. A countenance so ordinary it could blend into a crowd, yet it was this very individual who had recently revealed a visage that struck terror in Zhang Ju. It's difficult to describe; it seemed a confluence of a fierce ghost’s deep vengeance with the derangement of a psychotic. In that expression, there was madness, pathology, cruelty, but no trace of fear or dread. Zhang Ju was aware of his own monstrous appearance; he had always viewed himself as a horrifying entity. But Chen Ge's recent behavior showed him that there were 'monsters' in the world far more terrifying than he. "Yes, we are probably akin," he affirmed. He believed Chen Ge's words, for such expressions are only worn by those who have survived hell—those like him who had lost their pasts. "My apologies, Teacher Bai. Some distressing memories resurfaced, causing me to lose control," expressed Zhang Ju, his voice harsh yet noticeably more amiable. "It's alright, would a teacher genuinely reprimand a student?" Teacher Bai's face bore a gentle smile, exuding warmth and kindness, making it hard to believe he was the same person who had just addressed Zhang Ju with severity: "What do you recall? Please, spare no detail, tell me everything." "They’re merely some painful memories." Zhang Ju’s wounds continued to bleed, his attire increasingly stained crimson: "I remembered feeling powerless and frightened at a murder scene; the sensation of being scorched by flames, as if countless needles penetrated the flesh until the pain ceased; I also recollected my desperate struggle in the sterile ward, as despair took root and grew within me. I didn't wish to die, yet I was at a loss on how to go on living." "During your life’s final moments, did anything out of the ordinary transpire either to you or in your vicinity?" Teacher Bai was curious about how Zhang Ju arrived at the school, as understanding the entry method might provide clues to an escape route. In a three-star scenario, the 'door' is the only ingress and egress, but the rules seem to differ in a four-star scenario. "The ultimate phase of existence... " Zhang Ju caressed his face: "I appeared to slip into a coma, yet I was faintly aware of the external world; unable to distinguish between reality and nightmare. But, I distinctly remember one thing—every night in the ward, a door would emerge." "A door?" "I spent a week in the hospital, and nightly, that door materialized, drawing incrementally nearer until it finally stationed beside my bed," Zhang Ju gazed upward, his countenance smeared with blood: "It was a door that shifted autonomously; the more dread and despondency I felt, the nearer it approached. Unable to summon aid, on the eighth night, the door swung open from within, and hands emerged through the crevice, dragging me through." Zhang Ju's account mirrored Chang Gu's—they both encountered a self-propelling 'door' that, come midnight, would gravitate towards the sleeping individual, eventually positioning itself bedside and spiriting away the living once opened. "Did this school lie beyond that door?" Teacher Bai was even more intrigued about the subsequent events. He yearned to understand Zhang Ju's amnesia, how this student, disfigured by the inferno, transformed into the 'Half-Red Garment.' Zhang Ju shook his head: "I found myself ensnared in a dream, an incredibly lucid dream. Therein, everyone called me Lin Sisi. I repeatedly asserted my name was Zhang Ju, that they were mistaken, but they believed I was jesting." "No one credited my words, so I had to live under the moniker Lin Sisi in the dream, enduring all she faced. Over time, I even started to question my identity—was I truly not Lin Sisi?" "Being bullied, subjected to cold violence, ignored—such experiences aren't pleasant. Yet, on second thought, given the monstrosity I became in reality, existing within the dream was relatively comforting." He recounted with a sense of detachment as if speaking of another's life: "Friendless, despised by the world, the dual torment of mind and body gradually numbed me until one day, a girl entered my dream." "It was a rainy day. A frog had been covertly placed in my deskmate's bag, and she suspected me. But why would I commit such a trivial act?" "Unheeded by all, I was expelled from the classroom. Met with peculiar stares in the corridor, I had no choice but to seek solace on the rooftop of the teaching building, alone." "There, I met her." "Even aware it was a dream, I sensed the girl was unique." Zhang Ju's tone shifted: "Her name was Chang Wenyu, the sole individual who didn't overlook me." "I confided my plight to her, and she empathized." "Later, I divulged my past to her, asserting that I was not Lin Sisi." "She took great interest in my tales, and I relished her company, for only with her I could remember myself, resist assimilation by the dream." "We convened on the rooftop every evening, and I increasingly sensed my dependence on her." "As life seemed to regain color, she posed a sudden query—did I wish to behold the scenery beyond the school?" "At that juncture, I failed to grasp the question's gravity. I simply yearned for her company, thus I nodded in agreement." "That night, past midnight, she escorted me to the library." "The library's doors were perennially locked, yet we entered through a window and came upon a mirror sequestered behind a shelf on the third floor." "The mirror was vast; the girl claimed it had a few uses left and implored me to keep its existence clandestine." "I trusted her implicitly, and a realization dawned—it was my inaugural encounter with a mirror in the dream!" "I inquired about my next steps." "She instructed to simply gaze into the mirror in silence." "I stood before the mirror, her presence behind me. Amid the night's stillness, I beheld my reflection." "The more I stared, the more the mirror's inhabitant seemed unlike me. Gradually, the reflection commenced bleeding, scars manifesting upon the mirrored visage." "His ears shriveled, his left eye sealed shut, his visage a blur of mangled flesh!" "I recoiled from the sight, but when I sought to withdraw, the mirror's monster seized me!" "Blood cascaded down the glass, eventually tinting the entire mirror red!" "I bellowed for rescue, turning to Chang Wenyu, but she remained impassive. Her final words to me are etched in my memory—why fear? The you in the mirror, that's the genuine you." "Her slender fingers pressed upon my left eye, slowly extracting it." "The world abruptly became colorless, and I was hauled into the mirror by the creature. All hopes of beauty became the most malevolent of curses in that instant." Chapter 815: This Is But A Conjecture "Chang Wenyu removed my left eye, rendering me an exact likeness of the monster in the mirror," Zhang Ju lamented. "She crushed all my illusions. I am not Lin Sisi; I am Zhang Ju. The terrifying creature reflected in the mirror is none other than myself." Blood oozed from his wounds, staining much of Zhang Ju's attire a deep red. More unsettling was the pattern of blood veins on his clothing that intertwined and multiplied. Initially, Chen Ge believed Zhang Ju to be clad in the Half-Red Garment, but he quickly realized that he had underestimated him. As memories continued to resurface, the bloodstains on Zhang Ju's body proliferated, almost engulfing him entirely in crimson. "I was dragged into the mirror, and on the other side was Chang Wenyu, clutching my left eye. Her lips parted as if to say—'just one more.'" "In her grasp, my left eye transformed, and the entirety of my life's experiences flashed within its pupil. As she took my left eye, she stripped away all that was good and hopeful from me." Drip, drop, drip, drop... Zhang Ju's blood fell to the corridor floor, accompanying the faint echo of footsteps within the teaching building. Yet, no matter where they looked, no one appeared. "What lies beyond the mirror?" Chen Ge inquired softly. "Red. Everything is red there. It's a world saturated in red," Zhang Ju described. His words reminded Chen Ge of the eerie scene beyond the Three-Star Trial's door. "How did you manage to return from that place?" "The mirror concealed another version of myself, bathed in blood red, yearning to consume me. Without time to think, escape was my only recourse. After an eternity of running, I discovered that the mirror's other side was also a school, seemingly deserted." "And what happened afterward?" "I didn't survive the first night. The other me from the mirror's world captured me." Confusion flickered in Zhang Ju's gaze. "I remember him killing me, yet when I next opened my eyes, I was back in this school, bereft of most my memories, assimilated as one of its own." "So, your memories were tampered with post-mortem?" "That's a way to interpret it. I'm unaware of the actual events that transpired. If you seek clarity, perhaps the blood-red world behind the mirror holds your answers." Though Zhang Ju's appearance was grotesque, his expression was one of grave sincerity. "I think I'm beginning to understand," Chen Ge murmured. Chen Ge listened intently, a chill running down his spine as he realized their fates were intertwined through the mirror's reflection. "Normally, the 'Door' is the sole gateway into the blood-red world, but here lies a specter beyond our comprehension, likely a being surpassing even the Red Specters. This entity has used the mirror as a conduit, carving out an additional realm within the blood-red world—the school we now occupy. Do you follow?" The club members present shook their heads, unable to fathom his explanation. "Let me simplify it. Imagine this: opening this Door leads us to the blood-red world. Within it, we find another mirror. Touching the mirror, we enter the world within it." "Consider it akin to dreaming. In our waking state, we exist in reality. In slumber, our consciousness enters the dream realm. But what happens if we dream within that dream? Our consciousness shifts to a dream within a dream." "The world behind the mirror is akin to a 'dream' forged by the Door Pusher from the despair and negative emotions that constitute the blood-red world." Despite his efforts, Chen Ge's explanation eluded the students' comprehension, but he had pieced together an essential puzzle. Since awakening, he had lost all contact with his staff, and his black cellphone was nowhere to be found, plunging him into a perilous predicament. He couldn't grasp how the school's true master had accomplished this. Setting aside the black cellphone, Zhang Ya was meant to be concealed within his shadow. Yet now, his shadow was inexplicably ordinary, devoid of her presence. This suggested that his physical self hadn't truly entered the school. Just as Zhang Ju had recounted, when he peered into the mirror, he saw another self inside. One kind and gentle, the other vicious and bloodthirsty—the amalgamation of both constituted the real Zhang Ju. "I seem to have encountered the same predicament as Zhang Ju; pieces of my personality reside inside the mirror, while others remain outside." Chen Ge's conjectures were not guaranteed to be correct. It was akin to navigating a fog, his presence the only light in the murky world. "The mirror Chang Wenyu employed is located in the library. After inspecting the restroom, that's our next destination." Chen Ge revealed his plans. "Why would you go there when everyone avoids it?" Zhang Ju, unable to understand Chen Ge's rationale, was just regaining his memories, his vision clouded with the surfacing recollections. "Compared to this place, I find the blood-red world somewhat more authentic." Chen Ge's words hinted at his uncommon nature. After contemplating, Zhang Ju refrained from objecting: "As it happens, I too desire to untangle what has transpired to me. By all accounts, shouldn't I have perished?" Once Zhang Ju expressed his agreement, Chen Ge appeared more at ease, now accompanied by an invaluable ally. "Let's proceed to the restroom and investigate." They had already spent considerable time in the corridor, and fortunately, no anomalies had arisen in the teaching building. Zhang Ju's blood trailed behind them, its dripping sound blending with the gradually approaching footsteps. Though the footsteps resonated ominously, no one was in sight. "Zhu Long, have you observed Zhang Ju's transformation? His countenance is... horrific." Zhou Tu maintained his distance from Zhang Ju and Chen Ge, convinced they were both madmen. "At this juncture, we can only place our trust in Chen Ge. Does not the change in Zhang Ju validate that he hasn't deceived us? We are in the midst of reclaiming our forgotten memories." Zhu Long's complexion was pale. Clenching his teeth, his grip on the cellphone turned his knuckles white. "Very well." Zhou Tu glanced back and, feeling utterly terrified, could not muster the courage to return alone: "I must be out of my mind to have joined such a club." With determination, he stooped to retrieve the kitchen knife from the ground. However, in the moment he lowered his gaze, his world upended, and he saw rows of inverted heads in the corridor behind him—all fixated on Wang Yicheng, carried on the backs of Zhang Ju and Chen Ge! Zhou Tu nearly collapsed in terror, steadied just in time by Zhu Long's support. "What's wrong?" "There are people behind us! We are being followed by a multitude!" Zhou Tu's voice quivered with fear. "Where?" Zhu Long turned back to find the corridor empty, clearly inhabited only by their small group: "Are you suffering from an illusion?" "No, they are there!" Zhou Tu insisted, but as he spoke, he came to realize that the dread that seized him was all too real. Chapter 816: The Faceless Boy Zhu Long clutched Zhou Tu's arm, and both looked back at the enveloping darkness. They could barely make out the sound of footsteps, yet no visible soul was present. "Is there anyone there?" "I saw them when I reached for the kitchen knife. They were all upside down, trailing behind us, as if residing in a world inverted from ours." Zhou Tu was still shaken: "Those people kept their gaze fixed on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. Should we inform Teacher Bai?" "That might be wise." Zhu Long cast a doubtful glance behind, Zhou Tu didn't appear to be lying. Caught up in their hesitation, Chen Ge and Zhang Ju had already advanced to the corridor's midpoint. As they approached the restroom, their nervousness intensified. "Teacher Bai, Zhou Tu just spotted someone following us, all of them upside down. I'm not sure how to explain it; perhaps it's best you ask Zhou Tu." Zhu Long tugged Zhou Tu to Chen Ge's side. "As I stooped to retrieve the kitchen knife, I saw a crowd behind us, their heads downward, hovering in the air. No, they seemed to be traversing the ceiling, those entities presumably drawn to Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. My own eyes witnessed those inverted monstrosities fixating on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng." Zhou Tu felt an instinctual revulsion to getting close to Zhang Ju. "Inverted people?" Chen Ge had encountered such figures in the Laboratory Building: "Let's first inspect the restroom, to verify the existence of 'the Door.' If the restroom yields no clues, we'll depart at once." This school's eerie nature, even under the protection of the red garment, could not provide Chen Ge with a sense of security. They quickened their pace, and mere steps from the restroom, Chen Ge's neck was suddenly seized by a pair of hands. Chilly and skeletal, the arms constricted around his neck, the grip tightening slowly, constricting Chen Ge's breath. "Wang Yicheng? Have you come to?" Chen Ge twisted to see Wang Yicheng's head resting heavily on his shoulder, his eyes ridden with bloodshot streaks of black and red, as though locked in a perpetual struggle with an inner torment. "Don't enter, they are within." The voice that emanated from Wang Yicheng was drastically different from his usual tone, evoking the image of a battered stray dog fiercely guarding the corpse of a comrade, then resigning to the beatings of others. "Who are 'they'?" "Classmates, seniors, all who despise you are in there, don't approach, I've secretly informed the teacher already." Wang Yicheng attempted a smile, but it eluded him. "Did you hit this kid into delirium? He's spouting nonsense." Zhu Long, gripping a pink cellphone, discreetly approached Chen Ge, feeling a semblance of solace only when near Chen Ge amidst the oppressive aura of the teaching building. "Wang Yicheng, have you recalled something?" Wang Yicheng's memory had been stirred at the West Campus restroom entrance. Initially, Chen Ge, wary of exposure, had incapacitated him. Now awake, Wang Yicheng seemed slightly disoriented. "They sent me to deceive you into entering, I refused, so they beat me, compelled me to crawl up the stairs with a crippled leg. I obeyed them, yet they're still unwilling to spare you. Remember, irrespective of who urges you to venture to the top-floor restroom of the teaching building, you must not go! Never!" The weakness in Wang Yicheng's voice and his body's extreme tremors suggested he was on the brink. "Did they also approach others to entice Lin Sisi?" "I don't know, but I've disclosed everything to the teacher, why hasn't he arrived yet!" Wang Yicheng grew anxious, his sole hope for salvation being that teacher, who seemed absent, perhaps sharing the aversion towards Lin Sisi. "It's fine, I only intend to look." "Don't! Please, don't go in!" Wang Yicheng mistook Chen Ge for Lin Sisi, revealing his heartfelt guilt and desire for atonement. With the door within reach, it was unthinkable for Chen Ge to retreat, particularly with Zhang Ju's assistance. This increasingly potent half-red garment was Chen Ge's steadfast support. Wang Yicheng's arms tightened, veins bulging with exertion, desperately trying to prevent Chen Ge's entry, likely to avoid witnessing a replay of past tragedy. The restroom at the teaching building's pinnacle lay at the corridor's far end, the air tainted with the acrid scent of disinfectant, wall tiles marred by age-old yellowish-brown stains, the floor speckled with lingering water stains and an array of numerous and distinct shoe prints. The restroom door was bolted; Chen Ge forced it open. Slowly pushing open the creaking wooden door, Chen Ge retreated a step, warily eyeing the interior. The East Campus restroom appeared entirely unlike its West Campus counterpart – grimy and chaotic, as if forsaken by the school authorities, untouched by cleaning or visitation. "Has this restroom remained sealed since Lin Sisi's incident?" Chen Ge inquired, turning to Wang Yicheng, who by then had become speechless, his body convulsing as though stricken with illness. In comparison to the West Campus, this restroom imparted an even more authentic sensation to Chen Ge, who entered with Wang Yicheng on his back. Upon entry, Wang Yicheng instantly shut his eyes, neither wishing to witness nor recollect. "This chamber emits a different aura than the others." Zhang Ju surveyed the surroundings; the walls were veined with blood-like filaments, entwining the entire restroom in their web. The murals of ghostly visages on the walls had blurred, akin to memories on the brink of being forsaken. Those withered blood veins traversed every image on the walls, shrouding them, as if yearning to forget their existence. Chen Ge reached the first cubicle and extended Lin Sisi's cellphone into the slit, the screen revealing several figures in motion. "Who lurks within?" Chen Ge yanked open the cubicle door, the ensuing tableau defying his expectations. Within lay a mannequin, donned in black leather shoes and aged between thirty and forty, bearing a striking resemblance to Teacher Bai whom Chen Ge had previously encountered. "A pair of shoes adorned the West Campus restroom, whereas an actual mannequin occupies the first cubicle of the East Campus – why this discrepancy?" The cubicle's Teacher Bai mannequin was posed with head bowed, hands clasped behind its head, standing erect as if acknowledging a misdeed. No anomalies detected through his shadow pupil, Chen Ge lastly aimed Lin Sisi's phone at the cubicle for a snapshot. The captured image on the screen brought him astonishment. While the mannequin stood as Teacher Bai, the cellphone portrayed a faceless boy, hands behind his head, mirroring Teacher Bai's posture. "Could this faceless boy be Lin Sisi? Had Teacher Bai once punished him in this manner? Could he now be employing a similar method of retribution against Teacher Bai?" Chapter 817: Will You Be My Friend? When Chen Ge pushed open the second cubicle, he found a slender male mannequin inside, its posture contorted and deformed, surrounded by mud and refuse. 'It bears a striking resemblance to Wang Yicheng.' The mannequin in the second cubicle and the Wang Yicheng that Chen Ge was carrying both donned blue sneakers, indicating the mannequin represented Wang Yicheng. Chen Ge raised his phone to capture the second cubicle; the image on the screen was harrowing. The scapegoat was cornered into the cubicle by a mob, who threw garbage at him without mercy. The scapegoat in the image offered no resistance, suffering the abuse in silence. In the third cubicle, the mannequin wore glasses and was doused in red paint, standing blankly against the cubicle wall. This mannequin shared a resemblance with the tall, slender boy Chen Ge had encountered in Dormitory 413. With the lessons from his previous experiences, Chen Ge directed his phone camera at the cubicle. A boy with no facial features appeared on the screen, isolated in the cubicle, as anonymous aggressors doused him with paint. His once-clean clothes were now tainted, with the paint trailing down. The boy kept his head down, uttering not a word. 'These bullies have completely lost their sense of humanity,' Chen Ge observed as he opened the fourth cubicle, which was devoid of any clothing; wet garments were discarded next to the squat toilet. Chen Ge took out his phone and filmed the fourth cubicle, the screen displaying the scapegoat as he slowly stripped off his paint-smeared clothes under a deluge of water. The fifth cubicle, the sixth cubicle... Each unveiled a scene more distressing than the last, showcasing the depth of cruelty people can reach in their frenzy, as they cast out all their negative emotions onto a single individual. Initially, Chen Ge's sole intent upon opening the first cubicle was to uncover the truth; to him, everything here was unrelated, and he was merely a bystander, wishing only to free himself from victimhood. However, after witnessing the scenes within six cubicles, his heart had imperceptibly changed; his expression darkened, an expression that would surely surprise those who knew him, for it was rare to see such an emotion on this man. The transformation of expression is a sign of emotional tumult. When feelings surface, vulnerabilities become exposed. Hence, Chen Ge always maintained a facade of calm during his quests with the black cellphone. 'Are these still children?' Chen Ge looked up at the seventh cubicle, the sole one without a mannequin or a door panel. The hinge was savagely destroyed, leaving behind wood shavings. The door to the seventh cubicle had been forcibly opened. The door panel had disappeared, and the interior of the cubicle was overrun with those blood-vein-like stains. Indeed, these stains that had defiled the restroom originated from this cubicle; the seventh was the source of all the bloodshed. 'Was this where Lin Sisi was confined initially?' The black and crimson blood veins, which resembled desiccated vines, climbed the walls as if obscuring something. Chen Ge took out Lin Sisi's phone, maximized the screen brightness, and started recording the cubicle. Clutching his drenched clothing, the scapegoat was covered in sewage and paint that flowed down his body in a macabre array of colors, evoking the visage of a monster latched onto his skin. The door of the restroom cubicle seemed to be blocked from the outside, and the boy with no face was seen stooping over, embracing his garments, and repeatedly slamming against the door panel. Without a face, his emotions were hidden; his cries silent. It was unknown whether he wept or called out for help. All that was visible was the relentless assault on the door until it broke open. Barefoot, he stood at the entrance of the cubicle, his attire soaked with paint and sewage. His arms drooped, the same ones that had battered the door now lacerated by wood splinters, with blood tracing lines across his skin while paint infiltrated the wounds. An oppressive, unbearable constriction surrounded him, making it difficult to breathe. His neck twisted, and the face devoid of features scanned the vacant restroom. The tormentors had left, but their venomous words seemed to still echo within. The boy lingered at the doorway for a long while before slowly lifting his hands, putting on his sodden clothes one piece at a time. Aside from his arms, his body bore no injuries, yet he shivered with pain. His trousers were split down the middle, and there was a large hole in the back of his shirt. Once fully clothed, his reflection on the wet floor mirrored a terrifying monster too dreadful to behold. He wiped his face, attempting to take a step toward the restroom door. The light from the corridor flooded the restroom; the exit was so bright that it laid bare the boy's present state, so bright there was no place to hide. The step he took forward was retracted. Wearing his stained clothes, the boy retreated back into the seventh cubicle. Leaning against the cubicle wall, his body slid down to the ground, curling up in the corner. The face lacking features faced the restroom door as if waiting for the lights to go out. The story on the cellphone screen did not conclude there; the child watched for a long time, then slowly raised his head. The face without features turned towards Chen Ge, as if aware of his observer. 'Will you be my friend?' This question echoed in Chen Ge's ears, clear and distinct. However, when he looked towards the source of the voice, there was nothing. 'Could it have come from the cellphone? Impossible.' The recording stopped at the last scene, the scapegoat curled up in the corner of the cubicle with his face directed at Chen Ge, as if expecting his response. 'I am willing to be your friend, although your plea sounds akin to a curse.' Curses did not intimidate Chen Ge; it was a cursed love letter that had altered his life. Without that letter, he would have perished at Wang Qi's hands during his first assignment. Chen Ge accepted, but the scapegoat on the cellphone screen remained in the same posture. Besides the phone, the seventh cubicle was empty, yet through the camera of the phone, the scapegoat could be clearly seen. 'Can you hear me?' Chen Ge attempted to communicate, but without success. He waited for a while, and then the image on the cellphone screen changed once more. The door of the seventh cubicle swung open, and a blood-red hand stretched inside. This hand gently grabbed the scapegoat, as if whispering something to him. The boy nodded slightly in response. After that, the scapegoat was led by the hand, walking towards 'the other side of the door,' disappearing from sight. 'That bloodied hand, did it reach out from 'the door'? What was whispered to the boy?' Chen Ge wondered. 'The phrase spoken by the owner of the bloodied hand to the scapegoat—was it not *Will you be my friend?*' 'The scapegoat consented, and then, he was gone?' Chen Ge pondered meticulously. The scapegoat was Lin Sisi; he had shown no intention of pushing the door, yet the bloodied hand had emerged from within. This indicated that a door had always been part of the restroom cubicle. The owner of the bloodied hand extended an invitation to Lin Sisi, and ultimately, Lin Sisi accepted, implying that the bloodied hand was indeed the Door Pusher. Chapter 818: He and I May Not Be Enemies After a labyrinthine quest, Chen Ge at last uncovered the true master of the Ghost School—though it was merely a glimpse of a hand, it signified a substantial advance for Chen Ge. "I just heard someone whisper in my ear—'Would you like to be my friend?'" "That voice didn't emanate from the phone; I'm convinced it came directly from beside my ear." "Maybe that inquiry wasn't intended for Lin Sisi but for me instead." Chen Ge glanced back to witness the restroom stalls where the ominous black and crimson blood veins had begun to drop off massively, akin to autumn leaves, utterly devoid of life. "Did you accept his proposition?" Wang Yicheng, whose eyes remained firmly shut on Chen Ge's back, unexpectedly broke the silence. He laid his head on Chen Ge's shoulder, his voice so subdued it was almost inaudible. "I suppose, he appeared quite pitiable." Chen Ge could feel Wang Yicheng's body temperature steadily declining as their bodies remained entwined in the dimly lit restroom. "All his friends... they're all deceased, every single one!" The sound of dripping water echoed from behind Chen Ge, his shoulder growing damp. When he turned, his left shoulder was soaked in blood. The brilliance of the red was somewhat blinding. "You..." Chen Ge dislodged Wang Yicheng from his back. The youth's hands flailed helplessly, clawing at the void, as tears of blood seeped from his sealed eyes: "Do you remember anything?" Revisiting this place had triggered Wang Yicheng’s memory. Without opening his eyes, merely by hearing Chen Ge's words, he realized what had unfolded. "There's no escape now. You've given your word to him. He will come for you, no matter where you try to hide, he will find you!" Wang Yicheng's voice had undergone a drastic change, a stark contrast to his earlier cowardice. "If he doesn't come seeking me, I shall seek him out. I've always been keen on making friends, in every conceivable way." Chen Ge had numerous friends, though currently none were in proximity, hence his eagerness to form new bonds. The blood streaming from Wang Yicheng's eyes cascaded down his face, staining his jacket crimson; the vivid blood on his skin blossomed like petals. This seemingly fragile boy bore the potential to ascend to the ranks of the Red Garment. "My curiosity about the school's owner intensifies—how did he manage to entice each of you through the door?" Chen Ge had not anticipated the club members he had encountered by chance to be as extraordinary. Luck was a factor, but it also accentuated the dread that pervaded the Ghost School. A mere half-Red Garment was sufficient to support an ordinary two-star scenario, yet within the Ghost School, Chen Ge had already encountered several Red Garments and potential aspirants. "Are your humorous quips a facade for the fear within?" Upon hearing Wang Yicheng's suggestion, Chen Ge was further convinced that the other had regained his memory. Wang Yicheng of the past was submissive and compliant, never one to voice dissent. "I am not jesting. To hold the despair necessary to open the 'Door' also implies having once harbored hope, no matter how shattered it may now be. I genuinely wish to assist him, and befriending him is merely the first step." Chen Ge, bearing Wang Yicheng on his back, made his way towards the restroom exit. "Have you observed that most children here have distorted childhoods, burdened by physical anomalies or personalities deformed by external influences? Each harbors memories too excruciating to revisit." "What are you getting at?" "I am fascinated by the school owner's background. What kind of experiences might have propelled a Door Pusher to pry open this 'Door'?" "To accept being his friend is to be forever retained. The school wasn't always this vast; it expanded as despair and agony were amassed." After Wang Yicheng's confession, his eyes ceased to bleed, but his body persisted in shuddering. "You appear to be privy to a great deal." Chen Ge noted the parallels between this school and his Haunted House; the Ghost School ceaselessly sought out students rife with despair, luring those who radiated desolation, in contrast to Chen Ge's Haunted House which welcomed all comers: "This school has stood for many years, hasn't it?" "The only memory I have is of being here as soon as I opened my eyes. I lack Zhang Ju's experiences; I perished in this school and was reborn within these walls, forgetting much in the process. All I know is the school has been incessantly expanding." "Why are you present here? Was it Lin Sisi's retribution?" Chen Ge probed further. Wang Yicheng paused significantly before answering: "I am the sole individual Lin Sisi spared. My arrival here was because, after Lin Sisi vanished, I became his surrogate. The students' trepidation and unease transformed into violence inflicted upon me. On one night, as I neared the brink of collapse, that door found me." "So you simply entered? As Zhang Ju described, the door initially appeared far from one's resting place, then slowly approached day by day... Chen Ge didn't finish his thought before Wang Yicheng interrupted him. "He was entirely passive; conversely, I was proactive. I sought a hideaway; besides..." Wang Yicheng hesitated before revealing another secret: "The hand that extended from the door was daubed in various hues; it was Lin Sisi's hand, inviting me. And I desired to offer him an apology in person. That day, I had indeed alerted a teacher, yet they failed to appear." "What else might you divulge about Lin Sisi and the door?" "Nothing further. Upon crossing the door's threshold, I never encountered Lin Sisi. Even to this day, I have not seen him." Wang Yicheng released his grip: "You can let me down now." "Are you certain you've spoken no falsehoods?" Chen Ge set Wang Yicheng down: "At the entrance of the West Campus restroom, as your memory began to fray, the school's manager swiftly emerged. Had I not rendered you unconscious, we would undoubtedly have been apprehended. Your circumstances diverge significantly from those of Zhang Ju and Zhu Long." "Perhaps it's because Lin Sisi was his friend, and I was a friend to Lin Sisi." They passed seven cubicles in sequence, each chronicling an ordeal Lin Sisi had suffered. The phone had likely captured only a portion. "It's unfathomable to consider what the Door Pusher had endured previously." As they were about to exit the restroom, Chen Ge glanced at the seventh cubicle: "It is confirmed, the door resides within the seventh cubicle. To comprehend the school's proprietor, one need only investigate all events that transpired within the school's restrooms." Equipped with the clues at hand, Chen Ge charted his next steps—to visit the school archives, the library, and as vowed to Zhou Tu, the oil painting room in the laboratory building. Chapter 819: They Have Arrived The school's Archives Room might contain information about the mysterious school owner, while the Library could be harboring a mirror that leads to the Blood-Red World. The Oil Painting Room in the Laboratory Building is where Chen Ge promised to take Zhou Tu. 'Where should we start?' Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu. 'I know the Art Club's location, and I've seen the scenes from your dreams. I can take you there anytime, but are you truly prepared for the awakening of your memories?' Zhou Tu had limited interactions with Chen Ge, and he was momentarily disconcerted by the sudden question. Before regaining his memory, he was curious about what he had lost, but after witnessing the fates of Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng, he hesitated. 'Are you prepared to confront your past? Without your memories, you're nothing more than an inconsequential student in this place; you can live contentedly, endlessly reliving a peaceful, beautiful day. Once your memories awaken, you'll be hunted by the School Managers, with no escape.' Chen Ge's probing of Zhou Tu was deliberate. Among all the club members, Zhou Tu had the most resolve. 'I've thought it over, and I've decided it's better to reclaim my memories. Without my past, any comfort is just self-deception.' Zhou Tu's gaze turned toward Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. 'I wonder if my true self will be so terrifying that I'll scare myself to tears.' 'Maybe you should give it some more thought,' Zhang Ju said with a raspy voice, turning away his charred face. 'Your aura gives off a discomforting feeling. The real you must be a frightening entity.' Zhou Tu was speechless, his gaze wavering, his determination seemingly faltering once again. 'Let's go to the Archives Room first. You still have ample time to think it over.' Chen Ge patted Zhou Tu on the shoulder. 'Don't feel pressured; I respect whatever choice you make.' 'Thank you.' Zhou Tu bowed his head in contemplation. Zhang Ju nudged Chen Ge. 'His true form must be intimidating. If he regains his memory, whatever we plan to do next will likely be easier.' 'Everyone has their own path; I won't interfere.' 'Isn't the purpose of your help in recovering our memories to make us remember our pasts, increase our strength, and then assist you with your goals?' Zhang Ju was perplexed, recalling Chen Ge's past statements about their mutual benefit. 'I once read a line in a book: 'The rose doesn't question why; it blooms without seeking any reward.' Although I may not be as selfless, I've endured the same pain as you, and seeing you reminds me of myself.' Chen Ge looked seriously at the other club members. 'Also, let me be clear once more, our relationship isn't about using each other; it's about achieving success together. Mutual respect is fundamental.' Hearing Chen Ge's words, all the fierce spirits seemed to momentarily forget that the man before them was merely human. Perhaps he had yet to recover his own memories. Zhang Ju and Zhu Long nodded, following Chen Ge's footsteps. Wang Yicheng, with tears of blood in his eyes, seemed to endorse Chen Ge even more. Trailing behind, Zhou Tu looked pensive, his eyes slowly firming with resolve. Returning to the corridor, Chen Ge hadn't walked far when he sensed something was wrong. The air was thick with a foul odor, reminiscent of the one he had encountered in the Laboratory Building. An ominous premonition crept over him. The further he advanced, the more suffocating the atmosphere became, as if walking at the bottom of a frigid lake, with a chill seeping in from all around. 'Have the Inverted Monsters returned?' Chen Ge chose not to look down; acknowledging the situation would only disrupt his judgment. His priority was to evacuate the Teaching Building as quickly as possible. Standing beside Zhang Ju, Chen Ge's eyes narrowed, and he whispered, 'Do you see those creatures in the corridor?' 'Creatures?' Zhang Ju focused on the corridor, blood dripping from his coat. 'There seems to be something there, but they don't seem capable of harming us.' Before he could finish, Zhang Ju's hair began to float upward, as if pulled by an invisible infant in the darkness. Small cuts started to appear on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng, attracted by those beings. 'I can't see them; how are they causing me harm?' Blood oozed from the scars on Zhang Ju's face, and his blood vessels danced under his skin. Although his memory had returned, he still hadn't mastered how to wield this newfound power. 'If we look at things upside down, they become visible, but I don't recommend doing that.' 'Why not?' 'Because once you see them, you'll be plunged into even greater despair.' Chen Ge gestured for everyone to leave the building quickly. It was unclear whether the monsters were attacking out of instinct or if someone was directing them. If it was the latter, the situation was dire. The stench grew stronger, and more wounds appeared on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. Notably, with each new injury, a thin black thread would burrow into their bodies, resembling a curse. By the time they reached the third-floor corner, Wang Yicheng couldn't continue. His steps grew weaker. 'I feel like many things are tearing at my flesh, and my memory is blurring again.' 'Mr. Bai, the situation is bleak. There's an overwhelming amount of filth downstairs,' Zhou Tu said softly. Upon reaching the third floor, a pungent stench assaulted them, strangely emanating from their proximity. Looking down, Zhou Tu, much like when he picked up the Kitchen Knife, peered upward from below at the source of the stench. Between him and Wang Yicheng, an inverted face lay on the ground. The creature's clothes clung to its flesh as if it had no skin, with blood vessels pulsating beneath the fabric, blood mingling with the garment, dyeing the entire outfit a deep red. 'Wang, Wang Yicheng, that thing is right in front of you!' Zhou Tu screamed, his memory still dormant. The sudden sight nearly made him fall down the stairs. 'I told you not to look. Out of sight, out of mind.' Chen Ge picked up Wang Yicheng and stepped on the most fetid spot before dashing downstairs. Zhou Tu clutched his chest; where Chen Ge had stepped was precisely where the monster's head was. 'Got it, I won't forget.' As they descended to the second floor, the stench filled the hallway, and Zhu Long, with his memory fading, also became a target for the creatures. Zhang Ju could still resist, but Zhu Long and Wang Yicheng were faltering. They could only continue with the assistance of Chen Ge and Zhou Tu. Chapter 820: Archives Room The situation continued to spiral downwards, and now Zhou Tu found himself under the malevolent gaze of the monsters, as the first laceration appeared on his fingers. 'Mr. Bai, what do we do now?' With no alternatives left, Chen Ge gritted his teeth, determined to evacuate everyone, even if it meant dragging their mangled bodies, devoid of any capacity to move. The reek that filled the air was almost suffocating. As Chen Ge, burdened with Wang Yicheng, neared the first-floor corner, a sharp pain suddenly pierced his chest. Stumbling, he nearly fell to the ground. Looking down, he noticed a sharp nail had punctured his chest. 'The curse of Dormitory 413?' He instantly made the connection, his gaze shifting to his Shadow Pupil. What was once a normal shadow now twisted unnaturally, as if the 'person' within writhed in excruciating pain. 'Is he too being targeted?' The club members were at their breaking point, their bodies covered in grotesque wounds that painted a terrifying picture. 'The exit is within sight, don't stop!' Chen Ge's resolve was unyielding; pain was an old companion to him. Removing the nail, he forced himself to run, knowing each step brought him closer to the glimmer of hope. 'Thud!' Zhou Tu, carrying Zhu Long, fell on the stairs. His right hand was marred with deep cuts that seemed on the brink of tearing apart. 'My hand for drawing is...' For Chen Ge, leading just one person out was challenging enough; additional burdens were simply unthinkable. 'Persevere! We're almost at the first floor!' Their legs felt as if filled with lead, their movements increasingly heavy. The stench on the first floor was even more potent than above, with more Fierce Ghosts lying in ambush. While all hope seemed forsaken for everyone but Chen Ge, the stench in the air suddenly lightened, as if some unknown force had drawn the monsters away. 'Now's our chance!' Seizing Zhou Tu and shouldering Wang Yicheng, Chen Ge raced with all his might. Upon reaching the ground floor, he spotted an ominous dark figure standing at the other end of the corridor. The figure's stature closely resembled that of Chang Gu, with a Shadow Pupil emitting a sinister crimson gleam in his left eye and his coat drenched in blood, clutching something in his hand. 'Chang Gu?' Chen Ge shouted, but the figure did not respond, instead turning and leaving, causing the foul odor to dissipate further. 'Was it he who drew the monsters away?' The Chang Gu in Chen Ge's recollections was weak and timid, a far cry from the shadow he'd just seen. 'What has happened to him since entering the 'door' mere seconds before me?' With the shadow drawing away most of the monsters, Chen Ge hurriedly led the club members out of the Teaching Building. 'Mr. Bai, what was with those monsters earlier? Why could they only be seen when looking upside down? And why did they attack only Wang Yicheng and Zhang Ju, not you?' Zhou Tu collapsed on the ground, feeling as if the stench had seeped into his core. 'Those entities are probably tools for punishing students used by the school authorities. It's even possible that they were once students who broke the school's rules.' Chen Ge didn't expect that the entities would not fear even the Red Garments; they had lost all reason, becoming complete lunatics. 'The school's master wants to create a perfect 'paradise' behind the 'door.' Remembering your past goes against his wishes, so naturally, he will target you.' Chen Ge checked Wang Yicheng and Zhang Ju's wounds; the black tendrils had burrowed into their flesh. Near their wounds, a faint stench could still be detected: 'Be very careful; those monsters might be trying to turn you into one of their own kind.' Standing outside the Teaching Building, Chen Ge used his Shadow Pupil to scan the area, but the shadow that had saved them was nowhere to be seen. 'If it really is Chang Gu, why hasn't he sought me out? Is it not the right time for our meeting yet? Or has he already become a target?' Chen Ge had little interaction with Chang Gu, requiring him to guess at Chang Gu's thoughts before making the right decision. 'It's beneficial to have someone distracting them.' Chen Ge helped Wang Yicheng to his feet. 'Let's head to the office building now; that's where the archives should be.' ... The office building on the West Campus was situated close to the perimeter wall. From its highest point, one could overlook both the East and West Campuses. 'The monsters I've seen in this school can be grouped into several categories: ordinary Fierce Ghosts and Obsessions, the Red Garments, the West Campus's white-coated managers with burn injuries, and the East Campus's upside-down, stench-emitting monsters. Apart from these, the most dangerous are the school's teachers and dormitory supervisors. We're about to enter the office building, and there's a high chance we'll encounter them, so everyone must be on high alert.' Knowing the dangers yet proceeding, Chen Ge was no stranger to such ventures; however, for the other club members, this was a formidable challenge. 'Mr. Bai, aren't you a teacher too?' 'Do you consider me harmless?' Chen Ge responded offhandedly without looking back, leading the way into the office building. He had been to the office building on the West Campus before, but he was taken aback by the stark contrast in the interior design of the East Campus's office building. The West Campus's office was pristine and orderly; the East Campus's version was dominated by an oppressive quiet and gloom. The floors were dirty, littered with mud-stained footprints, the walls scratched and stained, the once white paintwork now a dingy yellow with large patches of mold. 'Do the East Campus teachers really work in this place?' Zhou Tu was incredulous. 'Here, the teachers' duty is not to educate but to manage you. They spend most of their time with students; the office building is more of a symbolic fixture.' Chen Ge tried an office door, which opened easily without a lock. The room was filled with decrepit furnishings that seemed to date back many years. 'I've been here before; I know where the archives are.' Zhang Ju's voice was cold, his demeanor having grown increasingly somber since the return of his memories. 'When did you come here?' Zhou Tu, slightly wary of the current Zhang Ju, inadvertently lowered his voice. 'Before Chang Wenyu deceived me, I came here in secret to understand what this school really was,' Zhang Ju led the way. 'Stay close; this place makes me uneasy, there might be something extremely dangerous lurking.' Whether the building's entities had sensed Zhang Ju's presence, or for some other reason, they faced no dangers along the way and safely reached the third floor. 'This is the archives. Let's quickly find what we need and leave without delay. Don't linger too long; I have a feeling that we're not alone here.' Zhang Ju opened the archive room's door to reveal several rusted metal cabinets and four rows of wooden bookshelves. Chapter 821: The Great Fire! The archive room was steeped in a musty miasma, with Chen Ge being the first to brave its confines, shielding his mouth and nose with the crook of his arm. The wooden bookshelves, relics of a bygone era, stood in stark contrast to the rusty metal cabinets beside them. 'These bookshelves and metal cabinets appear to be relics from different schools,' Chen Ge mused, as he gingerly withdrew a document from the wooden shelf, only for it to crumble slightly under his touch—a victim of neglect, woodworm, and dampness. Unfolding the damaged file with care, Chen Ge's eyes fell upon content that ignited his curiosity: 'A Donor Appreciation List? This seems eerily familiar...' A memory of a similar list in the Principal's office at Sunset Middle School flickered in his mind. 'An exact match! I've encountered this very list in the Principal's office at Sunset Middle School!' His visits to Sunset Middle School had been numerous in his quest to uncover the whereabouts of its old Principal. The school had become an enigma, a two-star horror scene that even a thorough search had failed to unravel. 'The world behind the door is shaped by the memories of the Door Pusher; this school is peculiar, seemingly a tapestry woven from the collective memories of all those trapped within its domain.' Chen Ge pondered. 'With the exception of the old Principal, everyone from Sunset Middle School has taken up residence in my haunted house. Could the presence of the Donor Appreciation List from Sunset Middle School here suggest that the old Principal is among us in this school as well?' As he scrutinized the musty shelves, a realization dawned upon him, 'Could these articles have been transplanted here from Sunset Middle School? Is a fragment of that two-star scenario concealed within this very room? It appears that my ties with the old Principal are destined to be profound.' Placing the document back in its original spot, Chen Ge's expression was one of enigmatic thoughtfulness. 'Before unlocking the Psychic Ghost School Trial Task, there were nine prerequisite tasks. Might all nine bear a special connection to the Psychic Ghost School?' 'Chen Ge, what have you unearthed?' Zhu Long inquired, approaching with a clutch of wrinkled newspapers rescued from a hidden corner. He indicated a prominent article, 'Examine this headline.' 'The Teaching Building was engulfed by an inexplicable blaze, with several students trapped in the restroom, heroically rescued by firefighters.' The article commanded the newspaper's focal point, demanding attention. 'From the layout and prose, the reporter behind this seems quite youthful.' Handling the newspaper, now blemished with mold and stained beyond clarity, Chen Ge surmised, 'It must be the school's newspaper.' Sunset Middle School, a private welfare entity, had neither the resources nor the capacity to produce a school newspaper. Sifting through the assortment of newspapers, Chen Ge's gaze continually returned to one recurring name—West City Private Academy. This institution featured prominently across multiple reports. 'West City Private Academy—that's where Zhang Ya was a student, wasn't it?' He recalled his first 'encounter' with the lady in red at the forsaken academy, and how he had ultimately penetrated Zhang Ya's heart. 'Was there a conflagration in the teaching building of West City Private Academy?' Memories of his past visit surfaced; the image of charred stairway handrails was particularly vivid. 'Curious. Not only West City Private Academy but every derelict school I've stepped foot in shows signs of having been kissed by flames.' Revisiting the newspaper offered by Zhu Long, he noted the account of six individuals being saved from the top-floor restroom. While lauded as heroes, the firefighters' bravery was overshadowed by a minor report in the corner that subtly referenced the fire and the tragic death of a student. 'How could a fire erupt in a restroom, and moreover, why would those children linger in the school's top-floor restroom after the day had ended?' Connecting the fragmented reports, Chen Ge's acute perception homed in on the crux of the matter, 'The blaze raged on the fourth floor, its flames confined to the restroom with students inside. The firefighters rescued six, but one was lost to the inferno, suggesting that seven souls were present in that restroom!' The catalyst of the blaze had vanished into the annals of the past, with not a trace in any document or archive. The child claimed by the flames had become an unspeakable taboo. 'Such a catastrophe also befell West City Private Academy? Yet, during my visit, there was no inkling of the 'abnormal'?' Puzzlement etched Chen Ge's features, 'If the Door Pusher was the child who perished in the fire, then he must be West City Private Academy's very own. However, the academy's ascension to a three-star scenario was entirely due to Zhang Ya!' With West City Private Academy now an integral component of the haunted house scene, Chen Ge was convinced of Zhang Ya's position as the most formidable specter within its walls. 'Each three-star scenario is anchored by a door, yet West City Private Academy stands as an exception—despite its three-star status, it lacks a door.' His contemplative gaze fell upon his shadow as he silently uttered a name, but the silence persisted, unanswered. 'The classification of West City Private Academy as a three-star scenario by the black cellphone owes entirely to Zhang Ya. To my knowledge, Zhang Ya has never opened any door, nor did I encounter one during my visit to West City Private Academy...' As his grasp on the newspaper relaxed, an image of a red dress materialized in his thoughts. 'Zhang Ya, the door that ought to exist yet remains absent, the Door Pusher...' These notions interwove within Chen Ge's mind, forging a startling hypothesis. His eyes widened as a chill coursed through him, 'Has Zhang Ya, perchance, consumed West City Private Academy's Door Pusher?' Such conjecture could illuminate why Zhang Ya was an anomaly, her power unfathomably immense. 'What transformation might befall a door once its Door Pusher has been devoured?' Chen Ge entertained a myriad of possibilities, 'Bound by her Obsession, Zhang Ya did not become a 'Door Pusher'. A door orphaned of its Door Pusher should spiral into chaos, akin to the one in Liwan Town, yet no such calamity has ensued. Rather, the door manifests solely beside those children steeped in desperation... Hold on! Is it in pursuit of a new 'Door Pusher'? Chapter 822: The Endless Pursuit of Despondent Children Chen Ge was startled by his own speculation—an ownerless door, relentlessly seeking children trapped in despair, expending years to evolve into a four-star scenario? This idea seemed preposterous, compelling Chen Ge to calm his racing thoughts. 'Thirteen easels occupy the Laboratory Building's art room, each one used by an individual privy to the school's sinister secrets, painting with strokes that seem to bleed in reverse. They likely represent the door's chosen thirteen.' A single entity would scarcely sustain a four-star scene unless they transcended the Red Specters. But what of a union of Red Specters? The outcome would be unpredictable, for he had never witnessed so many congregate. 'Thirteen, a number fraught with ominous connotations.' Chen Ge glanced at Zhou Tu, who had been searching for the Art Club and had dreamt of the art room's scenes. Zhou Tu must be one of those thirteen artists. 'The door must have its selection criteria. Zhang Ju clearly doesn't qualify, but Zhou Tu appears to have met them.' Initially, Chen Ge had little expectation for the art room, but after analyzing the situation, his perspective shifted: 'Zhou Tu's memory is the key.' Among the club members, Zhou Tu was the most enigmatic, and Chen Ge had to prepare for two possibilities. Either Zhou Tu would regain his memory and divulge everything, or upon awakening, become an adversary. 'This is a significant catch; have I been too casual with him?' Chen Ge's gaze fixed on Zhou Tu, causing him to tremble. 'Teacher Bai, I'm going to investigate over there.' Zhou Tu hastily fabricated an excuse and hurried to the archives room's deepest section. 'Why the rush? The one who should be apprehensive is me.' Chen Ge resumed his search of the room, convinced that the archive room harbored additional revelations. Soon, Chen Ge unearthed several reports related to fires. Fire seemed to hold a special significance in this school—symbolizing both annihilation and rebirth. 'A fire occurred at Sunset Middle School, the stairways bear scorch marks, the school's original site was a crematorium, and now I've discovered that West City Private Academy also experienced a fire. Are these mere coincidences, or do they suggest a deeper link?' In addition to the fire reports, Chen Ge discovered several well-preserved student files at the bottom of a metal cabinet; two in particular were noteworthy. One file bore the name Lin Sisi, complete with evaluations from teachers and peers. His classmates shunned him, and teachers rarely intervened. An orphan without a mother and with a father convicted of murder, Lin Sisi had been adopted but repeatedly ran away from foster homes, causing much frustration. For Lin Sisi, the sole figure of genuine support was an intern from the Hanjiang Welfare Home. This recent graduate had funded Lin Sisi's elementary education and even attended his parent-teacher conferences, despite their own precarious future. The teacher's notes suggested that only in the intern's presence would Lin Sisi's 'hyperactivity' improve. Absent from the file were Lin Sisi's photograph and detailed information; however, one element was immaculately preserved—a handwritten signature: Gu Youjia. The document was frayed and riddled with holes, yet the section with the guardian's signature remained untouched. 'Gu Youjia, Hanjiang Welfare Home—if I make it out alive, a visit might be in order.' Chen Ge murmured as if to himself, yet with an undertone that suggested he might be speaking to someone else. He then examined another file, older than the rest. It lacked a name or any official records, featuring only a poignant sentence. 'Just endure a little longer, and all will be well. They can't torment me forever; eventually, I will grow up, too.' The writing, twisted and uneven, seemed not the hand of a teacher but that of a child, penned perhaps while nursing an injury. 'Endless forbearance only emboldens the tormentor. In any context, those who derive pleasure from inflicting pain will neither empathize nor reflect.' Chen Ge captured the records with Lin Sisi's mobile phone before meticulously returning them to their original place. 'The earliest file likely belongs to the true Door Pusher. After opening the door, it's possible his nature underwent a drastic transformation.' 'If the Door Pusher consumed by Zhang Ya is indeed the same individual, then even post-mortem, his door might persist in fulfilling his intentions. To improve my odds of enduring beyond the door, it would be prudent to act in accord with his will.' Chen Ge had never been a victim of school violence himself. His nearest brush occurred in elementary school when the teacher prompted students to donate their unused toys to a welfare institution. When everyone else had contributed, Chen Ge remained silent, clutching his backpack. The classroom bullies lunged for his bag, and in the scuffle, the zipper gave way, unveiling an array of horror props—fake bloodied appendages. The lifelike fingers rolled chaotically across the classroom like sticks of chalk, and the plastic intestine convulsed atop a desk, petrifying the students and the oncoming teacher. Upon the deputy principal's arrival, they inquired about Chen Ge's family background. That evening, the police summoned Chen Ge's parents to the school and interrogated them for hours. Ironically, Chen Ge may have been the only student whose bullying incident resulted in his parents facing a police inquiry. Nonetheless, the ordeal had a fortunate repercussion—no peer dared to bully Chen Ge again. 'One must never capitulate to school violence.' His statement bore additional significance—in this institution, some victims had become the new instigators of aggression. The Psychic Ghost School continued to expand, with the sinister, unblemished door approaching every despondent child, assimilating them into its fold, reenacting their nightmares beyond, using their souls as bricks to construct a mausoleum over reality. After an extensive search in the archive room, a familiar stench prompted Chen Ge to promptly lead the club members out of the office building. 'Teacher, we're fortunate; those foul-smelling entities only pursued us at the very end,' Zhu Long murmured. 'It's not fortune; someone lured those entities away from us.' While Chen Ge couldn't confirm if Chang Gu was their benefactor, he sensed something momentous transpiring within the school, likely tied to the Chang siblings. 'Let's proceed to the Laboratory Building.' Chen Ge's gaze settled on Zhou Tu: 'You've made your decision, have you not?' Chapter 823: The Red Garment Club Memory is an enigmatic force—akin to snow that never thaws or a fleeting beam of light, elusive when sought and persistent when desired to be forgotten. Zhou Tu had been haunted by a dream for an extended period, cognizant of his distinctiveness yet hesitant to accept it, eventually plunging into profound self-doubt. That was until he encountered Chen Ge. This individual was the first to validate Zhou Tu; the dreams he experienced were not mere illusions but tangible realities—indelible marks seared deep into his psyche. Zhou Tu obtained the clarity he sought, yet it drew him into a dangerous vortex. He was at a crossroads, unsure if trailing Chen Ge would lead to his ruin or salvation. 'Have you made up your mind?' Chen Ge stood before Zhou Tu, inquiring once again. 'I...' 'If you find it challenging to decide, perhaps consider his situation.' Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng unexpectedly joined them, flanking Zhou Tu: 'Zhu Long, come here.' Lagging behind, Zhu Long bore an unsettling gaze, as if flames were alight within, on the brink of a breakdown. 'What did you do to him?' Chen Ge fixated on Zhu Long's left hand, where the veins around his grasp on the black cellphone were pronounced. 'We discovered a fragment of an incomplete news report in the archives room. A courier, frequently sighted around the university, vanished on campus. After several days of police investigation, his mutilated corpse was found in the dissection room's storage area,' Zhang Ju handed Chen Ge a few tattered newspapers: 'The disfigured body they found—it was him, Zhu Long.' The shattered illusions triggered a flood of recollection in Zhu Long upon viewing the paper. His aspirations of scholarly success and university admission were merely a dream, strikingly remote from the grim reality he faced. The girl he admired excelled academically, securing a place at the prestigious Hanjiang Medical College, while he struggled to afford even the fees for repeating a semester. Poverty plagued his home, and his sole remaining relative was battling a severe illness, their health deteriorating steadily. Despite life's relentless onslaught, he persisted; he learned to tend to others and became the pillar of his household. In his job search, he was judged for his lackluster appearance, so he sheared off his unkempt hair; his tattoos scared potential customers, so he meticulously excised layers of skin with a blade. Unyielding, he eventually landed a job—a deliveryman. Diligent and amiable, with resilience in his eyes and a smile on his lips, he embraced life, his endeavors bringing him respect and stability. After a laborious summer, he grew familiar with his work, laboring late into the nights. His sole pleasure was fulfilling orders for Hanjiang Medical College. Each foray into the campus carried a sliver of hope; the knowledge that she was there was sufficient. Even a distant, surreptitious glance could buoy his spirits for the entire day. The campus was neither too large nor too small, but when they might cross paths was uncertain. He had fantasized about their encounter countless times, yet when she truly appeared, all his rehearsals proved futile. He was so nervous he couldn't speak, like a child whose secret had been unveiled. After that encounter, they exchanged contact details. The girl's unexpected initiative took him by surprise; she thrived on control, and Zhu Long mistook it for adoration. His compliance led to psychological abuse. The girl took pleasure in tormenting Zhu Long, incessantly asserting his insignificance. The self-respect he had fought so hard to build was gradually trampled upon, transforming Zhu Long into the girl's puppet, and most terrifyingly, he was oblivious to it. This straightforward, foolish boy was no match for the girl versed in anatomy and criminal psychology. He was the lamb, denuded and laid bare on her platter, helpless under her dominion. The torment extended from psychological to physical, and only at death's doorstep did Zhu Long realize the truth—alas, too late to alter his destiny. As blood drained from his wounds, clutching the pink cellphone, his gaze locked onto the newspaper in Chen Ge's hands—a mute testament to his fragmented memories. The dam holding back his memories, under incessant pressure, finally burst. 'Do you know what part of the human body is pink?' Veins stitched his skin as Zhu Long advanced toward Chen Ge: 'The flesh is most tender as a wound nears healing; she had a fondness for pink.' Zhu Long's body started to distort, his skin marred by suture marks, a testament to the atrocities he suffered post-mortem. 'Yet another victim to the half-red.' Chen Ge's expression remained unsettlingly serene. As Zhu Long came within a mere two steps, Chen Ge raised his arms, enveloping him in a gentle embrace: 'I want you to understand, no matter the circumstance or rationale, any harm inflicted upon you is inexcusable, even if cloaked in the guise of love.' Observing the boy before him, Chen Ge felt a twinge of compassion, patting Zhu Long's shoulder: 'Regardless of your present thoughts, I assure you, if we can escape this school, you shall have the opportunity to confront that girl once more.' As Chen Ge spoke, the bloodline threading through Zhu Long's form hesitated momentarily. Zhu Long peered into Chen Ge's eyes, then slowly bowed his head: 'A promise is a promise.' Clutching the pink cellphone tightly, Zhu Long silently retreated to Chen Ge's rear. As Zhu Long and Zhang Ju's garments increasingly reddened, they stood distinguished not as red garments but as the elite of the half-reds. With Wang Yicheng at their side, Chen Ge felt bolstered against the common red garments. 'It's time to proceed to the laboratory building.' Chen Ge refrained from further questioning Zhou Tu; the answer was apparent in his expression. The youth, having witnessed Zhu Long's plight, had embedded his nails into his flesh, harboring an unresolved desire, its essence now forgotten. Navigating through the thicket, Chen Ge guided the students toward the laboratory building, marking his second visit that night. 'The red garment likely remains within the duty room. Should we encounter him, it will be fitting to return his garment.' With newfound resolve, Chen Ge addressed the students gathered outside the edifice. 'This structure serves as the lair for the inverted monsters. We aim for the art club, located on the fourth floor. Upon inspection of that chamber, irrespective of Zhou Tu's memory resurgence, we must evacuate posthaste.' Chen Ge advanced first, nearing a window on the ground floor: 'Now, ascend with me.' The students exchanged wary glances before witnessing Chen Ge scale effortlessly to the second floor. 'I asserted he must be the physical education instructor.' For Zhang Ju, Zhu Long, and Wang Yicheng, with their recollections rekindled, scaling was inconsequential for specters. Only Zhou Tu confronted the climb with apprehension.
Chapter 834: Return to the Sacred Land (Part Two) "朱雀." Within the Bamboo House, Bai Yan watched Bai Xiaochen and Xiao Long'er, her children, as they frolicked and scuffled. Suddenly, her reflections were interrupted by a disturbance outside. Her 柳眉 (willow-leaf eyebrows) furrowed slightly, and she inquired, "What commotion unfolds beyond these walls? Why is there such a clamor? Investigate for me, please." "Certainly, 王后 (Wanghou)." 朱雀 (Vermilion Bird) performed a respectful fist-and-palm salute before departing to carry out the task. A short time later, she returned, cautiously opening the door, and hesitantly reported, "王后 (Wanghou), two individuals are outside requesting to see you..." "Seeking me?" Bai Yan's eyebrows lifted in curiosity. "Then I shall go and see who has come to find me." She rose gracefully from her chair and proceeded towards the entrance. Outside, beneath a crimson sky, two figures crawled forward, quivering as if carrying an immense burden. Their passage left a vivid trail of blood, which caught Bai Yan's eye, striking a harsh contrast. "What is this behavior?" Bai Yan asked sharply, her voice slicing through the stillness as her brows drew together. The Second Elder's countenance was ghostly pale, and he lay splayed on the ground, tremors running through him as he confessed, "王后 (Wanghou), I come seeking your pardon. It was I who naively trusted the impostor, causing your misjudgment of the Emperor. The fault is mine alone, and I willingly accept any punishment you decree." "No, 王后 (Wanghou), the fault lies with me for failing to relay the Emperor's edict. He left the palace to unseal the Demon Realm and bade me inform you, which I did not, allowing scoundrels an opportunity," Huo Yu implored, kneeling with a face streaked by tears. He offered up a bamboo staff, held between both hands to Bai Yan, and bowed deeply, resigned to his fate. Bai Yan's hand slowly took hold of the staff proffered before her, her expression serene, her eyes reflecting an inscrutable light. As Huo Yu felt the staff leave his grasp, he stiffened, bracing for the imminent strike. Yet, the expected pain did not come. Confounded, Huo Yu looked up only to witness Bai Yan command a flame that consumed the staff, reducing it to cinders in a blink. "Have your ordeals along this path not been sufficient penance?" "王后 (Wanghou)?" Huo Yu looked at Bai Yan, befuddled by her enigmatic utterance. "If that is the case, then consider your debts repaid. Stand," Bai Yan decreed with a voice that resonated with authority. Bai Yan has always been a person of clear convictions. Her animosity was reserved solely for those who plotted against her. If she herself could be deceived, then how could she reproach the Great Elder and Huo Yu? Thus, she harbored no resentment towards them... Huo Yu remained motionless, struggling to comprehend that Bai Yan had so effortlessly forgiven them. They had braced themselves for severe chastisement, yet she had spared them without delivering even a single blow, absolving their sins with but a simple gesture. Observing the pair still kneeling, dumbstruck and immobile, Bai Yan's voice grew stern, "Do you still expect me to help you to your feet?" Her incisive words jolted Huo Yu into action, and he ascended from the ground, his legs wobbly, his trousers soaked in blood. Despite this, he stood resolutely, his legs quaking but not collapsing into a kneel again. Recognizing their plight, Bai Yan gestured towards a stone seat nearby, "Take a seat. Once you have rested, you may descend the mountain." Chapter 835: Return to the Sacred Land (Part Three) Tears of gratitude glistened in Huo Yu's eyes as he touched the damp trails on his pale cheeks, his face a canvas of deep appreciation. 'Your Majesty, the depth of your benevolence and mercy to Huo Yu is something I shall remember for a lifetime.' Without the Queen's absolution, he would no longer have a place in the Demon Realm. Her vast magnanimity was his deliverance. 'The fault does not lie with you; I too was hoodwinked, and thus have no grounds to reproach you,' Bai Yan spoke with a touch of melancholy. 'Furthermore, I acknowledge your genuine allegiance to the Demon Realm. I expect your unwavering fidelity to Emperor Cang from this point forward.' The Second Elder approached a stone throne and seated himself, his eyes heavy with contrition. 'The Queen's forbearance in not casting blame speaks to her greatness. However, I cannot exonerate my own conduct. Henceforth, my absolute loyalty is vowed to both the King and Queen.' Bai Yan let out a soft sigh and offered, 'These are two elixirs for mending wounds. Once ingested, your injuries shall heal. The Vermilion Bird prefers solitude; it would be prudent for you to depart from the mountain soon.' After handing over the elixirs, she turned and entered the Bamboo House. The Vermilion Bird, choosing not to enter, observed the Second Elder consume the elixir before landing a resolute kick upon him. The strike toppled the Second Elder, but fortunately, the elixir had already begun to soothe any further injury. 'Great Vermilion Bird,' the Second Elder began, his posture undone, eliciting a measure of sympathy. 'In the midst of that turmoil, why did you not seek my judgment?' The Vermilion Bird, her anger barely restrained, demanded an explanation. Trembling, the Second Elder replied feebly, 'The King... rather, the impostor, expressly forbade me from informing anyone, including the Great Elder and yourself. He was overwhelmed by the fear that the Queen might be apprised.' 'Fool!' The ire in the Vermilion Bird's eyes was unmistakable as she rebuked him, 'Were it not for the Queen's mercy, and my reluctance to contravene her wishes, your punishment would have been more severe than a mere kick! Now that you have regained your strength, leave immediately!' At her command, they withdrew from the mountain swiftly, disappearing as quickly as clemency was extended. After their exit, the Vermilion Bird entered the house, her gaze falling warmly upon Bai Yan. A sliver of hurt passed through her fiery red eyes, 'Your Majesty, my outrage was aimed solely at his imbecility. You... do you harbor any resentment towards me?' Bai Yan shook her head, her laughter light, 'You were simply incensed. With your anger now released, do you feel at ease?' The Vermilion Bird nodded fervently, her eyes brimming with tentative hope, 'Your Majesty, with your return, will you... will you stay in the Demon Realm, or is another departure imminent?' Bai Yan hesitated, her lips curling into a tender smile, 'Regrettably, I must venture away from the Demon Realm temporarily, but rest assured, my return will be swift.' The Vermilion Bird's mood lifted at Bai Yan's words, her eyes gleaming with joy. Her visage was captivating, her fiery garment a dazzling display of splendor. 'Your Majesty, I am currently bound to the Sacred Mountain, but when you encounter the Black Tortoise, please bring them back to me. Then, I will be free from this place...' Like a warrior from a bygone era, ready to rejoin you in the impending battles! A glint of nostalgia shone in the Vermilion Bird's eyes, as though through the crimson sky, she could glimpse the glory and fervor of days long past... Chapter 836: Return to the Sacred Land (Part Four) She held firm to the belief that one day, she would have a heartfelt reunion with her brothers, and that the erstwhile Queen would make a formidable comeback. 'Chen'er, Xiao Long'er, let's go.' Bai Yan's smile was a tender beacon, her hand clasping Bai Xiaochen's, and the other enfolding Xiao Long'er's little hand, her eyes aglow with joyous laughter. 'Mother, where are we going?' Bai Xiaochen's large, innocent eyes shimmered with curiosity as he looked up at Bai Yan. 'We're going to see your father...' Bai Yan paused briefly, 'With the crisis in the Demon Realm averted, it's time I revisited the Sacred Land.' 'The Sacred Land?' Bai Xiaochen's eyes sparkled, 'Does that mean we will see Honorary Uncle? I've missed Honorary Uncle and Chu Sister.' With a fond tap on Bai Xiaochen's forehead, Bai Yan replied affectionately, 'I've told you many times, she is your Honorary Uncle's sister. If you call her 'Sister,' does that not misplace her a generation below us?' Bai Xiaochen touched his forehead, his little face a look of innocent bewilderment, 'But... Chu Sister won't let me call her 'Auntie,' or else she won't engage in mischief with fire with me...' Realizing what he had just said, Bai Xiaochen's eyes darted about in a flurry of anxiety as he quickly tried to clarify, 'Mother, you must have misunderstood, I didn't mean I wanted to engage in mischief with fire... I was just...' 'No need for explanations!' Bai Yan laughed coldly, 'I had thought it was Chu Yiyi who was a bad influence on you, but it seems you have a natural penchant for fire! I will make sure to mention this to your Grandmaster. After all, you share the blame for the burning of the Treasure Pavilion!' 'Mother...' Bai Xiaochen's plea was tinged with desperation as he clutched Bai Yan's sleeve, 'I know I was wrong. Could you perhaps not mention it to the Grandmaster?' 'Hmm...' Bai Yan pondered, stroking her chin thoughtfully, 'I shall decide based on my mood.' With that, she led the two delicate children by the hand, her laughter soft and light as they stepped out of the Bamboo House. Despite the seals being lifted, the sky above the Demon Realm still bled crimson, as if submerged in a sea of blood, the scarlet hue enshrouding the entire world... ... Within the grand hall, Emperor Cang rested his chin in his hand, his domineering presence filling the space, making the man reporting to him sweat profusely, his form trembling slightly. Suddenly, a figure in red caught Emperor Cang's eye. His typically dominating and icy gaze softened. With a flutter of his robes, he was instantly at the woman's side, his hand tenderly drawing her into his embrace. 'What brings you here? Did I not ask you to rest upon the Sacred Mountain?' His voice, once unheard of in its tenderness, suggested that as if nothing else in the world mattered but the woman in his arms. 'I have come to discuss something with you; I need to make a brief return to the Sacred Land.' 'Very well, I shall accompany you later.' Emperor Cang furrowed his brow, deep in thought, before relaxing, his lips curving into a faint smile. 'That won't be necessary.' Bai Yan gently declined, 'I shall return promptly, and you have many matters to attend to. There's no need for you to accompany me this time.' In that instant, Bai Yan recalled the words of the Holy Master. At this moment... The gulf between her strength and Emperor Cang's was immense. She must quickly enhance her abilities to fight alongside him as an equal. And for her, the only way to increase her power was to return to the Sacred Land. 'Are you worried I might clash with Chu Yifeng?' Emperor Cang's voice carried a hint of jealousy. Chu Yifeng held a special place in Bai Yan's heart. He had been a constant presence when she needed support the most, often appearing at her side. This fact alone was enough to rouse the emperor's jealousy. Chapter 837: Assigning Her as the Referee (Part One) As Emperor Cang concluded his remarks, the woman before him rose on her toes for a tender kiss, her arms encircling his neck. Her kiss was deep and affectionate, spinning an endless yarn of love. After a moment, Bai Yan released her hold, her delicate hands caressing his head with care: "Be patient, wait for me here, I'll return before long..." Her voice, as gentle as one soothing a timid creature, irresistibly softened his heart. Hence, he could not find it in himself to refuse her any longer, and he whispered softly in agreement, "All right, after I've resolved the Demon Realm's affairs, I will come for you." Bai Yan nodded slightly: "Xiaochen, Xiao Long'er, let us head to the Sacred Land." "Father," Bai Xiaochen glanced at Bai Yan and then at Emperor Cang, his large eyes sparkling like stars, "Please, remember the promise you made to Xiaochen. After I visit my godfather and the Grandmaster, I will return to the Demon Realm, and then you must allow me to train in the Secret Realm." Emperor Cang's chuckle was filled with warmth: "When have I ever broken a promise? Upon your return, I will personally escort you to the Secret Realm for training." "Agreed." Bai Xiaochen's smile radiated innocence and brilliance, outshining even the sun's romantic glow. "Xiaochen will strive to grow stronger, to become the wings that shelter Mother from all storms." His youthful face was brimming with unwavering determination, his eyes filled with steadfast resolve. He feared no peril of the Secret Realm if it meant protecting his mother! Bai Yan was about to caution Bai Xiaochen, but seeing the excitement on the child's face, she found herself speechless, the words of restraint impossible to utter. Emperor Cang, sensing Bai Yan's concern, reassuringly embraced her shoulders: "You needn't worry; I will ensure Xiaochen's safety. Besides, as the Crown Prince of the Demon Realm, his duty is to protect his mother and sister! It is his inevitable destiny." Bai Yan gave Emperor Cang a questioning look: "And where might his sister be?" With a sly grin, Emperor Cang whispered into Bai Yan's ear, his voice laden with implication: "Should you wish, we could always have another..." The most beautiful of intimations are those left unspoken; like when children are mentioned, met with a whisper, 'If you wish for more, they can be yours at any time.' In that moment, Bai Yan's ears grew warm; she coughed lightly, turning away from Emperor Cang's phoenix eyes, which were filled with desire. "The day grows late; I must depart." A thought suddenly crossed her mind, and she looked up at Emperor Cang: "Furthermore, I have forgiven the Second Elder and Huo Yu; you no longer need to trouble yourself with them." A frown momentarily crossed Emperor Cang's brow. Truthfully, had it not been for those two, Yan'er would not have felt compelled to leave. Nevertheless... Since Yan'er had decided upon forgiveness, he would honor her decision. "Mischievous Father, farewell for now." Bai Xiaochen gestured a playful goodbye to Emperor Cang, following Bai Yan as they moved towards the exit. "Hold on." Suddenly, a voice resonated from behind. Bai Yan paused, turning to see the silver-haired man approaching. "Emperor Cang, is there something else?" "I will escort you." With an assertive yet smiling gaze, Emperor Cang walked beside Bai Yan, his grip on her hand firm. "Very well." This time, Bai Yan did not resist; with a light smile, she replied, "After all, I am to return; why such urgency?" "I simply wish to cherish every moment I spend with you," he declared. She had preferred he stay behind, and he had respected her wishes, yet he longed for just a few moments more by her side. Chapter 838: Let Her Be the Referee (Part Two) Bai Xiaochen trailed behind the two adults, lips pursed in a sulk, her delicate face painted with disappointment. "I can't shake the feeling... ever since Mother accepted 坏蛋爹爹 (Naughty Daddy), I've become redundant," she muttered. Xiao Long'er, his large eyes blinking with innocence, turned to the figure beside him, carved with delicate grace. "Why do you say that?" "Mother used to hold me all the time, but now that 坏蛋爹爹 (Naughty Daddy) is here, if she just hugs me once, he throws me out..." Bai Xiaochen's lips puckered more deeply, "So, I feel like maybe I'm not really 坏蛋爹爹 (Naughty Daddy)'s own child... Maybe I was picked up somewhere?" The Sacred Land, shrouded in a mystical fog, appeared as a celestial haven. Now, the Sacred Land buzzed with noise. Bai Yan, arriving at its edge, was met with a sea of people. Confusion flickered across her eyes as she whispered to herself, "What has happened in the Sacred Land?" She had been gone only a short while; why were there so many people gathered here now? "Miss, are you not here for the Sacred Land's 招生大会 (Recruitment Conference)? How come you don't know what's happening?" A youth, noticing Bai Yan's perplexed expression, spoke up with a gentle explanation. "A 招生大会 (Recruitment Conference) in the Sacred Land again?" Bai Yan's exquisite face showed a hint of surprise. The Sacred Land had just recently sent people to recruit disciples; why was there another event so soon? Could it be that something significant had occurred within the Sacred Land? "Mother," Bai Xiaochen yawned, "I wish to see 干爹 (Godfather) and 师公 (Grandmaster). Shall we go in now?" "Of course." Bai Yan, holding Bai Xiaochen with one hand and Xiao Long'er with the other, made her way briskly towards the Sacred Land's main gate. But the path ahead was clogged with too many people, forcing them to weave through the crowd to reach the Sacred Land. "Make way!" Suddenly, a hand reached out from the side, aiming to shove Bai Yan aside. Bai Yan's gaze sharpened, and she quickly pulled Bai Xiaochen to the side, dodging the intrusive hand. The owner of the hand, upon noticing this, shot a glare back at Bai Yan and scolded in a cold voice, "Have you not seen that the young mistress of the 火炎门 (Flame Sect) has arrived? Everyone else, step aside immediately!" The 火炎门 (Flame Sect), a revered second-tier sect, commanded a significant presence just below the 妖兽宗 (Beast Demon Sect) on this continent. With the proclamation of the young mistress's arrival, the crowd at the front hastily dispersed, parting to create a clear pathway. In the midst of all the onlookers, a woman in a resplendent red dress walked up from behind. A silver snake coiled around her wrist, her lips curled into a serene smile as she advanced with grace. "That's 火云 (Huo Yun), the young mistress of the 火炎门 (Flame Sect), renowned as a 驯兽师 (Beast Tamer). See that 银蛇 (silver snake) on her arm? It's a testament to her skill, subdued by her own hands." "Impressive. With such talent, even the 妖兽宗 (Beast Demon Sect) would eagerly recruit her. Unfortunately, 火云 (Huo Yun) is the precious daughter of the 火炎门 (Flame Sect); she's unlikely to become a disciple of another sect." Admiring murmurs spread through the crowd. With the young mistress of the 火炎门 (Flame Sect) attending the Sacred Land's 招生大会 (Recruitment Conference), their own prospects seemed diminished. "Mother, that lady looks quite plain, yet she dares to wear red. Only you, Mother, can truly complement such a splendid color," Bai Xiaochen's candid voice pierced the crowd's hush, swiftly drawing all eyes upon them. Chapter 839: Appointing Her as Referee (Part Three) Bai Xiaochen's cheeks puffed with indignation, his gaze locked onto the Silver Snake coiled around Huo Yun's wrist, exuding a domineering air despite his youth. His lack of affection for Huo Yun was understandable; not only were the Flame Sect guards notably arrogant, but Huo Yun was also allied with the serpent tribe. Bai Xiaochen's bond with Qing Luan and Sister Qing Xue left him with a deep-seated aversion to all serpent-kind. If not for those despised serpents, his mother would have been spared much suffering... Sensing the imposing aura from Bai Xiaochen, the Silver Snake shrank back, its forked tongue no longer flicking out, and fear shone in its tiny eyes. 'How dare you!' The Flame Sect guard was enraged. Few on this continent dared display such insolence toward his mistress! However, just as the guard was about to erupt in fury, Huo Yun furrowed her brow and held him back. 'We are in the Sacred Land! Without my command, no one is to cause trouble!' Huo Yun was aware of her place; despite her usual audacity, she wouldn't dare to incite disorder at the gates of the Sacred Land. And as for the mother of this child... She was clearly here for the Recruitment Conference. Huo Yun could wait to confront her at the event and settle their score. 'Let's proceed; our cousin should be here to receive us.' As Huo Yun turned away, she was oblivious to Bai Yan having already reined in her own menacing aura. Had Huo Yun not intervened, the guard might very well have been drenched in his own blood. 'Mother,' Bai Xiaochen blinked, turning to Bai Yan, 'may Chen'er seek retribution?' Bai Yan's lips lifted in a faint smile: 'If we are not offended, we do not initiate conflict. But should they offend you, Chen'er, show no mercy.' Her message was unequivocal—if these individuals wronged Bai Xiaochen, he was at liberty to retaliate, and she would stand by his actions. As Huo Yun reached the entrance, the crowd saw a man emerge to greet her, his delighted stride heading towards Huo Yun. 'Cousin, you've finally arrived.' Huo Yun's demeanor shifted from ice to a shy blossom, her eyes cast demurely downward: 'Cousin brother, father must have informed you that I am here to participate in the Recruitment Conference; I rely on Cousin Ya Han's assistance.' Lin Ya Han's laughter boomed, 'Do not fret, with your esteemed lineage, admission to the Sacred Land is certain. Shortly, we shall be fellow disciples.' The crowd watched Huo Yun and Lin Ya Han vanish into the Sacred Land, their eyes gleaming with envy. 'So, Huo Yun's cousin is within the Sacred Land.' 'And I've heard Lin Ya Han's master will serve as one of the referees for the disciple selection.' 'That child who slighted her just now, his prospects at the Recruitment Conference might well be doomed...' Bai Yan absorbed the murmurs of the crowd, her willow brows knitting together. Following earlier cheating scandals, she had requested the Grandmaster purify the Sacred Land. Yet, deception seemed to endure? 'Chen'er, our return is most opportune.' A gentle smile flickered across Bai Yan's lips. She was resolved to report the day's events to the Grandmaster, calling for heightened scrutiny during the contest. She would brook no further favoritism or corruption within these sacred confines! With a determination as resolute as her march, Bai Yan, hand in hand with Bai Xiaochen and Xiao Long'er, made her way through the multitude toward the grand gateway of the Sacred Land. Chapter 840: Her Appointment as the Referee (Part Four) Before her return to the Sacred Land, Bai Yan had dispatched a message to the Grandmaster, who had thus instructed the gatekeepers and had provided them with her portrait. When Bai Yan arrived, the gatekeepers, recognizing her, circumvented the standard invitation check and granted her unhindered entry into the Sacred Land. 'This... Why does this lady not have an invitation?' 'Could she have a powerful patron within the Sacred Land?' 'It seems likely; otherwise, where does she get the gall to stand up to Lady Huo Yun?' ...... The crowd's murmurs failed to reach Huo Yun, who had retreated from the throng. After some distance, she paused, her lips pursed, 'Cousin, did you see the woman with two children earlier?' Lin Ya Han was taken aback, 'What about her?' 'That woman's son insulted me with his insolent tongue. When the time comes for the Disciple Recruitment Contest, I hope... she will be outright rejected!' Huo Yun's jaw clenched, her eyes flashing with an icy glint. For her cousin, under the tutelage of an Elder, such a matter was inconsequential... 'Don't worry, cousin. Those who offend you will not be given the chance to progress,' Lin Ya Han reassured her with a laugh. He had prepared for a grave situation, but for him, resolving this minor inconvenience was effortless. ...... Unaware of the conversation between Huo Yun and Lin Ya Han, Bai Yan had crossed through the Holy Gates en route to the Sacred Island. Since her departure from the Sacred Land, she had committed the Sacred Island into the care of the Grandmasters. Consequently, they were certainly awaiting her arrival... From afar, Bai Yan's gaze found three venerable elders deep in a serene tea conversation. Her demeanor softened, and a tender smile adorned her lips. These three masters had been a source of immense warmth and support to her since her arrival on this continent, especially during her most challenging times... 'Disciple?' Ren Yi, spotting Bai Yan, his eyes alight with recognition, stood up promptly, 'You've returned?' His exclamation drew the attention of the Great Elder Zheng Qi and Third Elder Qiu Shurong, who turned their surprised and joyous gazes toward the approaching group—one adult and two children. 'Wait, is this young lady the one you've been looking for?' Qiu Shurong asked with a furrowed brow, 'But why did you leave the Illusionary Abode without informing us? We've been waiting for you... If not for your grandfather's word, we would be oblivious to your departure.' Bai Yan responded with a light chuckle, 'Esteemed masters, how are your alchemical endeavors progressing? Do you remember the procedures I taught you last time?' 'Ahem!' Zheng Qi coughed, casting an apologetic glance at Qiu Shurong before candidly exposing him, 'We have all excelled in our concoctions, except for your Third Master... he has yet to master it.' 'Indeed, your Third Master is astonishingly inept at such fundamental concepts. Disciple, you must correct him sternly!' Qiu Shurong's face turned a shade of crimson with embarrassment as he glared at his two treacherous companions, 'You two old scoundrels, must you betray me so?' As the Third Master prepared for a lighthearted clash with the other elders, Bai Yan interjected with a smile, 'Enough. My visit is not to inspect your alchemical skills. I have a significant matter to discuss.' 'What is it?' The trio of elders focused intently on Bai Yan. 'The Holy Realm, as mentioned by the Holy Master... I desire to make the journey there.' The Holy Realm, a domain notorious for its lethal trials, is said to confront its challengers with an ordeal of nine deaths and one life. However, those who are resolute enough to emerge from the Holy Realm not only gain a promotion in rank but also experience a momentous enhancement of their spiritual state. For Emperor Cang, for the Demon Realm, she was resolved to brave the treacherous dangers that awaited. Chapter 841: Her Role as Referee (Part Five) 'You wish to ascend to the Sacred Realm?' Zheng Qi looked at Bai Yan in surprise. After a moment's contemplation, he said, 'This matter requires a discussion with the Holy Master. Should any misfortune befall you, it would not only spell disaster for us three elders, but would also represent a massive loss for the Sacred Realm.' 'Very well,' Bai Yan responded with a slight nod, 'It has been a long time since I last saw him. I shall join you in this meeting. Additionally, there is another matter I seek to understand.' Bai Yan paused briefly, then inquired, 'Why does the Sacred Realm seek to recruit disciples?' 'The situation is such that...' Qiu Shurong sighed, feeling helpless, 'Recently, the continent has been fraught with unrest, and all three major forces have sensed a looming crisis. They aim to select disciples endowed with extraordinary talents from among the populace, to be sent to the Minor Sacred Realm for cultivation.' The Sacred Realm is divided into two sections: one being the Minor Sacred Realm, which Bai Yan had once visited, and the other, the true Sacred Realm, often referred to as the Mirror of Nine Deaths and One Life. Whether it is the Minor Sacred Realm or the true Sacred Realm, a person may only enter once in their lifetime. Unless there is no other choice, the Sacred Realm would not continue to recruit disciples. 'If the plan is to have her refine her skills in the Minor Sacred Realm, then this trial must be conducted with absolute fairness, without any acts of favoritism or corruption!' Bai Yan stated seriously, her hand thoughtfully stroking her chin. 'Speaking of which, your timing is impeccable; the Holy Master has just decided that you should serve as the referee for this competition.' 'I?' Bai Yan's eyes narrowed slightly, 'I lack the time, as I need to undergo cultivation in the Sacred Realm.' 'My disciple, opening the Sacred Realm is also a time-consuming endeavor. This spare time you have is perfect for taking on the role of referee. Furthermore, you will be the sole arbiter for this contest!' Bai Yan glanced at the group of elders: 'Why do you not serve as referees yourselves?' To serve as a referee? It was an aggravating task, and they would have to be out of their minds to take on such a burden. 'My disciple, we are still perfecting our alchemy and need to dedicate ourselves to it, thus we lack the time for other matters.' Ren Yi subtly grimaced, his eyes shifting as he quickly conjured an excuse. 'What of Chu Yifeng?' 'To appoint the Young Master as referee would be folly; those maidens would be too preoccupied with winning his favor to focus on the competition. They'd probably rather devour the Young Master whole.' 'And Chu Yiyi? If Chu Yifeng is unsuitable, surely she cannot be unfit for the role?' 'Her? Out of the question! With her capricious nature, she'd turn the entire competition upside down. Who knows, she might set the arena ablaze if she's in a foul mood.' In short, the elders were unanimous in their decision: Bai Yan was the only candidate for the role of referee! Bai Yan held her forehead, suddenly feeling as though she had returned at an inopportune time... 'May I decline the role?' Her voice carried a hint of reluctance as she asked. 'No! You cannot decline. It is decided; you shall oversee the competition, with the Little Princess as your deputy. In this Sacred Realm, it seems you are the only one who can handle her.' Ren Yi asserted definitively, leaving no room for Bai Yan to object. 'Mother,' Bai Xiaochen pulled at Bai Yan's sleeve, his eyes shining with eagerness, 'Xiaochen also wishes to serve as a deputy.' Xiao Long'er looked at Bai Yan and then at Bai Xiaochen, her eyes brimming with anticipation. She, too, longed to aid the Queen... 'That issue can wait. First, I must see the Holy Master and Chu Yiyi. By the way, is Chu Yifeng in the Sacred Realm?' Bai Yan contemplated for a moment before posing the question. Upon hearing this, the elders' faces stiffened, and they let out a sigh laden with unspoken complexities. Chapter 842: Appointing Her as Referee (Part Six) The Young Master's unwavering devotion to Bai Yan had always been evident, yet her heart belonged to Emperor Cang. Nursing his broken heart, the Young Master had retreated from the Sacred Land to heal... Bai Yan, upon seeing the elders' expressions, realized the truth and was filled with guilt. She owed Chu Yifeng a debt too vast to repay even in a lifetime. 'Let's go,' Zheng Qi encouraged Bai Yan, patting her shoulder and giving a resigned smile. 'We always harbored hopes that you would reciprocate the Young Master's affection. But we understand that love cannot be forced. He has supported you for years without your reciprocation. Then, in just a brief moment, you devoted yourself to Emperor Cang. This clearly shows that the Young Master was not the one destined for you. Whatever your decisions, we will stand by you.' 'Masters...' Warmth filled Bai Yan's heart, and she smiled appreciatively, 'You will always be my masters, in every life to come.' 'Hahaha!' Zheng Qi's laughter filled the room, 'With your words, what more could I ask for? Come along, the Saint Lord has been eagerly awaiting your return. Let me take you to him without further delay!'... In the room. The table was in complete disarray. Chu Yiyi sat devouring a chicken leg, her face smeared with oil, while beside her, a man held a wine jar, his handsome face flushed with inebriation. 'Father, did you summon Bai Yan?' Chu Yiyi inquired, casually tossing a chicken bone aside and eyeing the wine jar in Chu Ran's grip. Without hesitation, Chu Ran slapped her forehead, 'This fine wine was painstakingly acquired by Zheng Qi. You've had a taste; that should suffice,' he reprimanded, glancing at her sharply. 'Regarding Bai Yan... Zheng Qi informed me she would return in the next few days.' 'Oh!' Chu Yiyi's eyes sparkled, her face lighting up with a delighted smile, 'That's marvelous! I must write to my brother and urge him to return as well.' Even though Bai Yan's heart was with Emperor Cang, Chu Yiyi knew her brother would be overjoyed with just a sight of her. As his sister, she felt obliged to fulfill his wish. Just as Chu Ran was about to speak again, an elder rushed in, bowing deeply, 'Saint Lord, Princess, Zheng Qi has arrived, and... Miss Bai Yan is with him.' Being confidants of the Saint Lord, the elders were aware of Bai Yan's existence. Since the celebration of Bai Changfeng's birthday, it was commonly known that the three elders had taken on a new disciple. Despite this knowledge, none had actually met Bai Yan. Even standing before them, they would not recognize her as the master of the Sacred Isle or as the disciple of the three elders. 'What? She's back so soon?' Chu Ran stood up hastily, eyeing the chaotic table. With a swift wave of his hand, he cleared the table's contents into his Storage Pouch and donned fresh robes. He also took an Elixir to eliminate the alcohol on his breath. Chu Yiyi was stunned, her face still dirty and her gown a mess. 'She abhors untidiness!' Chu Ran whispered a reminder to her, signaling that she should change quickly. Unfortunately, it was too late... As Chu Yiyi rose from her seat, Zheng Qi and Bai Yan had already elegantly entered the room. The first thing Bai Yan noticed was Chu Yiyi's filthy appearance, causing her brows to furrow in disapproval. 'Yiyi, you've turned your own chamber into a mess, and now you dare to defile the Saint Lord's quarters?' Bai Yan's eyes surveyed Chu Yiyi, and upon detecting the scent of alcohol, she inquired with a grave mien, 'Have you been drinking again? Have you forgotten the last incident when you were inebriated and nearly set ablaze my Sacred Isle?' 'It wasn't like that, it was Father...' Chu Yiyi was on the brink of tears. Before she could explain further, Chu Ran quickly interrupted with a cough, stopping the words that were about to slip from her lips. Chapter 843: The Father Who Sets a Trap for His Daughter 'Yiyi, I have always cautioned you that a maiden must comport herself with grace. Yet, you indulge in meat with abandon and imbibe wine in great gulps! How does this befit your station?' Chu Ran admonished with an aura of righteous indignation, delivering his reprimand with piercing words and a visage etched in solemnity. Chu Yiyi was dumbfounded, her reply coming out as a mere whisper, 'But I took just a single sip...' 'What? You dare claim you drained a whole pot?' Chu Ran accused, pointing at Chu Yiyi, his voice cold and sharp with fury, 'To think you'd be so brazen while I was none the wiser! To enter my chambers and drink, leaving the air heavy with the stench of wine! How shall I find solace and slumber this night?' Chu Yiyi's eyes bulged with incredulity, her gaze fixed on the stern countenance of her father Chu Ran, as a sudden urge to weep welled within her. She had merely sipped; why was her father casting such unfounded accusations? 'Bai Yan, what matter of such urgency brings you before me?' Chu Ran's eyes shifted towards Bai Yan, his previously severe expression now touched with a hint of warmth. This maiden had kept her distance since he had once sought to match her with his son. Now, she would not seek him without grave cause; unless it was of great import, she would not approach him! 'Holy Master, you had once spoken of my prospects in the Minor Holy Realm, suggesting that I was fit to enter the true Holy Realm. I was in haste to depart the Sacred Land then, hence I did not seize the chance to ascend to the Holy Realm. Might I still pursue this path?' Bai Yan inquired, her brows slightly furrowed. Truly, she had spent two of her four years within the Sacred Land mastering the intricacies of the Minor Holy Realm. There, she had excelled beyond expectations, earning the privilege to ascend to the true Holy Realm. Yet, her heart had been heavy with concern for Bai Xiaochen, prompting her to leave the Sacred Land and return to the Bai family... If the opportunity still lingered, she would assuredly grasp it to elevate her prowess within the Holy Realm. Chu Ran paused, his brow creasing deeply, 'You desire entry into the Holy Realm?' 'Without a doubt.' Bai Yan's tone was steadfast, her resolve unshaken. Chu Ran exhaled a soft sigh, 'Miss Bai, it is as I affirmed: you may journey to the true Holy Realm, but you have witnessed the perils within the Minor Holy Realm. The hazards that lie in wait in the true Holy Realm are manifold!' 'Yet, it is precisely the threat of these dangers that renders the Holy Realm the crucible for honing one's mettle,' Chu Ran fixed his gaze upon Bai Yan, speaking with gravity, 'Furthermore, within the Holy Realm, the passage of time is greatly decelerated; a year within its bounds equates to but a month in our world.' Bai Yan lapsed into silence, contemplating Chu Ran's elucidation. 'Are you truly prepared to face the Holy Realm, to embrace its perils without trepidation?' Chu Ran's brow unfurled, his tone markedly gentler as he posed the query. 'I am certain.' The unyielding light in Bai Yan's eyes bore no trace of doubt. 'Very well, I honor your choice. Yet, to open the gates to the Holy Realm requires considerable exertion; preparations must be made,' Chu Ran remarked with a light-hearted chuckle, stepping beside Bai Yan and tenderly patting her shoulder, 'It is a pity, truly. I had long envisioned you as my son's betrothed, yet now you are joined with another... Nevertheless, should you not be my daughter-in-law, you remain as dear to me as a daughter!' 'Holy Master...' Bai Yan raised her eyes, meeting the gaze of the man before her. Chu Ran offered a smile, 'Let us dispense with maudlin sentiment. If my own daughter proved as little cause for concern as you, my heart would be at ease.' Chu Yiyi's heart brimmed with a sorrow unspoken. Was she so readily dismissed? It appears that in the eyes of others, their offspring are paragons, whilst she is reduced to a mere footnote of disappointment... Chapter 844: Framing (Part One) "Ahem!" Zheng Qi coughed twice to draw attention, his expression serene yet authoritative. "Holy Master, there is another matter I would like to report." "What is it?" "For the upcoming contest, I suggest nominating Yan'er as the referee. I await your esteemed opinion on this matter, Holy Master." Zheng Qi's suggestion plunged Chu Ran into deep thought. He turned to Bai Yan and inquired, "Miss Bai, what are your thoughts on your master’s proposal? Are you willing to undertake this task?" "How long will it take to open the Holy Realm? And the duration of the contest?" Bai Yan mused, her fingers resting thoughtfully on her chin. "The Holy Realm will take slightly more than a month to open, and the contest shall certainly conclude within that period." "Very well," Bai Yan's eyes gleamed with determination, and her lips curved into a faint smile. "I will assume the role of referee." Chu Ran laughed heartily, giving Bai Yan's shoulder a comforting pat: "Having you as the referee puts my mind at ease. Yiyi, accompany Miss Bai and take this chance to temper yourself. Listen to her advice; do you understand?" Chu Yiyi, still smarting from her father’s earlier scheme, hesitated, but Chu Ran’s admonishing glance swiftly silenced her. The unspoken message was clear: Reveal what I've done, and face the consequences. Perhaps cowed by Chu Ran’s menacing look, Chu Yiyi shuddered and could not bring herself to speak of the earlier incident. "Ahem!" Zheng Qi coughed again, clearing his throat before continuing, "Since we have settled all pertinent issues, I must discuss some further matters with Yan'er. Holy Master, we shall take our leave." He bowed his fists in a sign of respect and guided Bai Yan towards the doorway. They soon disappeared from the room, leaving Chu Ran to quietly sigh with relief, his hand lightly touching his chest as he relaxed. With a wave of his hand, the banquet that had been removed earlier was once more laid out on the table. "Yiyi, let's proceed," he chuckled, returning to his seat. Chu Yiyi's lips twitched in frustration: "I refuse to be your scapegoat. I'm going to find Bai Yan." "Wait," Chu Ran's brows furrowed as Chu Yiyi began to leave, "If even a whisper of what transpired leaves your lips, I'll see you wed before the fortnight is out!" Chu Yiyi's form shook, and she dashed from the room without looking back, her resolve not to betray her father evident in her haste... In the days that followed, the Sacred Land was a hive of activity with the gathering of disciples-to-be. To prevent these hopefuls from interfering with the Sacred Land's disciples, they were confined to a small courtyard in the outer sector, barred from stepping out without express consent from the Sacred Land’s authorities. Within a cottage in the courtyard, a woman clad in a red gown paced with restless anxiety. Her hands twisted together, and her stunning face was marked by a trace of apprehension. Abruptly, the door burst open, and her eyes lit up as a handsome man entered. She rushed to meet him. "Cousin, did your master respond? Will he agree to help us?" Lin Ya Han let out a sigh of resignation, his smile tinged with bitterness: "Cousin, I'm afraid that this time, my master is unable to come to our aid..." Huo Yun, previously elated, now stood petrified. She gazed at the man, her eyes filled with dismay: "Why? With your master's esteemed position in the Sacred Land, why can he not assist us? Is he reluctant to extend his support to me?" Chapter 845: Framing (Part Two) 'Cousin Sister, you've misunderstood; it isn't that my master is unwilling to help, but the Sacred Land has unexpectedly chosen a new referee for the event. This referee is shrouded in secrecy. Despite my considerable efforts, I've been unable to uncover her identity,' Lin Ya Han expressed, his visage marred by the bitterness of unforeseen changes. Upon hearing this, Huo Yun bowed her head, her complexion taking on a ghostly pallor. In fact, her vaunted talent was nothing more than a fabrication touted by the Flame Sect, a mere shadow when compared to the true prodigies of other sects. Her so-called Silver Snake pet wasn't subdued by her own hand, but was gifted by an Elder in her sect, who then deceitfully proclaimed her to be its conqueror. She had further obscured her power level by wearing trinkets that concealed her strength, seldom making public appearances, thereby keeping her true abilities hidden from the world... Her chances of advancing in this contest alone were nearly non-existent. More importantly, she was determined to use the Elder's influence to eliminate that woman! The memory of Bai Xiaochen's insolence ignited a fury within Huo Yun—she was resolute in denying that boy's mother any chance at all! 'Cousin Brother, could you endeavor to uncover the referee's identity? If I know who she is, I'm confident I can sway her to my side,' Huo Yun implored, her fists clenched as she raised her beseeching eyes to Lin Ya Han. Lin Ya Han's heart softened at the sight of his cousin sister's distress, but ultimately, he could only shake his head in gentle refusal. 'The Sacred Land is extremely secretive about the identity of this referee; even my master is in the dark. However, I do know that... The esteemed Little Princess of the Sacred Land will also be present at the Great Contest, serving as the deputy to the referee.' Huo Yun tensed; if the princess of the Sacred Land was merely serving as an assistant, what extraordinary origins might the referee possess? 'But do not fret, Cousin Sister. In addition to the referee and the Little Princess, several disciples from the Sacred Land will be there to aid them. One of these disciples happens to have a connection with me, and I can utilize that to ensure your selection,' Lin Ya Han revealed, a smile of victory playing on his lips. 'With such a vast competition, it would be impossible for the referee to oversee every detail. I will arrange for surreptitious interventions at the crucial moment, thus securing your triumph.' Huo Yun finally exhaled in relief, her fist playfully striking Lin Ya Han's chest, 'Cousin Brother, you've thought of everything for me. Why did you not reveal this sooner and save me from worry? And have you learned anything of that woman's identity?' Her tender punch grazed his chest, and as Lin Ya Han's gaze drifted from her pale neck down to the surging curves of her form, a scorching yearning blazed within him. He swallowed with difficulty, his voice parched, 'I've set people to investigate. Rest at ease, Cousin Sister, you will not be disappointed.' 'I trust you completely, Cousin Brother,' Huo Yun murmured shyly, her head bowed, the red of her attire making her neck appear even more lustrous, her face suffused with modesty, 'But when the time comes, I do hope you can ensure their failure. I cannot endure the thought of those people gracing the same stage.' 'Ha ha ha!' Lin Ya Han laughed heartily, affectionately squeezing Huo Yun's hand: 'Given that all competitors have been invited by the Sacred Land, I cannot simply eliminate that woman outright. But...' Chapter 846: Framing (Part Three) His eyes narrowed slightly, a cold gleam shooting through them as he silently smirked, 'I have a scheme that will lead to her utter disgrace. Once she's fallen from grace, she'll have no choice but to leave the Sacred Land, leaving you unrivaled.' After all, she's merely a woman. As a disciple of the Sacred Land, dealing with her should be a breeze. If it pleases my cousin, what's the harm in bending the rules a bit? The higher-ups are too detached to bother themselves with such trivial matters... Three days whisked by, and the venue was now teeming with contenders from various powers. Amidst the guards, Huo Yun stood out, her earlier shyness around Lin Ya Han replaced by an icy air of nobility. Her expression was frosty as she surveyed the bustling crowd, impatience flickering across her features. Yet, despite her searching gaze, Bai Yan's figure was nowhere to be seen, her brow creasing with a trace of concern. 'Miss!' A cautious voice from her attendant broke the silence, 'She has arrived.' Huo Yun's gaze followed the attendant's direction, and there she was – a trio, one adult and two children, making their way through the crowd. The woman, robed in the hue of the Vermilion Bird, moved with an ethereal grace under the midday sun. Her beauty was so transcendent that the phrase 'surpassing all worldly splendor' seemed an understatement. The boy on her left, as exquisite as carved jade, wore a purple brocade robe that accentuated his youthful sovereignty. It was remarkable that such a young face could exude such a commanding presence. On her right, a little girl with rosy cheeks giggled, her smile sweet and eyes curved like crescent moons, exuding a charm that could soften even the hardest of hearts. 'That woman has finally shown herself!' Huo Yun's eyes darkened with malice, 'Do you remember what I tasked you with?' The attendant nodded earnestly, 'I remember your orders very clearly, Lady Huo Yun.' 'Good,' Huo Yun sneered, 'My cousin is right; this woman... she must face complete ruin!' As Bai Yan led Bai Xiaochen and Xiao Long'er towards the High Platform, a derisive voice cut through the noise, stopping her in her tracks. 'The shamelessness of some knows no bounds, coming here to compete without talent or training! And to think they'd stoop to bribing the referee's aides, as if such underhanded tactics could ensure their selection in the Sacred Land!' Bai Yan's delicate eyebrows furrowed slightly. Releasing the children's hands, she turned, her gaze sliding from Huo Yun's frosty demeanor to the attendant who had spoken with such disdain. 'Were you referring to me just now?' The attendant retorted with a scoff, 'I speak only the truth; my eyes have seen your desperate attempts. I saw you trying to sway a disciple of the Sacred Land with seduction, thinking you could manipulate the selection process. Could the Sacred Land's disciples be so easily swayed by your temptations?' 'Xiao Ling!' Huo Yun cut in before Bai Yan could reply, her brows arching with a hint of interest and reproof. 'What do you mean by these accusations?' The attendant, Xiao Ling, turned to Huo Yun, fists respectfully clenched in salute, 'Lady Huo Yun, it was by sheer coincidence that I stumbled upon this lady... she... she had sought out a disciple of the Sacred Land, intending to use her allure to influence his decision and secure her place in the selection. I couldn't bear the thought of you competing against someone of questionable morals, Miss, so I felt compelled to expose her.' Chapter 847: Framing (Part Four) The words of Huo Yun and Xiao Ling, having been rehearsed numerous times, were etched in their memories. Coupled with Huo Yun's expression of disdain, their performance swayed the crowd to believe in their fabricated truth. 'What?' Huo Yun gasped, her eyes wide with shock as she clutched her reddened lips, her body quivering. Her gaze towards Bai Yan was filled with undisguised loathing. 'You... You have cast shame upon your sect with these deeds!' The crowd stirred with disapproval, their eyes upon Bai Yan now laced with revulsion. Those who had stood by her moments earlier now recoiled, wary of being sullied by her supposed dishonor. Anger colored Xiao Long'er's cheeks a furious red. She was eager to tear into the deceitful woman's facade, but felt the firm grip of a hand restraining her. 'Queen...' She turned, looking imploringly at Bai Yan, eyes brimming with injustice, even as she shot a glare filled with malice towards Huo Yun and her accomplice. Bai Xiaochen, unlike Xiao Long'er, harbored no impulse to act rashly. His lips curled into a cunning smile, and his eyes shone with mischief: 'Xiao Long'er, just wait and watch—the real spectacle is about to unfold.' Did these people truly believe they could entrap their mother? Were they ignorant of her reputation and the inevitable repercussions of their scheme? 'You allege that I bribed a disciple of the Sacred Land? Pray tell, where is this disciple? Can you bring them here to testify?' Bai Yan's lips curled into a knowing smirk as she regarded Huo Yun with a gaze dancing with mirth. At a sign from Huo Yun, her maid stepped forth, cleared her throat with purpose, and called out, 'Young Master Liu, would you please come forward and provide your testimony? The admission of such a woman into the Sacred Land would surely sully its hallowed grounds.' No sooner had the maid finished speaking than a man in a green robe appeared from the vicinity of the high platform. With casual grace and a hand resting behind his back, he made his way toward the gathered crowd, wearing a composed smile. 'Under normal circumstances, Liu Han would refrain from commenting on matters so unseemly,' began Liu Han, his voice exuding a sense of righteousness, 'but as Huo Yun's maid has beckoned, I, Liu Han, find myself obliged to give an account of the truth.' His gaze shifted to Bai Yan, his brow furrowed in an expression of grave concern, 'Miss, I understand your desperation born from inadequate talent, prompting such unsavory actions. Still, Liu Han conducts himself with integrity and could not possibly betray his conscience. I beseech you to withdraw of your own will, lest I be forced to expel you.' Gone was his earlier affability, replaced now with a seriousness that underscored the gravity of his words. 'Uncle Liu,' came a clear, childlike voice, piercing through the tension and drawing Liu Han's attention downward to the small child before him. 'Uncle Liu, didn't your mother ever teach you that children who lie will suffer dire consequences?' Liu Han's expression darkened as he responded icily, 'No wonder the child is so impertinent; the offspring reflects its parentage. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.' Bai Xiaochen's smile remained sweet, yet there was a cold glint in his large, fox-like eyes. 'Uncle Liu, Chen'er merely wishes to remind you of the grim fate that awaits liars. If you have spoken the truth, then my words do not concern you. Could it be that Uncle Liu himself harbors fear?' Bai Xiaochen's youthful face shone brightly, 'Moreover, even after you've besmirched Chen'er's mother, Chen'er still addresses you respectfully as 'uncle.' Who, then, truly lacks decorum?' Chapter 848: Framing (Part Five) Silence enveloped the crowd, a stillness so profound that the drop of a needle would have resounded like thunder. Though the disciples of the Sacred Land were typically beyond suspicion, Bai Xiaochen’s display of impeccable manners had cast doubt on the claims of his incivility. This incongruity swayed the sympathies of those present, particularly those whose hearts were easily warmed by maternal instinct, to the boy’s side. Bai Xiaochen, having delivered his pointed words, retreated to Bai Yan’s comforting presence. His cherubic face was uplifted, eyes bright with an innocent luster. 'Mother, Chen'er has issued a warning, but he seems deaf to my words. You needn't extend any further courtesies to him...,' Bai Yan gently stroked Bai Xiaochen’s head before her eyes, cool and assessing, settled on Liu Han. 'I'll give you another chance. Are you certain your previous statements were truthful?' Liu Han’s expression subtly changed, uncertainty crossing his features. What was this woman implying? Despite the Sacred Land’s troubled times, Liu Han’s voice was resolute. 'I, Liu Han, have never spoken an untruth.' Liu Han was no stranger to bribery; he had narrowly escaped previous purges. As the Sacred Land underwent yet another cleansing, protecting his interests became paramount. His alliance with Lin Ya Han was not born of bribery, but rather a desperate attempt to validate his own integrity. Consider this, he mused: even when faced with a woman of unparalleled beauty, he could remain undeterred, a paragon of virtue. Surely this would earn him the esteem of his fellow Elders and perhaps pave the way to greater achievements... 'Very well, I have given you a chance, yet you persist in your ways, so...,' Bai Yan’s eyes narrowed, her lips curling into a knowing smile, 'whatever consequences ensue, you have only yourself to blame.' Liu Han caught the chill in Bai Yan’s demeanor and an inexplicable unease began to take hold, sending tremors of dread through his heart. 'Liu Han, subordinate to Qinghong, core disciple responsible for overseeing weaponry during the contest...' Bai Yan’s voice contained a wisp of amusement, 'So, I supposedly sought to bribe you for superior weapons while sabotaging the others?' Liu Han, momentarily dazed, affirmed: 'Yes, you requested not only the best weapons for yourself but also tampered with the rest, an act of treachery I could never condone against the Sacred Land!' Upon entering the Sacred Land, bearing arms is forbidden. Even the contest’s weapons are provided by the Sacred Land, upholding fairness. Yet... Bai Yan’s laughter was sudden and derisive, 'You alluded to my lack of prowess, but have you forgotten? Against overwhelming power, even godly weapons are rendered insignificant.' Indeed, divine artifacts wield great power, but to a warrior nascent in their craft against a Venerable Rank adversary, can such an artifact’s potential truly be unleashed? Yes, the caliber of one’s weapon matters, but it pales in comparison to the essence of genuine strength. Liu Han was bewildered; he had overlooked the question of how Bai Yan knew about his weapon oversight duty—a detail privy only to the Sacred Land’s inner circle. The others knew only of his involvement in the contest. 'Has Qinghong failed to show himself? Fetch him at once!' A cold smirk graced Bai Yan’s lips as she issued the command with icy authority. This contest, supplemented by Chu Yiyi’s involvement, had Zheng Qi delegate two core disciples for support—one of whom was Liu Han, Qinghong’s underling. Bai Yan had not anticipated that Liu Han would mistake her for an ordinary contestant and even more, that he would dare to slander her with false accusations. Chapter 849: She Is the Mysterious Referee (Part One) At that moment... From the outskirts of the crowd, a pert voice arose from behind, abruptly quieting the previously bustling throng. 'What's this commotion all about?' From behind the onlookers, a girl clad in a yellow dress furrowed her brows, her tone suffused with impatience. As she made her appearance, the crowd that had been scrambling for a view promptly dispersed to either side. The disciples of the Sacred Land might not have had the fortune to meet Bai Yan, but there was no one who didn't recognize the infamous 'Enchantress,' known as the Demon Princess. With her arrival, Liu Han ceased his standoff with Bai Yan, his handsome features brightening with a congenial smile. 'Demon Princess, Brother Qinghong, Brother Changling, have you all gathered? Then, when shall the contest begin?' 'Now,' Chu Yiyi raised her brows playfully, her eyes alight with mirth as she cast a glance toward Bai Yan. She was about to approach Bai Yan when Liu Han's voice chimed in from the side. 'Demon Princess, shall we not wait for the Referee Master?' Chu Yiyi paused, confusion etching her features as she turned, her frown deepening: 'Has she not already arrived? Whom else are we awaiting?' The crowd's behavior seemed puzzling; Bai Yan was evidently there, yet they seemed to expect another. Liu Han's eyes widened in disbelief. The referee had arrived, yet he had received no notification? Chu Yiyi, seemingly oblivious to Liu Han's shock, spun around and, with a peal of laughter, made her way to Bai Yan, her charming face breaking into a brilliant smile. 'Bai Yan, I'm a tad late. Is it time to commence the contest?' Liu Han, who had been scanning the crowd for the enigmatic referee, stood rooted to the spot as he witnessed Chu Yiyi approach Bai Yan. Hearing her words, he pieced together a startling possibility. This realization left him rigid, his complexion turning ashen as his clenched fists trembled slightly, his eyes wide with disbelief. 'Brother Qinghong, this woman... is she...?' The youth who had arrived with Chu Yiyi glanced at Liu Han, clearly puzzled by Liu Han's intense reaction, yet he nodded subtly, 'Yes, she is the Referee Master. Were you not aware?' His tone, though measured, resonated distinctly in the solemn assembly, impacting the hearts of all present. Huo Yun swayed, requiring the support of her handmaiden to avoid collapsing. Yet... Her fingertips, blanched with tension, gripped her palm tightly, using pain as an anesthetic. Could this woman not be a disciple here for the contest but rather... the mysterious Referee Master summoned by the Sacred Land for this event? Had her cousin not claimed to have encountered all the high-ranking disciples of the Sacred Land, yet this woman remained unknown to him? 'Wait,' As Chu Yiyi was about to lead Bai Yan to the judges' panel, Bai Yan raised her hand, halting her motion, her eyes sweeping towards Liu Han, a frosty sneer curling her lips. 'Did you just suggest that my talent is lacking?' That single question brought Chu Yiyi, previously unaware of the developments, to an abrupt halt. Her eyes, round with astonishment, slowly shifted towards Liu Han. Is Bai Yan's talent in doubt? If so, what does the term 'genius' signify in this world? Bai Yan closed the distance with Liu Han by another two steps: 'Did you insinuate that I would stoop to bribery just to ensure my success in this contest, is that correct?' Chu Yiyi's gaze widened to the size of saucers. She had been merely a bit late, yet in her absence, a significant incident had transpired. Chapter 850: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part Two) "I..." Liu Han staggered back, his forehead slick with a cold sweat and his legs quivering uncontrollably, nearly collapsing in sheer terror. Before Liu Han could fabricate a plausible excuse, Chu Yiyi's voice erupted in righteous fury, sending him sprawling to the ground in utter humiliation, the shameful scent of his fear permeating the venue. "Liu Han, you have some nerve! Bai Yan graciously agreed to serve as referee, and yet you dare to slander her! With Bai Yan's exceptional talent, she could effortlessly defeat you and all your allies combined! And you dare to call her abilities into question? Who gave you such boldness?" Bai... Bai Yan? The name reverberated in Liu Han's mind, a name he had heard spoken with nothing but esteem. As he came to a realization, he shifted his gaze to the child by Bai Yan's side, his eyes bulging with a mix of dread and panic. He had heard rumors of the revered Island Master Bai Yan of the Sacred Land, granddaughter to Bai Changfeng, always accompanied by her endearing son! He had never actually seen her, only knowing of her through hushed tales, which is why he hadn't instantly connected her with the woman before him... If she truly was Bai Yan, then his earlier accusations were laughably absurd! Liu Han shuddered, with Liu Han's forehead pressed to the ground, too petrified to utter another word. The crowd around him fell silent, their prior skepticism towards Bai Yan now reflected back at Liu Han, their eyes filled with disdain and derision. This young lady's status in the Sacred Land was clearly esteemed; otherwise, the Little Princess wouldn't willingly become her deputy. Yet Liu Han, a mere Inner Sect Disciple, dared to insinuate that she would use her beauty as a bribe to gain entry into the Sacred Land? Ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous! "Little Princess, I acknowledge my wrongdoing. I truly do," Liu Han pleaded, his forehead knocking against the ground, tears streaming down his face, "It was Lin Ya Han who orchestrated this plot. I was merely his accomplice; he is the chief culprit." "Lin Ya Han?" Chu Yiyi's brows furrowed, her fingers lightly caressing her chin, "And who might this be?" "He... He is also an Inner Sect Disciple of the Sacred Land, hailing from the same master as I." "Very well. Have him expelled alongside you. Our Sacred Land has no room for such characters." With a wave of her hand, Chu Yiyi sealed the fate of both men. Turning to Bai Yan with a gleeful smile, she blinked playfully: "Referee Bai Yan, do you approve of my judgment?" "Proceed as you deem appropriate." "That won't do," Chu Yiyi objected, her lips pursing into a pout, "My father instructed me to emulate your wisdom and follow your directives. Should he discover that I've acted on my own accord, he would surely reprimand me." Her words carried an implicit warning. If even she, the Sacred Land's Little Princess, was bound by Bai Yan's wisdom, then who were these mere disciples to defy her? Should she report their insolence to her father, their repercussions would be more severe than a simple expulsion. In the crowd, Lin Ya Han, who had been closely monitoring the situation, sensed his plans unraveling and made a break for it. Yet before he could flee, he was surrounded by onlookers. One among them struck his chest with a palm, launching him through the air to land at the feet of Bai Yan and Chu Yiyi. Chapter 851: The Mysterious Referee (Part Three) Chu Yiyi stood with her hands on her hips, looming over Lin Ya Han who lay on the ground, chuckling with a sinister air, 'Bai Yan had Elder Zheng Qi cleanse the Sacred Land before, yet to think such vermin still persist. Our contests in the Sacred Land are held with utmost fairness, and we shall not tolerate any favoritism or deceit!' 'Sister Chu,' Bai Xiaochen stepped forward, his eyes sparkling with mirth, 'this Lin Ya Han is the cousin of that nefarious aunt, and moreover... that very aunt had previously caused a disturbance at the gates of the Sacred Land with Xiaochen. Xiaochen suspects that she is the orchestrator behind everything.' He tilted his head up proudly, pointing towards Huo Yun. His youthful face still bore traces of innocence, yet it was tinged with an emerging air of authority. Huo Yun’s face turned pale as she stepped back, her eyes wide with alarm. She desperately sought Lin Ya Han's gaze, her eyes sparkling with tearful specks. 'No, it has nothing to do with my cousin,' Lin Ya Han gritted his teeth and proclaimed, 'She is innocent; it was all self-initiated - I colluded with her maid! I only wanted to defend my cousin sister's honor, never anticipating such consequences. I pray the Little Princess can grant me another chance.' He was exposed, and the harshest penalty was merely expulsion from the Sacred Land. However, if his cousin were implicated, even if the Sacred Land took no action, upon her return to the Flame Sect, her father would show no mercy! Disgracing the Sacred Land would be the end of the Flame Sect! 噗通! The maid also knelt, her forehead striking the floor forcefully, bruising and bleeding. Blood oozed from her brow, staining the ground. 'All these transgressions were indeed plotted between the Young Master and myself, unrelated to the young lady. I beseech you to release the young lady; she is guiltless...' Tears filled her eyes, her complexion was ghostly, yet she exhibited a resolve to face her own demise. Should she shoulder all the blame, the worst to befall her would be death, but if her mistress met with misfortune, then her brother within the Flame Sect would share a similar fate... Thus, she could not implicate her mistress. As the two took full responsibility upon themselves, Huo Yun quietly breathed a sigh of relief. She moved forward, clenching her teeth, and knelt before Bai Yan, her eyes brimming with tears as she bowed deeply. 'Miss Bai, I understand you harbor deep suspicions towards me. This incident truly arose from my failure to supervise my maid, and my cousin... acted out of devotion for me, committing these deeds out of love. However, I, Huo Yun, have always walked a straight and honorable path. I shall never admit to actions I haven't committed! I entreat Miss Bai not to allow your son to falsely accuse me...' Her words were sincere, her eyes beseeching, as if she were indeed wronged. Chu Yiyi turned her head to Bai Yan, and truthfully, she trusted Bai Xiaochen far more than this woman. 'Do you wish to continue in the contest?' A sly smile played on Bai Yan’s lips as she gazed at the kneeling girl, 'Is that so?' Huo Yun's face turned ashen. With her cousin down, the outcome of the contest was predictable if she remained. Yet under such circumstances, she could not withdraw. 'Yes.' 'Hmm,' Bai Yan nodded slightly, 'Remove the jade pendant around your neck, and I shall allow you to continue in the contest.' What? Huo Yun's eyes widened, her face turning snow-white, her gaze filled with distress. How could she have known? 'Miss Bai, this pendant was bestowed upon me by my late mother,' Huo Yun lowered her head, masking the turmoil in her eyes, and spoke with a trembling voice, 'She instructed me never to remove the pendant, lest I dishonor her memory. Surely, Miss Bai would not... force me?' Chapter 852: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part Four) Within the Sacred Land, disciples might covertly indulge in deceit, but public displays of such acts are strictly forbidden. This emboldened Huo Yun's brazen disregard. However, she failed to recognize that among those present were the esteemed Little Princess Chu Yiyi of the Sacred Land, and another whose edicts even the Little Princess would not dare defy. After Huo Yun's defiant response, Chu Yiyi stepped forward, forcefully removed the jade pendant from Huo Yun's neck, and hurled it to the ground, where it shattered with a resounding crash. 'When Bai Yan instructs you to remove your pendant, you should do so without hesitation. Why do you speak such nonsense?' Chu Yiyi's glare was piercing as her voice cut through the air sharply. All who witnessed were shocked by Chu Yiyi's audacity, and their looks of pity toward Huo Yun were evident. Yet, none dared voice opposition, given Chu Yiyi's exalted status. But... Huo Yun had claimed that the jade pendant was a last memento from her mother, a treasured relic. Yet, the Little Princess of the Sacred Land acted with such dominion, shattering Huo Yun's relic without a second thought. Huo Yun's face paled, not from grief, but from fear. She stared at the fragments of the pendant on the ground, panic flickering in her eyes. Her downfall was now certain... 'Wait, this doesn't add up. It's said that Huo Yun, the heiress of the Flame Sect, had achieved the illustrious King Rank. Among all but the three great powers, she's hailed as the most talented. Why then does she exhibit only the strength of a Mid-Earth Rank practitioner now?' The Earth Rank, while not exceptionally high, is certainly not low. When Nangong Yi, the Crown Prince of the Liuhuo Kingdom, ascended to Earth Rank, he was hailed as a prodigy. But... Nangong Yi is merely a royal descendant with access to limited cultivation resources, unlike those available to a secondary sect. Thus, Huo Yun's supposed prodigious talent now falls short, especially since the Flame Sect had zealously promoted her as a peerless genius. Rising to the King Rank at such a young age would indeed mark one as a genius, but sadly... This 'genius' was an impostor! 'Yiyi,' Bai Yan said with a hint of a smile, 'as I understand it, anyone wishing to enter the Sacred Land's competition must at least possess the strength of a High-Earth Rank practitioner! If she hasn't met this criterion, how did she manage to enter the Sacred Land?' While Zheng Qi had extended invitations to all major sects, admittance to the Sacred Land necessitates a preliminary vetting. Only those meeting the minimum strength requirement are entitled to an invitation. How, then, did someone who failed to meet this fundamental criterion find her way into the Sacred Land? This question surely warrants the contemplation of us all. 'Qinghong, can you explain what's happening here?' Prompted by Bai Yan's inquiry, Chu Yiyi turned the interrogation toward the two men following her. Her eyes blazed with indignation, hands on her hips, as she demanded an explanation with an imposing aura. Qinghong wiped the sweat from his brow, 'The individual tasked with overseeing the selections for the major forces was Master Lin You.' 'Master Lin You? And who might that be?' Chu Yiyi pressed, her tone laced with irritation. 'He is...' Qinghong glanced briefly at Lin Ya Han, who was quivering on the ground, 'he is Lin Ya Han's master.' The crowd buzzed with whispers. The attention that had been on Huo Yun now shifted to Lin Ya Han... Lin Ya Han shook, acutely aware that both he and his master were now ensnared by inevitable retribution! Chapter 853: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part Five) 'Get him over here!' Little Princess Chu Yiyi commanded, her brow furrowed with a trace of displeasure. As her attendant prepared to follow the order, she hastily reconsidered, 'Wait, no, I don't wish to see him. Just take him directly to Elder Zheng Qi and let them handle it.' 'As you command, Little Princess.' The guard complied with the Little Princess’s decree, sealing the fate of Lin Ya Han and his disciples... 'You,' Chu Yiyi pointed to another guard, lifting her snow-white chin, 'take Liu Han and Lin Ya Han down to await their punishment! It's one thing to engage in corruption, but to plot against Bai Yan and think you can get away with it? Dream on.' Lin Ya Han's legs buckled, and he collapsed to the ground. Briefly closing his eyes, he reopened them with a resigned smile, his gaze falling on Huo Yun's pallid face. It seemed he was powerless to help his cousin sister now. 'Your Highness, Mistress Bai Yan,' Liu Han, panicked, approached and knelt before them once again, his forehead thudding against the ground. He was so overwhelmed he didn't even notice his forehead bleeding. 'I acknowledge my wrongdoings, I truly do. Please, have mercy on me this once. I won't dare again,' he pleaded. 'Spare you?' Bai Yan let out a cold laugh, her detached gaze resting on the kneeling young man. 'If I weren't the referee for this contest, would your sinister plan have succeeded?' Liu Han was stunned; indeed, if Bai Yan were merely a regular disciple and not the referee, he might have already succeeded in having her expelled from the Sacred Land, her reputation destroyed... 'So if it had been someone else, you know very well what the outcome would be,' Bai Yan pressed her foot down on Liu Han's head, grinding it into the ground, her voice icy, 'It's precisely because of people like you, with your cheating and favoritism, that the Sacred Land might have already lost countless outstanding disciples. How can we overlook such behavior?' Whether it is the Illusionary Abode, the Medicine Sect, or the Sacred Land, all are her home. She will not allow anyone to bully their way around her domain, nor will she permit the Sacred Land to miss out on its geniuses due to such misconduct. Today, she was determined to set an example—to ensure that the Sacred Land would henceforth be a place of peace and fairness! With a powerful kick, Bai Yan sent Liu Han flying into a nearby column. He spewed out blood, his complexion completely drained of life, devoid of any hint of vitality. His eyes, dilated with terror, watched as the formidable figure in the red garment approached, powerless to resist. Spurt! Bai Yan's fingers gripped Liu Han's arm, twisting with force. A sickening snap of bone echoed, followed by another burst of crimson blood. Then, a scream that ripped through the heavens ensued, sending shivers down the spine. 'Our Sacred Land has always been a paragon of fairness and justice, and will never tolerate any form of corruption or favoritism!' Bai Yan's calm gaze swept over the crowd, her voice unwavering, 'Should I discover such misconduct again, the culprit will suffer the same fate.' Bai Yan retracted her arm, and from within her sleeve shot forth a beam of light that struck Liu Han's dantian. In an instant, his dantian burst, and he crumpled to the ground in disarray. In the past, the three masters had cleansed the Sacred Land, but their admonitions were not severe enough. They only expelled the violators, and so, there were still those who gambled! For mere wealth and treasures, they were prepared to cheat once more.
Chapter 1064: Cross-Border Bombing Even on the frozen grounds of the north, within their own territory, the Finnish officials could not possibly remain ignorant of an uprising. Yet, they chose to maintain a complicit silence. The chaos was brought by Arrow Corporation's people, within their 'private territory.' Since the dead were not Finnish citizens and Arrow Corporation hadn't requested any aid, why should the authorities intervene? Partak Town's local police dispatched a few mounted officers to circle the refugee camp. These officers, however, lacked the courage to engage and promptly retreated after a brief appearance. Judging by the armaments held by the insurgents, this was beyond the local police's capacity to manage. The chief of police in Partak Town immediately decided to mobilize the local militia for defense within the town, striving to ensure the safety of the townspeople. His decision proved wise. In less than half an hour, directives came from above, urging the local police to protect Partak Town and dispatched Alpha Special Forces for support. As for the refugee camp, the Finnish Defence Forces, hundreds of kilometers away, would 'take over.' In name only. Through intelligence from the Russian Security Bureau, Jiang Chen learned of these developments. The silence of the Finnish officials was unexpected; he had anticipated that Finland would at least dispatch a rapid reaction force to stabilize the situation. Their subdued response suggested that perhaps Carmen, within the military base, was engaged in unsavory activities. Or did he believe the two brigades within the base were more than sufficient to handle these disorganized foes? Regardless of Carmen's reaction, Jiang Chen's plans were unfolding methodically. Most of these refugees hailed from the Middle East, many having been part of militia groups or conscripted as reservists, with basic military training under their belts. They couldn't be expected to operate tanks, but they were more than capable with mortars—at least they wouldn't drop shells on their own heads. With the second batch of equipment from the Russo-Finnish border arriving in Partak, Sami, bolstered by his swiftly growing prestige, assembled a ten-thousand-strong guerrilla force from the refugee camp. With the rallying cry 'Only by annihilating the infidels' army can we end oppressive rule,' he mobilized the entire camp for a decisive battle against Arrow Corporation. Crates of ammunition were loaded onto battered vans and trucks, and workers pulled welders from factories to mount heavy machine guns onto pickups. There was no doubt this ragtag force had no real combat prowess. Against formally trained mercenaries, they stood little chance, but Jiang Chen was brimming with confidence in the outcome of the war. The reason was simple. If marksmanship couldn't prevail, they'd win with firepower! At two in the morning, six hours after the insurrection began, leaving only two thousand to defend, the armed forces under Sami once again mobilized, advancing towards Arrow Corporation to 'liberate' their misled brethren. The formidable army reached two kilometers outside Arrow Corporation, spreading out to encircle the military base. Under the guidance of a few veterans, the militants dug simple artillery pits with shovels and hoes. Hundreds of mortars formed dozens of artillery positions. As a signal flare soared, the 'whoosh' of mortars firing blanketed the tundra, and bursts of explosive fire engulfed the base, disorienting the ready mercenaries. Of course, the mercenaries in the base weren't idle. At the first sign of artillery fire, all mercenaries rushed to bunkers. Simultaneously, the base's howitzers, based on coordinates from scouts, began counter-battery fire on the insurgents' mortar positions... But the mortar positions were too dispersed; the shells from all directions left the base's gunners running ragged. Despite their expertise in artillery, they were outnumbered drastically. A mortar shell hit the command post roof, crippling a corner of the concrete fortification. Yano, his face plastered with dust from the ceiling, steadied himself on the table, cursing as he looked out the window. 'Shit! Where did these bugs get so many mortars?!' The unexpected artillery strike caught everyone off guard. They had expected these disorganized foes to charge their machine gun emplacements with rifles, not to be met with support weapons leveling the ground. 'No doubt, it was Star Ring Trade that supplied them,' Saldes, back at the tactical map, glanced around at those present, 'Gents, we can't keep up this defense. No one knows how much ammunition they have because the man providing their arms is an unadulterated scoundrel. Yano, lead your men out and show them that modern warfare can't be won by numbers alone.' 'Yes!' Yano saluted, took the radio from his gear, and began issuing orders to units at all levels. After orders were given, the military ground's gates opened, and a dozen Humvees roared out, followed by four 'Cougar' armored vehicles, charging towards the rioters' positions. Under Jiang Chen's guidance, Sami decisively ordered his men, armed with crates of anti-armor weapons, to confront the oncoming threat. The frontline unfolded at the edge of a pine forest, where towering trees abounded. Upon meeting Sami's guerrilla force, Arrow Corporation's Humvees and armored vehicles slowed, their rooftop-mounted heavy machine guns firing bowl-sized bullets into the rioters' ranks. The mercenaries, too, dismounted, seeking cover to engage the rioters. However, they vastly underestimated the rioters' anti-armor capabilities. As the mercenaries fired their machine guns, RPG warheads—high-explosive and armor-piercing alike—flew haphazardly through the pines. Though lacking in accuracy, the sheer volume rendered the reactive armor on the armored vehicles ineffective, with only one managing to retreat unscathed. Of course, these alone couldn't offset the rioters' inexperience in warfare. Despite the sudden RPG fire catching Arrow Corporation's armored units off guard, even without the vehicles, these disorganized forces were no match for a regular army... In under ten minutes of combat, Sami's forces suffered over two hundred casualties, while Arrow Corporation had less than fifty. Seeing they were outmatched, Sami panicked, urgently calling Jiang Chen for aid. 'Our frontline troops are beginning to falter; their sharpshooting is too precise! Many have never handled a gun before; we simply can't best them...' 'Don't worry, it will soon be resolved.' Jiang Chen's words left Sami momentarily stunned. Soon be resolved? What did he mean? While he was still bewildered, the ground suddenly shook violently, and a thunderous explosion echoed from afar. The blast wave swept through the pine forest, across the tundra, and even ruffled his bangs. Before Sami could grasp what had happened, billowing smoke rose from the direction of the military base, his mouth agape in shock. Standing on a hill on the other side of the battlefield, Jiang Chen observed the dramatic display through his binoculars, a smirk appearing on his lips. It appeared that the Alpha Special Forces had made their move. (To be continued.) Chapter 1065: Arrow Corporation's Demise Under the relentless barrage of mortar fire, the base descended into chaos, and no one noticed a special forces team sneaking into the camp. Kutepov effortlessly placed a beacon on the designated target and then led his squad out of the base. Upon safely reaching the evacuation point, he called in an airstrike. Russian stealth bombers soon swooped down from above the clouds, dropping four cruise missiles that accurately hit two ammunition depots and two fuel stores within the base. The explosion's shockwave swept through the camp, collapsing a circle of concrete buildings. The exploding ordnance and the fiery blasts careened across the camp, setting off a series of chain reactions—flames, blood, and corpses were everywhere. The personal guard brigade within the camp suffered nearly a fifty percent casualty rate instantly, with most of the remaining soldiers injured—it was nearly impossible to find someone unharmed. Medics, carrying stretchers, wove through the base, searching for incapacitated wounded. Sappers, clad in bomb-proof attire, braved the inferno to drag undetonated ammunition from the rubble. All able-bodied soldiers sprang into action, searching for their units to regroup. Saldes, the notorious general manager of Arrow Corporation and supreme commander, gazed out the window at the flames. Despair slowly crept into his vacant eyes. The smoke obscured the entire base, while the fires turned the night sky red—it resembled the apocalypse. "Damn it..." He murmured, his leaden legs moving him away from the window. Turning, he locked eyes with the command center's staff. "Commander, what should we... do?" The aftermath of the explosions finally subsided; no more sounds of detonating ammunition echoed throughout the base. But tranquility eluded everyone's hearts. The mercenaries who had narrowly escaped the explosion knew that their real nightmare was just beginning. The initial blasts seemed to have ignited a beacon, signaling the charge for Sami's forces. At Jiang Chen's behest, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity, rallying the remaining insurgents to storm the front lines. More than six thousand individuals surged across the tundra toward the flickering pine woods—a magnificent scene from afar. Meanwhile, as the mercenaries at the front lines saw the smoke rising from their rear, panic set in. Their morale plummeted in an instant. Confronted by the insurgent tide, even if they had the strength to hold the line, their will to continue fighting had dissipated. Without a doubt, Arrow Corporation's defenses were breached, and the mercenaries scattered before Sami's overwhelming numbers. Some retreated to the burning base, but most turned deserter, fleeing into the depths of the forest. No prompt from Jiang Chen was necessary; even the dimmest would know what to do at this juncture. Watching Sami lead the insurgents in their assault on the military base, Jiang Chen stowed his binoculars and summoned the pre-prepared off-road motorcycle from his storage space, giving Aisha a gentle pat on the back. "It's time. Let's move out." "Understood!" Aisha nodded in agreement, and once Jiang Chen was seated, she swiftly mounted the motorcycle behind him. The engine roared to life, kicking up a spray of snow. Jiang Chen rode the motorcycle down the hillside, bringing Aisha to the side of the base. They stopped the bike at the roadside, and he retrieved a Laser Sword from the storage space. With ease, he sliced through the steel wire mesh protective wall. The base was engulfed in fire and disorder, with the occasional sound of mortar fire. All armed mercenaries were at the front, battling the insurgents for control of the main gate. Aside from a security squad at the command center, the entire rear area appeared deserted. For Jiang Chen and Aisha, it was as if there were no defenses at all. Ten guards in total—two in the watchtower, the rest stationed at the entrances on the first and second floors. Aisha took out the Ghost Sniper Rifle and silently dispatched the watchtower guards. Then, exploiting the blind spots, she systematically eliminated the eight others. After Aisha cleared the command center's security detail, Jiang Chen took his rifle and approached the entrance. As he passed by the Humvee, he ran into Saldes fleeing the command center along with the staff. Their eyes met, and both parties were momentarily stunned. The staff member reacted first, reaching into his chest to draw a weapon. But before his hand reached his chest, Aisha, quicker on the draw, ended his resistance. Saldes, about to fight back, found himself easily subdued by Jiang Chen, who pressed him against the Humvee with his hands twisted behind his back. "Saldes, male, 43. You're the general manager of Arrow Corporation and the supreme commander, am I right?" Although it was their first meeting, Jiang Chen's holographic helmet, linked to the Ghost Agent database, held his photo and personal information. With just a glance, Saldes' profile was projected onto the holographic screen. With his face pressed against the vehicle, Saldes displayed his stubbornness, refusing to surrender, his teeth gritted. "I won't say anything. You might as well kill me..." "Kill you? I haven't asked you anything yet." Jiang Chen grinned, unfazed by his uncooperative attitude. He retrieved a syringe and injected it unceremoniously into Saldes' shoulder. "Ugh—!" Saldes grunted in defiance, his eyes popping with veins, but his gaze soon dimmed. Jiang Chen let go of him; there wasn't a single precedent of someone resisting the effects of the truth serum. Turning Saldes over, Jiang Chen asked pointedly, "Where's Carmen?" "Underground bunker... inside the research institute." "Where's the entrance to the underground bunker?" "At the center of the base, only accessible by elevator. You'll see the two helipads next to the entrance." The information flowed like a rehearsed script. "Good, now you can have your wish." Jiang Chen pulled out his handgun and fired a bullet into Saldes' head before tossing his body aside. A swift death indeed, but for the well-known Saldes of Arrow Corporation, to die so anonymously might have been worse than death itself... If the dead could suffer. "The underground bunker, then." Jiang Chen looked toward the center of the base, a cold smile playing on his lips. Whatever Carmen was plotting, his luck was about to run out. The fate of the Rothschild family was about to echo their ascent—gained fame from a war, and now they were about to fade into obscurity because of one... However, just then, a piercing scream echoed from afar. (To be continued.) Chapter 1066: Iblis! A ghastly wail tore through the battlefield, eclipsing even the staccato of gunfire. Amidst the fierce clash between mercenaries and insurgents, a sinister shape plunged into the fray. Illuminated by the flare's incandescence, all could discern the monstrous visage: a creature with limbs arched like a bow, arms that ended in dark, scythe-like blades, and a shuttle-shaped beak bristling with rice-grain-sized teeth. A pair of stubby wings adorned its back, giving it the eerie appearance of a humanoid mantis. The fusillade ceased for an ephemeral two seconds. All combatants were transfixed by the spectacle before them. But in the lull of gunfire, the 'mantis' sprang into action. Its bow-shaped legs catapulted it forward, its seven-foot frame launching through the air with unnatural velocity. The insurgent nearest to it barely had time to react before crisscrossing blades decapitated him, his lifeblood spurting as he collapsed. The creature pinned its quarry to the ground, its beak-like maw violently plunging into the neck's gaping breach. With a series of crunchy, gnawing noises, it voraciously devoured the marrow and flesh, its ferocity akin to a wild beast quenching its bloodlust. Even the battle-hardened militants felt their stomachs churn at the sight, their legs quivering as they retreated in dread. 'Iblis...' That was the name of a demon, reminiscent of Satan from the Bible. 'It's Iblis!' Someone cried out, and soon after, screams rippled through the air. The insurgents hefted their G36 rifles, fingers white-knuckled on the triggers, unleashing a fusillade on the beast. But the mantis merely raised its bladed limbs, letting the bullets clink harmlessly off its chitinous armor, utterly unconcerned by the 5.56mm rounds. Most dreadfully, this mantis-like entity was not alone. From the underground bunker's entrance, a multitude of dark silhouettes emerged, their blades flashing as they charged towards the insurgents. Once in close quarters, the insurgents faced nothing but a massacre. Amidst the mantises, another grotesque form appeared: bloated, maggot-like creatures ejecting highly corrosive saliva that could consume steel and concrete, let alone human flesh. Confronted with these demonic beings of legend, the zealots finally felt the grip of fear. As disorganized as their arrival, the insurgents' collapse was uncontrollable. On the other side, the mercenaries' cries of elation soared. They were comrades, despite the grotesque appearances. Their cries, however, were fleeting as a similar nightmare soon befell them. Dense spore clusters drifted from the underground bunker, stealthily enveloping the camp. In the dark of night, they were nearly imperceptible. Those first exposed to the spores began to struggle for breath, followed by excruciating pain radiating from their chests. Writhing in agony, they clawed at their skin, blood flowing unabated. Quickly, they lost sensation throughout their bodies, becoming akin to the walking dead. Only those encased in powered armors were spared. On the battlefield, everyone else, regardless of allegiance, was swallowed by the spore cloud. In a desperate bid for survival, mercenaries and insurgents turned their guns upon each other, facing a common adversary. But from the start, they stood no chance... 'What the hell is that thing?!' A creature bearing resemblance to a deathclaw lunged; Jiang Chen, his back slick with cold sweat, planted a firm boot into its chest. He discarded his empty rifle, drawing his laser sword in a swift motion, its blade arcing through the air to sever a limb. Greenish blood spurted out, vaporizing under the heat of the blade. As the creature recoiled with a howl, Jiang Chen refrained from pursuit. With a flick of his wrist, a spinning blade of light detached from the hilt, cleaving the creature's face in half. Aisha, steadied with her Ghost sniper rifle, coolly dispatched two more alien creatures, their heads erupting. 'Their numbers are overwhelming; we can't hold this position,' Jiang Chen declared, retrieving a PK2000 from the ground and inserting a new magazine. 'Time to retreat.' Aisha nodded but didn't move. 'I'll cover our retreat—' 'You take the lead, quickly!' Jiang Chen patted Aisha's shoulder, propelling her forward, and raised his rifle to mow down a group of zombies lurching towards him. True, they were zombies. But differing from those he had faced in Cagayan City, these seemed to be the result not of viral infection but of something akin to the zombies from the wastelands. 【Warning: Unidentified bacteria detected in the air. Filtration system activated automatically. To deactivate, please...】 The alert on his helmet's display was clear, and Jiang Chen understood the nature of these beings. They were all too familiar. He had faced similar threats in Wanghai City. Without a moment's hesitation, Jiang Chen exercised his supreme command authority within Star Ring Trade, circumventing all bureaucratic layers, directly linking to Electromanta C-1 in synchronous orbit. He designated the entrance to the base's central underground bunker as the target, initiating an orbital airstrike. Diplomatic issues would take a backseat to humanity's crisis. Compensation could be addressed later. 'This is Electromanta C-1, airstrike target confirmed. Tungsten-core rounds have detached, departing synchronous orbit. Airstrike estimated to impact in ten minutes. All combat personnel must evacuate the target area...' After silencing the comm, Jiang Chen emptied his rifle's magazine and sprinted toward the protective wall. Aisha, who had already reached the perimeter, set up her sniper rifle, covering Jiang Chen's retreat. For reasons unknown, these alien creatures seemed to be purposefully pursuing them, as if controlled by some malevolent consciousness. Before the horde of zombies and mutants could encircle them, Jiang Chen successfully breached the protective wall and tossed a nuclear hand grenade behind him. Without looking back, he and Aisha fled. Once assured that no pursuers had emerged from the explosion that decimated the horde, Jiang Chen took an off-road motorcycle from his storage space and, with Aisha, sped toward the mountain, not towards the refugee camp but in the direction of the Russian-Finnish border. The motorcycle crested the hill, and Jiang Chen paused, glancing at his watch before looking back toward the military base. In the sporadic light of flames, he could barely make out with the naked eye that the base no longer harbored life. As specks of white light appeared in the night sky, trailing slender flames, a volley of tungsten-core rounds hammered the base's center, raising plumes of dust skyward. 'That ought to have finished them off,' Jiang Chen murmured, extracting binoculars from his pocket. When the dust settled, a crater dozens of meters wide stood at the base's heart, a chasm as if leading to hell itself. Yet from the depths of the crater, more alien creatures continued to crawl out... (To be continued.) Chapter 1067: Finland Caught in the Crossfire The sky was beginning to lighten, marking the approach of six in the morning. An orange-red civilian helicopter circled in the high skies, its side marked with the letters YLE. When the ammunition depot exploded, sending a column of black smoke skyward, YLE had immediately dispatched their helicopter to the scene. They had anticipated a forest fire, but what they encountered was far from natural. It was the military base of the controversial Arrow Corporation, situated within Finnish territory, now looking like a battlefield. At the epicenter of the turmoil was a massive, seemingly bottomless pit. "This is YLE, live at the scene of what was initially believed to be a forest fire in the outskirts of Partak Town... It has now been established that this is not simply a fire, but an explosion caused by human intervention. We have identified a huge crater on site... Wait, what's that?" The camera shook violently, refocusing and zooming in towards the direction of the military base engulfed in flames. Seen through the lens, undead roamed aimlessly while bizarre creatures intermittently crawled out of the pit. "...We seem to have stumbled upon something extraordinary. The speculations about Arrow Corporation conducting secretive experiments here might indeed be true. What are these creatures? Aliens? Zombies? Extraterrestrials? My God..." While the helicopter relayed this shocking footage to the people of Finland and the world, Jiang Chen stood on a hill, his concern for the situation inside the base evident. It was apparent that Carmen had put considerable effort into constructing this underground bunker. The tungsten-core rounds that had rained down from above had not completely destroyed it but merely collapsed the elevator shaft that accessed the underground bunker. Spores kept pouring out from the underground lab, now spreading beyond the confines of the base. Jiang Chen observed that the terrifying bacteria could mutate not only the animals that wandered into its range but also the vegetation rooted in the area. "Aisha." Jiang Chen called out. "Yes?" Aisha turned to face him, her striking chestnut hair waving in the wind. "I think... we might have stirred up a hornet's nest," Jiang Chen admitted with a bitter smile as he lowered his binoculars. "Stirred up a hornet's nest?" Aisha furrowed her brows in confusion, not grasping the meaning behind Jiang Chen's words. 'Hornet's nest'? What could that mean? Jiang Chen clarified, "It means we've caused a big problem that's likely to provoke a strong reaction." Just then, an unsettling premonition surged within him. Jiang Chen and Aisha simultaneously turned and aimed their guns toward the path ahead. "Come out, I'll count to three," Jiang Chen announced, his finger sliding off the safety catch. A figure, hands held high and dressed in arctic camo, emerged—a Russian. He spoke in thickly accented Chinese, "Don't be alarmed, I'm one of you." Recognizing the face, as lined with scars as it was with wrinkles, Jiang Chen holstered his gun, signaling Aisha to do the same. A wry smile appeared on his face. "I was close to pulling the trigger," Jiang Chen confessed. "I appreciate your restraint," Kutepov replied, lowering his hands and stepping closer, nodding towards the fiery installation below. "What's the situation down there?" "It's a complex situation. Better discussed when we return," Jiang Chen replied, shaking his head. "Then, shall we join forces?" Kutepov gestured towards the peak. "If you're not planning to return to the refugee camp, you could join us at the evacuation point. We've got a helicopter waiting." Returning to the refugee camp was out of the question for Jiang Chen. He had not only incited an uprising within the confines of another nation but had also left a significant mark on their map, to say nothing of the considerable mess left behind. Assuming the Finnish government was not blissfully ignorant, they would certainly be in an uproar. Without a moment's hesitation, Jiang Chen, accompanied by Aisha, took the 'convenient flight' offered by the Alpha Special Forces, retreating back to Russian territory. As if to confirm Jiang Chen's hunch, the Finnish Defence Forces were dispatched to Partak just as he crossed into Russian territory. With national security on the line, the Finnish authorities could no longer afford to be concerned with humanitarian crises. Tanks and armored vehicles forcefully entered the refugee camp, and fully armed soldiers quickly took control of the ammunition factory and warehouses, disarming the defeated insurgents. During the disarmament process, the Finnish Defence Forces encountered no resistance. In fact, Sami promptly surrendered his weapons and obediently boarded the prison truck, crouching in a corner, visibly shaken, incessantly invoking the name of the esteemed Iblis, begging for divine mercy. Many of the rioters who had narrowly escaped death bore the same look of terror. When questioned about the previous night's events, their fragmented responses repeatedly circled back to a few words—'Iblis,' 'demons,' 'monsters,' 'massacre'... The most absurd part of it all for the commanders was the insurgents' apparent eagerness to confess. In their desperation to leave this damned place, over a thousand claimed to have taken part in the execution of captives. Yet, the actual number of mercenaries executed that night was barely ten... "What in the world? Iblis? What sort of devilry is that?" Duwiao slammed the briefing onto the table, his gaze fixed on the map. "How are things at the military base?" "Our choppers have surveyed the site, but we can't make anything out. The entire base is shrouded in a sickly yellow fog. For fear of toxic exposure, our pilots didn't dare get too close," Duwiao's aide reported. "Send in the recon, and make sure they're suited up in protective gear," Duwiao instructed. Before he could finish his order, an officer entered the makeshift command tent, saluted, and handed Duwiao an envelope. "Sir, a directive from the Ministry of Defence." Duwiao's eyebrows lifted as he broke the seal. His frown deepened as he read, and upon finishing, he rubbed his temples and tossed the letter aside. "Cancel the mission. There's no need to send out the recon." The deputy looked at his superior in surprise, unsure of what had prompted such a sudden change of heart. Out of a sense of duty, he still prompted his superior, "Without confirming the base's situation, we can't devise a strategy or begin rescue operations." "There's no need for strategies or rescues. Thanks to the quick actions of our officials, the reporters got there first. They've confirmed it—there are no survivors," Duwiao said, tapping the envelope. "This is an order from the Ministry of Defence. We are prohibited from approaching within one kilometre of the incident site. Our only task now is to secure the perimeter, assist the police in evacuating the citizens of Partak, and relocate the refugees to two camps along the Norwegian border." After a pause, Duwiao frowned and looked outside the tent, muttering lowly, "Let those bureaucrats argue with Russia. If they think squabbling will solve everything." As he uttered these complaints, a government aircraft had already taken off from Helsinki International Airport, carrying the Finnish Minister of Defence and the Deputy President towards Murmansk—Russia's largest city on the Arctic Ocean coast. At the same time, the Russian Minister of Defence and the Director of the Russian Security Bureau were urgently en route to meet and discuss potential resolutions with their Finnish counterparts... (To be continued.) Chapter 1068: Only Star Ring Trade Can Save You The trouble with Harmonic Civilization lies in their advanced understanding of biology, which far outstrips the fledgling human civilization's imagination. While nations worldwide were busy exporting ideologies, they had already begun to spread something much more dangerous—their insidious genes. Their DNA code is to biology what a computer virus is to computing systems. Whether Carmen lives or dies is no longer Jiang Chen's pressing concern. Even if Carmen were still alive, it's likely he's barely clinging to life. The greatest concession the Harmonic Civilization could offer him is a small reserve territory, similar to the parcels of land once promised to the Native Americans by the United States, allowing him and a handful of natives to survive as 'specimens' of human civilization. Jiang Chen is relieved that the Commonwealth Society's influence is waning. If Carmen had made contact with Harmonic Civilization at the zenith of his power, it's conceivable that half of Europe would now be overrun, serving as a breeding ground for the Alien Species. But, if not for being driven into a corner by the Future Group, if the Golden Apples, once fervently sought after, hadn't become obsolete, would Carmen have ever resorted to such desperate measures? Jiang Chen is certain Carmen recognizes the danger of Harmonic Civilization, a civilization that seems to have invasion encoded in their very cells. In Murmansk, Russia's strategic stronghold on the Arctic Ocean coast and a mere ninety kilometers from the Russo-Finnish border, the situation is dire. Realizing the gravity of the crisis, the Finnish Minister of Defence, alongside the Vice President, made an urgent visit to Russia. The Finnish President had planned to personally attend, but diplomatic procedures and the need to stabilize the nation's internal affairs prevented him. Given the incident's closeness to the Russian border, a mishandling could even necessitate evacuating Murmansk. Russia took the incident seriously, with Sergei Shoigu, Russian Minister of Defence, and Bart, Director of the Russian Security Bureau, flying in from Moscow to meet the Finnish officials. Apart from the high-ranking officials of both nations, a foreigner with a unique status also participated in this meeting—or rather, a strategic briefing. Jiang Chen succinctly summarized the clandestine experiments by the Rothschild family, uncovered by Star Ring Trade, to the officials. He emphasized that the unapproved military operation in northern Finland was for the safety of both the nation and the world. This rationale effortlessly won the applause of the Russian officials, as it was a stance prearranged by Jiang Chen and Bart before the meeting. However, the Finnish officials were not so easily persuaded, and both the Vice President and Minister of Defence met the claims with skepticism. Seeing that he hadn't made the desired impact, Jiang Chen shifted to the meeting's focal point—the danger of the X2 Bacterium. 'At the heart of the military base, the source of infection we refer to as the 'Nest Core' can produce a distinct bacterium with properties akin to spores,' Jiang Chen elaborated. 'Our scientists have named it the X2 Bacterium. It's highly invasive and can easily infect organisms without antibodies, turning them into substrates for its reproduction. The infected will show heightened aggression and invasiveness, modifying their original DNA, leading to unusual enhancements. It's somewhat similar to what you'd see with Spider-Man or the Hulk.' 'So are you insinuating that soon, all Finnish citizens will become Spider-Men?' the Finnish Vice President asked, his tone laced with sarcasm. 'Ah... there's no need for immediate concern,' Jiang Chen clarified, circling an area on the satellite map and tapping the encircled pine woods with a marker. 'Do you see those withered pines? Those Alien Species... they can't leave the spore-affected area. Of course, we can't discount their potential to venture out in search of food or the possibility of the spores continuing to spread.' Jiang Chen omitted his deepest concern: the potential for an X2 adaptation or even an unknown X3 Bacterium. Biology excels at evolution, and after being defeated by his incendiary shells nearly four years ago, it's uncertain if Harmonic Civilization might have developed a new biological weapon. 'At present, only Star Ring Trade has the expertise to save you. Matters like these are best left to the professionals,' Bart, the Director of the Russian Security Bureau, emphasized. 'Wouldn't this disaster have been averted if it weren't for your actions!' At this, the Finnish Minister of Defence became infuriated, slamming the table as he exclaimed, 'Now you say only you can solve this—what reason do we have to believe you?' The Russian Security Bureau Director managed a strained smile, rubbing his brow and awkwardly looking away. Jiang Chen also felt somewhat awkward as he touched his nose and gave a light cough, 'To clarify, I am surely not responsible for today's situation, Carmen is. If you hadn't welcomed Arrow Corporation, leasing the northern wastelands for refugee camps, would we be in this predicament? Were you unaware of their research on your own soil, and don't you hold some accountability?' 'What would you do if we entrusted this to you?' the Finnish Vice President probed, his gaze fixed on Jiang Chen. 'Send in the Orbital Airborne Regiment,' Jiang Chen replied without hesitation. 'Aren't both of your Orbital Airborne Regiments currently deployed in Ukraine?' the Finnish Minister of Defence questioned, puzzled. 'In fact, we have another secret force that has been training for an extended period,' Jiang Chen disclosed, coughing gently. 'I had not planned to reveal this so soon, but urgency leaves me no choice.' As he spoke, he conveyed the notion of making a significant concession. The Finnish Vice President and Minister of Defence exchanged glances, their gaze moving between Jiang Chen and the Russian officials, finally settling on Sergei Shoigu, the Russian Minister of Defence. 'We regret to say we doubt your sincerity. We believe NATO is more capable of resolving the current issue—at least they would not violate airspace without notification. You were the first to break the rules of engagement, so do not blame us for this tough decision.' The issue of Finland's NATO membership has been debated since the Cold War yet remains undetermined. The upcoming parliamentary election is poised to set the NATO membership agenda, but the most significant hurdle is the public referendum, with Finnish citizens reluctant to abandon their neutral status. If NATO resolved Finland's crisis, even the challenging referendum might face little resistance. Finland joining NATO would mean Russia suddenly dealing with a new, armed defensive line spanning thousands of kilometers, with strategically important cities like Saint Petersburg and Murmansk just beyond. This scenario is Russia's greatest fear, one it wishes to avoid at all costs. 'Russia cannot accept NATO forces within Finland. You have other, better options,' Sergei Shoigu stood up, asserting, 'If you persist with the wrong decision, the situation will only deteriorate.' 'Is that a threat?' the Finnish Vice President countered coldly. 'That's a suggestion,' Bart intervened, aiming to moderate the tone. 'The Finnish people are confronting a life-threatening peril; nothing could be worse than the current situation. We appreciate your 'advice.' In fact, our President has already met with the NATO Secretary-General in Helsinki two hours ago. Goodbye.' With that, the Finnish officials stood and left. Sergei Shoigu attempted to keep them, but his expression remained frozen. 'Remember to use incendiary shells. They might be more effective against those creatures than bullets and pesticides combined,' Jiang Chen, unconcerned with the international dispute, advised. 'Moreover, if NATO does intervene, make sure they don't use 5.56mm ammunition. The keratinous armor of the Alien Species is naturally resistant to small-caliber rounds—deploying more soldiers would only result in more casualties.' 'And if you find yourselves at a loss, remember to call me.' The Finnish Vice President gestured dismissively, whether he heard Jiang Chen's advice or not, and exited with the Minister of Defence and their officials without looking back. (To be continued.) Chapter 1069: Bugs Do Evolve The conference room was eerily silent. Halfway through the agenda, Finnish officials from Partak Town had already made their exit. Sergei Shoigu, the Minister of Defence, caught between standing and sitting, exchanged a knowing glance with his secretary, who promptly came forward to tidy up the desk. The sounds of chairs moving and papers rustling filled the room as even the minister began to pack up, prompting the Russian officials to also gather their things and leave the long table. The meeting had ended prematurely, not even achieving half its intended goals. Jiang Chen, who had been analyzing the satellite map, tossed his marker aside and headed for the door. He had arrived with just one assistant and had little to pack up. On his way out, he dialed Aisha, asking her to book a warm dinner at the front desk. All he desired now was a hot meal; it had been a full twenty-four hours since his last proper meal. After being out all of last night and reaching Murmansk by helicopter with Kutepov, his first call was to the Hilton Hotel for a room reservation. Upon his return to the hotel, he collapsed into sleep without changing, until a call from Bart, the Director of the Russian Security Bureau, woke him for the meeting. It was now seven in the evening, and he had managed only a tube of fruit-flavored nutritional supplement before the meeting started—his stomach was protesting. As he stepped out of the government building, Bart called out to him. Without waiting for Jiang Chen to come over, Bart briskly approached, giving his shoulder a friendly pat and a broad smile. "How about dinner together? There's a fine restaurant nearby, and it's on me." "I've already reserved dinner at the Hilton Hotel; let me be the host," Jiang Chen responded, calling Aisha again to instruct the front desk to serve the dinner in a private dining room and to set an additional place. "Alright then," Bart agreed, seeing Jiang Chen's arrangements, and pulled out his car keys. "My car?" "That would be great," Jiang Chen replied with a smile. Unlike Sergei Shoigu, Bart drove himself due to his job's nature, in what appeared to be a Russian-made car unknown to Jiang Chen. Secured in the passenger seat, Jiang Chen fastened his seatbelt as the car roared to life and Bart's expression turned somber. "Comrade, you've brought us a serious problem." Jiang Chen gave him a sideways glance, slightly irked. "Why do you, like those from Partak Town, toss the blame onto me at the first sign of trouble? If your Alpha Squad had taken out Carmen, we wouldn't have all this mess! I heard it was just a 500-meter gap; you had the chance to eliminate him but chose to bomb an ammo depot instead?" Bart seemed taken aback, his brows knitting together. "Can one person really make that much difference?" Jiang Chen scoffed, leaning back to rest, "Give him a decade to develop, and he might transform the entirety of Russia just like that." "What do we do now?" Bart inquired. "We wait." "Wait?" "We'll wait for NATO to stumble there; they'll naturally remember us then," Jiang Chen chuckled softly. "You think NATO can't handle a few alien creatures?" Bart frowned. In his view, not even needing NATO's intervention, the Russian border guards could easily squish those extraterrestrial threats. Hearing such naïve words, Jiang Chen just laughed. "Just a few alien creatures?" Clutching the steering wheel, Bart fell into a reflective silence. Just as Jiang Chen almost dozed off, Bart ventured a question. "If I may ask, why are you so sure? I mean no offense... I'm simply curious; you seem very familiar with these situations? It was the same with the T-Virus, and now with this X2 Bacterium." Years of intelligence work had given Bart the sense that these two seemingly unrelated events were actually deeply connected. Jiang Chen's partially closed eye cracked open wider, giving Bart a longer look. Just as he was about to spin a convenient lie, he suddenly recalled the coveted Golden Apples that had leaked from the Rothschild-controlled facilities. It was those very Golden Apples that had forced a change in his plans. Perhaps it was time to open up? After pondering for a moment, Jiang Chen broke into a chuckle and said. "Yes, I am quite knowledgeable about these things, and I also know how Carmen got his hands on them. Want to know why?" "If it's not too much trouble." Though Bart seemed casual, Jiang Chen could clearly feel a deep interest in his tone. "Let's talk over dinner; we can take our time with the topic." Jiang Chen gave no answer but closed his eyes again, returning to his meditative state. With half an hour's drive to the Hilton Hotel still ahead, he needed to carefully consider how to articulate his story. Germany was in the throes of a revolution, too preoccupied to send support to their allies. The US aircraft carriers were too distant, and shifting them from the Mediterranean to the Baltic seemed unrealistic and would likely disturb the Russians' fragile sensibilities. The UK, having left the EU but not NATO, was the last to offer help. However, the British had clearly underestimated the danger of the 'Level Two Nest Core,' sending only a mechanized brigade, swiftly deployed to northern Finland via heavy-lift aircraft. Whether they heeded Jiang Chen's advice was unclear, but the Finnish government sent engineers to clear trees around the 'Infected Zone,' creating a fifty-meter-wide quarantine belt. Then the British Army unleashed twenty White Phosphorus Shells at the 'Nest Core,' aiming to sterilize the area before entering the Infected Zone. The outcome was unexpected; the White Phosphorus Shells did burst into brilliant sparks, but the flames quickly died in mid-air as if snuffed out. The charred spores soon rose from beneath the earth, replenishing what was lost. Upon realizing something was amiss, they extracted Spore Suspensions from the Infected Zone for the analysis and found that under high temperatures, these unicellular organisms rapidly consume themselves, secreting a unique High-Temperature Resistant Fluid that snuffs out flames by enveloping the burning material—cells with built-in fire extinguishers. Such a bewildering discovery left the biologists, brought in for the analysis of the Infected Zone's spores, stupefied. Even with their decades of experience, they could not fathom what was happening. Jiang Chen wasn't surprised by these developments. Bugs do evolve. If they have mastered the inconceivable feat of interstellar travel, extinguishing a mere fire is child's play by comparison. (To be continued.) Chapter 1070: Let the Experts Handle It! Attempts with white phosphorus shells and gasoline bombs proved futile; even flamethrowers were ineffective. Besides incendiary shells, the British had also tried various methods such as pesticides, insecticides, and even potent chemical weapons, which would be inhumane under normal circumstances, but there was no need for such considerations against a swarm of insects. Regrettably, the insects were utterly impervious to their chemical weapons; there was no reaction whatsoever. Furthermore, the UK had contemplated deploying larger-scale incendiary bombs, theoretically capable of drying out all the air in the Infected Zone at once, but the Finnish government disapproved. A larger-scale incendiary bomb would undoubtedly render the fifty-meter isolation strip useless, and if it accidentally sparked a forest fire, the damage would be catastrophic! This is the Arctic Circle, home to the pristine pine forests—living fossils. The Finns were already heartbroken over felling trees for the incendiary bombs. Moreover, the British couldn't guarantee that larger incendiary bombs wouldn't be 'frozen' by those bizarre spores. If they were prohibited from using them, so be it. It was an excellent opportunity to demonstrate their strength to their future allies and reassure them about joining NATO's ranks. The UK Ministry of Defence made a decision, and the dispatched commander didn't take it lightly, deploying two mechanized companies, totaling forty 'Ajax' armored fighting vehicles to lead the way, followed closely by over three hundred infantrymen in chemical protective suits. The battle plan was straightforward: eliminate all Alien Species within the Infected Zone within ten minutes, secure the entrance within twenty, then deploy Special Forces Rappelling into the underground bunker to eradicate the source of infection. The soldiers, donned in chemical suits, were oblivious to the mission's peril, jesting before the media that had the Nest Core appeared in London, the fire brigade might have handled it without their intervention. The emergence of the Nest Core drew global attention, and of course, the interview was broadcast live worldwide. In the same conference room as the day before, the satellite map on the large screen was replaced by a live interview from a Russian TV station reporter with the British forces poised for the mission in Partak. Initially, Jiang Chen had no desire to join the old Russians in watching the news, as he had a good idea of the eventual outcome. But since the Finnish Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoigu, had extended a personal invitation, Jiang Chen couldn't refuse without causing offense, so he attended. Honestly, watching a gathering of bigwigs quietly focused on the news felt quite peculiar. "Are you certain they can't handle it?" Sergei turned to Jiang Chen, asking incredulously, "I'm not gloating over the misfortune, but this is crucial for Russia's defense strategy. If the British succeed, it would mean an additional defense line of thousands of kilometers for us." "Just watch." Settling back in his chair, Jiang Chen glanced at the screen where the self-assured British soldier was featured and smirked. 'The London fire brigade?' Even if you enlisted every urban management officer from the Celestial Empire, Japanese high school students, and American vagrants, it would be to no avail! As the military convoy set out, the TV scene shifted, the reporter gave a close-up of the forty armored vehicles on their way, then the camera swiftly moved from the ground to the air. The helicopter kept a safe distance from the mechanized force, watching them enter the spore-enshrouded Infected Zone. Confident in their 'extermination' strategy, the British commander, with the Ministry of Defence's approval, exceptionally allowed some non-sensitive battle communications to be shared with reporters, to display NATO's combat prowess. As for the battle footage, due to military confidentiality, it wouldn't be disclosed. "This is the 12th Company, we've arrived at the target area, no anomalies detected so far." "Alien Species sighted. Safety off, open fire at will." The intense gunfire and the roars of the Alien Species lasted for two full minutes. The Russian officials before the screen, especially the Minister of Defence, gradually showed more interest. As military elites, the sounds alone told them that the British forces were likely in a grim situation. "...... We're engaged with the Alien Species! Their numbers are vast, but our firepower is superior—" "Damn it! They're so fast! F*ck! Infantry, fall back! I repeat, infantry, fall back! Charlis! You're insane, get your men out—zzz—" The communications were abruptly cut off, clearly, the British commander had realized that the unfolding events were no longer suitable for public broadcast. The only indicator left of the battle's ferocity for those in the conference room was the intermittent glow of gunfire amidst the murky fog on the screen. An eerie silence fell over the conference room as Russian military leaders exchanged bewildered looks. No one anticipated such a turn of events, no one imagined a mechanized brigade succumbing to a horde of mutant creatures... Except for one person. Jiang Chen. If they underestimated their anti-armor capabilities simply because they were insects, he was not surprised that the British suffered a setback. He was merely curious about how many armored vehicles could be safely withdrawn. As for the infantry, he didn't need to think about it; by now, they were likely reduced to gnawed bones. "There's been a slight mishap in the Nest Core clean-up. We will now broadcast a brief news update... "On the screen, the reporter, looking somewhat sheepish, announced. Now, even the footage was gone. Just then, Jiang Chen's wristwatch vibrated. "I need to step outside for a call." Murmuring to Sergei beside him, Jiang Chen rose and left the conference room. The call was from the Finnish Presidential Office. No need to ask how he knew; it was obvious. Stepping outside, Jiang Chen approached the window in the corridor, opened the holographic screen, and hit the answer button. The call connected, and the other side remained silent. After a brief, somewhat awkward pause, the person on the other end, somewhat reluctantly, broke the silence. "...... The British forces are retreating." It was as expected; regular armies are not mercenaries, and in times of peace, each life is precious. Now, with a battalion inexplicably lost in the Infected Zone and the entrance to the bunker unlocated, there was likely uproar back in Britain. "Oh." "The Americans want to observe for a while longer, but the spore coverage is expanding, now including the fifty-meter isolation strip," the President of Finland informed. Hearing this, Jiang Chen's expression was one of 'I knew it.' The British casualties provided the Nest Core with readily absorbable organic material, including human remains, which served as a better incubator for spores than wood or insects. With just a battalion's worth of force devoured, the Nest Core was already eager to expand its spore domain. This behavior was certainly in line with Carmen's modus operandi. With his suspicions confirmed, Jiang Chen's confidence in resolving this predicament increased. But at that moment, he refrained from speaking; the other end was clearly pleading. If he gave in too easily, it would be too lenient! He had initially intended to resolve this issue for free, but they had been reluctant. Now they were asking for help? Why the delay! "Hmm." Adjusting his tone, Jiang Chen spoke coolly. "Speak plainly if you have something to say." "Well... how about we leave it to you guys?" the President of Finland suggested, with a hint of desperation. Pretending to ponder, Jiang Chen paused before responding slowly. "The Infected Zone has grown substantially, and even the British mechanized brigade was at a loss. It seems quite challenging. Why not try carpet bombing? Although the spores can block combustion, it's hard to imagine they could also withstand high-explosive bombs, right?" "We've already attempted that, to no avail. The spores removed don't keep pace with their secretion, and the blasts have scattered them even further," the Finnish President explained with a wry laugh, "Let's cut to the chase. You're a businessman, so name your price." A sly smile crept across Jiang Chen's face as he responded genially. "300 million New Dollars." At the mention of this sum, the Finnish President's eyebrows twitched significantly. "...Could you consider a lower price?" The New Dollar was not cheap, and with the Euro recently devalued, it was unthinkable to allocate the entire annual budget of the Finnish Defence Forces. "If you can't afford the payment, we can consider another arrangement. For instance, you could sell Arrow Corporation's assets in Finland to us as a package. After such an event, we would only appraise their assets at 300 million New Dollars. Trust me, that's a very fair price, considerably higher than any bank's valuation," Jiang Chen stated, a hint of malice in his heart. Arrow Corporation, though a long-standing adversary, had mercenaries with no personal vendetta against him. Following this incident, Arrow Corporation would surely go bankrupt due to the Finnish government's hefty fine. Acquiring Arrow Corporation in Finland would mean inheriting over twenty thousand seasoned veterans—a significant boon for Star Ring Trade. Once integrated into their training camps and with improved benefits, these soldiers would soon be loyal to their new employer. If concerns arose about management, a complete overhaul was an option, while the rank-and-file could be vetted and absorbed, with surplus arms sold off to Africa. As for the two associated refugee camps, they could serve as leverage in negotiations with the European Union when used judiciously. Regarding the two accompanying military bases, Jiang Chen had substantial plans. The Finnish President, though reluctant, nodded in agreement. "Deal." Jiang Chen nodded, his smile cordial. "Pleasure doing business with you." "How soon can your team be here? If we're talking ten days or half a month, we might not be able to wait..." "It won't require that long," Jiang Chen glanced at the holographic screen for the time, "just give me five hours. And inform the British forces for me—tell them they can pack up and head home. Leave it to the experts." Chapter 1071: Nest Core A vast sinkhole, spanning several meters, dominated the military base's center. Deep beneath the chasm, some five hundred meters down, lay the Rothschild-crafted underground bunker, a structure wrought for experiments of the most clandestine nature. Now, this subterranean fortress was devoid of any vestige of human presence, swathed in sinister blood-red flesh bubbles emitting an arcane stench. Those who could suppress their revulsion and peer closer might see the flesh bubbles' surfaces teeming with dense clusters of pus blisters, each the size of a sesame seed. With each blister's rupture, a cloud of spore gas was unleashed. These myriad flesh bubbles tirelessly generated spores that ascended through the breach to the surface, contributing to the relentless territorial expansion of the Nest Core. At the underground research facility's heart, a fleshy colossus pulsed with bloated bubbles, its vast root-like system reminiscent of a prehistoric tree. This behemoth functioned as both the heart and 'central processor' of the Nest Core. Tentacles stretching from its foundation to its crest acted as conduits of communication, akin to data cables linking a mainframe to its peripherals. Embedded within its bowels was a coffin, or more fittingly, a 'cultivation chamber', sculpted from a resinous substance. In stark contrast to the flesh-red Nest Core, this obsidian chamber manifested a formidable solidity. Gazing through the semi-transparent membrane, one could barely discern a figure lying inside, their gaze locked on a series of digits displayed upon it. 【14731】 Four thousand were refugee recruits he had led into the abyss. Over three thousand stemmed from the personal guard brigade and the institute's researchers, while the largest share, seven thousand, was contributed by the mercenaries and rioters ensnared in the base's melee. The British had also recently augmented the tally by approximately six to seven hundred. Each soul yielded two units of organic matter, half of which he had already expended to fortify the Nest Core and spawn alien kin. "Insufficient," Carmen mused within the cultivation pod, contemplating whether his display of power had been too ostentatious. Had he not obliterated them so thoroughly, perhaps he could have seduced the British into a delusion of near victory, compelling them to send more fodder into this death trap, providing him with the additional organic matter required to augment his forces. But now, the British had adopted a stance of wariness. Apart from the relentless artillery barrages upon the area, they had refrained from further troop deployments. Evolving to a Level Two Nest Core demanded an astronomical five hundred thousand units of organic matter. There were two methods of garnering organic matter: the primal method of photosynthesis, a sluggish accumulation over time, and the far more rapacious and efficient method of continual consumption. By devouring the living and assimilating their essence, he could amplify his own existence. Carmen's preference naturally skewed towards the latter. If he were to rely solely on photosynthesis to extract organic matter from soil and air, it could take centuries before the Nest Core's dominion could shroud the entire globe. Yet, with unrelenting consumption, he could precipitate this evolutionary leap within a mere span of days. A venomous glint flitted across Carmen's visage at the thought. He had chosen this locus for the Nest Core precisely due to the adjacent refugee camp, teeming with nearly half a million souls. Had he devoured the denizens of the camp and Partak Town, he would have already transcended the first phase of evolution! A Level Two Nest Core would harness unspeakable power, extending the predation radius of the alien horde to a hundred kilometers and unlocking new 'troop types'. One such monstrosity, the Meat Mountain, was rumored capable of withstanding the onslaught of tank shells with its sheer girth. However, Jiang Chen's unforeseen intervention had thrown all his schemes into disarray. At this thought, Carmen clenched his teeth in vexation. Spores served as his eyes and ears; he could sense everything transpiring within the spore-enveloped domain. He was certain that he had 'seen' Jiang Chen that night within the military compound, and it was a pity he hadn't ensnared him. 【Alert, the host is still a considerable distance from the required five hundred thousand units of organic matter. It is recommended to upgrade troop types to ease through the initial phase.】 The thought, an advisory from the Nest Core, materialized directly in his consciousness. Communication through direct consciousness, forgoing the need for vocal cords, circumvented the barriers of language and expression, granting Carmen an unprecedented convenience. This was precisely why, after having witnessed the grandeur of a biological civilization through the Golden Apples, he held it in such high esteem. 【Upgrading troops? Your suggestion is prudent.】Carmen mentally concurred, closing his eyes to meld his consciousness with the Nest Core's nexus. A catalog of streamlined upgrade options materialized before him. After a meticulous selection, he allocated five thousand units of organic matter to fortify the 'Blade Warrior's' wings. Blade Warrior, the appellation he had ascribed to the mantis-like alien species. The augmented Blade Warriors would boast elongated, more potent wings, transcending their ancillary role in boosting leap strength, evolving into true wings capable of short flights. As Carmen allocated the organic matter, formless viscous fluids snaked through the ducts to the cluster of insect eggs before the Nest Core. Infused with the organic matter, the eggs began to mutate, as did the imminent new generation of 'Blade Warriors' ready to erupt from their confines. These eggs served as incubators for the alien species, a 'barracks' of sorts for him. At that moment, a severe tremor rattled the ceiling. With a slight lift of his eyelids, Carmen's lips curled into a cold smirk. The earth above the sanctuary had been reinforced by the Nest Core, with root fibers intricately woven, creating a 'bulletproof vest' layer half a kilometer thick, its resistance to explosions and seismic forces on par with steel-reinforced concrete. The British had hurled no less than a hundred shells at him, only managing to etch away a thin layer of concrete. It was solely because Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons had struck while the Nest Core was still nascent, before he had the chance to fortify the aperture... Abruptly, his expression darkened, and simultaneously, the Nest Core's consciousness broadcast an urgent alert within his mind. 【Warning, the protective layer has sustained impacts from external forces, causing fractures in structural tissues. Immediate use of organic matter for repairs is mandated, host.】 "Damn it! Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons!" Carmen cursed under his breath, now fully cognizant that he had underestimated the potency of Star Ring Trade's orbital arsenal. He had presumed the tungsten-core rounds would only inflict superficial damage to the Nest Core's protective carapace, but the harm was more severe than a mere superficial wound. The damage to the protective layer required a prompt infusion of organic matter for repairs, a significant setback given his already scant reserves. As the quantity of organic matter rapidly depleted, Carmen frantically rerouted it to the breaches. Then, a series of devastating fractures reverberated from above. Realizing the catastrophe that had unfolded, Carmen's features contorted in a visceral snarl. "Damn them!" (To be continued.) Chapter 1072: Overcoming with Force A formidable convoy of over forty armored vehicles entered the Infected Zone with an imposing presence, and just when everyone thought this would be a unilateral display of British might, the situation underwent a dramatic shift within a mere minute. No one knew how fierce the firefight within the Infected Zone was, but the entire world witnessed the outcome of the engagement. Of the forty armored vehicles, a mere five returned, and the entire infantry unit was lost. Colonel Moston, who commanded the operation, was unable to accept such a defeat at the hands of mere insect-like creatures. Not just him, the masses following the catastrophe on their smartphones were equally unable to accept this harsh reality. From Cagayan de Oro to Tokyo, the term 'Biohazard Crisis' repeatedly struck a nerve with people across the globe—a term once relegated to the realms of literature and film, now easily inciting global attention and panic. On social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Weibo, the discourse surrounding the X2 Bacterium reached a fever pitch. "Last time it was the T-Virus, this time the X2 Bacterium? God, have those capitalists lost their minds? Why would they create such things? Governments should legislate to ban such perilous research!" "Unbelievable, were those really British forces that went in? Are the UK's armored vehicles made of paper? Just a horde of alien creatures, why not just run them over? Could their teeth really bite through armor?" "End Times Survival Handbook, a decade's worth of survival tips from an apocalypse enthusiast, limited supply, act fast." "Deploy peacekeeping forces, this isn't a single nation's issue, it's a global crisis..." "I'm now curious, does every Arrow Corporation military base house such research institutes?" ... Colonel Moston, for the time being, was blind to the social media frenzy. He was now fretting over how to report this disastrous defeat to the Ministry of Defence and the Parliament. An entire mechanized battalion had been overrun without the slightest chance to retaliate! Good Lord, the Prime Minister had expected him to resolve this neatly and bring Finland into NATO's embrace. But now, with a ghostly pale face, he lacked even the courage to devise a battle plan, refusing to send more troops into the fray. Forget a brigade of mechanized forces; even an entire division might not suffice! The Finnish government, in desperation, half-threatened to seek a resolution from Star Ring Trade if they couldn't contain the Nest Core threat. Moston scoffed at Finland's stance, knowing this was not an issue of combat strength. If armored vehicles were being dissolved by acid, how could Star Ring Trade's mechanical exoskeletons fare any better? Better to let the scientists fully investigate the X2 Bacterium and determine what it really was. Moston had a hunch that if they could find a way to kill those Spore Suspensions, the alien creatures would eventually die out. "I admit we underestimated the Nest Core's might, and hastily sending troops into the Infected Zone was a mistake," Moston stated firmly to the media, "The scientific research team from London is already analyzing the DNA structure of these spores, and I believe it won't be long until they can design a method to neutralize the X2 Bacterium." The reporter probed further: "Colonel Moston, does this mean that the UK will abandon military aid to Finland?" "NATO will never abandon any cooperative partner, but this crisis extends beyond the capabilities of any single nation." "Good heavens... Look there! What is that?" As Colonel Moston was occupied with addressing the media, a cry of astonishment erupted from the crowd around him. A female journalist, looking skyward in amazement, pointed towards the Infected Zone. Cascades of 'fireballs' rained down from above. Despite the distance, the sonic booms as they pierced the sound barrier were distinctly audible. The cameras, which had been trained on Moston, now swiveled to capture the unfolding spectacle in the sky. In unison, a tremor that shook the earth to its core emanated from beneath everyone's feet, jolting not just their vision but also their very souls. Without a doubt, this marked the inaugural appearance of Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons before the lenses of the media. Moston was relieved to have the cameras off him; he knew all too well that his current expression was one of bewilderment. ... Farther off, a hundred kilometers away in the presidential suite of the Hilton Hotel in Murmansk, Jiang Chen lounged on the sofa with his legs crossed, overseeing the conflict between Star Ring Trade and the alien threat through a holographic screen, executing remote command over the battle. The space-based weaponry briefly cleared the Spore Suspensions shrouding the military base, and following the bombardment, Jiang Chen, utilizing a brief pause, observed the shattered terrain on the satellite map. "Hmm? It hasn't collapsed?" Gazing at the holographic screen, Jiang Chen expressed his surprise. Logically, even if the underground bunker extended over five hundred meters deep, it should not withstand the tungsten-core round's impact. These were tungsten-core rounds plummeting from a synchronous orbit; even if the entire five hundred meters were composed of reinforced concrete, by now it should have been reduced to rubble. The Nest Core was indeed an anomaly. Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed slightly as he issued orders to Ivan. "Continue the bombardment! If the first round is ineffective, initiate the second! Continue until their true form is unveiled!" The regenerative abilities of the alien creatures were formidable; minor wounds could heal at a visibly rapid pace with just a few breaths of air laced with spores. The British forces had executed multiple rounds of bombings on the military base, yet they had not truly killed many of the alien creatures. To humans, severed limbs might spell death, but to these organized alien creatures, it was a mere inconvenience, requiring only a brief respite in the Nest Core to recover. Even if they were obliterated on the spot, dragging the remains back would allow them to be recycled into organic matter and rebirthed into new alien creatures. Moreover, most of the alien creatures were concealed underground. Jiang Chen's strategy was straightforward and brute: a war of attrition, bombarding incessantly with space-based weapons! As long as the defense could be breached, if one blow did not vanquish them, another would follow, until the Nest Core displayed its true nature! These tungsten-core rounds were not targeted at the alien creatures from the outset, but at the obliteration of the underground bunker. All impacts were concentrated within a ten-meter diameter circle; even if the Nest Core's recuperative powers were as formidable as those of the alien creatures, Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons were not to be underestimated. For vertical penetration power, no nation on this planet could match their arsenal! Jiang Chen was unaware that his direct and forceful plan had Carmen, concealed underground, in a state of distress. First round, second round... One barrage after another of tungsten-core rounds descended from synchronous orbit. Jiang Chen was expending money, Carmen was consuming organic matter. Both parties were internally hemorrhaging, but obviously, Carmen, with limited resources, was the more pained. Soon, the Nest Core could withstand no more. How did Jiang Chen discern this? The satellite images made it clear. As the dust settled, the soil layer had been fully stripped away, unveiling the entangled roots beneath. Indisputably, these sturdy roots were the reason for the bunker's resilience, the soil fortified by them providing a defense akin to concrete. The Nest Core futilely expelled spore gas, attempting to mask its frailty, but Jiang Chen did not miss the opportunity, directing Ivan to capitalize on their advantage. The onslaught from synchronous orbit persisted, and when the Electromanta C-1, stationed in synchronous orbit, released its last tungsten-core round, the tentacles shielding the bunker above also fractured. With its defenses utterly disintegrated, the Nest Core laid bare the flesh bubbles hidden within the underground bunker. Upon witnessing this scene, Jiang Chen knew the moment had arrived, he immediately instructed Ivan. "The Nest Core has exposed its essence, cease the orbital weapon assault. Pass down my command, Third Powered Armor Brigade, commence the airborne operation!" "Affirmative!" Ivan answered with conviction. The relentless orbital barrage came to an end, fifteen arduous minutes having elapsed from its inception. The journalists, military personnel, and townsfolk stationed near Partak Town remained transfixed, their gazes locked at a forty-five-degree angle, captivated by the clear expanse above. Colonel Moston's mouth opened and closed in silence, wordless. The Finnish Minister of Defence at his side wore a grim expression, filled with regret for not having enlisted Star Ring Trade's intervention from the beginning. As for the reporters, their minds were already racing, contemplating the prose to accompany their accounts of this apocalyptic 'airstrike'. No one had quite recovered from their astonishment. Just when all believed the spectacle had reached its conclusion, a series of luminescent trails began to descend from the serene sky towards the earth... (To be continued.) Chapter 1073: Steel and Blood For the onlookers standing in front of Partak Town, it was merely a moment before the thunderous clash of steel and earth echoed from several kilometers away. The executives of YLE hastily gestured to their reporters, and soon the broadcasting helicopter was airborne again, heading toward the military base. Not just the media, but the British and Finnish Defence Forces were intrigued by Star Ring Trade's Orbital Airborne Regiment, dispatching two helicopters. Officially, they were to support Star Ring Trade if needed, but their true intentions were clear to all. Jiang Chen, observing via satellite, saw Finland's and the UK's maneuvers but remained unfazed. With the deployment of the powered armors, secrecy was no longer his concern. The 'Micro Regiment'—merely two hundred strong—had been under development for two years. Kept hidden due to the lack of formidable adversaries and to avoid an arms race impacting his economic strategies, the time to unveil them was now, as past concerns were rendered moot. As for the reasons, they would be disclosed post-conflict. The descent of fifty drop pods was swift; dust from the blasts had barely settled when two hundred fully-armed T3 Powered Armors, wielding Tactical Rifles, burst from the pods onto the spore-infested battlefield, advancing towards the Breach Point gouged by orbital weaponry. Sensing the intrusion, the Nest emitted a harrowing shriek, and 'Blade Warriors' with quivering wings soared from the abyss. During the bombardment, these aliens had sheltered underground, but now, drawn by the scent of life, their predatory instincts were unleashed, eager to rip apart their prey with razor-sharp Claws. But their predation was thwarted; these foes were unlike any they had faced before. 'Roar—!' A Blade Warrior lunged. Its curved legs sprung, and strengthened wings propelled it forward, serrated scythes aiming to cleave the nearest powered armor. Such force could rend steel, yet in a flash, an invisible Shield unfolded from the armor's arm. The Blade Warrior collided with the Shield, its assault futile, its keratin blades shattered. Its Shuttle-shaped Beak emitted a piercing scream. Retreating, the Blade Warrior raised its arms defensively, but the powered armor, with a Shield bash, broke through, and with a Tactical Dagger, pierced and eviscerated the alien. The encounter was over in an instant. Carmen, within the Hibernation Pod, was dumbfounded. He had never seen such formidable technology; it reminded him of rumors about the Koro Island Iron Man. After the Los Angeles Assault Incident, there were whispers of Star Ring Trade's 'Iron Battle Suit.' Some even speculated that Jiang Chen was the 'Iron Man' seen in Koro City, bearing a resemblance to the Heir of Stark Industries. Carmen, sweating, had not dismissed the rumors but never envisioned that Jiang Chen had not only crafted an 'Iron Battle Suit' for himself but had also equipped an entire military force with such costly gear! Amidst his astonishment, he had no alternative but to act. Though small, this force was Star Ring Trade's elite, and elites were few. If he could survive this initial phase, the entire forest would succumb to his Nest Consciousness. To strike at Star Ring Trade, even at the cost of flooding them with a swarm, he had to anchor this trump card here! Even at a great cost. Resolute, Carmen gritted his teeth, connecting his consciousness with that of the Nest. At that moment, the Nest's blood-red vessels pulsated like burrowing rodents, the shadowed flesh bubbles swelled tumultuously, and sesame-sized pus blisters grew to the size of green beans before bursting, releasing spores laden with Rage Factors. Every dark green eye turned blood-red in an instant. 'Roar—!' The roar became savage as all Blade Warriors frenzied, swarming the two hundred powered armors. Yet, before they could close in, they met the barrage of the fire net. Jiang Chen had tailored this batch of T3 Powered Armors for the Current World, featuring functional subdivisions to fit modern combat. The right arms, once uniform rotary machine guns, now bore modular attachments like Grenade Launchers, Expandable Shields, and Plasma Cutting Daggers, as dictated by battlefield requirements. The front powered armors kneeled, hoisting man-high Shields, their right arms emanating a faint bluish glow. The rear echelons raised their Triangular Barrels, unleashing a torrent of firepower. And behind, Powered Armors with anchored feet and 72mm Anti-Vehicle Cannons, ripped through the alien formation with High-Explosive Shells. Firepower alone made this two-hundred-strong unit more formidable than the British mechanized battalion—twice over. Considering mobility and defense, Jiang Chen could confidently claim they could overpower a NATO Infantry Division, airstrike support aside. The front Blade Warriors were decimated by the fire net; those reaching close quarters were bisected by Plasma Cutting Daggers protruding from behind Shields. The Keratinous Armor, impervious to bullets, was no match for the intense heat of Plasma Jets. Green blood and acidic spatter painted the battlefield. Carmen, hell-bent on a standoff with Star Ring Trade, wouldn't retreat. Pushing the Nest's incubation and digestion to the limit, he spared no resource, converting all organic matter into Blade Warriors and Spitters, and sent them to the front. The swarm's only advantage was its disregard for death. Under the Nest Consciousness, even the last alien would plunge into gunfire without a second thought. As the battle raged, the gap narrowed, shifting from suppression to close-quarter melee. Even the mighty armors began to falter, casualties emerging amidst the fray. Seeing this, a glimmer of triumph flickered across Carmen's face, confident that Star Ring Trade would falter first! With that, he pushed all his resources forward. But at that moment, his elation turned to despair, as his face grew pale with hopelessness. Through a Blade Warrior's eyes, he saw a series of flashes in the sky. Star Ring Trade's second air drop commenced. This time, it was Drone Hives, not soldiers. Before the drop, the powered armors engaging the aliens retreated orderly, maintaining fire, and leaving ample space for those emerging from the pit. As they reached the military base's edge, Drone Hives landed behind the alien horde. From these hives, thousands of drones swarmed towards the wound inflicted by the orbital weapons on the Nest. Too late to react, Carmen was helpless. The underground aliens, mostly on the surface, left only newly hatched ones in the bunker. Despite their numbers, they couldn't stop the drones that ignored their attacks and targeted the bursting insect eggs. Carmen's face turned a desperate green. 'Fuck!' One hundred kilometers away, Jiang Chen bolted upright on the sofa, his fist thundering down on the coffee table. 'Detonate!' Chapter 1074: A Swift End As the unmanned drones closed in on the insect eggs, they detonated abruptly, shrouding the surging eggs in a blaze and obliterating them in an instant. Mixtures of crimson and dark green plasma splattered from the ruptured flesh bubbles, the heat charring both blood and flesh. Part of this blood belonged to the Nest Core, and the rest to the Alien Species embryos, not yet fully formed. Carmen, ensconced in the cultivation chamber, felt a chill from head to toe... If he were still capable of feeling cold. A profound sense of defeat washed over him. The situation resembled a gamer's high from a winning streak, suddenly quashed by the enemy bombing their barracks. [Warning, extensive damage to the Incubation Section. Host, immediate repairs required.] The consciousness of the Nest echoed in his mind. Carmen hastily checked the reserves of organic matter. The sight of the glaring triple-digit number drained the last vestiges of color from his face. He had just allocated all his resources to the insect eggs, to hatch the Blade Warriors. But now, following the drones' kamikaze attack, his stock of organic matter had been severely depleted. Digesting the remnants on the ground was possible, yet converting them into organic matter would take time, dependent on the form of carbon present and the efficiency of the spores' photosynthesis. Exactly how long it would take was unclear to Carmen, but it would certainly be several hours. And would Star Ring Trade afford him this time? The breeding pace halted, the Alien Species' assault lost momentum. The Powered Armor Brigade, having secured their position, launched a counterattack on command, targeting the weakened aliens! Here, Spitters were shredded by the fire net, there, Blade Warriors were gutted by plasma cutting daggers, their corrosive dark green blood washing away the paint from the Powered Armor. Thousands of Alien Species might seem numerous, but with no reinforcements, their annihilation became inevitable. The confrontation between flesh and steel, the Harmonic Civilization's first clash with a pure civilization, concluded as the smoke settled. The dust cleared to reveal no more aliens emerging from the pit. At the forefront, a Powered Armor knelt, retracted its shield, and slowly rose from the ground. "Damn, is it over?" "It looks to be over at last..." A fellow soldier, covered in slime, responded with a heavy voice. As the battle subsided, no one removed their masks. The air was still thick with high-density spore clusters, dangerous even for those inoculated with the genetic serum. Some stood awaiting orders; others sat among the alien corpses, undisturbed by the revulsion. There were no cheers, only a collective sigh of relief. Forty T3 Powered Armors were scrapped, over thirty lives lost — a heavy toll for the nascent brigade, yet the spoils were of epic proportions. Nearly ten thousand Alien Species lay defeated by their fire net. It's fair to say, even an entire NATO division might not have achieved such a victory — perhaps even bolstering the enemy ranks instead. The Brigade Commander surveyed his troops, "Alright, gentlemen, our mission is not yet complete. Let's descend and eradicate this vermin. Let me check..." He tapped on his arm's control panel, piloting a reconnaissance drone into the depths. Before the aliens destroyed it, he saw the situation below, "About thirty remain. Who's still got the strength for one last push?" A soldier rose, steadying his rifle, "I'm in, I can still move." "I'm with you." Selecting eleven more, the Brigade Commander led them to the pit's edge, their vortex engines flaring as they dove. Twelve Powered Armors touched down, and hiding Blade Warriors lunged, poised for a final struggle. The Commander, unfazed, grasped an alien by the neck, calmly shooting it in the head before discarding the limp form. The rest, too distant to pounce, were promptly riddled by the soldiers' fire. Stepping past the corpses, they approached the Nest Core. Before them lay the remnants of the eggs and a mixture of dark green and crimson fluids. "Damn, this is vile." "The quicker we finish here, the sooner we go up." Sappers distributed thermite agents, instructing, "Insert the red end deep inside." While spores could snuff out flames, the Nest lacked this ability. By stuffing the incendiaries deep into the Nest Core, the burning would remain unaffected by the spore gas. Carmen watched the Star Ring Trade soldiers with growing panic. As thermite agents were secured to the Nest, his eyes reddened with rage, "No——!" The nearest soldier glanced at Carmen, smirked behind his mask, and thrust the thermite deep into the Nest's heart. Brilliant flames burst from the cracks, the Nest Core disintegrating rapidly under the intense heat. As he watched, Carmen felt his heart being torn apart. For this Nest, he had sacrificed his researchers, his loyal guards, his closest allies. Yet now, right before his eyes, it was being destroyed by Star Ring Trade. Hatred, fury, fear... A torrent of negative emotions twisted his face grotesquely. At that moment, the Brigade Commander approached, tapping the resin coffin and signaling to Carmen. He drew a Future Phone, unfolded it, and pressed it against the chamber's membrane. "We meet again." From the presidential suite at the Hilton Hotel, Jiang Chen regarded the figure in the chamber, "I never imagined our reunion would be this ironic." Carmen glared at Jiang Chen on the screen, "Are you here to mock me?" "Yes and no." Jiang Chen shook his head, pity in his tone as he observed the grotesque figure, "I'm simply wondering what brought my adversary to this state." Carmen remained silent, consumed by hatred. Jiang Chen noticed the black sphere overhead. "Golden Apples?" he mused, recalling the Rothschild family's susceptibility to Klein Particle Waves, an innate sensitivity to the cosmos's random waves. Carmen, already predisposed to Klein Particle sensitivity, was obsessed with the Golden Apples, akin to placing a magnet atop a television — it was bound to cause distortion. He had lost his sanity. Realizing this, Jiang Chen's interest waned. The conversation he intended to have with Carmen seemed pointless now. With a sigh, he cut the communication and instructed the Commander, "Make it quick for him." "Affirmative." The dark muzzle pressed against the chamber's membrane, Carmen watching dully as the gun pointed at his head. Bang——! The gunshot echoed, his consciousness plunging into the abyss without a sound. (To be continued.) Chapter 1075: The Pentagon's Worries Observers of this battle were not limited to the British and Finns present at the scene; the United States, across the Atlantic, was also closely monitoring the developments in Finland. When Star Ring Trade deployed their space-based weapons, a somber mood took over everyone. Later, as the Powered Armor Brigade and unmanned aerial vehicle airdrop tactics were introduced, the atmosphere inside the Pentagon's conference room turned icy. The footage captured by the British might have been blurry, but those watching through the screens could still sense the terror of the alien species flooding in like a tide and the formidable strength of the Powered Armor that resisted the alien onslaught. If K1 Type Exoskeletons were likened to bicycles, then Powered Armors would undoubtedly be the motorcycles. They not only provide soldiers with highly mobile armor but also serve as a pivot for firepower output, elevating the individual combat power of the soldiers to the extreme. From the standpoint of humanity, what the US Secretary of Defense least wanted to see at this moment was Star Ring Trade ultimately defeating the Alien Species. Ideally, as per a typical Hollywood script, both the British and the New Federal Reserve forces would fall to the aliens, and in the end, the US Marine Corps would emerge as the savior, waging a war to save all of mankind. The Secretary of Defense inwardly prayed for the swarm to overwhelm these two hundred 'humanoid armored vehicles,' but reality did not conform to his wishes. The moment the drone swarm penetrated the alien nest, the defeat of the Alien Species was sealed. When the last Blade Warrior had its head cleaved off by a Plasma Cutting Dagger, silence befell the meeting room. 'These hypocrites, they go back on their word! They clearly said there were only two Orbital Airborne Regiments; now how come there's another one?' a high-ranking Pentagon official couldn't help but curse as he broke the silence. Secretary Ashton Carter glanced at the officer and shook his head. Believing others who claimed there were only two Orbital Airborne Regiments was naive. There are plenty of undisclosed equipment in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and failing to get the news in advance can only be blamed on inadequate intelligence work. Nevertheless, it was an unavoidable situation; the counterintelligence capabilities of Ghost agents were just too formidable. The CIA had long attempted to infiltrate Star Ring Trade to steal space elevator technology, but all agents sent to the New Federal Reserve returned empty-handed, with some who overstepped disappearing altogether. At this moment, comrade Hillary, better known as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, spoke up. 'More than the Orbital Airborne Regiments and Powered Armor Brigade, I'm concerned about their space-based weapons. If they can deliver dozens of tons of tungsten-core rounds above our heads whenever they wish, it poses a grave threat to the national security of the United States,' she declared. Those present nodded in agreement. The Outer Space Treaty of 1966, which prohibits weaponization and militarization of outer space, was brought up, but in practice, securing absolute air superiority and a strategic vantage point for national security has long been a shared strategic goal among the major powers. Strictly adhering to the treaty would mean the non-existence of all high-orbit missiles—which is, of course, unrealistic. After a glance at those present, the CIA Director coughed lightly and spoke, 'Regarding their space-based weapons, we managed to acquire some tungsten-core rounds from Ukraine. CIA technicians have analyzed them and concluded that the technology involved is not complex; it's essentially a tungsten alloy sphere, roughly the size of a watermelon, with a guidance component akin to a gyroscope at its core.' 'Replicating their weapons is easy,' he continued, pausing with a trace of helplessness on his face, 'The real challenge is how to transport these tungsten spheres to synchronous orbit.' Without an economical way to deliver these spheres to synchronous orbit, the development of space-based weapons would be meaningless. 'Exactly,' the White House Military Advisor commented with a wry smile, 'Using rockets to send these things to synchronous orbit before dropping them back down is entirely redundant. The danger with Star Ring Trade lies in the absence of a binding international convention that limits the scale of private armaments. Without a way to intervene as they continue to expand, we are at a disadvantage.' Hillary tapped the armrest of her chair, pondering, 'What if we push for an international convention now?' 'We might end up the biggest losers,' the Secretary of Defense Carter admitted with difficulty, 'As you know, a significant portion of our annual defense budget goes to military contractors. They have, in no small terms, become an integral part of the US Army.' With Hillary included, the high-ranking officials from both the Department of Defense and the White House fell silent. Wall Street would be the first to oppose any action against private military contractors. Tampering with the military-industrial complex meant tampering with the wallets of all American consortia. Infamous private military contractors such as Blackwater, Triple Canopy, and Deyang International all have deep ties with Wall Street capital. With the 2020 Elections on the horizon, staying in position means winning the public's favor without excessively offending the American consortia. With Goldman Sachs recently collapsed, WASP consortia like Morgan Stanley and First Boston now dominate the North American financial sphere. No one wants to provoke those capital giants at this juncture. What's to be done? Hillary's brows furrowed as she pondered... The war was over, and under Jiang Chen's directive, the Powered Armor Brigade, having destroyed the Nest Core, took control of the military base. Seeing the outcome decided, the Brigade Commander of the British Mechanized Brigade approached the military base's entrance, requesting permission from Star Ring Trade to enter the premises. His reasons seemed sound, such as 'recovering the bodies of fallen soldiers' and 'removing the wreckage of the scrapped armored vehicles,' yet Star Ring Trade flatly refused. The reason for the refusal was straightforward: there were no bodies left to recover. The Alien Species devoured captured life forms for their flesh and blood immediately, using them as high-quality sustenance and incubators for spawning spores within the Nest. Star Ring Trade only promised that if any dog tags with English letters were found, they'd be sent to the British forces. Such excuses were far from sufficient for the British. Recovering bodies was secondary; most likely, not even the bones remained. Their true intent was to closely observe Star Ring Trade's Powered Armor and gather as much intelligence on this new equipment as possible. Besides this factor, their chief concern was the potential appropriation of the X2 Bacterium by Star Ring Trade. The impression left by the merciless Alien Species was profound, and the thought of them being used for military purposes was a chilling prospect. The best way to overcome fear is to possess a piece for oneself, much like with nuclear weapons. Brigadier Moston resolved that once they entered the military base, they had no intention of leaving. Star Ring Trade likely didn't have the audacity to confront the British directly. Once London's Scientific Research Team arrived, they were determined to understand the Nest's formation mechanism. Even if it wasn't for military use, they intended to archive a sample within their own national repository, ready for unforeseen needs. However, Star Ring Trade refused without courtesy, declaring the entire military base as private property. Even Finnish officials' attempts at mediation were futile. When Finland's President requested military assistance from Star Ring Trade, they had already sold the nationalized assets of Arrow Corporation at a discounted rate of 300 million New Dollars to Star Ring Trade. By law, the treaty between Arrow Corporation and the Finnish government now extended to Jiang Chen. For instance, this military base now belonged to the private assets of Star Ring Trade and was protected by Finnish legislation. The Brigade Commander of the Powered Armor Brigade had no plans for dialogue with Moston, and the two soldiers at the gate turned him away. Despite Moston's deep reluctance, he had no choice but to return to the military camp near Partak Town, report the situation to his superiors, and await the Ministry of Defence's decision. (To be continued.) Chapter 1076: Right Beside Us The great battle had subsided, and by dawn, a light snow began to fall. In late May, the Northern Hemisphere was on the cusp of summer, but the permafrost of northern Finland remained unaffected. Within the Arctic Circle, locals could still spot snow well into mid-June, should the Arctic Ocean monsoon pass through. At present, the military base near Partak Town flew the flag of Star Ring Trade high. The base, having undergone multiple bombardments, bore no intact structures. Following an agreement with Finnish authorities, logistical support was channeled through Russia by Star Ring Trade. Logistics personnel and a scientific research team who flew into Murmansk set up camp with marching tents outside the military base. Contrary to the X2 Bacterium Jiang Chen had previously encountered, these modified strains proved exceptionally tenacious, capable of surviving independently for extended periods in the absence of a Nest Core. As such, the decision was made to eradicate them, as their continued existence posed significant risk. Without inoculation from a genetic serum, the inhalation of a sufficient concentration of spore gas would trigger a 'zombification' response in any organism, especially in primates, seemingly due to their advanced brains making them more susceptible to these noxious bacteria. Upon the arrival of the logistics team, Jiang Chen's initial order was clear: annihilate the airborne spores and eradicate all infection sources. While an agent to kill the spores hadn't been identified, not all solutions necessitated technological intervention. The spores could quench flames, but since they sacrificed themselves to do so, and with no Nest Core to produce more, their pyrophilic trait would ultimately hasten their extinction. A simple flamethrower could yield unexpectedly effective results. The base remained enveloped in spores, with only those in powered armors and logistics personnel donned in orange chemical protective suits staying behind. Alien carcasses were amassed a kilometer from the base, drenched in gasoline and incinerated. The dark smoke that began the previous day persisted into the morning, visible from Partak Town miles away. In the command barracks adjacent to the base, Brigade Commander Moston, free from his powered armor and clad in a heavy cold-weather outfit, stood before his command table processing reports. '...Columbia TV from America has requested access to the base to film the underground bunker and remnants of the Nest Core.' 'Direct them to Star Ring Trade for authorization. We're soldiers, not gatekeepers,' Moston replied, his patience wearing thin. This was the fifth media outlet to approach the military camp, as global attention zeroed in on this base, eager to learn of Star Ring Trade's next move. 'Additionally, we've been contacted by Finnish Presidential Office officials this morning. The President seeks dialogue regarding the disposal of alien bodies, urging us to consider an eco-friendlier alternative to mass burning.' Upon hearing the update, Moston raised an eyebrow. 'Then communicate our stance: they either accept our method or find their own solution for these contagions. Should they require, we're willing to transport them to nearby warehouses at no cost.' 'Understood, sir.' The non-commissioned officer saluted crisply before exiting the barracks. Moston settled back, attempting a brief respite, but before he could relax, another officer hastened into the barracks, abruptly awakening him with a succinct six-word report that surprisingly didn't incite Moston's ire despite the interruption. 'Report! The boss is coming.' ... Around noon, a helicopter crested the mountains, descending gracefully onto the base's helipad. Jiang Chen, encased in a chemical suit and gas mask, disembarked. Though unaffected without the gear, the dense spore concentration suggested a more subdued approach was prudent. He was followed by Bart, the Director of the Russian Security Bureau, who was equally garbed in protective gear, surveying the chaotic aftermath of the base. Aisha had intended to accompany them, but with the stay in Finland lasting no more than two days, Jiang Chen had her return to Koro Island. Moston, in his powered armor, saluted Jiang Chen, who acknowledged the gesture. 'Your efforts are commendable.' 'It’s our duty!' Moston smiled. 'What's the status underground?' inquired Jiang Chen. 'Nest Core is confirmed deceased, no living aliens remain. The logistics team continues to purge the X2 Bacteria, while researchers from Koro Island are sampling the Nest Remains,' Moston reported. 'Lead us there.' 'Yes, sir!' Moston saluted. Following Moston, Jiang Chen and Bart approached the gaping pit at the base's core, once the entrance to the underground bunker. Star Ring Trade's tungsten-core rounds had collapsed it days prior. The logistics team, in support, had installed a makeshift elevator at the site. Descending to the bunker's entrance, five hundred meters below, they arrived at the heart of the Nest Core. 'This is the interior of the Nest Core? Those flesh bubbles on the walls are quite revolting,' Bart commented, eyeing the wall's residue with disgust. 'Consider it as such. Before the core's destruction, the Nest Core had transformed the entire bunker into its own habitat,' Jiang Chen clarified. Nearby, researchers were busy examining the insect egg remnants, their unprecedented DNA codes and existence challenging the scholars' very understanding of biology. Their dedication was palpable, as they immersed themselves in the study of these valuable specimens, a treasure trove for human civilization. While Jiang Chen had only glimpsed the Harmonic Civilization, his knowledge of them was almost non-existent. He harbored no illusions of discovering their vulnerabilities from the Nest Remains, yet it remained the sole method Earth's civilization had to glean insight into them. Despite the protective suits, Jiang Chen's identity remained unrecognized. After Moston received salutes from the guards, they allowed passage. In Moston's company, the two discreetly stood beside what was left of the Nest Core. Bart surveyed the miserable remains and through the damaged membrane of the resin 'coffin,' recognized a familiar face. 'Carmen Rothschild?' 'Indeed.' 'You actually did it—you killed him.' Bart mused, 'In my opinion, the International Court would have been the ideal destination for him.' 'Keeping him would have been a liability,' Jiang Chen said nonchalantly. He didn't know how much the Harmonic Civilization had revealed to Carmen. If they had disclosed his time-traveling abilities, it would pose a significant problem. The Rothschild family had generated countless Golden Apples, a lurking danger to him and to human civilization. Now, he was here to eradicate that menace! Jiang Chen signaled Moston, then pointed to the head section of the resin coffin. Moston got the hint, extracted a tactical dagger, and sliced through the resin to retrieve a black orb from within. As Bart caught sight of the sphere, his expression turned subtle. 'The Golden Apple,' Jiang Chen announced, receiving the sphere from Moston and assessing its heft, 'we once believed it to be a conduit to the future, but that's far from the truth.' 'It does facilitate communication, but its true essence lies in indoctrination—covertly infecting its holders, transforming them into minions. Whether Tanaka of the past or Carmen of the present, they're fundamentally similar.' Jiang Chen feigned distaste as he flipped the Golden Apple back to Moston, indicating it should be reinserted. Though Bart's countenance was obscured by his suit, Jiang Chen's seasoned instincts suggested his objective was likely achieved. With the German revolution nearing triumph and Russia probably having secured numerous Golden Apples from the insurgents, they might well unearth significant findings should they persist with their experiments. Before they deciphered the Golden Apple's utility, Jiang Chen needed to implant a seed of dread about these devices. 'The most alarming fact is, the civilization that the Golden Apples connect to isn't from the future.' Pausing, Jiang Chen cast a meaningful glance at Bart. 'Rather, it's right beside us.' (To be continued.) Chapter 1077: A Recruitment Ad that Packs a Punch Before the Munich Incident, Carmen had consolidated control over the Rothschild family's power by a series of maneuvers. Following the orchestration of his brother James's demise with the help of Star Ring Trade during the Pearson Church Massacre, he had essentially become the sole authority within the family. Consequently, with his death, the Rothschild dynasty teetered on the verge of collapse. Jiang Chen anticipated that, once the revolution in Germany prevailed with the Christian Democratic Union supplanting the New Choice Party, the first action would likely be settling the Commonwealth Society's accounts for crimes committed during their governance. It was foreseeable that the Rothschilds' assets, among others, would be auctioned off to satisfy the exorbitant fines imposed by the courts. The Rothschilds were poised to dwindle in the ensuing asset division frenzy, even if Jiang Chen remained passive. Their excessive wealth had indeed rendered them excessively vulnerable. Jiang Chen harbored no concerns about their swift decline. However, he was apprehensive about the destiny of the Golden Apples, previously under Rothschild dominion. With Carmen's demise, these Golden Apples would undoubtedly disseminate. It wasn't just Russia; Jiang Chen was convinced that nations like the United States, United Kingdom, France, and even China, on the opposite side of the globe, would covet these artifacts. Various powers would surely vie to secure them for study. The Harmonic Civilization had already infiltrated the communication channels of the Golden Apples. If global leaders failed to recognize the inherent danger, it was uncertain where the next Nest Core might manifest. Aboard the flight returning to Moscow, Bart ruminated on his dialogue with Jiang Chen in the underground bunker and the revelations within the Nest Core... "...Are you suggesting this is the work of the extraterrestrial civilization you mentioned?" Bart still struggled to accept the reality Jiang Chen had presented, his brows knitted in disbelief as he gazed upon Carmen in the resin coffin, "And the Golden Apples are merely a brainwashing tool?" "Precisely," Jiang Chen affirmed with a nod. "That's hard to believe." "It does sound like an April Fool's joke, but that's the stark reality. On June 15th, at the Outer Space Security Summit in Koro City, we will disclose all evidence we've accumulated on extraterrestrial civilizations through our space endeavors. I've shared everything I know with you candidly. Whether you take this to heart is your prerogative." Overwhelmed by the enormity of information, Bart was momentarily stunned. An extraterrestrial civilization? Was this some sort of jest? Even though Jiang Chen had hinted at this during their previous encounter in Murmansk, Bart's skepticism persisted. The notion that the Golden Apples—a prize the Russian Security Bureau had painstakingly obtained—were part of an alien scheme to invade Earth was inconceivable. It was difficult to accept that a scenario fit for a Hollywood epic could unfold before his very eyes. Yet, recalling the grave expression on Jiang Chen's face, Bart's skepticism began to waver. If the Golden Apples indeed possessed the ability to covertly transform their holders into pawns of an extraterrestrial force, they were undeniably dangerous. It was impossible to identify the brainwashed, nor would such individuals willingly come forward. If an unsuspecting brainwashed individual were to construct a Nest Core within Russia... A chill ran down Bart's spine at the thought. Reflecting on the Golden Apples' journey from the Rebels to the Russian Security Bureau and the numerous hands they had passed through, Bart recognized the gravity of the situation and made a decision. At the very least, he would wait until June 15th to assess the evidence Star Ring Trade would present. Until then, he resolved to seal the Golden Apples away, barring anyone from further access. Should they prove as hazardous as Jiang Chen claimed, it would not be too late to destroy them then... Through the lens of YLE, the Finnish national broadcaster, Star Ring Trade's orbital weapons and the formidable powered armor suits became known to every corner of the globe. The populace, once disheartened by the British military's defeat, were reinvigorated by the decisive victory of two hundred against ten thousand. The vile Alien Species, falling one by one before the stalwart steel armors, their dark green blood splattered amidst bursts of orange-yellow munitions, culminated in a climactic melee that set viewers' blood racing. "Absolutely epic, are those two hundred Gundams? Or two hundred Iron Men? I just want to know if joining Star Ring Trade means I can wear that gear. If so, I'm signing up for the Foreign Legion on their site right now." "@RobertDowneyJr, what's your take?" "That right arm equipped with a laser knife is so up my alley! The way it cleaved the alien in half was jaw-dropping. It's a shame the footage was blurry; if only the Finnish TV cameras were higher quality." Aside from frivolous social media banter, military forums were ablaze with debates over the practicality of these weapons. Enthusiasts split into factions: some believed that the so-called Powered Armor could revolutionize modern warfare, while others remained skeptical. "This individual soldier armor reminds me of World War I-era bulletproof gear, but with a mounted machine gun? I see no cause for such excitement—it's just a mechanical exoskeleton clad in steel. Rather than developing a contraption that encases a person, why not produce more tanks or armored vehicles?" "You're thinking too narrowly. What became of the British Mechanized Brigade? Practice is the sole criterion for truth! Infantry with the combined capabilities of protection, mobility, support, and even anti-armor will become the battlefield's unstoppable force—and they're mass-producible! Regarding welding steel plates onto an exoskeleton to create Powered Armor, you must be referring to Krupp's ‘Lightning’ series. But please, don't equate it with Future Group's military tech; they're not even in the same league!" Of course, not all discourse favored Star Ring Trade. With the biohazard crisis averted, the public began to ponder another issue: what significance did borders hold if Star Ring Trade could deploy a division-strength Powered Armor brigade to any world corner within hours? Provoked by opportunists, pacifists in cities like New York and Los Angeles conducted demonstrations, protesting Star Ring Trade's repeated militarization of space. However, these protests failed to gain traction. Despite the mainstream media, which typically echoed the elite's interests, siding with the protesters, online sentiment was decidedly pro-Star Ring Trade. Engrossed in compensation negotiations with the Finnish government, Jiang Chen had paid little attention to the internet. It was during a layover at the Moscow Airport that he discovered Star Ring Trade's Powered Armor Brigade had unexpectedly become a viral phenomenon. This unforeseen popularity took Jiang Chen aback. Although he had anticipated the Powered Armors would garner widespread governmental attention, he hadn't expected such a degree of public fascination. The long-term impact of this development was still uncertain to Jiang Chen, but one aspect was indisputable. The high-definition footage from YLE was tantamount to an extraordinary, cost-free recruitment advertisement for Star Ring Trade... (To be continued.) Chapter 1078: Drive Safely Days have passed since Star Ring Trade's military operation to eradicate the alien Nest Core, and the White House and The Pentagon had held a series of extensive meetings on the subject. "... I don't care what methods you use, but within three days, I need to see DARPA's project proposal for powered armor research, separated from the mechanical exoskeleton project. Don't worry about the budget; I'll discuss it with Congress. According to the Finnish Minister of Defence, this powered armor is projected to be an infantry squad's fire support, with a minimum of fifty kilograms in ammunition loadout and NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection. Moreover, it must provide absolute protection against ammunition calibers of 12.7mm and below..." In a small conference room within the White House, the President's Advisor was engaged in a one-on-one meeting with the DARPA Director. DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is colloquially known as the real-life S.H.I.E.L.D., and is involved in numerous defense and aerospace projects. This includes the Faraday Spray, designed to counter EMP weapons, a joint effort between DARPA and Lockheed Martin Corporation. Star Ring Trade had surpassed America in defense technology, forcing the Advisor to rely on DARPA. Having taken careful note of the President's Advisor's requests, the DARPA Director fiddled with his pen and tapped it lightly on his notepad. "We'll expedite the initiation of the project. Lockheed Martin Corporation has already achieved significant progress in exoskeleton research, and we can leverage the existing technology. Additionally, I suggest we initiate talks with Germany to obtain data on the improved 'Lightning' exoskeleton from the Krupp Consortium. They have nearly developed a working model of powered armor, albeit with some design flaws." "I'll have Secretary Kerry handle that," replied the Advisor. After exchanging further details, the DARPA Director closed his notebook, stood up, and prepared to leave. He had several meetings awaiting him and needed to prepare the project proposal within two days to meet the Congressional Budget Committee's hearing deadline. A billion-dollar research initiative wasn't something he could decide on with just a signature. As he reached the door, it opened, and a White House aide entered with a document in hand. "Madam Advisor." The Advisor turned to her assistant, asking with a serious tone, "What's the matter?" "The President of the New State has sent an invitation." The aide placed the document on the desk, "They are inviting us to the Outer Space Security Summit on June 15th." "Outer Space Security Summit?" The Advisor scoffed, her crow's feet deepening with disdain. Star Ring Trade dares to host a summit on outer space security? Who exactly is the one exploiting space resources for weapon development? "Draft a polite refusal for me. State that the US regrets Star Ring Trade's breach of the Outer Space Treaty. Until Star Ring Trade and New State provide explanations, we will not initiate high-level bilateral talks with New State." "Understood." The aide nodded and left. The Advisor leaned back, rubbing her tired eyes. Another meeting was imminent in ten minutes. As she was about to steal a moment of rest, she noticed the invitation letter. After hesitating, adhering to diplomatic protocol, she pulled out the invitation. Upon skimming the document, her eyes locked onto a key term, and she froze. "Extraterrestrial civilization?" As she read down the invitation, her expression fluctuated. When she reached the last line, she tossed the invitation on the table, stood up abruptly, and quickly followed the aide out... On June 1st, just after midnight, a Gulfstream jet landed at Koro City Airport. Surrounded by bodyguards, Jiang Chen, yawning, passed through the VIP corridor to his Rurka sedan. After a bodyguard opened the door for him, he settled into the passenger seat. Aisha, already in the driver's seat, skillfully started the engine and, upon reaching initial speed, pressed the magnetic levitation activation button, smoothly lifting the car into the air. Koro City's central thoroughfares had been upgraded for magnetic levitation traffic, with nearly half the private cars floating mid-air. The endless stream of traffic, alongside the neon lights of the streetscape set against the backdrop of skyscrapers and countless home lights, transformed the city into a resplendent jewel, a dreamy and beautiful sight. It was hard to imagine what this place looked like just four years ago. In the car, Jiang Chen unexpectedly received a call from Warner Bros. Christopher Nolan, who had previously collaborated with him, reached out, expressing Warner Bros.' keen interest in adapting the battle between humans and Alien Species for the 'bigger' screen, and inquired if Star Ring Trade could provide assistance during filming. Considering the positive exposure for Star Ring Trade, Jiang Chen accepted Warner Bros.' proposal, stating that as long as Star Ring Trade was portrayed positively, they would offer production support at no cost. After ending the call, Jiang Chen retracted the holographic display and stretched, still struggling with jet lag and feeling rather groggy. Aisha glanced at Jiang Chen with a concerned look and softly asked, "How was it in Finland?" "Busy, but it was alright." "Did you see Natasha?" "We had dinner before my flight." Jiang Chen turned to Aisha, who was focused on driving, and smiled. His hand casually wrapped around her slender waist. "Don't worry about me. Did you miss me these past few days?" Her cheeks flushed, Aisha whispered, "I thought about you every day." As his hand began to move, Aisha squirmed but did not resist. Jiang wasn't worried about accidents; magnetic levitation was far safer than road travel. Designated lanes at specific altitudes enforced speed limits, and at the highest cruising orbit, drivers could leave the steering entirely to the intelligent driving system. Initially, Jiang simply held Aisha's waist, but soon became more daring. The gentle lamb allowed his hand to wander higher... Biting her lip, Aisha, unable to contain her emotions and blushing deeply, steered the car into the cruising orbit and entrusted the driving to the intelligent driving system. She deftly turned and straddled Jiang's lap. With her arms around his neck, Aisha looked into his eyes with her clear, sapphire-like gaze. Caught under such scrutiny, Jiang, typically bold, felt shy. "Err, you should concentrate on driving—" Before he could finish, Aisha's warm lips silenced him, and her tender tongue invaded... Beside them, the cityscape, awash with colors, flew by beyond the tinted glass. In such a moment, everything naturally fell into place. Jiang felt the fatigue of several days melt away with the warmth of their closeness. Within the glittering night, a tale of speed and passion unfolded... (To be continued.) Chapter 1079: The Epilogue of Conflict Xia Shiyu glanced at the wall clock for the third time, releasing a deep sigh before murmuring, "Why hasn't he returned yet?" Half an hour ago, Aisha had driven off to the airport to fetch Jiang Chen, prompting Xia Shiyu to take a refreshing shower. Despite the summer's embrace, Xia Shiyu, freshly bathed, hadn't rushed to dress. Instead, her damp hair was wrapped in a white towel, and she was clad in a bathrobe, seated on the living room couch. She reveled in the fantasy of Jiang Chen's flushed, panting expression upon seeing her, which coaxed a gentle smile onto her lips. Suddenly, realizing she was indulging in embarrassingly intimate thoughts, Xia Shiyu blushed. With a light cough and clenched fists, she took several deep breaths to regain her composure, resuming her usual poised and ethereal demeanor. Yet, the gaze she couldn't help but direct towards the window, along with the glint of love and anticipation in her eyes, betrayed her inner turmoil. As the minutes ticked by, and it was well past one o'clock, concern began to cloud Xia Shiyu's calm facade upon another glance at the clock. 'Could it be a traffic jam?... Impossible, maglev cars don't experience traffic. Could there have been an accident?' Anxiety mounting, Xia Shiyu quickly picked up her smartphone from the coffee table and dialed Jiang Chen's number. The phone rang for what felt like an eternity, unanswered. She then tried Aisha, only to discover her phone was off. Worry gnawed at Xia Shiyu. Just as she stood to dress and investigate, the villa's door finally swung open. The headlights flickered briefly as the familiar Rurka sedan slid into the garage. Soon after, two figures entered the living room. Relieved at their safe return, Xia Shiyu approached Jiang Chen and asked with a hint of reproach, "Why are you so late?" Jiang Chen, sheepishly, replied with a smile, "Got held up on the road. Why haven't you gone to sleep?" Xia Shiyu scrutinized Jiang Chen with suspicion. Something was amiss. Normally, her appearance in just a bathrobe would elicit a distinct reaction from him, but now his calm seemed too unwavering. What she didn't realize was that Jiang Chen, having recently exerted himself to the limit, was now in a state of post-exertion clarity, impervious to even the most provocative sights. Unaware of Xia Shiyu's puzzled thoughts and feeling slightly uneasy under her probing gaze, Jiang Chen self-consciously touched his face, asking softly, "Is there something on my face?" Xia Shiyu shook her head, then turned her gaze to Aisha. Aisha, cheeks flushed, averted her gaze. Realization struck Jiang Chen, and he internally cursed. Busted! Indeed, Xia Shiyu had caught on and, with a mischievous grin, moved closer to Jiang Chen, tenderly linking arms with him. "There does seem to be something. Let me take a look." The scent of lilacs filled Jiang Chen's nostrils as the damp hair, still covered in a mist, cascaded down beside her exquisite face, leading to an expanse of fair skin that hinted at hidden depths. The proximity to such beauty caused Jiang Chen to react with a mix of unease and pleasure. "There's quite a bit, actually," Xia Shiyu carefully examined Jiang Chen's profile, nodding earnestly. After a jealous glance at Aisha, her 'murderous' smile remained unaltered, "Let's go upstairs, I'll help you clean up thoroughly~" With that, Xia Shiyu, holding the front of her bathrobe with one hand and grasping Jiang Chen's arm with the other, briskly made her way upstairs. Jiang Chen's expression—a blend of amusement and chagrin—stirred a measure of sympathy from Aisha. But the young girl merely offered a silent second of condolence in her heart before humming a lively tune and dashing to the upstairs bathroom. In Koro City's sweltering summer heat, her skin felt sticky. She longed to shower and then slip into bed for a blissful night's sleep. ... It wasn't until noon that Jiang Chen, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, finally sat up in bed. The woman who had shared his slumber was already up and about. As the old adage goes, 'the fields may never be overworked, but the oxen toiling might just die from exhaustion.' He had used every trick in the book the previous night, leaving Xia Shiyu pleading for mercy with his exhausted body. Yet, the committed CEO managed to rise on time for work the next day. At that thought, Jiang Chen chuckled, shook his head, then swung his legs off the bed and tossed aside the comforter. Hearing movement within the bedroom, the attentive Aisha entered with clothes, dressing Jiang Chen with a gentle touch, and softly inquired, "Do you have any plans for today?" "Yes," Jiang Chen stroked Aisha's hair affectionately, "the entire day is dedicated to the two of you." Savoring his warm touch, Aisha smiled softly and suggested, "Spend more time with Sister Shiyu. She's always waiting for you at home alone, and I occasionally have the chance to accompany you out. Even though she rarely speaks of it, I can sense that her love for you is just as deep as mine." Gazing into those clear eyes, Jiang Chen felt a twinge of regret. As he opened his mouth to speak, Aisha's soft fingertip pressed against his lips. "No need for words." After murmuring, Aisha tiptoed to gently kiss his lips. With a gaze filled with affection, she reached out to neaten his collar. "It's time for lunch." Jiang Chen, moved by her proximity, couldn't resist wrapping an arm around her waist, whispering in her ear, "May I have a taste of you first?" "Not now, you have to head to the office this afternoon." Bowing her head to touch his chest with her forehead, Aisha softly insisted, "Don't put off the important tasks, or Sister Shiyu will feel jealous again." Jiang Chen was certain that if he insisted, Aisha wouldn't resist. However, taking Xia Shiyu's feelings and the harmony of his inner circle into account, he heeded the young woman's advice. After sharing lunch, Jiang Chen rested on the sofa for a bit before driving to the company. Ascending to the top floor in the elevator, he stopped by Xia Shiyu's office to greet her. While she didn't express it, Jiang Chen could plainly sense Xia Shiyu's delight at his afternoon visit. What mattered to her wasn't how engrossed Jiang Chen was in his work—she had long been accustomed to shouldering those heavy tasks for him—but his willingness to spend more time with her. She didn't expect her share of Jiang Chen's affections to exceed Aisha's, his steadfast partner through thick and thin; she only hoped not to lag too far behind in their emotional connection... Settling into his office, Jiang Chen requested his striking secretary to prepare a cup of coffee and summoned David Smith, CEO of Future Bank, from downstairs. Before long, Mr. Smith appeared before his desk. With work to be done, Jiang Chen got straight to the point. "Within three days, I need to see 150 billion New Dollars in Future Bank's accounts, available for discretionary use. Also, send me the reports on Daimler, BMW, and the Volkswagen Group. And compile a list of top German companies in the electric industry—email that to me as well." Hearing Jiang Chen's instructions, Smith's face displayed his astonishment. A seasoned finance professional, he was keen on the subtlest shifts of capital on the international stage. Without Jiang Chen's prompting, Future Bank had been gearing up to capitalize on the European economic downturn, with liquid assets at the ready. His team was now strategizing on where to begin for optimal returns and the highest success rate. Companies like Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen, with their technological prowess and market potential, were naturally prime investment targets. Yet, such acquisitions weren't impulsive decisions; even with a substantial premium, they depended on the German government's willingness to sell. Still, Smith hadn't foreseen his boss's vast influence, capable of potentially securing the pillars of the German automotive industry. Would the German government simply stand by and watch their industrial mainstays be claimed by foreign investment? "No problem," Smith confirmed. Though surprised, he had no recourse but to nod in agreement. "Then make it quick." "Yes, sir." After Smith departed, Jiang Chen accepted the mocha from his secretary and leaned back in his chair, savoring the brew contentedly. The conflict had ended, the capital had been deployed, and the casualties had almost ceased. The German Revolution hovered on the precipice of triumph, with Carmen perished in Finland and the Commonwealth Society, led by the Rothschild family, faltering. Now, the true climax of the conflict was about to unfurl. The moment to distribute the spoils had arrived! (To be continued.) Chapter 1080: Frenzied Acquisition In the northwestern German city of Bremen, a man of Germanic heritage was frantically packing his bags in a budget hotel. Amidst his rush, he accidentally sent his phone tumbling from the table to the floor. Quickly stooping to retrieve it, he shoved it into his pocket, cursing under his breath. 'Damn that Carmen, nothing but a liability! How did I ever get mixed up with him... Damn it!' Still cursing, he snapped his suitcase shut and strode towards the door. Karl-Friedrich Krupp, a name that once resonated with prestige in Germany's upper echelons, now lived like a vagabond, wrapped in a coat worth mere euros, staying in cheap motels, and always hiding behind sunglasses and a baseball cap, fearful of being recognized. He found himself reminiscing about his brother, Glennar Krupp, who had vehemently opposed any alliance with the Rothschild family and had been the cornerstone of the Krupp family. If only he hadn't been blinded by power, had he warned Glennar about Carmen that fatal night, perhaps the Krupp family's fortunes would be different. Exiting the elevator, he banished these impractical musings. Reflecting on the past served only to aggravate his distress. A flicker of hope ignited within Karl-Friedrich as he stepped into the hotel lobby. If he could just reach South America, lie low for a while, and later discreetly funnel his Cayman Islands funds through an offshore company, he could still enjoy a wealthy lifestyle. A hundred million dollars would suffice for the remainder of his life. The Krupp family's fiasco was now for his two brothers and sister to handle. Upon leaving the hotel, his presence immediately caught the attention of four men in black suits who stood up and moved towards him from all directions in the lobby. Realizing he was the focus of their interest, panic surged through him. He spun around to flee, only to discover there was no way out; within moments, he was surrounded. The man standing directly in front of him presented a badge. 'Mr. Karl-Friedrich Krupp, I presume?' 'You must be mistaken...' Karl-Friedrich's voice trembled with apprehension, 'I am Francis Aude, a businessman hailing from South America in the food processing industry. I am merely here in Germany on an inspection...' However, the agent was unyielding and proceeded, 'We represent the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection. Mr. Krupp, you face over twenty charges, including treason. You must come with us.' Desperate, Karl-Friedrich attempted to push past the man beside him in a bid for freedom. But his slight stature was no match for the experienced agents. The man next to him didn't budge, effortlessly restraining Karl-Friedrich's desperate efforts to escape. 'No! I won't go anywhere! I need to catch a flight! Help! Someone...' His screams grew increasingly shrill as he struggled in vain, his condition as pitiful as it was desperate. The federal agent, seeing no cooperation from Karl-Friedrich, gave a decisive nod to his assistant. 'Take him away.' 'Understood!'... On June 3rd, the German People's Liberation Front marched into Berlin unopposed, with the city's citizens lining the streets to welcome them. The revolution, which had been simmering for months, finally came to a victorious close after a month of armed conflict. On June 5th, Evelyn, the exiled government leader, returned from Russia to the Chancellor's Office in Berlin, bringing an end to his years in exile. Standing before the German people, he was sworn in as Chancellor, representing the Christian Democratic Union. That same afternoon, twenty-seven members of the New Choice Party faced charges including war crimes and crimes against the federal constitution, with the possibility of life imprisonment without parole. Concurrently, several European companies, including the Rothschild Bank and Krupp Group, suspected of offering substantial political contributions to the New Choice Party, were prosecuted by the German government. The Supreme Court swiftly froze their assets within Germany and initiated expedited trial proceedings. If convicted, the Rothschild Bank could be slapped with a trillion-euro fine—a sum far beyond the Rothschilds' reach. Evelyn had no intention of collecting this money. After the sentencing, shares in various companies held by the Rothschild Bank would be nationalized and auctioned. The proceeds would be channeled into the national treasury to revitalize an economy paralyzed by revolution. As per the agreement, Jiang Chen secured shares from the German government at a 20% premium, surpassing the European consortiums, including the Rothschilds, to become the majority shareholder of the automotive giants Daimler, Volkswagen, and BMW. With the European Union's integration crumbling and the euro's value plummeting, the exchange rate to the new dollar plummeted to as low as 1:3. One hundred and fifty billion new dollars, when exchanged for euros, resulted in a four hundred billion deal on the currency market. Of this, two hundred billion euros were loans from Future Bank to the German Central Bank. One hundred billion euros were invested in acquiring a 37% stake in Volkswagen, a 41% stake in Daimler, and a 39% stake in BMW, and the remaining hundred billion euros were an impromptu investment by Jiang Chen in five additional electrical industrial companies, including Siemens and Bosch. In the division of the European consortium's assets, Jiang Chen's Future Group emerged as the dominant victor, branding Germany's key industries with the Future Group's insignia. Jiang Chen had also considered acquiring the Krupp Group, but Evelyn proved less accommodating this time around. The Krupp Group was the lifeblood of German industry. Despite their ill-advised alignment with the New Choice Party, the Supreme Court refrained from meting out harsh punishment. As a traditional Prussian nobility not of Jewish descent, the Krupp Group had never been integral to the inner workings of the Commonwealth Society. With new leadership at the helm, the Krupp Group resolutely sided with the victors, decisively distancing itself from the Rothschild family and the Commonwealth Society. Evelyn decided against excessive scrutiny, and thus a chapter was closed. The European Union's integration efforts had not even survived a hundred days before Carmen's demise brought the farce to a sudden, anticlimactic end... (To be continued.) Chapter 1081: Another Possibility As the heart of the EU, the triumph of the German Revolution inspired the beleaguered peoples of Europe. The downfall of the Rothschild Empire hastened the pace of 'de-rightization' across European nations, leading people to question whether the choices they made two years ago were indeed correct, and if the rise of far-right parties truly steered their countries in a better direction. In stark contrast to Europe’s turmoil, the economy of Asia on the other side of the globe was on a steady climb. Particularly in that nation sprawling across the vast waters of the Western Pacific, where its GDP was skyrocketing as though aboard a space elevator. On June 10th, emissaries from Japan proactively arrived in Koro City, spearheading a consortium with Central Electric Power Company and Tokyo Electric Power Company, to broker an expanded agreement for power imports. This would increase the total amount of electricity imported for the latter half of the year by 31% to compensate for two domestic nuclear power stations that had ceased operations. Currently, the rate of Helium-3 extraction in Guanghan City far outpaces consumption, and the second Nuclear Fusion Power Plant is nearing completion, with ample excess capacity. For such an agreement, Jiang Chen was, of course, wholeheartedly receptive. It wasn't just Japan; the much-desired Chinese market also loosened its policies, dispatching numerous power company delegations to the New Country for exploratory visits. As the world's number one consumer of electricity, China's power market is larger than that of the United States and India combined. If China were to retire half of its coal power, it would spell astronomical profits for Star Ring Trade. As of early June, the first and most critical step of the Global Electricity Network Project had been completed. Thanks to the concerted efforts of many, Star Ring Trade's submarine cables had successfully enveloped the entirety of Australia and covered eighty percent of the countries and regions in Asia, accounting for 88% of the total domestic electricity output. Benefiting from the boon of affordable electricity and based on the proportion of imported electricity in national usage, the industrial cost reduction for countries part of the Global Electricity Network Project reached up to a maximum of 1.7%, with a minimum of 0.3%. This one or two percentage points reduction might seem trivial, but when applied to a GDP measured in trillions, the resulting energy is beyond imagination! Not to mention the myriad of benefits concerning the ecological environment, investment climate, competitiveness of exported goods, acceleration of electrification, and weakening of domestic industries' dependence on the energy market. In essence, governments that have tasted the fruits have, in turn, signaled positively, sending their entrepreneurs to the New Country for negotiations to possibly increase their import quotas. The New York Times went so far as to proclaim that the New Country had become a 'nation on a pole.' The Washington Post, on the other hand, published a cartoon rich in irony, depicting leashes stretching out from the Western Pacific and tethering the surrounding nations, regardless of their size. Regardless of how the media spins it, the countries that have bought tickets are already on the fast track to electrification. Having tasted the sweetness, there's no rationale for them to leap off. Through a network of submarine cables, Jiang Chen has harvested not just a continuous cash flow but also solid diplomatic capital. Why has the dollar dominated the global market for over half a century? One of the main reasons is that any nation seeking to develop its light and heavy industries cannot forgo oil, which is intrinsically linked to the dollar. If your nation's crude oil production fails to meet domestic demands, then you must stockpile more foreign reserves as a risk aversion measure. Now, the same principle applies as Asian countries are bolstering their New Dollar reserves. When the rise and fall of the New Dollar can sway the industrial and residential electricity costs of multiple nations, even if Koro City is not the financial hub of the world, the New Federal Reserve indeed possesses the potential to challenge the dollar's hegemony. This isn't about finance; it's about tangible power. ... With the Outer Space Security Summit only five days away, Jiang Chen has dispatched invitations to ten major global powers, subtly implying in the invitations that the topics of discussion will relate to extraterrestrial civilization. To date, all ten recipients of the invitations have confirmed their intentions to send high-level ministers to attend. The summit is set to proceed without a doubt. For Jiang Chen, the crucial issue is what evidence to present at the meeting. Currently, the space telescope that he has brought over from the post-apocalyptic world has been installed on the space elevator and dispatched to geostationary orbit. While Jiang Chen is not precisely aware of the colonial ship's exact coordinates, he is privy to its origin and destination—and that is quite sufficient. The Gliese 581 star system, roughly 2 degrees north of Beta Librae, lies 20.5 light-years from Earth. A week prior to the dispatch of the invitations, the Astronomical Observation Group of Star Ring Trade's Aerospace Department conducted a prolonged observation and analysis of the star system, and ultimately they unearthed an astonishing... For Jiang Chen, an anticipated revelation. The probability of life on planet Gliese 581g has been assessed at 90%. 'Incredible...' Holding a dossier brimming with astronomical data, Kelvin entered Jiang Chen's office and expressed his disbelief, 'Your hypothesis is correct; there indeed exists a potential for life. However, I can confidently assert that even if life exists, it could not possibly have developed a civilization beyond the Stone Age.' Jiang Chen lifted an eyebrow and asked with a smile, 'Oh? Why's that?' 'Firstly, due to tidal locking, the habitable zone on the planet is restricted solely to the area around the terminator line, which determines their spatial limits for living.' As he spoke, Kelvin extracted a spectrograph from the stack of documents and laid it before Jiang Chen, 'Next is the crux of the matter. The planet's elemental composition is abundant in hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, but it's markedly deficient in mineral elements like iron and aluminum. Coupled with the gravitational data we've observed, it's most likely that a variety of arthropod insects inhabit the terminator line, and even mammals are nonexistent!' Upon hearing this, Jiang Chen nodded approvingly. Granted, this was with the aid of 22nd-century observation equipment, but to deduce so much valuable intelligence from limited data was already quite a feat. 'But have you contemplated an alternative possibility?' 'An alternative possibility?' Kelvin furrowed his brow. 'We have always assumed that the progression of civilization is linear: from the Stone Age to the Iron Age, then advancing from the feudal era to the Industrial Revolution, and ultimately stepping through the gateway of the information age into the future.' 'What's incorrect about that?' Kelvin challenged doubtfully. 'A conclusion derived from a single frame of reference cannot be universally applicable. We cannot negate the potential for different forms of civilization just because the trajectory of human civilization is linear,' Jiang Chen explained. 'You're suggesting that a group of insects might foster a civilization? Stop joking; they...' Kelvin began to shake his head, about to remark that they lacked even the most basic appendages, but he abruptly came to a halt. He was suddenly reminded of the recent military operations by Star Ring Trade in the tundra of northern Finland. There, the vaunted Power Armor Brigade of Star Ring Trade seemed to have encountered an army of alien species that had emerged from insect eggs. Why had Jiang Chen directed Star Ring Trade's Aerospace Department to survey the Gliese star system, why had he unexpectedly journeyed to Finland before the X2 Bacterium outbreak, and why was he so firmly convinced of the Nest's peril from the very outset... All the clues coalesced in Kelvin's mind. He looked at Jiang Chen, thunderstruck, as he eked out a few words. 'Are you suggesting...' 'Precisely,' Jiang Chen nodded solemnly, 'The inception and conclusion of the X2 Bacterium is not as publicized to the outside world as merely a research mishap. From the beginning, it has been a stratagem by an extraterrestrial civilization.' (To be continued.) Chapter 1082: Underdevelopment? Upon departing Jiang Chen's office, Kelvin's thoughts incessantly replayed the serious conversation he just had with his boss. The Outer Space Security Summit was looming, a mere five days away, where Star Ring Trade was set to present concrete evidence to the world's leaders, revealing the existence and hostile intentions of extraterrestrial civilizations... Frankly, proving such an assertion was hardly necessary. When two civilizations, each with their own distinct values, come into contact, the notion of trade is a non-starter. As each perceives the other as nothing more than insects, it appears that the only way to establish dominance on the food chain is through conflict. War. Looking at the document in his hands with a complicated gaze, Kelvin thought about the mission his boss had entrusted to him just a minute prior. For the first time, he truly grasped the weight of the responsibilities resting on his shoulders... ...... Instead of heading straight home after work, Jiang Chen took a solitary boat trip to Coconut Island. This island had been entirely repurposed by him into a transshipment hub for resources between the current world and the apocalypse. Each month, cargo ships docked, unloading unsellable foodstuffs, household supplies, and on occasion, sealed containers packed with advanced industrial machinery, Sixth District's T3 Type Powered Armor, and other cutting-edge technological products. Though the island had no permanent military presence, it was protected by a full squadron of unmanned combat drones. No foreign operative had ever managed to infiltrate this 'mysterious little island'. After mooring his boat at the dock and having his identity verified by a reconnaissance drone, Jiang Chen made his way to the central warehouse. In a corner lay the 'Hamster Killer No.1', a machine that Jiang Chen had named himself. Lin Ling had previously used this machine to transport a chubby hamster from the current world to the post-apocalyptic one and back, marking a significant breakthrough in trans-dimensional living being transport. While transporting humans was not yet feasible, this was a significant first step. Jiang Chen had never imagined that the device would be needed so soon. Seated next to the machine, Jiang Chen extracted several vials brimming with a dark green substance from his pocket and placed them in the center of two discs. He then strapped on the gauntlets filled with wires and turned on the machine. As he watched the electrical arcs jump and flicker, he steeled himself and hit the switch. After a bit of effort, he managed to send the vials to the post-apocalyptic world. Quickly removing the gauntlets, he switched off the machine and crossed over himself. ...... One vial contained substances extracted from the remnants of a Nest Core, while the others contained spore and insect egg extracts. The cells within the vials had not undergone the process of inactivation, allowing for the movement of the unidentified substances to be visible within the dark green medium. Upon receiving the vials from Jiang Chen, Lin Ling immediately submerged herself in her laboratory work. Not long after, the lab door swung open again, and Lin Ling emerged, gesturing for Jiang Chen to come over to a specialized microscope. Alongside the vials he had provided, Jiang Chen noticed two other familiar ones. 'The sample you've brought is significantly different from what we've retrieved from Shelter 005 and the Nest Core we encountered in the city center. Their DNA codes, however, share a number of similarities. The Nest Core you came across is undoubtedly an evolved form, but due to its underdevelopment, many of its functionalities have not manifested,' Lin Ling elucidated. Upon hearing this, Jiang Chen's eyebrows twitched involuntarily. 'Underdevelopment?' It had taken hundreds of tungsten-core rounds and an entire brigade of Powered Armor to subdue this formidable adversary. And now he was being told it was underdeveloped? If they allowed it to reach full maturity, would they stand any chance at all? Lin Ling solemnly nodded in affirmation. 'Precisely. If it is provided with an abundance of organic matter and sufficient time to undergo photosynthesis, to digest and incorporate these materials, the Nest Core would gradually evolve to its mature state. Based on a simulation of its entire DNA sequence, a mature Nest Core would become an unfathomable terror.' She paused, her tone growing grave, 'With our current level of technology, I cannot envision a method to wholly eradicate it. Each spore cell possesses the capability to develop into a complete Nest Core, and their division is now unlimited. Unless we manage to exterminate every single spore, it is inevitable that it will resurface from some obscure corner.' After listening to Lin Ling's detailed briefing, the potential for the Nest Core's rapid evolution sent a shiver down Jiang Chen's spine. For these extraterrestrial beings, Earth was a completely alien environment. Whether it was gravity, atmospheric composition, or the magnetic field, understanding these factors didn't necessarily translate to full adaptation. In this war, humans initially had the advantage of fighting on familiar terrain. However, with each encounter, their alien adversaries evolved at a staggering rate. If there were several more Nest Core incidents, it would be challenging to predict the posture the Harmonic Civilization might adopt when their colonization fleets made landfall. Realizing the deeper implications of the situation, Jiang Chen paused briefly before issuing an order. 'Compile all available data on this Nest Core, with particular focus on the genetic similarities between the X2 Bacterium and the T-Virus. I need both a hard copy and a digital file—the digital copy should be a comprehensible holographic representation.' 'Hey, do you think I'm your secretary? This is a lot of work, you know!' protested Lin Ling, puffing out her cheeks. 'Ten boxes of mango pudding,' Jiang Chen offered as a compromise. Lin Ling pondered for a moment, then replied with a hint of bargaining, 'Fifteen boxes, strawberry flavor.' Jiang Chen chuckled and nodded. For her, no request was too burdensome. 'I'll bring them along next time. But I thought you were fond of the mango flavor?' Lin Ling playfully stuck out her tongue and shyly looked away, 'I've had an overabundance of mango; I haven't even finished the batch you brought me last time.' While compiling the entirety of the Nest Core data was no small endeavor, for Lin Ling, a digital entity, it presented no difficulty. With the promise of pudding secured, she gave her assurance to Jiang Chen that everything would be prepared within a maximum of three days. Leaving the lively research institute, Jiang Chen passed through the backyard gate and made his way back to the villa. He had informed Aisha beforehand that he would be staying in this world until Lin Ling had finished compiling the Nest Core data. This information would be critical at the impending Outer Space Security Summit. Whether it would draw the global community's full attention was now contingent upon it. (To be continued.) Chapter 1083: Lurking Threats At the Morgan Stanley skyscraper on Wall Street, New York, an informal Federal Reserve shareholders' meeting was in progress. Seated near the entrance was Daniel Morgan, the incumbent patriarch of the Morgan family. Joining him around the conference table were representatives from the Rockefeller family, the Rocky family emblematic of the Boston Consortium... Even the Giannini family, proprietors of the distant Californian Consortium, had sent their delegates. To say those eligible to sit at this table were as symbolic to Americans as the image of Franklin on the hundred-dollar bill would not be an exaggeration—except these figures were the living embodiment of their wealth. A solitary decision from this assembly could induce financial earthquakes. Frankly, the wealth corresponding to a third of the world's capital was concentrated within this moderately-sized room. "To commence, a toast to our shared victory," Daniel Morgan lifted a champagne flute from the table, loftily raising it as his eyes swept across the attendees, "Victory is ours—the WASP's—and so is Wall Street!" The term 'WASP' aligned with the acronym for the WASP Consortium, and its members often referred to themselves by this appellation. Old Rockefeller, with a knowing smile, also raised his glass in accord. Dispensing with unnecessary pomp, twelve glasses were raised in honor of the consortium's collective success, promptly drained following Daniel's cue. Twelve servers approached, offering towels with utmost deference. After use, the towels and glasses were tactfully cleared from the conference room. Having swiftly discarded his towel onto the server’s tray, Daniel surveyed the table with a sense of fulfillment. Among the titans of finance present, he, at forty, was the youngest and one of the most triumphant. Once the servers had left, Daniel clapped softly, signaling everyone to direct their attention to him. "Yesterday, Morgan Bank concluded the acquisition of key assets from Rothschild Bank, including shares of Citibank and others. It's my privilege to announce that we have decisively expelled those troublesome financiers from the street at our feet." Appreciative applause rippled around the table, with old Rockefeller participating with a subtle clap, though his eyes flickered with a thought-provoking luster. Daniel modestly acknowledged the commendations from the core members of the WASP Consortium directed towards him and his illustrious surname. Mentioning the Rothschild family's control over America inevitably leads to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve, effectively America's central bank, commands the macroeconomic regulation of the 'world currency.' A mere increase in interest rates could cripple vulnerable economies, turning months of industrial labor to naught and piling up national debts—a fiscal doomsday device. And this 'nuclear weapon' was in private hands. Federal Reserve Board members, nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, are technically government officials, but the Owen-Glass Act established twelve reserve districts, each with an independently chartered district reserve bank. The equity of each district's Fed is proportionally subscribed by its member banks based on their assets. Take the New York Reserve District as an example, where recent disclosures show Citibank with 15%, Chase Manhattan with 14%, Morgan Trust with 9%, Hanwha with 8%, and Hanover with 7%. These institutions often have the backing of financial dynasties like Rockefeller, Morgan, and Rothschild. Goldman Sachs collapsed last year, and now the Rothschild lineage has been unequivocally ousted, with their stakes in Citibank, Hanover, and more divided between the titans Rockefeller and Morgan. If Wall Street in 2018 was a shared stage for Jews and Anglo-Saxons, by 2019, it had been claimed by the WASP Consortium. Old Rockefeller interrupted Daniel's celebratory stupor with a soft cough. "We can save the festivity for tonight's banquet. Gentlemen, there are urgent matters that necessitate our immediate attention." "Certainly," Daniel affirmed, his smile betraying no irritation. Without uttering a word, old Rockefeller beckoned with a gesture; his secretary, perceiving the signal, stepped forth and laid a document upon the conference table. Straightening up, old Rockefeller adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses and perused the document. "On the eleventh of June, just yesterday, Japan's Central Electric Power Company and Tokyo Electric Power Company expanded their power import contract with Star Ring Trade. Considering Japan’s total electric consumption last year, Star Ring Trade has effectively secured a monopoly on twenty percent of the nation’s electrical supply." As this revelation was made, those present exchanged contemplative glances, with a flicker of astonishment in even Daniel’s eyes. "This information hasn't yet been made public, and you may not have been notified. I owe my intel to a certain government official." With meaningful looks, old Rockefeller canvassed the room, "There's no need for further elaboration; you've no doubt sensed it already." "We are relinquishing our grasp on the situation in Asia." This proclamation sent a wave of consternation through the assembly. Each person was a representative of a significant consortium, a colossus of Wall Street finance; with their acumen and intuition, they wouldn't miss such a pivotal shift. However, in recent times, all had been preoccupied with Europe, so immersed in extracting every last morsel from the Rothschild carcass that they overlooked the developments on the other side of the globe. "The dollar’s supremacy is being challenged; perhaps toppling the Commonwealth Society so swiftly was an oversight." "What are our alternatives? Are we to resurrect them from their graves?" "We might consider bolstering the Krupp Consortium. As long as there's a new challenger to counter the Future Group—" "That's less feasible." Cutting through the burgeoning discussion, Daniel shook his head, his fingers interlaced contemplatively before him. The previous sense of victory had dissipated, giving way to an awareness of the crisis looming over the WASP Consortium, "We must curb Star Ring Trade's continued expansion of their sway. The ominous signs are evident; if we allow their global electricity network project to advance unimpeded, we'll find ourselves increasingly cornered." "Precisely," Rockefeller nodded, his gaze methodically scanning the assembly, "I'm aware many here have engagements with the Future Group across various sectors, but if they unsettle the dollar's bedrock, I trust you all grasp the implications." The financial empire of Wall Street is predicated on the dollar. Wielding the levers of exchange rates and markets, Wall Street’s magnates have reaped the world's wealth for nearly a century. If the dollar were stripped of its 'world currency' stature, and central banks worldwide began to divest their dollar holdings, every Federal Reserve note could devolve into mere paper. The paper-built financial empire of Wall Street would disintegrate overnight. The subsequent two hours of the meeting served as a clarion call for all, Daniel included. Everyone was roused from their state of celebratory intoxication. The Jewish financial consortium had crumbled, yet the beasts that feasted upon it remained hungry. Now, their predatory gaze was fixed on the Pacific’s far shore. As the threat to their collective interests became apparent, the WASP Consortium united like never before, dedicating these two hours to devising a containment strategy against Star Ring Trade’s 'global electricity network plan.' Following the adjournment, consortium representatives briskly exited the venue. Daniel Morgan, the convener of this meeting, remained in his seat, reclining contemplatively in his chair. In that moment, he recollected a phone call from a month prior with Carmen. The once-formidable Rothschild family had humbled themselves, seeking his assistance, yet he had nearly instinctively rebuffed Carmen’s overture. "...On the contrary, I am overwhelmingly convinced that one day I will be grateful for today's decision... right?" His fingers tapped lightly on the table's surface as Daniel replayed his past dialogue in a whisper, but now, his voice carried a shade of hesitation, lacking the decisiveness it once had. (To be continued.)
Chapter 1303: Only You (1) 'What is the meaning of this?!' Grand Elder Donggong demanded, his voice filled with anger as he tapped his cane. 'Our Ancestor will be here shortly, so please, Grand Elder Donggong, be patient. You will understand our actions soon,' the lead man responded. Grand Elder Donggong knew exactly whom they referred to as 'Ancestor.' He was somewhat perturbed, uncertain of Pei Yi's reasons for coming. To have a feud with DK was no small matter, especially in Country R, where despite everyone's desire to oust DK, it remained an unattainable dream. Minutes later, Pei Yi's vehicle arrived. He stepped out, his attention quickly shifting to a nearby car. An Xiaoning caught sight of him and, keeping her mask and wig firmly in place, also disembarked. Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind. 'You've arrived,' An Xiaoning called out. Pei Yi gave her a once-over and actually chuckled. He moved closer and whispered, 'Wow, with this get-up, they'd have a hard time guessing it's you, right?' 'Exactly, I don't want them to know who I am yet, that's why I asked for your help. It's not the right time yet.' Pei Yi's gaze inadvertently fell on Wu Lianzhi. 'What are you doing with him?' 'There's a situation to handle.' He straightened up, facing the Donggong family with a casual smile. 'I wonder what my kin has done to offend the Donggong Clan to the point of them wanting her dead? Do you truly dare to challenge DK's might?' The Donggong family turned pale at his words. Pei Yi's kin? Since when did he have kin? Elder Madam Donggong spoke up, 'We honestly had no clue about Mr. Pei's kin...' 'Good, now you do,' Pei Yi retorted coldly, his voice carrying an edge of steel. 'I hope that's clear.' 'If Mr. Pei claims she's his kin, then by all means, take her with you. As for Donggong Lianzhi, his name remains in our family records, and he has yet to be formally disowned. He is still of the Donggong Clan, and how we deal with him is our family's business.' Before Pei Yi could reply, An Xiaoning seized the moment to cry out to him, 'Brother, he's my boyfriend, and I'm pregnant with his child. You can't just leave him behind.' Pei Yi had intended to rescue only her, but the situation had suddenly turned complicated. Yet, his style was to be assertive and imperious. If he wanted to get something done, this was hardly an obstacle. 'Elder Madam Donggong, you've heard her. He's practically my brother-in-law now, and they're expecting. To hand him over to you is to deprive a child of their father. Do you really think I would agree to that?' Elder Madam Donggong knew very well that if Pei Yi took them away, they wouldn't be able to openly deal with their grandson in the future. Despite her fear of DK's influence, she couldn't show weakness. 'Mr. Pei, that will not be possible. Our family has its traditions, and outsiders have no right to meddle in our affairs.' 'Didn't you hear that he's going to be the father of my kin's baby? Are you going deaf in your old age?' Pei Yi shifted his intense gaze to Wu Lianzhi. 'What do you think? Are you a member of the Donggong Clan?' 'This morning, when my mother tried to poison me, I renounced my ties to her then and there. And when the Donggong Clan plotted to kill Miss An and her people, I made my position clear. Though the name Donggong Lianzhi still exists in the family registry, I no longer carry the Donggong surname. My name is now Wu Lianzhi, and I am no longer a part of the Donggong Clan!' His words resonated with determination and a chilling resolve. Declaring this in front of so many witnesses solidified his decision. 'It's not for you to decide!' Elder Madam Donggong snapped. 'Once you enter our Donggong doors, in life you belong to us, and in death, you are our ghost!' 'Grand Madam Donggong, do you not worry that Country S may issue a formal protest over your plot to kill Miss An, which she has already uncovered? Are you in any position to punish and deal with me now?' Wu Lianzhi spoke with an unfamiliar and fearless tone. 'I've had dealings with Miss An Xiaoning.' Pei Yi's smile slightly widened. 'She's not the type to forgive and forget a grudge. You sought her life; would she let it go unpunished? Enough with the chit-chat. My time is valuable, and I'm taking both of them with me.' As the Donggong family attempted to interject, he warned, 'Unless you want a bloodbath here.' And so, the Donggong family could only watch as their surefire catch flew the coop. Fuming, Elder Madam Donggong and Grand Elder Donggong were beside themselves with rage. In the end, Elder Madam Donggong conceded defeat. 'Fine, remove his name from the family records, and annul his family registry!' 'We must return to Country S.' Pei Yi gave her a sidelong glance. 'So you use me and then leave? Didn't you promise to fulfill one of my requests? And now you're already talking about returning?' 'I urgently need to go back for an issue, but I did promise you a request. What is it?' 'My request might make things difficult for you...' 'Then don't bring it up. Make one that won't be difficult.' Pei Yi faced her squarely, his gaze unyielding. 'You haven't changed a bit. Accompany me for half a month.' 'What do you mean by accompany?' 'The same as before.' An Xiaoning stared at him, her expression a mix of concern and defiance. 'No, first, no chains, no restrictions on my freedom. Second, half a month is too long. Two days.' '...' Pei Yi's smile slightly dimmed, but his eyes held a playful glint. 'That's too much. Five days, not a day less. You made a promise, and you'll have your freedom.' 'Can I first return to my country?' 'No.' '...' Wu Lianzhi, sitting in the car, listened to their exchange and couldn't help but wonder if there was more to their relationship. Could it be that their relationship was not entirely proper? Their conversation seemed to suggest it. But if that were the case, their lack of discretion in his presence was astonishing. 'Let him return to Country S first, and I'll stay with you alone, okay?' 'I won't harm either of you, stay together.' His tone was final. An Xiaoning said no more. They were close to Qingping Mountain, so they arrived quickly. Returning to this place, she was flooded with mixed emotions. Upon seeing An Xiaoning, Qin Guo couldn't hide her displeasure. As they walked in, she rolled her eyes. She wondered in exasperation why her esteemed ancestor had once again invited this harbinger of misfortune into their fold. Chapter 1304: Only You (2) After delivering the pastries and tea, Qin Guo, seized by curiosity, ventured, 'Elder of the Donggong Clan, may I know who this gentleman is...?' 'Your name?' asked Pei Yi. 'Wu Lianzhi, I believe I've mentioned it already.' 'I overlooked it.' Pei Yi responded coolly, then instructed Qin Guo, 'Please prepare a room for him.' 'Certainly, sir. And for Miss An, should I arrange one as well?' 'No need.' Wu Lianzhi had surmised correctly; it appeared he would be sharing accommodations with An Xiaoning. An Xiaoning caught the peculiar look he threw her way when glancing between her and Pei Yi, and immediately deduced that he had misconstrued their rapport. She couldn't explain why, but she loathed the idea of anyone misreading her connections with men—Jin Qingyan being the only exception. Her thoughts drifted to Jin Qingyan, leaving her feeling helpless. 'Lianzhi, come with me; there’s something we need to discuss.' 'Of course.' Once they were alone, she probed in a subdued voice, 'Have you misunderstood my association with Pei Yi?' 'Isn't it apparent that you two are...?' 'Not in the slightest. Normally, I sleep on the sofa we were just seated on. Even when he had me restrained, I would always end up sleeping on that couch.' 'He doesn’t harbor affections for you?' 'Dispense with such idle gossip.' An Xiaoning gently tapped his shoulder, 'We'll stay here for five days, then it's back home.' 'Understood.' Fang Erlan had been running ragged these last few days, with a relentless schedule of reshoots and promotions that filled her waking hours to the brim. Despite Xiao Chenyang's assiduous efforts to ensure she was well-nourished, she had still managed to lose a noticeable amount of weight. 'I fear I won't be able to accompany you in the upcoming days.' Xiao Chenyang revealed, after glancing over An Xiaoning's message to Fang Erlan. 'What tasks are you undertaking?' Xiao Chenyang had yet to share with her the truth of Jin Qingyan's dual personality, opting for discretion, 'There's an urgent issue I need to address, but I promise to return as promptly as I can.' 'I will come with you.' 'Your filming and promotional duties, remember?' 'They can wait until my return.' Xiao Chenyang tenderly caressed her head, reveling in her evident anxiety and reliance on him, 'I'd feel at ease with you by my side, knowing you’re in safety. However, this instance requires my solitary attention.' 'What is so urgent?' Fang Erlan pressed, 'Without an explanation, I cannot let you depart.' Faced with her anxious gaze, Xiao Chenyang conceded, 'You must vow to secrecy, this cannot reach another soul.' 'Without question, I will tell no one.' In a grave tone, Xiao Chenyang admitted, 'Qingyan has disappeared without a trace.' 'Vanished... could you elaborate?' 'He has an alternate personality, which has now gone missing. His whereabouts are unknown. It's as if he has evaporated. He might even have crossed borders, to where, we do not know. Hence, I must orchestrate a search. Moreover, with An Xiaoning in DK, I must make a sojourn to Country R. There resides someone from the Wu Clan who bears similarities to me.' 'Who is this person from the Wu Clan?' Xiao Chenyang clarified, 'Our country's once-renowned Witchcraft Cauldron lineage had cursed An Xiaoning and Qingyan. Then they inexplicably vanished, only to be found now. Their progeny have not carried on with the witchcraft traditions. Instead, we stumbled upon an individual akin to myself, presumably versed in the Witchcraft Cauldron arts. We must either capture or ensure he does not remain a threat to us.' Fang Erlan felt as if she were living within a fantastical saga, 'An Xiaoning is safe, isn’t she?' 'Yes, she's unharmed and will return shortly.' 'Then proceed. I will not accompany you; I refuse to be an encumbrance or a cause for concern. I'll request Sister Mei Yangyang to fortify my protection.' Xiao Chenyang stroked her hair, 'When will Qingyan come back to us?' 'Is he not your senior brother? Why do you address him by name and not with respect?' 'I prefer it this way. I seldom called him 'senior brother,' mostly when our master was around. Otherwise, it's always been informal between us—we've been close since we were children.' 'I see no point in arguing.' Xiao Chenyang planted a kiss atop her head, 'I shall leave as soon as the bodyguards arrive. Now, call Sister Mei Yangyang; I wish to instruct her personally.' 'Very well.' Fang Erlan fetched her phone and contacted Mei Yangyang. 'Sister Mei Yangyang, Chenyang would like a word.' Mei Yangyang responded affirmatively, 'Alright.' Passing the phone to Xiao Chenyang, he pressed it to his ear, 'I will be preoccupied with pressing matters for several days and will not be by Erlan's side. Please send eight bodyguards for her protection.' Fang Erlan hastily interjected, 'Four should be plenty.' 'Not nearly enough.' He countered, 'Send them without delay.' 'Alright, they'll be on their way shortly.' 'Very well.' Xiao Chenyang ended the call and turned to her with detailed instructions, 'In my absence, please ensure you eat well, rest adequately, and sleep immediately after finishing work. Refrain from using your phone late at night; it's detrimental to your eyesight.' 'I'll heed your advice.' An Xiaoning's spirits lifted with the news of Xiao Chenyang's arrival to Country R, fostering hope for Jin Qingyan's swift return. Instead of folding paper cranes to while away the time at Qingping Mountain, she had taken to practicing yoga on a sumptuous rug. Pei Yi, engrossed in his work, would occasionally glance up to observe her yoga postures. Even without much conversation, her mere presence seemed to brighten the room, and he felt a noticeable improvement in his mood. 'With the Marquis Jiaping of the West no longer present in DK, who is taking the reins?' 'He was the founder of DK. In his absence, there's no one else with the authority to fill his shoes.' While attending to his computer, he broached, 'Do you intend to remarry Jin Qingyan?' An Xiaoning adjusted her position to face him, settling into a cross-legged pose, 'In all honesty, whether we remarry or not seems inconsequential.' She had meant to reassure him of their eventual reunion, but the curse cast a shadow of doubt. 'How can that be inconsequential?' He challenged, 'Marriage is the most definitive testament to a couple's relationship. As his wife, you'd be known as Mrs. Jin instead of Miss An.' 'We’ll be united nonetheless.' Pei Yi inquired, 'Are you aware of why I insisted you remain here?' 'You crave diversion in your drab and mundane life; I'm merely your source of entertainment.' 'An Xiaoning, could you possibly be less insightful?' 'It's an innate trait of mine.' She retorted with a hint of lightness. He held back a chuckle, 'That's not the sole reason.' 'Is there another?' 'If you weren't already spoken for, I might have considered claiming you as my own.' 'Even with your aversion to germs, you find me appealing?' 'The allure of a truly enchanting woman eclipses her exterior; it's her essence that captivates.' Chapter 1305: Only You (3) Pei Yi's gaze met An Xiaoning's. 'I hold you in high esteem and would like to be friends, the kind who can meet often. Would you be open to that?' Rising from the blanket, An Xiaoning took a seat in the chair across his desk, her chin resting casually in her hand. 'Considering you're the head of DK's local division and I'm known as the daughter of the First Lady of Country S, wouldn't our friendship be viewed with suspicion, potentially as strategic collusion?' 'So you're... reluctant?' She faced him squarely. 'Pei Yi, I truly admire you. You possess a certain allure, and I mean that sincerely, not as flattery in response to your pleasing words. You are accomplished, but I adhere to one principle, do you understand it?' 'What principle?' 'I refuse to befriend anyone affiliated with terrorist organizations, even those who have saved me. It's not out of prejudice; consider the Donggong Clan, who, despite their respectable facade, commit ruthless acts. Pei Yi, my wish is for world peace, however unattainable that may seem. I don't want to see any more civilian casualties of war, nor can I bear the rumors of collusion with DK. My parents, being in their positions, shouldn't be pressured because of me. Given my status, malicious exploitation by others could cause irreparable damage.' Pei Yi nodded in understanding. 'I'm well aware of your concerns.' 'Perhaps, if one day you were to sever ties with DK, we might become good friends. But for now, it's best we maintain our current relationship.' Expecting him to profess eternal allegiance to DK, she was surprised when he said, 'In the future, who can say?' After lunch, with Pei Yi away on business, An Xiaoning and Wu Lianzhi were left alone, surrounded by surveillance. They refrained from touching anything in his office. Qin Guo, serving them begrudgingly, watched them play cards with visible disdain. 'Why the daze? Fetch me some cake; I have a craving,' An Xiaoning demanded. With a grumble, Qin Guo retorted, 'Do you think you're at home, An Xiaoning?' 'Are you not going to get it?' Departing with a mutter of 'May the cake make you fat,' Qin Guo reluctantly fulfilled the request. Returning with the cake, she couldn't resist commenting, 'I don't understand why Elder Donggong bothered bringing you here; all you do is indulge yourself.' 'That's a question for Elder Donggong, not me,' An Xiaoning replied with a smile. 'Qin Guo, if you're idle, why not join us for cards?' Qin Guo hesitated. 'Are you unwilling?' 'If Elder Donggong knew...' 'It's fine, I'll explain it to him. You're free anyway.' Won over by An Xiaoning's invitation, Qin Guo joined them. Playing cards, she inquired, 'Do you have feelings for Elder Donggong?' 'Would you prefer that I did or didn't?' 'I'm asking you—do you fancy him?' 'Why should I reveal my heart to you?' Stumped, Qin Guo pressed on, 'If you don't like him, please don't lead him on. Despite his cold and casual demeanor, he takes matters of the heart seriously.' 'Lead him on? You're mistaken; there's nothing romantic between us,' An Xiaoning clarified. Unconvinced, Qin Guo persisted, 'Really? You're being truthful, right?' 'Do you harbor feelings for him?' Qin Guo denied it, 'Of course not. We are unworthy of aspiring to Elder Donggong's affection.' 'That's evident. He's not the type to favor someone like you.' Qin Guo fell silent. 'He likely has a preference for two types of women.' 'Which types?' 'The first is a guileless, pure-hearted girl. The second, an empowered, capable woman who can earn his respect. Do you see yourself in either category?' Shaking her head, Qin Guo admitted, 'No.' 'Then there's your answer.' 'Qin Guo, what compelled you to join DK?' 'It's simple. My entire family joined; why would I exclude myself?' 'So you follow without question? Just because your family joined, is it necessarily right? Perhaps when you were born, your mother forgot to instill you with a sense of reason,' An Xiaoning chided. Qin Guo glared in response. 'What are you looking at? Isn't what I said true?' An Xiaoning pressed. 'You have a sharp tongue,' Qin Guo said. During her five-day stay, An Xiaoning remained serene and at ease. Though she felt some mental stress, her personal well-being was paramount. The days may have seemed lengthy, yet they flew by swiftly. For Pei Yi, they were all too brief. Regardless, he intended to honor his promise and release An Xiaoning. Just as she was preparing to depart, she received a call from Xiao Chenyang. He had reported the presence of Henry's traces in Country R. Subsequently, An Xiaoning and Wu Lianzhi set off to meet Xiao Chenyang. Upon their arrival, Xiao Chenyang expressed surprise at seeing Wu Lianzhi. 'So it is truly you.' 'Do we have an acquaintance?' Wu Lianzhi inquired. Xiao Chenyang burst into laughter, catching Wu Lianzhi off guard. 'What's his issue?' Wu Lianzhi asked An Xiaoning. 'He's never behaved this way; he must be having a fit,' An Xiaoning speculated as they entered. Following her inside, Wu Lianzhi watched Xiao Chenyang recover, drink some water, and say, 'I had my suspicions, but seeing you in person confirms it.' 'So you're aware of who he is, sparing me the introduction.' 'You truly have no recollection of him?' 'None whatsoever.' Xiao Chenyang lounged on the sofa, legs crossed atop the coffee table, grinning. 'The Wu family has only one such talent; he's somewhat memorable.' 'Enough with the mystery, what is it?' 'He's supposedly a friend with whom you share a significant past.' Thinking it trivial, An Xiaoning replied, 'I was already aware. Was that the cause of your prolonged laughter? I don't see the humor.' 'Ah... My amusement stemmed from picturing Long Tianze's despairing expression.' 'What does Long Tianze have to do with this...' 'It appears that in recalling your past life, you focused solely on your partner and yourself, giving little thought to anyone else.' Chapter 1306: Only You (4) An Xiaoning nodded. "It seems to be the case. Go on, please." "He was a lover of Yu Jiao from a past life, the same Yu Jiao who is now with Long Tianze," the revelation came. An Xiaoning's eyes widened. "You're not fooling me, are you?" "Would I gain anything from fooling you? Our esteemed Marquis Xi has been green with envy over him a few times. Occasionally, he has mentioned that his affections were never for you but for the maid by your side." "..." Wu Lianzhi seemed to grasp the underlying message. "Who is Yu Jiao?" An Xiaoning chuckled awkwardly. "In a past life, she was a maid serving me." "And in this life?" "In this life, she's married with children. Her husband, Long Tianze, is a prominent businessman involved in advertising, entertainment, and film production." Wu Lianzhi nodded in understanding. "Xiao Chenyang, did Yu Jiao and I have a relationship in that past life?" "You were lovers, yes. But clearly, there was no happy ending since I'm aware of your untimely demise at the hands of your own Wu family." "I see. But that's all history now. Xiaoning, is Yu Jiao doing well now?" "Yes, she's doing well. Her husband adores her, and they have a happy family with their children." "That's good to hear." Wu Lianzhi had come to terms with his past. "The past is the past. Our paths didn't cross early in this life, which means our connection ended in the last. Knowing she is happy now is enough for me. Is there a photograph of her?" "There is." An Xiaoning pulled out her smartphone, found Mei Yangyang's photo, and showed it to him. "This is her. In this life, she's called Mei Yangyang." Wu Lianzhi looked at the photo and smiled knowingly. "She is indeed quite pretty." "Right? Her daughter looks just like her, both with adorable dumpling faces." "Xiaoning." "Hmm?" "Let's not tell her or her husband about our past connection. I prefer things the way they are. I don't want my past to disturb their peaceful life." An Xiaoning felt a surge of warmth at his thoughtfulness. "Since you feel this way, we won't tell them. As you said, there's no longer a connection in this life, so it's best to let each lead their own lives." With that matter settled, it was time to address more pressing issues. "Have you found him?" "My men are on it. They've spotted him and will soon bring him in." Xiao Chenyang returned to his usual demeanor. "But did he come here specifically for you?" "I doubt it. I'm not sure, though. Have you visited the Donggong family estate?" "I have. I faced the revered elder. I expected a formidable opponent, but he was quickly subdued. He's now detained in Country S." "..." An Xiaoning gave a thumbs-up. "Impressive, truly remarkable." "You flatter me," Xiao Chenyang replied, seizing the moment to discuss Erlan's future. "Your studio should cultivate new talent, as Erlan won't continue acting after this film." "We're preparing for that. Yangyang and I anticipated you'd do this. When are you planning to wed?" "We haven't decided yet. A wedding shouldn't be rushed; it requires careful preparation. Initially, I thought a small ceremony with close friends and family would suffice. But I've changed my mind. On our wedding day, I want the entire world to know that she is mine." An Xiaoning teased, "Quite a grand affair. Planning to spend your entire fortune on it?" "Do you know how much I'm worth?" "Half a trillion?" Xiao Chenyang uncapped a bottle on the table and poured three glasses. "You underestimate me. I'll drink to that; you do as you please." With that, he took a sip. An Xiaoning handed a glass to Wu Lianzhi, then slowly raised her own. "Where did you get so much money?" "Let's just say I acquired it creatively." She scoffed. "Who are you trying to fool?" "Then how else do you think I got it?" An Xiaoning eyed him for a few seconds before drawing out her phone. "Erlan probably doesn't know about this. I should inform her; I'm curious about her reaction." Xiao Chenyang grabbed her wrist. "I was wrong." "How about more sincerity and less scheming from now on?" "Aside from my dormant periods, I've always engaged in business while searching for Erlan. The Xiao family has deep commercial roots, and as the youngest and sole son, the fortune inevitably came to me. Over time, my enterprises grew. In recent decades, I've invested in jewelry, gold, and real estate, making a fortune. I've begun the residency process in Country S, as not having local registration can be inconvenient." "Where's your current residency?" "Country Y. I've had to cancel and re-register every few decades. It's just a matter of transferring it here now." An Xiaoning turned to Wu Lianzhi. "And you? Have you thought about your future?" "Not until now." "It's time to start. Haven't you heard? The Donggong family elder, Wu Haigang, has been extradited to Country S. Your family will soon come for me, likely blaming me for his capture. I'll be sure to bring up your situation. You should consider your future plans now." "I hope to find someone who loves me, and whom I also love, to live a peaceful life together." "That will happen in due time." The three of them awaited news from Xiao Chenyang's men. After two hours, they finally received a lead on his whereabouts. Initially, they planned to apprehend him, but he proved too elusive. They rushed to his last known location. Upon seeing him, An Xiaoning quickly removed her mask and called out, "Henry!" Henry, startled, turned around. An Xiaoning hurried toward him, but he remained still. "Didn't I tell you to avoid trouble? Why can't you obey?" "The house felt too confining; I needed to get out." "If you wanted to get out, why not bring someone with you? You know you're free to travel." An Xiaoning attempted to take his arm, but he discreetly withdrew. "Everybody's trying to catch me, making me feel like a criminal." Chapter 1307: Only You (5) An Xiaoning clung to his arm tightly, fearful he might again become restless and try to flee, 'I was worried you'd get into mischief, which is why I wanted to find you as soon as possible.' 'Why has he come as well?' 'It's all because of you.' Henry didn't say anything else, simply joining her in walking towards Xiao Chenyang. —— Fan Shixin exhaled a sigh of relief upon the safe retrieval of Henry. He massaged his temples; from the moment Henry had escaped, there hadn't been a moment of respite for his nerves. After taking a brief pause, he summoned Xiao Huang. 'Captain Fan, did you call for me?' 'Bring He Yi to the duty room, I'll join you there shortly.' 'Understood.' After freshening up with a shower and donning fresh clothes, Fan Shixin left his quarters. He Yi, who had been confined to the basement, was at last allowed back into the light of day. Currently, he appeared quite ragged, a stark contrast to his initial composed state when first detained. Fan Shixin surveyed him with a stern gaze, 'Not just anyone can plot against our Young Madam Fan. It's ironic that you were once classmates with our Young Master at high school. This time, Young Madam Fan has decided to spare you just this once. There will be no repetition, and absolutely no next time. You may go.' The hands that were restraining He Yi loosened instantly. He Yi straightened himself up, fully aware that this was not the moment for bravado, and left without a word. Xiao Huang questioned, 'Captain Fan, why are we letting him go? Aren't those from the police department facing execution? Shouldn't he be serving some years at least?' 'It's the directive of Young Madam Fan. Furthermore, his involvement isn't on the same level as those sentenced to death,' Fan Shixin explained with a steady voice. 'He's merely a coerced first-time offender who ultimately failed to accomplish anything. A stern reprimand was deemed sufficient. The other seven or eight, however, were operatives that the Donggong Clan had stationed in Country S for intelligence-gathering. Our country enforces severe penalties on such individuals. Had He Yi been an operative from abroad, rest assured that Young Madam Fan would not have been so lenient.' 'Captain Fan, your hair's still wet. Have you just showered?' 'Yes, what of it?' 'Fresh out of the shower and into new clothes,' Xiao Huang remarked, rubbing his chin with a delighted grin, 'Could it be that Captain Fan is heading out on a date?' 'What, feeling envious?' he chuckled. 'I get it, for a lifelong bachelor like yourself, witnessing others go on dates must be quite the ordeal.' 'Captain Fan, can't you spare me the salt in the wound?!' Xiao Huang lamented. 'Enough, I'm off,' Fan Shixin glanced at the time and promptly exited. Between his trip to Country R and now, notably during the time of Henry's disappearance, Fan Shixin had been too swamped to entertain Wu Pingyang’s invitations. Now with an unexpected window of opportunity, he intended to make it up to her. He planned to pick up a gift for her first, thus he didn't call ahead. Wu Pingyang was at A City First People's Hospital. Fan Shixin was carrying a red rose gift box, knowing well that such a gesture would be cherished by most women, he selected it for his girlfriend. Arriving on the second floor, he saw the sign for the dental department and proceeded with the gift box in hand. At that moment, Wu Pingyang was busy fitting braces for a young boy and did not notice his presence. The other doctors, however, noticed him first and greeted him with a smile, 'Is that Captain Fan?' 'Hello.' Upon hearing his voice, Wu Pingyang looked up, her face immediately lit up with joy at the sight of him. 'I'll be right with you, please have a seat.' 'Alright.' Fan Shixin sat down, feeling somewhat awkward as the medical staff's curious eyes were all on him. This was Fan Shixin's first opportunity to observe his girlfriend while she was at work. Dressed in her white coat and blue mask, she was diligently focused on her tasks, her professionalism adding an extra layer of attraction. Once finished, Wu Pingyang, reveling in the envious looks from her female colleagues, felt a surge of pride. She quickly removed her mask and coat, 'Why are you here?' 'I've been preoccupied these past days, but I've finally managed to find some time to come and see you. I brought this for you.' Wu Pingyang eagerly received the gift box, and upon opening it to reveal the red roses, her face radiated happiness, 'They're beautiful. Do you have time this afternoon?' 'I believe so.' 'Wonderful, I had half a day blocked off just for you. My family is eager to meet you.' Wu Pingyang covered the box and lightly linked her arm with his, 'Let's talk outside.' 'Sure.' The duo stepped outside, with Fan Shixin asking, 'Your family has expressed a desire to meet me?' 'Yes, they inquired about when you would be available to join us for a meal at home. I explained your recent busyness to them.' 'Then let's make it this afternoon. We can dine at your place in the evening.' Wu Pingyang, elated by his consent, had been apprehensive that he might decline, especially since she had confidently assured her grandfather that Fan Shixin would definitely attend. 'That's settled, then. I'll inform my family right now.' 'Okay.' Wu Pingyang immediately relayed the news to her family. After hanging up, she faced Fan Shixin with a look of sheer excitement, 'We'll be visiting my grandfather's. Have you thought about what gift to bring?' 'Not yet.' 'My grandfather is particularly partial to that famous vintage from B City. I can't recall the name, but it's in English, that blue liquor that's so fragrant.' 'Ah, yes, that one. My grandfather has always talked about it. If you bring that, he'll be quite pleased.' 'Well...' Fan Shixin hesitated, 'That bottle of wine is priced at two hundred thousand, and it has become a collector's item. It's nearly impossible to find one for sale since they've ceased production. Perhaps we should consider another gift option.' Understanding the importance of a first impression when meeting a girlfriend's family, Fan Shixin was familiar with the custom of bringing a gift. Nonetheless, presenting something so costly could give off the wrong impression, suggesting that he was a careless spender from an affluent family. In reality, his circumstances were much different. While he did own a car and house, and his monthly income was substantial, he did not come from a wealthy background like Long Tianze, Ling Ciyi, or Jin Qingyan. His parents were laborers, working diligently every day at the Jin family household. Hearing his cautious approach, Wu Pingyang's mood deflated slightly, 'What's wrong with gifting a two-hundred-thousand-dollar bottle of wine? It's a sign of respect for my grandfather, which he can enjoy for a long time. Besides, it's a one-off. Won't the money spent on the wedding gifts eventually come back to us?' 'Respect for elders can be shown in many ways; it doesn't have to be extravagant,' Fan Shixin firmly resisted. 'As for the gift, I'll handle it; you needn't worry.' Taken aback, Wu Pingyang paused, 'Then, what do you intend to buy?' 'I'll have something in mind by the afternoon.' Chapter 1308: Only You (6) Wu Pingyang, careful not to stir any further tension, tactfully steered the conversation elsewhere. 'This gathering will likely see all the key members of our family. Please, make yourself comfortable when you arrive.' 'There is no need to worry.' He had navigated many a social maze; a few additional faces hardly posed a threat. 'But I must ask, why aren't we visiting your parents' home directly?' 'My grandfather is particularly eager to meet you,' she explained. 'My mother suggested it would be best to have the meeting at his estate.' Wu Pingyang gave him a pre-emptive heads-up, 'If my relatives bring up the matter of marriage... how do you plan on addressing it?' 'We can afford to take our time, to truly understand each other before delving into marriage talks. I entered this relationship with matrimony in mind, but we shouldn't rush. Marriage is, after all, a lifelong affair.' Wu Pingyang nodded in agreement. 'So, where to now?' 'What's your preference?' 'Let's head to the Winnie Community.' 'Agreed.' He led her back to Winnie Community, and as they stepped out of the car, she glanced at the main villa with curiosity. 'Shixin, could you possibly show me inside? I'm rather curious about Mr. Jin's living quarters.' Fan Shixin hesitated, 'Our master generally doesn't allow strangers into his private spaces, unless they're close acquaintances or have his express permission. But since you're my girlfriend, I suppose a brief tour of the living room could be arranged. The upper floor, however, is out of bounds.' She nodded, not wanting to trouble him, 'Of course.' Hand in hand, they approached the villa. At the threshold, the sight that greeted Wu Pingyang took her breath away. 'Wow, it's truly magnificent!' 'Come on in,' he invited, stepping through the doorway. She followed, taking in the surroundings. Her previous visit had been limited to his personal area, never daring to venture into the heart of the residence. Unbeknownst to her, a world of extravagance awaited. The luxury that unfolded before her was breathtaking—if destiny granted her the fortune to dwell in such a place, she would die content! After her tour, the desire to explore upstairs tugged at her, but she held back, remembering her promise. Once outside, Wu Pingyang asked in a low tone, 'Shixin, who was that woman we saw earlier?' 'That's Auntie Chen, the steward of our kitchens. Her culinary artistry is second to none,' he informed her. 'I see.' With noon on the horizon, Fan Shixin queried, 'Would you like to dine here, or shall I take you to a restaurant?' 'Here is fine; no need for extra fuss.' 'What would you like to eat?' he continued to probe. 'Is there a choice in the matter?' Wu Pingyang looked up, 'I am in the mood for something delectable.' 'Speak your wish. If it's within my means, I'll satisfy it.' 'I'm in the mood for red wine and steak.' Fan Shixin nodded, 'Consider it done. I'll speak to the kitchen. You can wait for me in the security office.' 'Very well.' She obediently made her way there while Fan Shixin went to pass on the instructions and also reached out to An Xiaoning. It was deep into the night in Country R, but An Xiaoning was still awake. 'Young Madam, have you retired for the night?' 'Not yet. What's on your mind, Shixin?' He pondered before speaking up, 'My girlfriend has invited me to dine with her family. I'm uncertain about the appropriate gifts to bring.' 'You should prepare at least two gifts, one for each of her parents.' 'It's not just her parents...' Fan Shixin coughed slightly, 'She's asked me to visit her grandfather's place—the Mu Family estate.' 'Isn't it customary to meet with the parents first? If you're heading to her grandfather's, you'll need to present gifts of a certain caliber. Otherwise, it might seem disrespectful. You'll have to consider gifts for her parents, uncles, aunts, and grandfather. However, if marriage isn't yet on the table, perhaps it's best not to meet all these relatives just yet. Or else, could you afford it if you had to do this every few weeks?' 'Today, she mentioned her grandfather has a taste for Blueocean. She suggested I bring a bottle, saying it would make a fine impression.' 'That's a rather forward request for such a new relationship,' An Xiaoning chuckled on the other end. 'There's no need for such grand gestures at this stage. Here's what you'll do: pick a bottle from our cellar, something in the range of twenty to thirty thousand, for her grandfather. Depending on how many uncles she has, get some fine cigars as well. Make sure her father gets the same treatment—fair is fair. There's no need to go out and buy anything; what we have at home is more than enough. That would already be a gesture of remarkable generosity.' Convinced by her advice, Fan Shixin expressed his thanks, 'I appreciate it, Young Madam.' 'Don't forget to dress smartly,' she added. 'Understood.' After the call, he promptly prepared the gifts, making sure they were nicely packaged. With the gifts in hand, he returned to the security office. Wu Pingyang, noticing the gift bags, inquired, 'What's all this?' 'Wine and cigars for your grandfather, uncles, and your father.' 'And what about my mother and aunts?' 'It's not necessary to gift something to everyone; we're not engaged, let alone married. The main thing is to bring a sign of goodwill.' 'How can you bring gifts for the men and not for the women? What would my mother and aunts think? Besides, this is your first visit; how can you be so casual?' 'Casual? These gifts are worth between fifty and sixty thousand. Are such valuable gifts really considered casual on a first visit? They're quite substantial.' Fan Shixin asked, 'Are you expecting me to bring over a hundred thousand in gifts on a first visit?' Wu Pingyang looked at him, her lip caught between her teeth, 'It's clear you don't care about me. I never asked for gifts of several thousands for my mother and aunts, but isn't a gesture of respect expected?' Holding back his frustration, Fan Shixin agreed, 'Alright, I'll pick up some additional gifts on our way.' Typically, Wu Pingyang's fiery spirit would have seen her leave by now, but she knew the stakes; any mistake here wouldn't be lightly overlooked by her family. She curbed her fiery temper, conceding with a pained admission, 'Alright, my hunger gnaws at me.' 'I'll take you to eat.' 'Yes.' Fan Shixin's first encounter with the Mu family left him feeling uneasy. Something about them—Wu Pingyang's grandfather, her parents, uncles, and aunts—didn't sit right with him. Their scrutinizing looks felt too revealing, their expectations too clear. Though he prided himself on being unflappable in any setting, he now realized the challenge of spending an afternoon, possibly even an evening, with a group so relentlessly inquisitive. They were tactless, broaching not only the subject of marriage but also other taboo topics—business dealings, and matters concerning Jin Qingyan and An Xiaoning. He expertly avoided these discussions, much to their visible chagrin, as they failed to extract any valuable information from him. Chapter 1309: Only You (7) Wu Pingyang could discern her grandfather's dissatisfaction, her own countenance losing its luster as she felt her esteem wane. She whispered to Fan Shixin, who was seated beside her, 'When Elder Donggong asks you something, can't you humor him a little? Your silence is unbearably dull.' Fan Shixin, unwavering in his integrity, responded, 'They persist in asking about matters I'm sworn to keep confidential. There are lines I cannot cross; it's a matter of principle.' 'Such a bore,' Wu Pingyang complained under her breath, her perception of him diverging from the man she had imagined. 'What did you utter?' Fan Shixin's brows drew together as he detected a fleeting expression of impatience on her visage. 'Nothing of consequence.' The inclination to leave immediately was strong for Fan Shixin, but duty bound, he endured and stayed until the evening drew to a close. At dinner, the attendees persistently offered him toasts. Even with his considerable tolerance for wine, the relentless drinking eventually led to a hint of inebriation. Repeatedly, he waved them off, citing the responsibility of driving himself home, but Wu Pingyang's uncle insisted, ensuring a chauffeur would take him back. Yielding to their insistent toasting, he continued to drink. Ultimately, with a nauseating sensation, he resolutely ceased drinking. As a key member of Jin Qingyan's inner circle, he adhered to a strict rule: never allow himself to be incapacitated by alcohol in such settings, to avoid vulnerability. His foresight proved prudent. Upon the suggestion by Wu Pingyang's mother that he stay the night at the Mu Family Manor, he became fully alert, declining repeatedly with resolve. Despite the Mu family's insistent hospitality, he remained firm in his refusal. They arranged for his car to be driven back, and Wu Pingyang was tasked with his care. Once at Winnie Community, Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai assisted Fan Shixin from the vehicle. Squinting, he addressed Wu Pingyang, 'Please return...' 'You've had too much to drink. I shall stay and take care of you,' she insisted. 'Young Madam, we are here for that. We shall look after him. You should go back,' Xiao Bai said with a hint of mirth. Before he could finish, Xiao Huang chided him, 'Mind your words.' Considering her intent to maintain an image of purity before Fan Shixin, Wu Pingyang nodded and re-entered the car, advising through the window, 'Prepare some hangover remedy for him.' 'Certainly, Young Madam. Travel safely,' they replied as her car departed. After she left, Xiao Huang commented, 'Why did you send her away when she was willing to stay, you fool?' 'Didn't you see the captain suggesting she leave? It's clear he doesn't want her to spend the night here,' Xiao Bai retorted. Xiao Huang turned to Fan Shixin, 'Captain, why did you drink so much?' 'I was being constantly plied with drinks... My stomach's in knots... Ugh...' Unable to hold back, Fan Shixin vomited there and then. The relief was immediate, and his mind began to clear. Xiao Bai called for someone to clean the mess, and after they escorted Fan Shixin inside, they served him a concoction to counteract the alcohol. They left once he had taken it. After a brief respite, Fan Shixin awoke with a headache that was no small matter, though the effects of the alcohol had largely subsided, leaving him with no desire to sleep. He washed up, dressed in clean clothes, and ventured outside. It was now eleven at night. Xiao Bai, on night duty, saw Fan Shixin rise and yawned, 'Captain, what brings you out of bed?' 'My head's pounding; sleep eludes me,' Fan Shixin replied, his voice rough with discomfort. 'I should have kept silent. Had Young Madam stayed by your side, you'd be sleeping soundly by now,' Xiao Bai teased, offering a conspiratorial wink. 'Enough. Do not call her Young Madam so casually; we have not yet taken marital vows,' Fan Shixin chided. 'What does it matter? Our Young Madam and Young Master haven't formalized their reunion, yet we still address her as Young Madam. Captain, perhaps you're merely shy? There's no need for such pretenses; the Young Madam herself wasn't perturbed.' Fan Shixin instructed him, 'Aren't you supposed to sleep during the day? Appear more alert.' 'Yes, Captain!' Xiao Bai jolted to attention, his eyes wide, mustering all his energy. Fan Shixin took hold of the mouse, scanning the community's surveillance. While monitoring, he noticed that the lights in his residence were still on. It was quite late; why had she not retired for the night? 'How has Miss Mu been coping with the meals you've been delivering?' he inquired. 'She's been managing well, but she no longer wishes us to deliver food,' Xiao Bai responded. 'Why is that?' Fan Shixin pressed. 'Miss Mu finds it burdensome for us to bring meals thrice daily. She suggested we deliver groceries, allowing her to cook for herself and fill her time. Today, we've stocked her refrigerator; she should have enough for the next few days.' Fan Shixin hummed in acknowledgment and departed from the guardroom. Droplets of rain began to fall outside. He exited the main gate and proceeded to his quarters. After entering his passcode, Fan Shixin silently advanced inside, the sound of the door closing barely perceptible. He paused at the guest bedroom door and knocked with decorum. Her voice inquired from within, 'Who is it?' 'It is I.' 'Enter, please.' Pushing the door open, he found her seated on the bed, engaged in cross-stitching, 'Not resting yet?' 'Sleep proves elusive.' Mu Wansheng detected a faint scent of alcohol, 'You have been drinking?' 'Even after a shower and brushing my teeth, the scent lingers, doesn't it?' he admitted. 'It is faint, but yes. You seem to have consumed a fair amount.' 'I paid a visit to your family this afternoon, and they saw fit to ply me with drink.' Mu Wansheng placed her needlework aside, 'Is there talk of an engagement?' 'No such discussions. Pingyang mentioned that Grand Elder Donggong wished to meet me, so I obliged.' 'It must have incurred a considerable expense?' Mu Wansheng inquired with certainty. 'Young Madam Mu had me select a bottle of wine valued in the tens of thousands and several fine cigars from the storeroom.' Mu Wansheng drew a deep breath, 'Captain Fan, does your heart lean towards Pingyang?' Fan Shixin locked eyes with her, 'One could say there's a measure of affection, yes.' Mu Wansheng hesitated, her voice caught. She harbored no desire to meddle, yet could not bear to see a benevolent man deceived, 'The Mu family elders, save for my mother, eagerly anticipate your union with Pingyang. To be precise, my grandfather is quite intent on it. However, Pingyang's affections towards you are not without ulterior motives.' She spoke with a subdued earnestness, her hands tightly clasping her blanket. 'Matches are not just about affection; they hinge on the right conditions,' Fan Shixin understood well, 'which is why I'm in no hurry to marry. It's prudent to thoroughly understand one another before making such a life-altering commitment.' Chapter 1310: Only You (8) Mu Wansheng offered a gentle smile. "Fan Shixin, your kindness won't go unnoticed by Pingyang."  "Do you really see goodness in me?"  "Undoubtedly, you are the kindest soul to me in the entire world."  Fan Shixin found himself unexpectedly moved by her mention of 'the entire world', a smile gracing his lips. "What if I choose to pursue you instead of Pingyang?"  Mu Wansheng looked at him, startled. "Captain..." Seeing her reaction, Fan Shixin let out a laugh. "Did that frighten you? I was only jesting." Mu Wansheng cast her gaze downward. "The night has grown late. You should return and rest; I'm quite tired myself." Fan Shixin's smile faded to a more serious expression. "Very well, good night." "Good night." Mu Wansheng slowly reclined, stretching out an arm to switch off the light. He quietly closed the door behind him. She touched her face, which felt feverishly hot. To her embarrassment, she realized she had taken his playful words to heart, her cheeks now flushed with a mix of embarrassment and shame. How could she have failed to recognize a simple jest? Was she too gullible? After all, he was Pingyang's boyfriend, and soon to be her own cousin-in-law. As the term 'cousin-in-law' crossed her mind, Mu Wansheng's spirits dampened, for she knew that once healed, she would have to face the Mu family again. She couldn't forever hide away in this room; there were debts awaiting repayment. The Mu family would, sooner or later, discover her whereabouts. Thinking of this, she cherished the present moment of safety and the lack of worries even more. Her lifelong yearning was for a warm home, a place where the wealth of her partner mattered little compared to kindness. She was ready to strive alongside him towards a future together. Now, all seemed lost, her hopes extinguished. Mu Wansheng closed her eyes, and a solitary tear traced its way down her cheek. As dawn approached, An Xiaoning, Henry, Wu Lianzhi, and Xiao Chenyang made their return. Upon arriving back at Winnie Community and stepping onto its soil, a sense of profound security enveloped them. An Xiaoning had begun to consider this place more than just a residence; it was her home. After settling Wu Lianzhi and Xiao Chenyang into their guest rooms, An Xiaoning and Henry ascended the stairs. Entering the bedroom, she flung off her slippers and dove onto the bed, sinking into its soft embrace. "Ah, what comfort this is." "After having rested for so long, do you still wish to sleep?" Henry inquired. "No, I shall first cleanse my face, apply a mask, and then lie in repose to contemplate our next steps," An Xiaoning replied. While Henry showered, she lay on the bed, leisurely applying a facial mask. Once he returned, clad in a bathrobe and towel-drying his hair, he began to rummage through her skincare products. "Your skin surpasses mine in quality without any effort; why do you bother with these?" he quipped. "Should one wait until they are old and withered before they start caring for their skin?" An Xiaoning retorted, a hint of a smile in her voice. "You'll never grow old, and you'll live for many years to come, so there's no need for concern," she added. He took her words lightly, jesting further. "If I were to stay forever young while you aged into a wrinkled old woman..." Her eyes shot him a sharp look as she interrupted, "Then prepare for disappointment, for I shall neither age nor perish." "What a delightful wish," he remarked casually. "I speak the truth," An Xiaoning insisted. "Oh, indeed?" Henry replied, his tone laced with playful skepticism. "Yes, really!" she affirmed. He patted his face with a towel, advancing toward her and nodding with faux solemnity. "Fine, I concede it's true." She stretched her leg out to the bed's edge as he made to sit down. He unhesitatingly took a seat atop her leg. "Ah!!!!" An Xiaoning rolled to her side and kicked at his neck with her free foot. "The bed is mine; seek your slumber upon the sofa." "Is it emblazoned with your name, by chance?" he teased. "If you stay, I'll be compelled to touch, to kiss, and who knows what else," she threatened playfully. "Then proceed. But do so knowing the risk of finding yourself against the wall once more," he warned, casually tossing her leg aside and settling into the bed. "Henry, you've grown quite audacious," An Xiaoning observed. "Even the meekest rabbit may leap when cornered," he responded with a proverbial shrug. An Xiaoning rose from the bed, fetched a needle so fine it was nearly invisible, and swiftly pricked his hand. He jerked in surprise, attempting to withdraw his hand, but she quickly brought it to her lips. "What are you doing?" Henry exclaimed, a mix of confusion and alarm in his voice. "Sampling your blood," she declared with a mysterious air. "...You've lost your mind," he stated flatly. An Xiaoning released his hand, seemingly indifferent, and settled back onto the bed. Henry eyed his hand, now glistening with her saliva, with an expression of utmost revulsion. He rose to cleanse it before returning. "That was revolting," he commented. "Oh, was it enough to make you wish for death?" An Xiaoning teased, her laugh carrying an unsettling undertone. "You call that revulsion?" she continued, drawing closer to him. "I could share a tale so vile it would render you speechless for a minute at least." "I'd rather remain ignorant," he declined. "Indulge me. It concerns your own deeds," she pressed. "I've made my stance clear: I do not wish to hear it," he said firmly, knowing full well his protests would do little to dissuade her. An Xiaoning whispered something then, a remark that turned Henry's face a shade of deep crimson. "Nonsense, I refuse to believe such a thing." She left the room, returning shortly with her phone in hand. "Disbelieving, are you? Allow me to present the surveillance footage," she offered. Conflicted yet curious, Henry snatched the phone from her and retreated to the bathroom. An Xiaoning watched his retreat with amusement, murmuring, "Let him deny it; the proof is irrefutable." Henry was at once astounded and incredulous, his mind struggling to accept that his body could have acted in such a manner. It felt as if his privacy had been stripped bare in an instant before An Xiaoning. He knew there had been numerous intimate moments between his body and An Xiaoning, as their child was living proof. But he hadn't anticipated that he would have personally cared for her needs. And allowed her to film it! In that moment, his mind seemed on the verge of imploding. He hastily deleted the video and emerged, glaring. An Xiaoning reached out, and he placed the phone in her hand, his voice silenced by shock and embarrassment. Observing that he had eradicated the video, she calmly informed him, "The original footage is stored on my computer; what you deleted was merely a duplicate." "Do you intend to have a tech wizard extract it and broadcast it for the entire world to see?" he asked, eyeing her warily. "Certainly not," she replied with a smile. Chapter 1311: Only You (9) "Certainly not, the video was made on a whim during an impassioned moment and later saved in a hidden file on my computer. But rest assured, I've already deleted it after copying it earlier. You looked so anxious." Relieved, Henry's tension eased. He had seen himself in an indescribable encounter with her in the video, but he had no recollection of it, nor any sense of what it might have felt like. "You're quite the thrill-seeker, aren't you?" "Isn't that quite normal?" An Xiaoning propped her head with one hand while looking at him, "Do you want to continue sleeping, or get up?" "And you?" "I'm wide awake now; I'll be getting up soon." "Then you go ahead, I want to sleep." "......" —— Dreams are full, but reality is harsh; Henry wished to sleep, but his wish was denied. During breakfast, everyone took their places, and Wu Lianzhi, being a guest, didn't appear as comfortable as the others, showing a hint of reserve. The mood was lively when Long Tianze arrived, humming a tune. "Hello, my dear friends, I've arrived." Xiao Chenyang glanced at An Xiaoning, who caught his silent cue, and they shared a tacit smile. "What's so special about your arrival?" asked Henry. "I missed you all, that's why!" "Get lost." Unfazed, Long Tianze shrugged, "I haven't eaten yet. Mind if I join you? Auntie Chen, can you pass me a pair of chopsticks?" "Of course." That was just like Long Tianze, casual and carefree among friends. After receiving chopsticks from Auntie Chen, he settled down to enjoy the meal. "And who might this be?" He looked in Wu Lianzhi's direction. "Hello, I am Wu Lianzhi." "Long Tianze." At the sound of his name, Wu Lianzhi froze momentarily, his memory of Long Tianze prompting him to take a second look. Sensing Wu Lianzhi's gaze, Long Tianze quipped, "Why keep staring? Taken a fancy to me?" Wu Lianzhi laughed off the remark, "Hardly, you just seem like a decent man." Pleased with the compliment, Long Tianze's grin widened, "Obviously, I'm Country S's number one great guy, right, Qingyan?" Henry bluntly stated, "You've blown your own trumpet so much you've almost forgotten your own name." "Is there a need for exaggeration? It's simply the truth. Xiaoning, haven't I always been good to our Yangyang? Whatever she says goes—I never argue." "Indeed, Tianze has been nothing but good to Yangyang," An Xiaoning affirmed. "Hear that, Qingyan?" Henry continued his meal in silence. After breakfast, Xiao Chenyang had someone bring over Wu Haigang, the elder of the Wu family. He then turned to An Xiaoning, "He may not have martial arts skills, but his Witchcraft Cauldron Technique is formidable. He could potentially lift the curse on you and Qingyan if we handle it right. Do you have any ideas on how to convince him to help?" "In the end, life is all anyone cares about. It's his choice whether he wants to cling to it. He must know that even if he helps lift the curse, he likely won't survive after revealing our Eight Characters of Birth Time—a crucial component of our astrological profiles. Knowing too much, how could we let him live? That path is doomed from the start. We might have better luck with a different approach, something he'd be willing to trade for." Xiao Chenyang listened intently, "What might that be?" "His family lineage. We both know why his family changed their surname and relocated to Country R. Changing one's family name is a significant ordeal, so future generations are of utmost importance." Xiao Chenyang agreed, "You make a good point. Let's proceed with that plan. After all, what's the distinction of his family if their unique skills are gone? They're no different from ordinary people. But aren't you going to check on everyone else?" An Xiaoning nodded, "I was just heading there. Will you wait here for me?" "Sure." As An Xiaoning visited the others, Long Tianze and Wu Lianzhi were conversing in the living room; Mei Yangyang was not in sight. "Long Tianze, where's Yangyang?" "She went to her studio early to talk to the two boys and a girl she picked from school." "What are you two gentlemen discussing?" "Just some man-to-man topics," Long Tianze said with a chuckle, "I’ve discovered that our friend Wu here has quite a sense of humor." "Humorous?" An Xiaoning mused, as she had yet to discern Wu Lianzhi's humorous streak. "Yes, Xiaoning, he's quite the character." "When will Yangyang return?" "Soon, I expect. She left for work without breakfast, planning to eat once she's back." An Xiaoning checked the time and then took a seat, "Lianzhi, did you know? Tianze and Yangyang's daughter has been betrothed to my son." Wu Lianzhi nodded, "He mentioned it, but it seems somewhat traditional to arrange betrothals for such young children." "I absolutely adore our little dumpling, little Xi. She's as plump and adorable as Yangyang - simply irresistible." Pride shone in Long Tianze's eyes, "That's my little sweetheart. You have to love her." An Xiaoning playfully remarked, "Just look at him, brimming with joy at the mention of his little treasure." Wu Lianzhi smiled, "It's evident, Brother Long, that you have a truly happy family." "Indeed," Long Tianze agreed. An Xiaoning expressed mild irritation, "Could you two please stop using those nicknames?" "Is there a problem?" "Certainly. Long Tianze, when you call him 'Brother Wu', it sounds like 'without chest', and Lianzhi, when you say 'Brother Long', others might think you're calling for a 'chest enhancement'. You two really are quite the match. Is this some sort of nickname camaraderie on your first meeting?" The playful analysis made both men chuckle, having not considered the nicknames' connotations. Half an hour later, Mei Yangyang returned. Dressed in jeans and a beige sweater, she entered, carrying her handbag. "Husband, I'm home." "Ah, wife, we have a guest," Long Tianze announced. "Who is it?" Mei Yangyang peered at the sofa as she finished changing her shoes. Upon seeing Wu Lianzhi, she hesitated, "And this is...?" "He's my friend, Wu Lianzhi. Tianze and he seem to have hit it off right from their first encounter today." Mei Yangyang approached with a smile, "He's always been quite the social butterfly." Chapter 1312: Only You (10) Wu Lianzhi watched her, his heart inexplicably warmed despite the absence of any shared memories. "Hello." Mei Yangyang responded, "Hello." ... As they left the courtyard, An Xiaoning could sense Wu Lianzhi's calm composure. "How do you feel?" she inquired. "Seeing her so content, I'm genuinely happy," he replied. An Xiaoning patted his shoulder reassuringly. "Don't worry, you'll find happiness too. Some ties are meant for past lives, not this one. Plan for your future and let me know what job you'd like. I'll help you arrange it if I can." Together, they entered the grand gate, and Wu Lianzhi reflected, "I can tell her husband is a good man. With such an optimistic partner, it's hard to have a bad life. I'm reassured and at peace. As for my future, I want to live a stable life, to share joy with a girl who can bring happiness. To meet the right girl, I suppose I should start in places where they're likely to be, right?" An Xiaoning agreed, "That's sound reasoning." Shortly after their return, Wu Haigang was brought before them. An Xiaoning scrutinized the man who looked to be in his forties yet showed no signs of age. "Hello, Mr. Wu. You're acquainted with this man; he was once of the Wu lineage, like yourself." He looked up, eyes flashing with disdain. "He is unworthy of the Wu name." "Oh? And you deem yourself worthy?" An Xiaoning retorted. "Today, you have no choice. Your life has long been inconsequential. It's whether you wish to doom your entire Wu lineage that's at stake. "Including him?" He pointed at Wu Lianzhi. "No, though he has reclaimed the Wu surname, he's no longer part of your family. Mr. Wu, you should be well aware of my status. A noble family in R country is trivial. One bomb could deal significant damage, don't you agree? With R country in turmoil, you must choose: lift our curse or protect your kin." "How can I trust you?" he started. "Trust that you won't go back on your word?" "You have no choice," An Xiaoning plainly stated. "Did you think I've forgotten your family's attempt on my life? A noble family conspiring to kill a foreign national, especially me, will not go unnoticed by my country. If I wish, I have many ways to make your family pay dearly and ensure their utter destruction. Wouldn't you wish to witness that?" Wu Haigang closed his eyes, bereft of words. Indeed, if it were just his life, so be it. But the prospect of his entire clan's annihilation would brand him as the Wu family's greatest traitor, incapable of facing his ancestors in the afterlife. He acknowledged the gravity of his situation. —— "Sister Erlan, I've heard that Director Jing Tian's filming has wrapped up, and he's leaving today." "Does his departure make any difference?" Fang Erlan mused, applying lipstick. "Aside from being diligent at the start, he's been absent. The director said a double completed many of his scenes. If this were his brother's production, such use of a double would be unacceptable." "Director Jing Tian has high standards and would never allow such frequent use of a double," Xiao Yue concurred. "By the way, Sister Erlan, when is Cousin-in-law returning?" "Very soon." "I'm craving the treats he brings you. I get to indulge too." "You little foodie," Fang Erlan chided playfully, rising from her seat. "Let's go." "Okay." Xiao Yue grabbed her bag and followed, with a line of bodyguards in tow. The queenly procession was hard to miss. While Yu Caiwei arrived with a handful of bodyguards, Erlan brought an entourage of eight. Their collective presence formed a stately convoy. They were at a promotional event for a TV drama – a meet-and-greet with fans. Most attendees were there for Yan Ge's female fans. Fang Erlan's fandom paled in comparison. Although her fame had risen, it benefited largely from her public relationship with Yan Ge. With none of her series aired, where would her fans come from? Unbeknownst to her, a modest group of about twenty fans had indeed arrived. They were a small contingent amongst the several hundred... The event neared its end after about half an hour when an incident occurred. As Fang Erlan descended, making her closest approach to the audience, a man in his fifties made an unexpected move towards her. It wasn't a typical lunge; he dodged under a bodyguard's arm to reach her. The venue instantly became chaotic. Fang Erlan was caught off guard and fell onto the bodyguard at her side. Another bodyguard instinctively yanked her away, tossing the intruder to the ground with lightning speed. The crowd recoiled, and the middle-aged man hit the floor hard. Fang Erlan stood firm, her composure quickly returning as she swiftly left the area. Xiao Yue was fuming, venting her anger in the van. "That damned old man must be tired of living. If Cousin-in-law were here, he'd break his arm for sure." Fang Erlan calmed herself, choosing silence over words. Xiao Yue mistook her silence for upset and tried to console her. "Sister Erlan, don't worry. Our bodyguard brothers took care of that old man, didn't they?" "Xiao Yue, what do you plan to do in the future?" Caught off guard, Xiao Yue replied, "What do I plan to do?" "I want to keep working with you." "What if I leave show business?" Xiao Yue looked steadfastly at her. "Then I'd still want to be with you, Sister Erlan." "If I leave the industry, you can't follow me. Xiao Yue, your family is just getting by, right? You once said owning a home in Alton City was your biggest dream, right?" "Yes, but with the housing prices, it's impossible on my salary." "How much have you saved?" Fang Erlan inquired. "A little over thirty thousand." "What if I bought you a one-bedroom apartment?" Xiao Yue was astounded. "Sister, that's extremely generous. Even the cheapest one-bedroom is over a million. I haven't been with you long enough; you've already done so much for me." Chapter 1313: Only You (11) "Are you certain you won't take it?" "No, thank you," Xiao Yue responded. "Fang Erlan, you earn your money through hard work every day. Please, keep it for yourself; I'm confident that I will eventually save enough for the down payment." Fang Erlan didn't press further. Returning to her hotel room for rest, she sat on the bed, engrossed in the search for real estate online. Xiao Yue had been part of her life for about a year. Their daily interactions would come to an end when Fang Erlan exited the entertainment world. She wished to do something meaningful for Xiao Yue. Xiao Yue had always been more than generous, caring for and looking after her. When the doorbell chimed, Fang Erlan had already been perusing several housing communities. Confident in the security presence, she opened the door without hesitation. Greeted by the man at the threshold, a smile graced her features, "Have you returned?" "Yes." He stepped in, shutting the door behind him. Sweeping her off her feet, he carried her further inside, "What have you been up to?" "House hunting." "House hunting?" Xiao Chenyang placed her gently on the bed, his gaze falling on the laptop. "For a one-bedroom place?" he questioned, puzzled. "Our home should have more space." "It's not for us; it's for Xiao Yue." Xiao Chenyang removed his shoes. "Does she have the financial means for a house?" "No, I intend to buy it for her." "That's commendable." He sat next to her, draping an arm over her shoulder, "So, which one caught your eye?" "Take a look at these," she said, pointing them out one by one. "This one in Sanqiao seems perfect—good ventilation and lighting. Plus, isn't An Xiaoning's apartment also in that area? Let's settle on this one." Encouraged by his endorsement, Fang Erlan made her choice and jotted down the contact information. Then she broached, "Should we also get our own house in order? It will take some time after renovation, not to mention, we can't move in immediately—it needs to air out for a few months." "There's no need for the hassle of another renovation. Let's find a place that's already furnished and well-decorated. Captain Fan mentioned a fully furnished villa in the Winnie District that's up for sale at a fair price. We should buy that." "A villa?" Fang Erlan sought confirmation. "Is it like the one Sister Yangyang lives in?" "Quite." "Then let's go ahead with that purchase." "Agreed." "Today, at an event, an elderly man took advantage of the situation and knocked me over." As she saw the flame ignite in his eyes, she quickly added, "Luckily, our bodyguard was on the ball and tossed him out immediately." Fang Erlan set aside the computer and small table, then took her seat beside him, facing him earnestly, "To be honest, did you miss me these past few days?" "I didn't miss you; I missed Fang Xiaogou more." She feigned annoyance. "You're the little dog." He enveloped her in his arms as they lay down. "Alright, I'm the little dog, and you're the woman who sleeps with the little dog." "..." Fang Erlan gave him a playful pinch. "Can't you speak properly?" "Certainly... Mrs. Xiao." Now satisfied, Fang Erlan inquired, "Is everything sorted out?" "Mostly, although it's been quite amusing." He turned toward her. "Let me recount the details to you." "I'm all ears," she replied, eager to listen. --- The hospital. An Xiaoning and Henry arrived together to visit Elder Jin. Captain Fan had informed them that Elder Jin had awakened and was no longer in critical condition; he simply needed to rest well in the hospital. Henry had been reluctant to come, but An Xiaoning had insisted. Upon their entry into the ward, they found Elder Jin engrossed in a newspaper. He looked up at their arrival and snorted, "So many days have passed, and this is when you, as a son, come to see me. Is that justifiable?" Without mincing words, Henry responded, "That I've come at all is nothing short of a miracle; what more do you expect?" "What do you mean by 'miracle'? Remember, I am your father!" "You recall now that you're my father?" Henry's tone was icy, not wishing to engage further, "When will you behave appropriately?" Elder Jin, choked with anger, abandoned the newspaper on the bedside table. "Uncle, how are you feeling?" An Xiaoning inquired, depositing the fruit basket. "Much better, thank you." "Qingyan has been feeling unwell these days and couldn't visit, but he has been worried about you. Uncle, could you perhaps avoid the casino in the future? You didn't go often before, and if you're bored now, maybe you could travel or partake in activities with your peers? That would be more substantial." Elder Jin let out a disdainful snort. "What's the point in mingling with people I don't know? It's pointless." "Yes, because losing money is so fulfilling," Henry interjected with a hint of sarcasm. "Now that you're in the hospital, you can't gamble, can you?" "Do you get a kick out of bickering with me?" Elder Jin retorted, frustration evident. "If you have nothing more to say, then leave—all of you, leave." Henry grabbed An Xiaoning's arm without another word, turned, and walked out. Once outside the room, he released her arm and remarked, "I told you it was pointless to visit him, but you insisted." "Your father is in the hospital, and it's proper that we visit to prevent any unpleasant talk. It was necessary," she explained. He was visibly impatient. "I would rather go home and see Wangcai and Fugui than visit him." "..." An Xiaoning was speechless. "Well, we've seen him; let's head back." Though the visit to Elder Jin was accomplished, another destination awaited them. When he realized she wasn't driving back to the Winnie District, he asked, "Where are you headed?" "To the Devil's Training Camp." He remained silent, letting her drive into the grounds of the training camp. On the way, An Xiaoning had procured gifts for the children, including two for Long Tianze's kids, one for each child. The children were delighted with their gifts. By the time they returned, an hour had passed. Wu Haigang had agreed to lift their curse, but it would have to wait until Jin Qingyan's birthday on the sixteenth of October. It was soon approaching, so there was no rush for these last few days. For the time being, Wu Haigang was being held in custody. An Xiaoning had also had someone check Wu Lianzhi's information abroad. She had initially planned to transfer her household registration to Country S, but to her surprise, it had been canceled there, saving her some trouble. He had gone to the Public Security Bureau to apply for his own household registration. Thanks to An Xiaoning's prior arrangements, it was processed swiftly. When he returned, he found An Xiaoning sipping coffee, waiting for him. "I almost forgot something," he began. "What is it?" "You still haven't answered my question about why your people here were after my hair," he said, a hint of embarrassment in his voice. Chapter 1314: Only You (12) "Honestly, I was hesitant to tell you, but after seeing that mural, I was struck by a rather audacious thought." "What kind of thought?" "I wanted to have your hair tested to see if we share any blood relation." An Xiaoning, taken aback, had not anticipated this reason at all. "I kept it to myself because I feared your revulsion." "There's nothing revolting about it." As she finished speaking, the voice of Xiao Lv filtered through from outside, "Madam, representatives from the Donggong Clan overseas have arrived at the gates." She had foreseen their approach, yet their promptness was unexpected. "Invite them in." "Very well." "Do I need to... excuse myself?" he inquired. "Why bother? Are we intimidated by them?" "Certainly not." An Xiaoning gestured to the servant, "Another cup of coffee, please." "Right away, Madam." The group from the Donggong Clan included several sons of the Donggong Patriarch and a number of grandsons. All were influential male members of the Clan. "Please, have a seat." One by one, the six or seven men sat down. The Eldest Elder Donggong initiated the conversation, "Miss An, we come today with two objectives: firstly, to offer you a sincere apology, and secondly, to plead for the release of our Elder Donggong." "I accept your apology. But as for releasing your elder—how does that arise? I know nothing of him. Who is he? What does he look like? What's his name?" Wu Lianzhi had not foreseen her outright denial, but guessing at her motives, remained silently seated. The men from the Donggong Clan were visibly confounded by her blunt denial. "Miss An, let's speak plainly. We've ascertained that our Elder Donggong is under your care." "Any proof to support that claim?" "Well..." The men exchanged glances, "But we're absolutely certain of it." "I'm sorry, but certainties are void without proof," she refused to concede any leverage, "Accusations cannot be made so recklessly." "Miss An," the Second Elder Donggong interjected, "state your terms. Whatever it takes to secure his release, we will comply." "Must I reiterate myself?" she responded with composure, "I truly have not taken your so-called elder." However, they did not believe her, convinced she was merely not admitting to it. Seeing her resolute stance, the men found themselves at an impasse. They were unaware that An Xiaoning intended for them to depart in vain, as she had no intention of sparing Wu Haigang's life. "Miss An..." After a tense minute of silence, the Eldest Elder Donggong spoke, "If you consent to free our Elder Donggong, the Donggong Clan will swear allegiance to you. This is the patriarch's own pledge." Wu Lianzhi froze completely. "Why would your father..." She trailed off, leaving her question unfinished. "Our Clan has long lost the Witchcraft Cauldron Technique, and the elder is the sole keeper of that knowledge. Without him, there is no hope for our revival." "Revival?" An Xiaoning queried with a sly smile, "To propagate your witchcraft and continue afflicting others?" "That wasn't my implication." Unmoved by his words, An Xiaoning remained firm, "I'm genuinely unaware of the elder's whereabouts. Please, if there's nothing more, I must ask you to leave; your company is no longer needed." She delivered a decisive expulsion. The Donggong delegation was left without recourse, even after playing their trump card. Her unwavering stance left them utterly out of options. And so it was. The Eldest Elder Donggong, left with no alternative, knelt down in a last-ditch gesture of desperation. "What are you doing? I've told you, I haven't seen your family elder. Do you expect me to conjure him out of thin air?" "..." Ultimately, they left with nothing to show for their visit. The living room fell silent. An Xiaoning glanced at Wu Lianzhi's stoic face and asked, "Do you see me as heartless too?" "Not in the slightest," Wu Lianzhi assured her with sincerity, "I understand your perspective, and your actions are justified. I am no longer affiliated with the Donggong Clan, hence this is now a matter for others. I withhold my opinion." "Once the curse is undone, this chapter will be conclusively closed. Truthfully, you are the one I should be most thankful to. If it wasn't for you reaching out to me, I might never have discovered your existence, or at least not without a prolonged period. Without your intervention, I wouldn't have learned of these events so swiftly. You know, Xiao Chenyang had sought the Wu descendants but found no trace. After all these years, it's not an easy task. We had presumed extinction due to backlash was the likely cause." "The fact that I could play a part in resolving this matter so fortuitously brings me joy. It's astonishing how fate has brought us together in such an extraordinary manner." As Henry descended the stairs, he caught sight of An Xiaoning and Wu Lianzhi sharing a moment of mutual understanding. Pausing on the staircase, he called to An Xiaoning in an offhand tone, "Come up here for a moment; I need to speak with you." "What about?" "You'll find out once you're here." With that, he turned and ascended, leaving An Xiaoning to follow, believing he had something important to say. It was only upon reaching him that she discovered it was a ruse. "You said you had something to discuss. Were you just toying with me?" "And what if I was?" Without a word, An Xiaoning shot him a look, "Fine, enjoy your games. I'll take my leave now." "Hold on." "Now what?" "When do you plan to send that fellow on his way?" "He'll reside here for the time being. We'll decide in due course," An Xiaoning reasoned, considering that the curse should be lifted and Wu Lianzhi's household registration settled before arranging his departure. "Decide in due course?" Henry's mood soured, "I find the presence of an unfamiliar man in our residence disconcerting." "Then put up with the inconvenience, it's only temporary." "An Xiaoning, this is my domain!" "Does that mean you're admitting to being Qingyan?" she approached him provocatively. "Who says we aren't one and the same? Aren't we inherently united?" "Perfect." She settled onto the bed, hands bracing her as she leaned back, a picture of contemplation, "I have a particular need right now, and I'm hoping you can oblige me." A spasm crossed Henry's lips, "You're starting this again..." "What's 'again'? Isn't this perfectly natural? Henry, I believe it's high time for us to establish a deeper connection. I trust you'll earnestly consider my proposal." Chapter 1315: Only You (13) "No need." An Xiaoning briskly turned and made her way out, as his voice echoed from behind, "Where to?" "To meet my destiny." "......" —— After descending from upstairs, An Xiaoning found that Wu Lianzhi was no longer there. She settled onto the couch and turned on the television, which was currently showing an archaeological documentary featuring an interview with Wang Jinsheng. Watching intently, her demeanor was completely relaxed. After a few minutes, she made a call to Pan Zhenghui. "Director Pan, it's me." "Ah... Xiaoning." "Is Wang Jinsheng still heading the archaeological team?" "Yes, but I've been meaning to discuss his case with you. Since your last mention of his involvement with tomb raiding, I've been covertly investigating him. We now have some findings." An Xiaoning was taken aback by the quick progress. "You work with remarkable efficiency." "How could I not take a matter you mentioned seriously?" Pan Zhenghui replied. "It's too convoluted to explain over the phone. Xiaoning, could you come over to the bureau?" "I'll be there shortly." "Good, good." She switched off the television and headed to the bureau. Pan Zhenghui had carefully prepared the documents, and by the time An Xiaoning arrived, he had even brewed some tea. "Here, Xiaoning, try this new tea I bought. Let's sit down and talk this through." Taking the tea, An Xiaoning sat opposite him. "What have you uncovered?" "The investigation into Captain Wang... has led to some dismay. He's always appeared upstanding, but upon closer scrutiny, his true colors have emerged. His recent association with He Yi isn't longstanding, but he's been implicated in transactions involving our nation's cultural relics, secretly profiting from their sale." An Xiaoning, momentarily at a loss for words, finally said, "Then proceed with the investigation and ensure he faces the fair consequences he deserves." "Certainly." "Additionally, keep an eye on He Yi. If he dares to continue his illicit tomb raiding within our borders, handle it as necessary." "Understood." An Xiaoning inquired, "Has the special team found a replacement for Yuan Mingzhu yet?" Pan Zhenghui sighed deeply. "If I had, you'd have been the first to know. It's not easy to find the right person. We thought we had a candidate, but he turned out to be a fraud. Xiaoning, we need your expertise, even if it's just occasionally. Can you manage that? There are cold cases from over two decades ago still unsolved. Without you, they might remain unsolved indefinitely—not due to a lack of evidence, but because of the political sensitivities involved." "What do you mean?" "Isn't it clear?" Pan Zhenghui's voice dropped to a whisper. "The suspects are well-connected; they're practically untouchable." "Alright," An Xiaoning said, "I'll remain as the head of the special team, but I can't be at the bureau every day. My schedule is packed; I can only come in sporadically—perhaps only a few days a month, or even just one." Pan Zhenghui nearly leapt with excitement at her agreement. "Fantastic! Even if it's just for one day, having you is invaluable. Our nation is in dire need of talents like you. There are many major unsolved cases, some for years. Without modern forensics, they were nearly impossible to crack in the past. And as for cases with evidence that we can't close due to powerful suspects, no one is more outraged than I am." "Collect all the information and evidence on those notorious cases and forward them to the special team. I'll review them there." "Will do." An Xiaoning put her teacup down, left the director's office, and headed towards the special team's room. It was unusually quiet. She pushed open the door and saw everyone deep in thought, silent. Zu Dong was the first to notice her and promptly stood up. "Ah, team leader, what brings you here?" "Why all the long faces?" she asked as she entered. "Just the usual case troubles. But what about you, Xiaoning? Is there an urgent matter?" "No, just needed to speak with the director. But I do have some good news to share with you all," she announced, sitting at the table. "Guess what?" The team looked at each other curiously. Good news? "What is it?" "Try guessing." Ma Jianguo speculated, "Could it be... you're rejoining us to lead the special team?" "How did you manage to guess correctly?" An Xiaoning asked with a smile. "Old Ma, you're showing remarkable insight." "Just a hunch," he replied with a chuckle. Gong Le chimed in, "Absolutely, Old Ma's intuition is spot-on—even the unusual doesn't escape his notice." "You rascal! Come here, and I'll show you!" Ma Jianguo feigned anger. Gong Le winked, "Old Ma's about to show his ire!" The previously subdued atmosphere turned lively with their banter. Once the excitement subsided, Ma Jianguo asked with a hint of uncertainty, "Team leader, are you really coming back? You're not just pulling our leg, are you?" "What would be the point in pulling your leg?" An Xiaoning said, leaning back. "I've already discussed it with the director. I can't commit to coming in daily—I'll be available sporadically, maybe just a few days a month, but the director agrees it's acceptable." "Didn't I say today felt like a day for good news? Whether it's a few days or not, just having you is what counts," Ma Jianguo said, his voice filled with excitement. "Indeed. We'll launch new cases once you're done with the current ones. I just wanted to stop by and let you all know ahead of time. I'll leave you to your tasks for now. Keep up the good work, and we'll talk soon." "You've barely warmed your chair, and you're leaving already?" "I wouldn't want to disrupt your focus. Carry on, and we'll catch up another time." With that, she stood and left. On her way back, An Xiaoning stopped at a supermarket to buy some water. Unexpectedly, she encountered Shi Shaochuan and... Bu Qianqian. She had heard that Shi and Bu had parted ways long ago. Curious turn of events, she thought. "Look at you, Bu Qianqian, making a return," An Xiaoning said, initiating conversation while holding a bottle of water. Chapter 1316: Only You (14) 'What do you mean by that?' Bu Qianqian faced her squarely, her eyes sharp. 'How am I capable?' 'Weren't you two split up? How come you're back together?' An Xiaoning's voice was tinged with a hint of mischief and an undercurrent of curiosity. 'That's a matter between us and doesn't concern you,' Bu Qianqian snapped back, her nervousness peeking through her defiance. 'So, mind your own business and move along.' An Xiaoning shrugged indifferently, her tone dripping with feigned concern, 'Oh well, good luck with that.' After watching An Xiaoning walk away, Bu Qianqian, clinging to Shi Shaochuan's arm, muttered, 'Isn't she just insufferable?' 'She's always been such an annoyance, hasn't she?' Shi Shaochuan responded, his voice as distant as a winter's echo. 'Don't bother with her. Did you find everything we came for?' 'Pretty much.' 'Let's go then,' Shi Shaochuan said, and they headed to the cashier. As they left the supermarket, they saw An Xiaoning standing by her car, sipping water and watching them with an inscrutable gaze. 'Shi Shaochuan.' Shi Shaochuan, disinterested, dismissed her with a wave. 'What is it?' 'Do you want a piece of advice, or would you rather not hear it?' An Xiaoning asked, her voice carrying an unspoken warning that seemed to resonate with the supernatural elements of their world. 'Keep your tricks to yourself.' An Xiaoning spread her hands, 'You said it, not me. I won't bother then. But don't you feel a sense of unease within?' She walked around the front of the car, intending to leave, but Shi Shaochuan called out to her, 'Wait.' She rolled down the window, 'Yes?' 'Did you notice something wrong?' he queried, a trace of suspicion in his voice. Bu Qianqian quickly interrupted, 'An Xiaoning, quit your act. We're not buying it.' 'Oh, Bu Qianqian, you're something else,' An Xiaoning said lazily, her eyes fixed on the duo outside, 'Under any other circumstance, Shi Shaochuan, I wouldn't bother giving you advice. You're not exactly a saint. But with Bu Qianqian, the woman I loathe the most, I just can't bear to see her so content. Shi Shaochuan, you're carrying a spectral passenger, a ghostly burden at that.' 'Carrying what?' He looked perplexed. She grinned at him mysteriously, 'What do you think? Figure it out yourself.' Without another word, she rolled up the window and drove off, leaving a sense of unease lingering in the air. Shi Shaochuan stood there, then turned to Bu Qianqian, 'Was she implying that you're the one orchestrating this?' 'Shaochuan, you can't possibly take her seriously. It wasn't me. How could I have such abilities? Don't accuse me wrongly,' Bu Qianqian insisted, her voice laced with desperation. 'She has a grudge against me. You heard her; she can't stand to see me at ease. That detestable An Xiaoning, always spouting nonsense to stir trouble. Don't believe her; she wants to make us both miserable.' 'But how would she know I'm feeling ill?' 'You're pale as death. Anyone with eyes can see that.' Bu Qianqian continued, 'Please, Shaochuan, don't listen to her.' Shi Shaochuan's temples throbbed with an ominous headache, as if presaging darker troubles ahead. He said no more and got into the car, with Bu Qianqian taking her place in the passenger seat as they drove towards the Shi residence. Their drive home was silent. Upon arrival, Shi Shaochuan headed straight to bed, falling into a heavy sleep, while Bu Qianqian sat on the bed's edge, a sly grin curling her lips. Yet, thinking of An Xiaoning, that scheming spirit, made her blood boil, and she yearned to smash her head with a mallet. Thankfully, it seemed Shi Shaochuan harbored no suspicions. Meanwhile, An Xiaoning was reflecting on the encounter during her drive. Shi Shaochuan was undoubtedly haunted by something sinister, a deed that reeked of Bu Qianqian's handiwork. The woman had sunk her claws into dark arts. But meddling with spirits is a perilous affair; fail to appease them, and they bite back. Did Bu Qianqian truly understand the rules of this dangerous game? Foolish woman, she toys with forces beyond her reckoning. An Xiaoning could not fathom her endgame. It appeared Bu Qianqian sought to continue leeching benefits from Shi Shaochuan. Beyond that, her motives were a mystery. An Xiaoning resolved to stay out of it. Everyone's fate was their own to bear. Later that afternoon, Jin Qingyue, heavy with child, arrived. With her due date approaching, the nursery was ready, but the baby's clothes were yet to be chosen. She sought An Xiaoning's company to select the little one's wardrobe. An Xiaoning, free of other commitments, agreed. Wu Lianzhi also came along, mainly to drive and carry purchases. Henry was the initial choice, but An Xiaoning, wary of his temperament, chose not to trouble him. Unbeknownst to her, Henry was sulking by the window, feeling left out. Jin Qingyue's hair was loosely styled, partially concealing her rounded cheeks, now sprinkled with freckles from her pregnancy. She had refrained from makeup throughout her term for the baby's sake, leaving her once radiant skin somewhat dull. Yet, her inherent grace remained undiminished. She carefully made her way downstairs, cautious of every step. An Xiaoning trailed behind, alert to any potential accidents. Wu Lianzhi drove them to a department store, one of the Jin family's many enterprises. Both An Xiaoning and Jin Qingyue rarely visited the store. To avoid attention, and because Jin Qingyue was without makeup, they wore hats and masks—a simple yet effective disguise. Jin Qingyue had come to shop, fully intending to pay rather than charge the family account, so a bit of incognito was easier. As they entered the store, Wu Lianzhi's undisguised face caught the attention of the staff. 'Bring us your best infant boy products and clothing, the whole lot,' he requested with authority. The clerk was stunned, 'Everything, sir?' 'Yes, everything. The finest you have. We'd like to take our pick,' he insisted. The clerk, flustered, quickly fetched the manager, and they presented an array of baby clothes and items. 'These are all the items we have. Please have a look,' the manager said. 'Place them here,' Wu Lianzhi instructed, stepping aside to let the two women make their selections. Jin Qingyue held the tiny garments in her hands, her face alight with joy. An Xiaoning felt a similar warmth at the sight, the instinctive surge of motherly love almost overwhelming. 'This is more than he'll ever wear. Jin Qingyue, let's choose what's comfortable. We don't need so much,' An Xiaoning suggested softly. Jin Qingyue picked a few sets in different sizes, 'Certainly, certainly. They grow up so quickly, so there's no need for excess. A modest assortment will do for now. Let's start with these.' Chapter 1317: Only You (15) After a while, Jin Qingyue selected eight sets, but An Xiaoning felt it wasn't enough and picked out five more. They also chose other infant necessities like diapers and bottles, deciding to buy baby formula later as needed. Once they finished, An Xiaoning told the sales clerk, 'You can take the rest back; we have enough here.' Upon hearing this, the manager, who had been smiling just a moment ago, suddenly turned cold. He sneered, 'Some people pretend to be wealthy, demanding the most expensive and best items, only to buy half in the end.' An Xiaoning explained, 'A dozen sets of baby clothes are ample for now; we can always buy more if needed. Surely A City won't run out of these essentials.' The sales clerk, a mother herself, interjected, 'Manager, we can't force customers to buy; what they've selected is quite sufficient.' Instead of calming the manager, her words only aggravated him further. 'Are you here to teach me how to do my job? Who is the manager here, you or me?' The clerk, intimidated, recoiled, 'You are, of course, the manager.' Jin Qingyue retorted, 'It seems your sales clerk understands better than you do. Maybe you two should switch roles. Manager, why don't you try being a sales clerk? Or better yet, consider resigning.' The manager's anger intensified upon hearing this, but he remembered they were customers and somewhat restrained his temper. 'These matters are internal. Only those capable can be managers, and those who aren't, can only be clerks.' Jin Qingyue, unimpressed by the manager's arrogance, decided to leave the items and said, 'Forget it, we don't want these after all. There are other counters. Sister-in-law, let's look elsewhere.' Seeing that they were not going to purchase anything, the manager became less willing, 'If you want to leave, you need to pay for these items first.' Wu Lianzhi watched with detached interest, 'Isn't this forced selling?' 'If you didn't want them, why did you ask for so many? Are you just playing games with us? Everything's already bagged,' the manager said, gesturing dramatically and summoning several security guards. The implication was clear. At that moment, Jin Qingyue's phone rang. As she reached for it, the manager, mistaking her intent to call for help, snatched the phone away. 'Pay up now, and I'll let you leave,' he demanded. An Xiaoning had reached her limit, 'Who gave you the audacity to bully customers? You can simply unbag the items and put them back. Now, return the phone.' She had hoped to resolve the issue quietly, considering the store was part of the Jin family's business, and a commotion would be unseemly. But the manager, failing to see her intention, refused to give back the phone. With no other choice, An Xiaoning removed her hat and mask. The manager and the sales clerk were shocked into silence upon seeing her face. She approached the manager, reclaimed her phone, and left him with a parting shot, 'You indeed have quite the nerve.' The manager's face turned pale, his earlier assertiveness gone, replaced by spinelessness that left him speechless. 'Miss An... I apologize. I didn't realize who you were. Please accept my apologies,' he fumbled. 'No need for apologies; they're not sincere. It makes no difference whether you offer them or not. Now, call your general manager over,' An Xiaoning demanded. The manager, realizing the gravity of the situation, remained motionless. 'Go,' An Xiaoning ordered the sales clerk, 'and bring your general manager here.' 'Right away.' Moments later, the general manager arrived out of breath, followed by several others. After being briefed by the sales clerk on the way, he addressed An Xiaoning, 'Madam, this is a case where one bad apple spoils the barrel. Our staff would never dare treat customers this way; it's my oversight. Rest assured, I will address this lapse in attitude. This manager will be dismissed immediately.' 'That's reassuring. I wouldn't want to see such an incident happen here again. Understand?' 'Yes, Madam, there won't be a second time,' the general manager assured her, then ordered the sales clerk to bring the items Jin Qingyue had chosen. 'Are you still interested in these items?' An Xiaoning asked her brother's wife, Jin Qingyue. The general manager, realizing only now that the pregnant woman was the sister of their chairman, wished he could disappear. 'Forget it, we've made our choices, and I can't be bothered to look elsewhere. Let's settle the bill; I'll pay by card,' Jin Qingyue decided. She had insisted on not accepting any gifts or having An Xiaoning pay for her, so An Xiaoning didn't stop her from paying. As they were about to head home, a luxury car sped past them. The man behind the wheel, wearing dark sunglasses, drove away with flair. All three were momentarily stunned by the car's showiness, and especially because it looked just like Jin Qingyan's Mercedes, but it had sped by too quickly for An Xiaoning to get a clear look. Wu Lianzhi, watching the car zoom past, was visibly shaken, her hands trembling on the steering wheel, 'That driver is insanely reckless, driving so fast, as if they have a death wish.' As they continued to drive, they noticed that the car had stopped ahead. 'Why has it stopped?' Wu Lianzhi wondered. An Xiaoning squinted ahead, and upon recognizing the license plate, she sighed, turning to Jin Qingyue, 'That's your brother's sports car.' 'Is it?' Jin Qingyue responded, puzzled. 'Why would my brother be driving so recklessly?' 'Who knows?' As their vehicle was about to overtake the sports car, it suddenly took off again. 'Lianzhi, follow him,' An Xiaoning instructed. 'Alright.' Wu Lianzhi narrowed her eyes, focusing on the fast-moving car ahead, her foot firmly on the accelerator, driving both swiftly and smoothly. They followed the car all the way to a restaurant entrance. An Xiaoning, spotting Henry getting out of the car with Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai, understood immediately that he had been followed. She got out of the car, telling Wu Lianzhi to take Jin Qingyue home first, considering her condition. An Xiaoning then quickly made her way to the restaurant entrance. Henry was seated at a table by the window, with his companions sitting separately. 'What were you thinking driving like that?' An Xiaoning confronted Henry, sitting across from him. 'Why so reckless? Are you tired of living?' Henry looked at her dismissively, 'Why didn’t those with you come in?' 'They've gone home.' He had seen this but had asked deliberately. Chapter 1318: Only You (16) "Why didn't you go back with the others?" "Didn't I see you come in?" An Xiaoning responded tersely, "Or did you come to the restaurant because the food at home was too hard to swallow?!!" "Is it not permissible to dine out once in a while?" "Certainly, but it's only ten o'clock. Are you hungry already?" "Does hunger adhere to a schedule?" Sensing that he was deliberately provoking her, An Xiaoning offered, "What do you feel like eating? Let's order." "The person I'm expecting hasn't arrived. We'll order after they're here." "You're expecting someone?" An Xiaoning asked, "Who might that be?" "What concern is it of yours?" "......" An Xiaoning felt a thick tension in the air. What had she done to irritate him? So temperamental. Silence ensued. An Xiaoning leaned her chin on her crossed hands, fixing her gaze on him. He shifted uncomfortably under her scrutiny, turning his gaze outside the window. After ten minutes, Li Baozhen arrived, rushing. Recognizing her, An Xiaoning instantly grasped the situation, "Miss Li, please have a seat." Li Baozhen had not anticipated An Xiaoning's presence, smiling lightly, "Thank you. Receiving a dinner invitation from Qingyan-ge out of the blue today, especially on my day off, was quite the surprise." "Ah, I see. Qingyan-ge said he's been unable to make time for you lately, so he wanted to invite you out to see how you've been, given that you've been his savior. He's always kept you in his thoughts." Li Baozhen smiled faintly, "I'm quite content. At the company, I follow the daily grind—work, meals, and I stay put at home after hours, only venturing out for occasional strolls." Henry passed her the menu, "Order whatever your heart desires." "Alright." Li Baozhen chose several dishes, then handed the menu to An Xiaoning, who didn’t order as she wasn't feeling peckish. The atmosphere grew tense, likely from a shortage of shared topics. In this stalemate, An Xiaoning blurted out to Henry, "I'm considering a second child." !!!!!!!! The four people present abruptly cast their eyes on her. Xiao Bai and Xiao Huang suppressed their laughter, and Li Baozhen seemed more embarrassed. Henry was momentarily lost for words. Were they alone, he might have dismissively retorted, "Have it on your own." However, in this company, he managed, "Indeed, it's something we should seriously discuss at home." Unintentionally, the three single dogs at the table had just been served an ample helping of PDA. An Xiaoning knew too well that he was oblivious to her past because he wasn't burdened with the memories she shared with Jin Qingyan; he hadn't lived through her past, nor her difficulties with fertility. Under the table, she slyly extended her foot, lightly entangling it with his. Henry stiffened, his dark eyes locking with hers, knowing immediately whose foot it was, as Li Baozhen was seated right beside him. When the meal arrived, An Xiaoning only nibbled a bit before ceasing. While wiping her mouth with a napkin, it fell, and as she bent to retrieve it, she seized the chance to stealthily graze Henry's leg. Henry was internally raging. She had the audacity to covertly tease him in such a public setting. And when she picked up the napkin, her expression unruffled, and swiftly winked at him, he had to sit upright and composed, as if utterly unaffected. The dining experience was anything but enjoyable, particularly in terms of the atmosphere. Hence, once they finished eating, he said to her, "You, along with Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai, go to the car. I'd like to have a word with Baozhen in private." An Xiaoning complied with ease, preserving his dignity, "Alright." They quickly made their exit. After watching them climb into the car, he turned to Li Baozhen, saying, "Stay dedicated at work, and whenever free, make time to visit your parents. If you ever need assistance at the company, reach out to Xiaoning or Captain Fan, okay?" "Qingyan-ge, you gave me this advice when I started at the company, and now you're reiterating it. Are you about to leave on another business trip?" Henry confirmed, "Indeed, I am often away on business and seldom in A City." "Qingyan-ge," Li Baozhen regarded him, "I can't shake the feeling that you're talking as if you're leaving for a faraway place and won't return." He chose not to elaborate, "Let's leave. Xiaoning and the rest are waiting. I'll drive you back to work." "Okay." After escorting Li Baozhen back to the company, the car retraced its route to the Winnie Community, but... Inside the garage, silence prevailed. Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai alighted first, followed by the pair. Only when they ascended to the second floor did they speak. An Xiaoning broached the topic, "What did you speak of with her back in the car?" "I discussed matters not meant for others' ears." "......" An Xiaoning could tell something was amiss, "What's bothering you?" "Nothing." He slid under the covers and closed his eyes, signaling his wish to be left alone. An Xiaoning edged closer, casting her shoes aside and kneeling on the bed, "Henry, you did agree to have another child with me at dinner." "Don't you realize I was merely trying to prevent your embarrassment?" "You've changed." An Xiaoning peered at him, "You’re not the Henry who once loathed me. If you were, would you have cared whether I faced humiliation?" He peered back at her, squinting, "An Xiaoning, I need you to agree to something." "Is it that if I say yes, you'll think about having another child with me?" "......" "Alright, what is it?" "When I'm not here, and he encounters Baozhen, I hope he'll acknowledge her, and perhaps visit her parents now and then, maybe once annually." "What if he refuses?" An Xiaoning probed. "No, he will do it. He heeds your words." Driven nearly to distraction by his entrancing gaze, An Xiaoning yearned to devour him whole. "I know you don't wish to touch me, but at moments like this, I can't resist the urge. Allow me a single kiss, and I'll consent to your request." "......" "If not, it's fine." As she was about to cross over him to the other side of the bed, he uttered, "One kiss only." Therefore, she straddled him and descended for the kiss. Henry had a fleeting impulse to retract, but it was already too late; her kiss was far from fleeting. She kissed him until he responded with evident arousal. Releasing him, Henry lay there, gazing at her, seemingly immobilized by the encounter. Chapter 1319: Only You (17) An Xiaoning watched him with satisfaction, and whispered affectionately, 'Oppa, saranghae (Brother, I love you).' Henry felt an unexpected surge in his heart, leaving him speechless. Lying beside him, An Xiaoning wrapped her arms around his neck and said, 'Today, Lianzhi and I went shopping for baby items. Seeing all those baby products made me long to have another child. Imagine having three little ones at home—wouldn't that be wonderful?' He moved his lips, attempting to speak, but no words came out. After a while, she thought he had fallen asleep. When she glanced at him, she found his eyes wide open, deep in thought. 'You seem preoccupied with something.' 'No.' 'Henry, let's go to sleep.' 'Okay, let's sleep.' She repeated, emphasizing the words more strongly, 'OK?' 'OK.' Surprised, An Xiaoning sat up to look at him closely, 'Qingyan?' 'I am Henry.' '!!!' An Xiaoning moved closer, 'If something's troubling you, just talk to me. Don't keep it bottled up.' 'An Xiaoning.' 'Yes?' 'Would you really hate me if I never disappeared?' She avoided answering, 'I don't want to address that.' He nodded, as if understanding something. 'What are you doing?!' 'Henry, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you all of a sudden?' 'Let go, I'm telling you to let go! Are you out of your mind? Let go!' '...' Thanks to the room's excellent soundproofing, none of the noise inside could be heard from outside. At three o'clock in the afternoon, Auntie Chen knocked again, 'Young Madam, Young Master, it's time for lunch; it's already three.' A soft, muffled voice answered from within, 'Understood, Auntie Chen. We'll be right down.' With that assurance, Auntie Chen hastened downstairs to finish preparing. An Xiaoning slowly opened her eyes, gazing vacantly for a moment before focusing on the man beside her. She had never imagined he would take such initiative in a scene so untamed and unrestrained. Normally, he wouldn't even let her touch his finger, proving the saying true—what's least expected often happens. Propping herself up, An Xiaoning noticed a note on the nightstand with a pen beside it. Out of curiosity, she picked it up and read the words written on it. [I've lost our bet and, as promised, I will fade away. Today... has been the happiest day of my life, a happiness given to me by you, the person I once detested the most. Thank you. —Henry] Her hand shook slightly as she read. Today had been full of surprises. She had no clue when she had made him fall for her. His disappearance would have been the best outcome for her. Yet his silent farewell caused her an unexpected twinge of melancholy. She sat there, stunned for quite some time before lying back down and hugging the man beside her. The man she embraced instinctively held her back and softly called out, 'Xiaoning...' 'Yes?' He opened his eyes, saw her so close, and suddenly realized the situation. They were naked in each other's embrace. Memories of their passionate encounter overwhelmed Jin Qingyan's mind. Then, a torrent of memories began to emerge, prompting him to sit up quickly. 'Qingyan, what's wrong?' He embraced her tightly, 'Xiaoning.' 'What's the matter?' 'How come I suddenly have Henry's memories?' An Xiaoning had an inkling of what had happened. If their memories had been separate before, they were now merged, at the cost of Henry's true disappearance. 'He honored our agreement and disappeared on his own. Essentially, your past unhappiness and negativity have been exposed. You're still you, whether as Henry or Jin Qingyan. You've set a precedent. Dual personalities are deemed incurable in current medical science, yet you've healed. Isn't that extraordinary?' 'Did he fall in love with you?' Although Jin Qingyan had anticipated this, it felt surreal, 'Sooner than I expected. I thought it would take several more encounters alone with you.' 'It feels abrupt to me as well. On reflection, he probably realized today that his feelings for me have changed from aversion to affection. His behavior was very unusual today, even going so far as to frantically pin me down on the bed, hm.' Jin Qingyan arched an eyebrow, his tone filled with implication, 'So...' 'No 'so.' I'm getting up. It's already the afternoon, and I'm hungry. Since Henry's memories have merged with yours, there's no need to discuss certain things separately, especially regarding Li Baozhen. Henry believed we should visit her parents at least once a year and be kind to her, which I support. She saved your life, and we owe her gratitude, right?' 'Certainly. But say it one more time.' 'Say what again?' 'Say 'Oppa, saranghae.'' '...' An Xiaoning complied and softly said, 'Oppa, saranghae, brother, I love you.' He felt elated as he held her in his embrace. — On the sixteenth day of the tenth lunar month, Jin Qingyan's birthday arrived. For him, the ultimate gift was the end of the curse. They had no concerns about Wu Haigang's deceit; he was well aware that his end was in their hands, while his descendants still had lives to lead. At that moment, he had no other choice. On his birthday, he lifted their curse, and with its release, his own life ended. The Wu family's Witchcraft Cauldron Technique came to an end. For the Donggong Clan of Country R, An Xiaoning reflected, their desire for her demise had resulted in Wu Haigang's death at their own hands. Nothing else held significance. Once the curse was broken, Wu Haigang was secretly executed. An Xiaoning finally felt the weight lift from her heart, entering the most relaxed and content phase of her life. Wu Lianzhi's household registration had been approved. 'Now that you have permanent residency, I've arranged a job for you as a university counselor. While the school prohibits faculty-student romance, it's where you'll meet the most women. If you find mutual attraction with someone, you could opt for another job or even a secret romance. What do you think?' Chapter 1320: Only You (18) 'It aligns perfectly with my wishes, yet I harbor a concern.' 'And what might that be?' 'That the Donggong Clan will persist in seeking vengeance against me.' 'Do they still dare?' An Xiaoning queried further, 'Here's what I propose: I shall issue a declaration to them, making it known that you are under my protection. Should they dare to meddle with you again, they shall face my wrath. Does this put your mind at ease?' 'Xiaoning, your valor knows no bounds.' With a chuckle, An Xiaoning remarked, 'Is that not the essence of camaraderie? Thanks to your aid, the curse has been lifted. It is only right that I safeguard you in return. Pursue boldly the tranquility you seek, and the affection of the girl who has captured your heart.' 'Understood. I shall strive with all my might.' ... Throughout the day, the servants were busy with preparations for the birthday celebration at the manor. Although Jin Qingyan had already received the finest of birthday tributes, it did not negate the need for a celebratory soirée. As evening approached, his most intimate friends would convene for a modest celebration to honor his natal day. Just past five o'clock, An Xiaoning, freshly bathed, was playfully commandeered to the bed by Jin Qingyan, who demanded with an air of authority, 'A birthday serenade, if you please, before anything else.' 'A proper serenade shall be rendered when the festivity commences.' 'I insist on a prelude.' With an eye roll, An Xiaoning acquiesced, 'Ever the child at heart, Jin Sansui. Very well, on this day of your birth, your wish is my command. Let me now sing a ditty for our beloved Oppa.' He clapped with fervor, prompting An Xiaoning to suppress a giggle. Happy Birthday to you... Happy Birthday to you... 'What a delightful melody.' No sooner had he lavished praise than he pinned her beneath him, engaging in a playful tussle that left them both breathless with laughter on the bed. Their merriment would have continued unabated had not a knock at the door beckoned their attention. It was Captain Fan Shixin delivering the attire and accessories for the night's celebration. A gown and footwear, bespoke for her. Upon inspection, An Xiaoning was instantly smitten with the ensemble — a pristine white cocktail dress paired with equally lustrous heels, encrusted with diamonds. These heels, a testament to meticulous craftsmanship, were tailored for An Xiaoning's usual aversion to such footwear, offering both a commanding height and an unwavering balance, rendering her stride as elegant as it was assured. Once they had both dressed in their finest, their descent down the staircase coincided with the arrival of a modest throng of guests. Ling Ciyi and Jin Qingyue were ensconced on the settee, while Long Tianze, who initially occupied a seat beside Ling Ciyi, opted for a more languid posture, draping himself over Ling Ciyi's legs instead. Were they not bound by the ties of brotherhood, Ling Ciyi might well have catapulted him straight to Wazhao Country. 'Ah, behold the radiance of our sister-in-law, a vision of splendor,' Long Tianze extolled with a whistle, 'Gorgeous, truly gorgeous.' 'Indeed, sister-in-law, you are a sight to behold in such attire,' concurred Jin Qingyue with an approving nod, 'A paragon of beauty.' 'Money well invested,' An Xiaoning quipped with a smile, 'Where is Yangyang at this hour?' 'He has gone to fetch the children. What kind of celebration would this be without the little ones in attendance?' As the children arrived, the assembly was nearly complete. This was an intimate affair, devoid of strangers. Thus, by the time the clock signaled an hour past six, the birthday celebration ceremoniously commenced. Captain Fan, acting as the emcee, initiated the proceedings. Following his introductory remarks, he invited Jin Qingyan to make a wish and cut the cake. Jin Qingyan approached the cake as the birthday anthem filled the air. Clasping his hands and closing his eyes, he soon extinguished the candle's flame with a gentle puff. A rousing chorus of applause ensued. 'My wish...' Jin Qingyan began, pausing to bestow a tender gaze upon An Xiaoning in the crowd, '...is to hasten the day when Xiaoning shall once again be my wife.' 'Bravo!' Long Tianze led the chorus of acclamation, his applause spirited. The sentiment was echoed by the others, their cheers resounding. An Xiaoning, however, remained poised, her gaze fixed on Jin Qingyan as a soft smile played upon her lips, her heart fluttering with a mixture of joy and anticipation. When it came time to divide the cake, An Xiaoning joined him in the act, and as the cake was shared, the revelry began in earnest. They feasted, drank, and reveled, their dance a celebration of high spirits. The children were beside themselves with joy, sneaking off to a room with wine in tow, only to succumb to their indulgence, leaving them in a drunken slumber. An Xiaoning could not have foreseen the arrival of Wang Jinsheng at her doorstep. She consented to an audience with him, albeit reluctantly. 'Miss An...' 'If you've come hoping that I might intercede on your behalf once more, I must dissuade you from voicing such a plea, for it will be to no avail.' Wang Jinsheng, taken aback by her foreknowledge, stammered, 'Miss An, when did you... become aware?' 'I was apprised of the situation prior to the morning news broadcast, but my awareness predates even that.' With a wry smile, An Xiaoning probed, 'Was it not you who implicated me to He Yi regarding the Shenjia Lake incident? Are not your dealings with He Yi alarmingly frequent for an archaeologist? Your association with those engaged in tomb raiding — what were you thinking? Furthermore... to involve yourself in such unlawful activities. Given that you have dared to show your face here, I surmise that the authorities are en route to apprehend you as we speak, are they not?' Wang Jinsheng, drenched in a cold sweat, beseeched her, 'Miss An, I implore you, grant me clemency this once, and I vow never to err again.' 'Madam An, have my words not resonated with clarity?' An Xiaoning rose to her feet, 'One must bear the consequences of their misdeeds.' 'Madam An, officers from the Criminal Police Squad are here to escort Captain Wang Jinsheng away.' 'Is he not present among us?' An Xiaoning retorted. Captain Fan signaled the officers waiting outside. They entered and took custody of Wang Jinsheng. An Xiaoning exhaled deeply and inquired, 'Shixin, whatever could have possessed Captain Wang to act so recklessly?' 'I am as perplexed as you are,' Captain Fan confessed. 'Perhaps he was oblivious to your knowledge of the matter and wished to try his luck.' 'Indeed, he has been the architect of his own downfall, and none can spare him from the consequences of his folly.' ... After lunch, An Xiaoning received a call from Pan Zhenghui, instructing her to report to the precinct. Upon her arrival, Pan Zhenghui discussed two matters: the case of Wang Jinsheng and He Yi, and a new assignment for her. Regarding Wang Jinsheng's debacle, Pan Zhenghui could only shake his head in dismay, 'The man is a lamentable case. After years of dedicated service in the Archaeological Team, holding the rank of captain, how could he succumb to such indiscretion? His captaincy forfeited, his livelihood in jeopardy, and incarceration imminent. As for He Yi, per your directive to monitor his activities, he has proven to be a recalcitrant problem. The authorities in Country Y are fervently pursuing him, seeking our collaboration in their manhunt.' Chapter 1321: Only You (19) An Xiaoning inquired, "Have they been caught?" "Could there have been any escape? You had already advised me to keep an eye on him, and my people have been closely watching him. It was easy to capture him, and he has been taken away by international law enforcement, his guilt surpassing even that of Wang Jinsheng." "What kind of sentence do you think he'll receive?" "Conservatively speaking, at least ten years. He's in for a tough time." An Xiaoning didn't say much more, knowing that everyone has their own life path and must take responsibility for their actions. "Let's talk about the case." "All right." Pan Zhenghui handed her several case file boxes. "These contain two notorious cold cases. Take a look and decide which one to start with; they've been unsolved for many years. Although one case has plenty of evidence, it still seems challenging. Take these and discuss with the special team's members." An Xiaoning took the files, "Understood." As she left the office, she started to open the file boxes, their yellowed pages indicating their age. Upon entering the office, everyone turned their attention to her. Ma Jianguo rubbed his hands together and chuckled, "Xiaoning, you're here at last. We've been waiting for you. Our current cases have been wrapped up, and the chief said we should start on the major cases with you." An Xiaoning sat down and seriously addressed them, "I currently have two famous cold cases. At a glance, one is twenty-two years old, the other fourteen. It's not always the most meticulous or skilled in evasion who commit these crimes. Consider the time they were committed—no surveillance, no fingerprints, solving these would indeed be difficult. Review these cases briefly; then I'll take a closer look." She passed the file folders to each person for a quick review. After about fifteen minutes, they had skimmed the key points and handed the files back to her. "Having looked them over, which case do you think we should tackle first?" Ma Jianguo suggested, "I think we should start with the Widows' Village case. It's the oldest and, though it has sparked much online debate, it lacks the solid evidence of the other case. I believe we should begin with the more difficult case due to the lack of evidence." Gong Le agreed, "I also agree with Old Ma. I've been following discussions about Widows' Village online, and it seems the culprit is still living worry-free. This is the most unsettling for the deceased. Investigating this case will be the toughest, so I agree to start here." An Xiaoning nodded, "Then we'll start with this one. But do you really think the second case with solid evidence will be easy to solve? If it were so simple, why wasn't it closed despite the evidence, and why was the investigation halted?" Ma Jianguo replied in a low voice, "Isn't it because of the perpetrator's powerful family connections? With someone to cover for them, of course. But compared to your status, Xiaoning, theirs is nothing. There's always a bigger fish. I bet they don't know that you're personally investigating this case. Would they be scared if they knew?" "Keep your mouths shut about the second case. We haven't started it, and I want complete silence on the matter, or you'll face the consequences." "Xiaoning, don't worry. What are we? We're police officers. Trust in your subordinates, OK?" An Xiaoning acknowledged with a hum, "I'll take the second case file home for a thorough review. We'll discuss it together once we start. For now, focus all attention on the first case. I want to use a subtle approach to investigation, digging into the details slowly. This case has probably become taboo in the village. Also, I want to confirm that before the incident, the gender ratio in the village was normal, right?" "Correct, before the case, the male-to-female ratio in the village was standard. After the deaths began, many men were afraid to stay at home and moved away. Now the village is mainly inhabited by economically disadvantaged elderly people, middle-aged widows, and children, with many of the elderly also being widows. Initially, people suspected the water supply, but that was not the case, as both men and women drank from the well, yet only the men died. Eventually, the village was renamed Widows' Village." Ma Jianguo recalled, "Twenty years ago, there were many superstitions, suggesting the deceased were seeking revenge on the village, which is why the village's tragedy has been linked with these victims." "It seems that to truly understand Widows' Village, I need to visit personally, which I had already planned to do." Zu Dong asked, "Team leader, are we going with you, or do you have other plans?" "We can't all go; that would raise suspicion. I'll assign tasks." She detailed their assignments, "Zu Dong, come with me. Gong Le and Ding Liang, being young, conduct field reconnaissance around Widows' Village without arousing local suspicion. Ma Jianguo, you're the most experienced, so stay at the station on standby." Ma Jianguo protested, "Xiaoning, isn't this ageism? I don't want to stay at the station. I'll go with them. I have extensive experience as a seasoned officer and understand more than they do." "Fine. That's settled. I'll take the case file home to review in detail. You three go ahead with the reconnaissance. Zu Dong and I will head back to Winnie Community." "Agreed." After driving Zu Dong home, An Xiaoning found Jin Qingyan still at home, not at the company. "Why aren't you at the company?" "I'll go in a bit." Jin Qingyan noticed Zu Dong's arrival and asked, "You've really taken on a case?" "Yes, this afternoon, Zu Dong and I will head to Widows' Village, and I won't be back for some time." Jin Qingyan disliked hearing this; her absence meant he'd have to sleep alone and wouldn't see her for a while. "Do you plan to stay there?" "Of course." After thinking it over, An Xiaoning added, "Zu Dong and I will pretend to be a married couple to rent a house." It was better to tell him early to prevent unnecessary jealousy. '...' Jin Qingyan objected, "Send Fan Shixin with you instead." Chapter 1322: Only You (20) "Why? Shixin is your assistant, and I am off to work on a case; wouldn't it be more appropriate to go with our police unit's officers?" An Xiaoning suspected something was off, "When we were in Country V, I posed as Shixin's wife, remember? Don't be so possessive." "I'm not possessive. Am I the type to be petty? I'm mainly concerned about your safety, which is why I feel more at ease with Shixin accompanying you." "..." She noticed his illogical reasoning; it was apparent he didn't want anyone else pretending to be her husband. That's why... "When you're dictating Shixin's actions, have you considered how his girlfriend feels?" An Xiaoning signaled for Zu Dong to wait outside, making him awkwardly comply. "Either you don't go, or Shixin accompanies you; choose." "Jin Qingyan." "I didn't catch that." "Brother." "Calling me 'grandpa' won't help." An Xiaoning drew closer and sat beside him, "You're an adult, thirty-four, not three or four. I'm going on official duty with the officers, not on some frivolous outing. Is this really necessary?" "I just prefer to have someone I trust with you. If I could, I'd go myself, but I have to oversee the company. I trust Shixin to play your husband since you both have prior experience." "..." "Are you even listening?" "Fine, Shixin can come too. It seems you only trust your own people." An Xiaoning glared at him, "Are you satisfied now?" "Yes, quite satisfied." He dialed Shixin's number and hung up swiftly. Shortly after, Shixin arrived. "Master Jin." "Go on a rural retreat with your Madam." Shixin was confused; such arrangements typically included him, so why was it his turn now? "Master Jin, a retreat to the countryside?" "Yes, as a reward for your dedication to the company lately, I've arranged this special treat." "Despite what you say, Master Jin, I sense there's a catch." "Don't mind your Master's prattle. There's no retreat. I'm headed to a village for a case investigation. I was supposed to go with one of our male officers, acting as a married couple... um..." Before she could finish, her mouth was forcefully covered. Shixin grasped the gist and added An Xiaoning's unspoken words, "The officer at the door, right? Master Jin doesn't want you two acting as a married couple, so he's put me in charge. To be exact, Master Jin doesn't like the idea of you pretending with someone he distrusts, even if he knows it's a farce, even if he's sure nothing will happen. He's just cautious, and he doesn't like it." "That's correct!" An Xiaoning pried Jin Qingyan's hand away, "Did you hear that? Shixin's explanation is spot-on. Jin Qingyan, you're beyond help." "I'm beyond help then, so be it. Money can't buy my peace of mind, and I like to have things my way. If you object, you don't have to go." Exasperated, An Xiaoning pointed her index finger at his forehead, "Alright, alright, we'll do it your way. Shixin and I will go together." Due to her sudden change of plans, Zu Dong had no choice but to join Ma Jianguo and the others. She and Shixin quickly packed their luggage and loaded it into the car. The car departed the city at one-thirty in the afternoon and arrived at five-thirty, a four-hour drive. As they neared Widows' Village, the sky turned a somber grey, foretelling rain. An Xiaoning had Shixin park in a lot, and then they, masked, rode a trike with their luggage towards their destination. The trike driver, a man, was taken aback upon learning where they were headed. "Are you two going back to see your parents?" he inquired. "No, we're visiting relatives." "Don't overstay in that place. The village has an eerie reputation; it's mostly women, with scarcely any men left. Usually, no men visit, so you and your husband should make it a brief visit. Look, nightfall is soon." An Xiaoning asked, "Brother, is it truly as eerie as they say? You're making me somewhat scared." "It's as eerie as they say. The village men all fell to misfortune in quick succession; almost all of them perished. Everyone around here knows. Judging by your accents, this is your first visit, right?" "Yes, our first time," An Xiaoning confirmed. "Well, take my advice seriously; you'll be alright." "Thank you, brother." After a seven or eight-minute ride, they reached the outskirts of Widows' Village. The driver, fearing bad luck, refused to go further, "There it is, right up ahead." An Xiaoning paid the fare, and they walked on with Shixin. "Shixin, recall our mission to Country V with Xiao Bai? We pretended to be a couple then, and we'll have to do the same now. Just call me Mu Ning." "Understood, I'm on it. Don't worry, my acting is quite convincing." An Xiaoning gave a small smile, "Indeed, your acting is commendable. It's just that Master Jin sometimes has unnecessary concerns." "He's deeply concerned about you; that's why he acts this way." "There are people ahead by the village entrance; let's pick up the pace and ask around." They quickened their pace, and An Xiaoning greeted them cheerfully, "Good day, could you tell us if there are any houses for rent in the village? My husband and I run a small business in the market town, but the accommodations there are too pricey. This place is conveniently close to the town, so we're looking to rent somewhere nearby. We've inquired in other villages, but to no avail." "There are places to rent," a middle-aged woman replied enthusiastically, standing up, "I have a couple of spare rooms in my annex, but..." The woman's voice waned, tinged with hesitation, "If you're not put off by our village's unsettling reputation, I'd be willing to rent to you." "That's not an issue. My husband plans to sleep at the shop front, so he won't be staying here often. It's mainly for cooking and my stay here." Encouraged by her response, the woman readily agreed, "Then it's decided. I'll rent to you." An Xiaoning's face brightened with a smile, "Wonderful, could you please show us the house? If it's satisfactory, we'll settle in." "Of course, follow me." They followed the middle-aged woman into the village, stopping before an iron gate. She retrieved her keys and unlocked it, "My surname is Wang. With the children at school and my husband working out of town for years without coming back, I've been left alone. It gets lonely without someone to talk to. The annex was my daughter's space; it's quite clean, although she only returns during school breaks, so it's empty most of the year." "Mrs. Wang, how many people live in the village?"
Chapter 1906: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twelve) As she mulled over these thoughts, Su Yan couldn't help but feel a surge of compassion for her brother, clinging to his arm with a determination not to let go. She pouted and expressed her heartfelt desire, "Brother, I really do hope you'll find a sister-in-law for me soon, someone to look after you, and maybe I'll even get a little nephew to pamper." "Who has you so concerned?" Su Yan, with a smile still gracing his face, affectionately pinched Su Yue's pouting lips. Eager to avoid the topic, Su Yue perceived his reluctance. Not wishing to press him further, she sat upright and sighed, "Okay, I'll stop. Bringing up this topic always makes me anxious." Her hands continued to embrace his arm tenderly. With a slight smile, Su Yan confidently said, "Given my favorable circumstances, bachelorhood is not my destined path." "Hmph," Su Yue rolled her eyes playfully, "Vain. Third Brother's habits are rubbing off on you." Su Yan laughed softly, his shoulders giving a noncommittal shrug that seemed to say: 'Indeed, that's the case.' Su Yue reached for her cup again, finding the tea had cooled to a perfect drinkable warmth. She tested the temperature and then downed the cup in one gulp, looking quite parched. Su Yan watched her curiously, "Where have you been to come back so thirsty?" After finishing the water, Su Yue put down the cup and truthfully responded, "I went to check on Qiao Chen's mother. On the way back, I just found myself drawn here without realizing it." "Oh." Su Yan nodded, then inquired, "Did little Xiaoqiao accompany you?" His eyes fell on Xiaoqiao, who was contentedly nibbling on an apple, her legs swinging freely in the air, exuding a carefree innocence that beckoned one to protect her from the slightest harm. He yearned for her to experience the warm and colorful childhood that his mother had been denied. At one time, when he had considered stepping in, there was Qiao Chen, the man who had risked his life for Su Yue. He had hoped that Qiao Chen would be the salve for the shadows that darkened Su Yue's childhood and adolescence. He had imagined Qiao Chen would be Su Yue's best and ultimate partner. Yet, as it turned out, while he was the best, he was not the last. That man still occasionally burst into his thoughts and dreams. Thus, it was imperative that Xiaoqiao never forget him. And he hoped that Ming Ansheng would not fall short of Qiao Chen, that his love for Su Yue would be just as deep. This was the selfish wish of an older brother. "Yes," Su Yue replied, lips pursed in thought, "But I didn't enter. I just stood at the door for a while. I was afraid that my presence might bring back memories of Qiao Chen and cause her heartache." Su Yan offered a comforting smile, cleverly steering the conversation elsewhere, "How's Xiaoqiao adjusting to kindergarten?" "Quite well," Su Yue nodded, "With Yan Yan and the others around, she's making friends and playing well with the other children." "That's good to hear," Su Yan said with a gentle smile, then suggested, "Do bring Xiaoqiao to the new product launch. She will enjoy it." Su Yue's eyes sparkled with uncontained excitement, "Certainly, I'll bring Ming Ansheng along too." "Does he need your invitation?" Su Yan raised an eyebrow, "Isn't he supposed to be the one bringing you?" Su Yue pouted, "When it comes to importance, from Rongsheng's perspective, I'm the main event." Their conversation was abruptly interrupted by the office door swinging open without any prior knock. Su Yue looked over in surprise, half-expecting Third Brother to be the intruder. However, she was instead taken aback by the unexpected presence of a tall woman making her entrance. Chapter 1907: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Thirteen) Su Yan was taken aback by the woman who nonchalantly entered the room. This... Wasn't this the very same Aireli, the acclaimed celebrity from earlier? What could have prompted her return? No... The actual question should be, what was her business in her brother's office, and most importantly, why did she forgo the common courtesy of knocking? Her manners appeared to be lacking. As Aireli marched in with undeniable confidence, her pale green Hermès bag—an emblem of her status—hung elegantly over one arm, and the sunglasses she had just removed in the other, Su Yan felt a surge of annoyance she couldn't quite understand, settling on a general sense of discontent. The click of Aireli's high heels against the wooden floor reverberated, announcing her presence dominantly. Her gaze first flitted to President Su's office and then to Su Xiaoqiao, her striking face registering a flicker of surprise before she regarded Su Xiaoqiao with a puzzled expression. However, Su Xiaoqiao, deeply engrossed in the cartoon on the screen, did not notice Aireli's presence, her bright eyes glued to the screen, unblinking. After observing Su Xiaoqiao for a short while, Aireli was about to divert her attention when Su Yan suddenly called out, 'Miss Aireli.' He stood up to greet her, with Su Yan rising as well, her arms still entwined with his, their closeness projecting a natural affinity. At the sound of her name, Aireli turned with a smile that momentarily faltered when her eyes met Su Yan's. 'President Su,' she acknowledged, her inquisitive gaze resting on Su Yan, revealing a glimmer of complexity. Su Yan perceived the shift in Aireli's demeanor as soon as she caught sight of her, and instinctively, she clung tighter to President Su's arm, leaning her head on his shoulder. It was evident that Aireli harbored feelings for her brother, and despite Su Yan's internal resistance to this notion, she couldn't deny a burgeoning sense of pride. Yet, she couldn't shake off the unexplainable aversion she felt toward the actress. Perhaps, she mused, her brother's detached nature was incompatible with a woman from the entertainment industry, especially one who seemed assertive. But these were her personal reflections, not to be ascribed to anyone else, least of all her brother. 'President Su, who might this be?' Aireli inquired after a moment, her gesture indicating Su Yan. With a straightforward introduction, he responded, 'This is my sister, Su Yan.' The words seemed to bring a springtime warmth to Aireli's face, a semblance of hope rekindled. Her reaction, Su Yan noted with an internal critique, was hardly befitting an actress of her caliber, lacking the subtlety one might expect from an award-winning performer. Yet, it underscored the allure her brother held, even for someone of Aireli's celebrated status. With pride swelling within, Su Yan observed as Aireli approached with a welcoming smile that blended professionalism and personal charm, 'Hello, Su Yan.' Aireli extended her hand with a polish that spoke of her worldliness. Once, Su Yan might have met the gesture with disdain, but time had taught her the intricacies of social grace. She reciprocated the handshake, her smile was subtle yet sincere, 'Hello, Miss Aireli.' After the cordial exchange, Su Yan smoothly retracted her hand, mirroring Aireli's effortless poise. Aireli turned back to President Su with a warm smile, 'I just remembered I left my scarf here.' Chapter 1908: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Fourteen) As she spoke, her gaze swept over the sofa and finally settled in its corner. Her eyes, heavily adorned with makeup, lit up as she pointed and said, 'It's over there. I've been too careless, always losing and forgetting things.' She laughed at herself, walked over, and picked up the scarf. It was a large floral scarf, yet its design was refreshingly elegant, avoiding any hint of vulgarity. This is the hallmark of prestigious brands and top designers. Su Yan’s attention was caught by the scarf in Aireli's hand, her thoughts elsewhere. She came to talk business but managed to leave her scarf behind without bringing an assistant. Was the scarf genuinely forgotten, or was it intentionally left as an excuse to talk to her brother again? Oh, Su Yan, why so narrow-minded? Perhaps you've read too many novels. She shook off the melodramatic thoughts that had invaded her mind and pouted at Aireli, feeling a twinge of sourness in her heart. For some reason, she did want her brother, Su Yan, to find a girlfriend and settle down. Yet she clung to Su Yan's arm, never letting go, hugging it tightly as if claiming her territory before Aireli, as if to show her disapproval of her. Aireli, scarf in hand, returned to where the siblings stood. Su Yan, with a hint of politeness, offered, 'A phone call would have sufficed; I could've had someone bring it down to you.' Aireli responded with a bright smile, 'I was free anyway, so I came up to get it myself.' An actress of her caliber, with such popularity, must have exceptional charm. Su Yan couldn't help but find Aireli's dimples when she smiled quite captivating. Especially her face, seemingly perfect yet with an ineffable flaw, contrasted with the surgically perfected faces of many online celebrities and stars, it possessed a unique appeal. Su Yan's gaze involuntarily drifted to Aireli again. When Aireli caught her looking, she maintained her generous smile. After a brief glance at Su Yan, she turned to President Su and complimented, 'President Su, your sister is quite beautiful.' Before President Su could reply, she quickly added, 'And she looks a lot like you.' President Su's lips curled up slightly, but he said nothing. Upon hearing this, Su Yan inwardly rolled her eyes at Aireli. She could have simply praised her brother's good looks; there was no need to use her as a pretext. Internally criticizing Aireli repeatedly, Su Yan acknowledged her success, charisma, and allure, but... She simply couldn't take a liking to her. Feelings about people are indeed inexplicable. Aireli seemed in no hurry to leave, continuously seeking topics to engage President Su in conversation. As they chatted about inconsequential matters, Su Yan grew bored and let go of President Su's arm, planning to visit Little Seastar. 'Knock, knock, knock' Suddenly, a series of knocks came from the door. Before President Su could respond, the door was already being pushed open. 'President Su, Third Brother Su and I need to leave now,' Wen Xuxu entered in haste, bag in hand, making her greetings. Upon seeing Aireli, she paused, then moderated her hurried demeanor. 'Third sister-in-law,' Su Yan greeted, changing direction to walk happily toward Wen Xuxu. 'Wen Xuxu's here,' Su Yan said, her smile forced as she curved her lips. President Su, growing concerned, asked, 'What's happened? Is everything alright?' He moved towards Wen Xuxu as he spoke. Wen Xuxu's expression turned mournful, 'Ah Heng's grandfather has passed away at the Cardio-Cerebrovascular Hospital; Third Brother Su and I are on our way there now.' Chapter 1909: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Fifteen) Her heart was heavy with grief as she reminisced about her relationship with Jiang Zhuoheng and the kind regard the late Old Master Jiang and his family had shown her. Despite his longevity, his passing caused her profound sadness. Upon hearing the news, Su Yan's expression briefly registered surprise. 'Then you must make haste,' he said. 'Certainly.' Wen Xuxu nodded with determination and turned to Su Yue, 'We need to leave now.' She quickened her pace to the door, only to be stopped by Su Xiaoqiao's voice, 'Auntie.' Wen Xuxu paused, turning back with a comforting smile. 'Xiaoqiao, auntie has something urgent to take care of and can't play with you now. Be a good girl, okay?' 'Okay.' Su Xiaoqiao nodded obediently and waved her little hand, 'Goodbye, Auntie.' 'Goodbye!' Wen Xuxu left in a hurry, and Su Yan watched the office door close, deep in thought. 'Brother, isn't Ah Heng's grandfather also Xin Yanting's grandfather?' 'Yes.' 'Aren't you going to pay your respects?' 'Don't be nosy.' 'Hmph, I dislike this attitude.' 'President Su, I shall take my leave now.' 'Miss Aireli, take care.' Su Yan acknowledged Aireli with a nod before calling out, 'Mi Xiao.' At this, Su Yue's curiosity was piqued. 'Who is Mi Xiao?' Before she finished her question, the office door opened, and a young woman entered, dressed in a white blouse and black business slacks, epitomizing professionalism. The young woman adjusted the black-framed glasses perched on her nose. She looked to be around Su Yue's age, perhaps even a bit younger. At first glance, her features seemed quite plain. Su Yue scrutinized the newcomer. The woman adjusted her glasses and looked to Su Yan, 'President Su?' 'Escort Miss Aireli out, please,' Su Yan directed. 'Understood.' Mi Xiao nodded, then turned to Aireli. She seemed a touch nervous, possibly unaccustomed to her new responsibilities. 'Miss Aireli, this way, please.' Mi Xiao bowed slightly and followed Aireli out, carefully closing the office door with a soft click behind her. 'Brother, who was that?' Su Yue redirected her gaze from the door back to Su Yan. 'Isn't it the secretary's job to see out guests?' Indeed, that was the standard practice. 'Indeed, she is my new secretary,' Su Yan replied nonchalantly, strolling toward Su Xiaoqiao with his hands casually in his pockets. A new secretary? Su Yue's eyes widened in astonishment, 'Oh!' She quickened her pace to keep up with Su Yan's tall figure. 'Is there a problem?' Su Yan glanced at Su Yue with a trace of bemusement, feigning ignorance. With his sharp intuition, he knew exactly why Su Yue was reacting this way. Su Yue nodded emphatically. 'Yes, it's quite a big deal.' As they walked, she continued, 'Hadn't you always refrained from hiring female secretaries? The last time I accompanied you on a trip, you had that very striking male secretary, right?' Upon hearing this, Su Yan smiled amusedly. 'I've just never found the right person before. You're overthinking it.' He then flicked Su Yue's forehead affectionately. Su Yue winced, rubbing her forehead, and pouted, 'Ouch! But the secretary we just met... she didn't seem particularly striking.' She laughed, 'But, brother, you've finally opened up to the idea of having a woman close by. That alleviates my concerns. You've always been escorted by a handsome man on your business trips, which was quite worrisome for me. I was almost afraid you might... change your preferences.' Chapter 1910: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Sixteen) 'What?' Brother Su's eyebrows knit together, a dangerous glint in his eyes as he again withdrew his hand from his pocket. Su Yue hurriedly tucked in her neck, swiftly raising her hands to protect her head, while smiling appeasingly at Brother Su, 'Hehe, my apologies, I misspoke...' Indeed, it had been too much, making such a joke with her own brother. Even as she begged for leniency, Brother Su's gaze remained piercingly fixed on her. Su Yue looked back with caution, 'What are you doing? Why are you looking at me like that?' Brother Su's lips curved into a smile, 'It just occurred to me, you're idling at home right now, so why not come to work? That way, I wouldn't need to hire anyone else.' His tone was ambiguous, leaving Su Yue uncertain of his sincerity. Regardless of his intent, Su Yue immediately shook her head in refusal, 'No way, I'm not interested.' Recalling something, she retorted with a pout, 'Who says I'm doing nothing? My online store is still up and running.' And it was indeed thriving. She scoffed at the idea of giving up her freedom for a nine-to-five job. 'Besides, if I were to work, to be a secretary, I'd rather be Ming Ansheng's secretary, not join Rongsheng.' Brother Su nodded as if in understanding, 'Ah, the proverbial spilled water of a married daughter, but...' He paused, then suddenly chuckled, 'But you haven't been married off yet, have you?' 'Stop it,' Su Yue's face flushed, and she playfully punched Brother Su on the shoulder. Brother Su chuckled, then his expression turned serious, 'I've got some work to do. You entertain Little Seastar, okay?' 'Alright.' Su Yue nodded, 'I'll take Little Seastar upstairs and downstairs for a bit, and we can all go for dinner after you finish work.' 'Okay.' ... 'As expected, traffic is always congested around this time, without fail.' At six o'clock on the ring road, the cars moved slower than a sloth speaking, prompting Su Yue to grumble. 'Are you hungry?' Brother Su pointed to the glove compartment in front of Su Yue, 'There should be a bag of cookies in there.' Su Yue shook her head, 'Not hungry, just anxious.' Every traffic light seemed to take an eternity, but the real frustration was the slow pace of traffic. Seeing Su Yue's anxiety, Brother Su smiled affectionately, 'You still act like a kid.' At that moment, Su Yue's phone rang. It was Ming Ansheng calling. She quickly answered. 'Hello?' 'Oh, then I should probably stop by as well.' 'Mmhmm.' After a short talk with Ming Ansheng, Su Yue hung up and looked to Brother Su, 'Brother, I'm afraid I can't join you for dinner. Grandfather Jiang has passed away, and Ming Ansheng is helping out there. I think I should be there too.' She hadn't had much interaction with Jiang Zhuoheng, but their connections were intricate, and most importantly, her relationship with Ming Ansheng was deep. She was his... Wife. They were living together, and they even had a child. That pretty much made her his wife, right? So she felt it was appropriate for her to go. Brother Su, upon hearing this, simply said, 'I'll take you there.' 'Okay.' Su Yue nodded, then glanced at Little Seastar, who was engrossed in the scenery outside. After a moment's thought, she turned to Brother Su, 'Could you take care of Little Seastar for me, or maybe take her home? It's late, and it's not really a place for a child to be.' Chapter 1911: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Seventeen) Su Yan nodded with pleasure, 'I'll take her to have a meal.' As they reached the next traffic light, Su Yan changed direction. The Jiang family, a prominent name in Kyoto, coupled with Jiang Shaomei's prestigious connections, ensured that news of Old Master Jiang's passing spread swiftly. Within just a few hours, those with favorable business relations had arrived to pay their respects. Old Master Jiang was highly esteemed, and the Jiang family unanimously decided to set up the 灵堂 at their residence. The entrance to the Jiang estate was as crowded as a shopping mall parking lot, with cars lined up to the intersection, forming a long queue. Thankfully, the road had been cleared, allowing Su Yan to drop off Su Yue at the Jiang residence's entrance. 'Xiaoqiao, Uncle will take you out to eat, and Mommy will pick you up tonight.' Su Yue affectionately patted Su Xiaoqiao's head before stepping out of the car, 'Brother, drive safely.' After signalling to Su Yan, Su Yue reached to shut the car door. She looked up, paused, and her actions froze. Behind them, a black Cadillac had come to a stop. From the driver's side, a simply dressed woman stepped out. Her raven-black hair was tied back in a basic ponytail, carrying a black bag, her face bare, eyes red and swollen from weeping. 'Xin Yanting.' Su Yue called out almost instinctively upon seeing Xin Yanting. Hearing her name, Xin too paused and looked up to see Su Yue, a flicker of surprise in her eyes. Then, her gaze instinctively shifted to the driver's seat. Seeing a glimpse of Su Yan's side profile, her grip on the bag tightened. Abruptly, she lowered her head and walked past Su Yan's car. 'Brother, you can go back now.' Su Yue closed the car door and quickly followed after Xin Yanting. She wanted to speak, yet didn't know what to say, and considering Xin's likely grief, she decided it was best not to. Thus, she slowed her pace. Near the entrance, she turned back; Su Yan's car was nowhere in sight. She pouted and sighed in resignation. To love is to love; to be indifferent is just that. It's not so much that her brother is aloof, but more unfeeling. Oh dear, Su Yue, how can you think this way about your own brother? She felt sorry for Xin Yanting, seeing her as innocent. But why should women make things difficult for one another? She had always felt guilty and sympathetic towards Xin Yanting. 'What are you thinking about?' While Su Yue was deep in thought, a familiar voice from ahead interrupted—it was Ming Ansheng. She composed herself and looked up, shaking her head slightly, 'Nothing particular.' She ascended the steps, approaching Ming Ansheng. ......  'Xiaoqiao, is there anything else you want to eat?' After dinner, around eight o'clock, with the traffic finally easing, Su Yan drove around the vibrant district with Su Xiaoqiao. The city's multicolored neon lights flickered, casting a mesmerizing glow. At a red light, Su Yan gently pressed the brakes. From the back seat, Su Xiaoqiao's voice rose, 'I want some ice cream.' Su Yan shifted his gaze from the window back to Su Xiaoqiao, a smile spreading across his face, 'You want ice cream again?' Su Xiaoqiao pressed her lips together, her silence a tacit confirmation. Really, who needs to be asked about wanting ice cream? It's a well-known secret among all earthlings, isn't it? Chapter 1912: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Eighteen) Watching her adorable little mannerisms, how could Su Yan bear to refuse her? He suggested, 'Then we shall only get a small serving.' Su Xiaoqiao nodded like she was pounding garlic, 'Mhm.' Her chubby cheeks curved into a smile, her eyes forming beautiful crescents that were as pretty and adorable as the crescent moon itself. As Su Yan drove past several traffic lights, he kept an eye out for an ice cream parlor. He seldom went out shopping or eating out, so the search was somewhat blind. Eventually, as they passed a mall, a Häagen-Dazs sign stood out prominently. His eyes lit up, and pointing towards the Häagen-Dazs, he asked Su Xiaoqiao, 'Häagen-Dazs, is that alright?' 'Yeah, yeah, yeah!' Su Xiaoqiao nodded like she was pounding garlic. To her, as long as it was ice cream and she could have some, the brand mattered little. She was quite unpretentious in her desires. Su Yan parked the car in a space along the curb, then carried Xiaoqiao towards the beckoning Häagen-Dazs store. The time was post-dinner, and there were many people out and about, enjoying a stroll after their meals. The weather was neither too cold nor too warm, and inside the Häagen-Dazs, there were many teenagers, mostly girls, seated in groups, occupying most of the available seating. 'What flavor would you like, Xiaoqiao?' Su Yan asked, hoisting her up to have a look at the large posters displaying the variety of flavors. After a brief glance at the poster, Su Xiaoqiao pointed decisively at one and said, 'I want vanilla and strawberry.' 'Alright then.' Su Yan pointed to the two flavors Xiaoqiao had chosen and told the server, 'We'll have vanilla and strawberry, a double scoop, please.' The server smiled slightly, 'Today our branch is having a promotion with the movie theater in the mall. If you buy a three-flavor ice cream, you'll get two free Little Seastar movie tickets.' She looked at Su Xiaoqiao when she mentioned 'Little Seastar,' a name that obviously catered to children. She was trying to captivate a child's eager heart. Su Xiaoqiao blinked and asked, 'Is Little Seastar any good?' 'The promotional poster over there talks about Little Seastar's adventures with its ocean friends,' the server pointed towards the entrance where the promotional poster was displayed. The poster was filled with various colorful sea creatures, vibrant and enchanting. Interest sparked, Su Xiaoqiao turned back to Su Yan, pouting her lips and in a sweet tone, she said, 'Uncle, I want to watch Little Seastar.' Even though Su Yan treated her very well and doted on her, they didn't spend much time together, so the little girl didn't dare to act too spoiled around him. Every expression she made, even the tiniest bit of willfulness, was so endearing that it made it difficult for anyone to say no, let alone when she tried to please. Su Yan reached out and playfully pinched her little nose, saying with a smile, 'But we can only have a little ice cream, okay?' Su Xiaoqiao knew that meant he had agreed. She nodded and gestured with her chubby little hands, 'Mhm, just a little bit, this little.' 'Okay.' 'Smack...' Seeing Su Yan nod in agreement, Su Xiaoqiao enthusiastically hugged Su Yan and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Her soft little lips left Su Yan momentarily stunned. As he regained his composure, he held her even tighter, wishing nothing more than to cherish her to his very core. It fulfilled a childhood longing he never realized he harbored. Watching his sister being taken to the orphanage, crying and calling out, he had so desperately wanted to hold her and take her home. Chapter 1913: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Nineteen) After purchasing the Tri-Color Ice Cream, three little scoops with three different colors in a paper cup, Su Yan carried Xiaoqiao with one arm and the ice cream in the other as they made their way to her table. Xiaoqiao, wielding a fork, blissfully ate while walking, her face becoming adorably smeared with ice cream. They had obtained two movie ticket vouchers; the cinema was located on the mall's top floor, which had ten floors in total. The elevator in the mall, much like the one in the hospital, stopped nearly at every floor, testing the patience of the adults, but Xiaoqiao, absorbed in her ice cream, was not the least bit hurried. "I'm sorry, there are no tickets left for the next show, and the following one isn't until 9:40 PM." At the cinema's ticket counter, the clerk informed them that the soonest show was sold out, and they would have to wait over an hour for the next one. Su Yan glanced at his wristwatch and said to Xiaoqiao, "It starts at 9:30 PM, and it'll be after 11:00 PM when it's over. That's too late; Xiaoqiao, you can't watch it." He pouted, anticipating the little girl's reaction. Hearing his words, Xiaoqiao's lips drooped in disappointment, and she whispered softly, "I want to watch it." Her enthusiasm had been kindled, and to be told abruptly that they couldn't continue was truly disheartening. "But it's late, and if Xiaoqiao doesn't sleep, she won't grow taller," Su Yan said as he affectionately ruffled her hair with a tender coaxing voice. Xiaoqiao, rather than throwing a tantrum, simply bowed her head and sulked, her downcast expression more heart-wrenching than any outburst. Su Yan felt a twinge of pity; looking around, he noticed a long line across from them. Curious, he glanced upwards to see 'Snowy Love Ice Rink, National Champion Inline Skating Coaches...' His eyes lit up, and pointing in that direction, he proposed to Xiaoqiao, "There's an ice rink over there; how about I take you skating instead?" Following Su Yan's direction, Xiaoqiao saw the long queue of people outside the rink, bustling with activity. She blinked, still pouting, her thoughts lingering on the 'Little Seastar' movie. Yet, since Uncle had mentioned it was quite late and the movie seemed out of the question, she decided that skating would be an acceptable alternative – certainly better than missing out on everything. After some internal deliberation, Xiaoqiao nodded hesitantly, "Alright, let's skate then." Her tone bore a hint of reluctance. Su Yan gently stroked her cheek, reassuring her, "Uncle will take you to see 'Little Seastar' next weekend." Xiaoqiao's eyes brightened, and she held out her pinky to Su Yan, demanding, "Pinky promise." Su Yan extended his pinky, locking it with the little girl's and sealing the promise with a 'stamp'. Dressed in a crisp shirt and exuding an impressive demeanor, Su Yan's height and presence made him stand out in the crowd, and his high attractiveness drew glances from passersby, both married women and single young ladies alike. They envied the adorable interaction between him and Xiaoqiao, wishing they could be the little girl embraced by such an attractive man. They decided to go inline skating on a whim, they lacked any gear, but that was easily resolved with a single word – 'buy.' Money was no obstacle to getting equipped. Su Yan and Xiaoqiao, after ordering and paying, were handed two complete sets of inline skating gear by the sales clerk. "Sir, we have several inline skating coaches from the national team here, including national champions who are experts at teaching children," the clerk enthusiastically recommended their skating coaches to Su Yan. Chapter 1914: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty) Su Yan patiently listened as the instructor finished his introduction, then politely shook his head to decline, 'No need, thank you.' He took the complete set of equipment and led Su Xiaoqiao to a bench in the resting area to change into their skating gear. ... 'Are you ready, my dear? Feeling scared?' After gearing up, Su Yan stood up first then gently pulled Su Xiaoqiao to her feet. They made their way to the rink, step by careful step. The ground was covered with a thick layer of ice, with drafts of cold air rising up, causing Su Xiaoqiao to shiver. She then looked up at Su Yan and shook her head firmly, 'I'm not afraid.' Observing the other children on the rink, their screams and laughter, Su Xiaoqiao's disappointment at not seeing the movie slowly dissipated. Her plump little face blossomed into a bright, flower-like smile. 'You're doing wonderfully, Xiaoqiao. There's no need to fear. Uncle will always hold your hand and protect you,' Su Yan reassured her as he gently coaxed her onto the ice. Holding her small hands, he faced her and pulled her along, skating backward with ease. Su Xiaoqiao expressed surprise, 'Uncle, you can skate?' Su Yan winked at her in response, 'Just watch; you'll see.' He then carefully let go of Su Xiaoqiao's hands and started to glide backward slowly. Suddenly, he spun around with lightning speed, closing the distance in the blink of an eye. Su Xiaoqiao watched with her mouth agape in disbelief, looking at Su Yan with absolute admiration, 'Uncle, that was amazing, you're so skilled!' 'So, do you believe now that your uncle won't let you fall?' Su Yan asked as he smoothly returned to Xiaoqiao's side, taking her hand and guiding her in a slow glide across the ice, all while instructing her with great patience. He wore his own casual clothes, and despite having access to all the gear, he only switched to a pair of skates, foregoing knee pads and the like. However, he spared no effort in ensuring Su Xiaoqiao's safety, outfitting her with knee pads, elbow guards, a helmet, and more. 'Mmhmm,' Su Xiaoqiao nodded, her trust in her uncle immeasurable, her admiration without bounds. At that moment, she would've even helped him count money if he had decided to 'sell' her. 'Uncle, you're the best.' The uncle-niece pair skated in sync, their conversation flowing with delight, when suddenly, from afar, applause broke out. Su Xiaoqiao's gaze shifted toward the sound, and the next moment, she excitedly clutched Su Yan's hand tighter, pointing in the direction she was looking, 'Uncle, look at that sister, she's incredible.' Hearing this, Su Yan turned to look where Su Xiaoqiao was pointing, his expression neutral. He didn't look out of curiosity, but rather instinctively. From that corner, across from them, came the clapping and cheering of children gathered around a girl in a white tracksuit... she must have been just over twenty, surrounded by a group of kids. Su Yan observed her performing consecutive 360-degree spins, just like the move he had shown Xiaoqiao. Her hair, wound up in a topknot, spun so fast her face was indiscernible. She must be the inline skating coach here, with such skills not out of the ordinary. Su Yan glanced at her briefly, intending to look away. Suddenly, the elastic band holding her hair broke, and her raven-black locks tumbled down, forming an elegant curve in the air as she spun. This unexpected event dazzled the spectators with its natural and surprising elegance. However, the skater herself hadn't anticipated this. Surprised by her loose hair, she immediately stopped. Because she halted so abruptly, her body lurched forward, staggering unsteadily. Chapter 1915: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-One) Su Yan instinctively extended his hands, a natural reaction born from his tendency to offer assistance out of compassion. Yet, he had been momentarily distracted, forgetting to maintain the proper distance. 'Teacher, teacher,' The girl teetered, trying to keep her balance. Her pupils quickly encircled her, working together to steady her before she could fall. Recovering her balance, the girl teacher stood tall, head bowed, and cheekily stuck out her tongue to the children, 'How embarrassing, your teacher almost took a spill right in front of everyone.' The incident took place in front of both the children and a circle of observing parents. Despite the potential for embarrassment, her voice revealed no discomfort but instead conveyed a natural and composed demeanor. Such poise... Su Yan was intrigued, his attention irresistibly pulled back to her. With her head down, her long hair fell and shielded her face, leaving him with a singular impression... Tranquility. She seemed to embody what he always sought after... Comfort, serenity, and peace. 'Teacher, you're so pretty,' 'Teacher, you're like a goddess,' The consoling words came from a band of little boys, each eager to be the hero, lavishing their teacher with enthusiastic compliments. The teacher grinned at the boys and tenderly tousled their hair, 'How come you boys are so sweet?' Her voice... it sounded somewhat... Familiar? Recognition sparked within Su Yan; the voice of the skating instructor felt strangely familiar, yet he couldn't place where he had encountered it before. His train of thought was interrupted as Su Xiaoqiao tugged at his sleeve, asking, 'Uncle, isn't that sister very pretty?' Shifting his gaze to his niece, he smiled warmly, 'But not as pretty as you, Xiaoqiao.' Girls of all ages love compliments, and Su Xiaoqiao was no different. She smiled radiantly, 'Uncle, you have great taste.' Su Yan allowed himself a fuller smile. He glanced back towards where the children were, but the skating instructor was no longer in sight. He lightly pursed his lips and looked away. The skating rink would close at half-past nine, and they had skated for just under an hour. After removing their skates, Su Yan efficiently packed the gear and took it in hand. Leading Su Xiaoqiao to the exit, he inquired, 'Did you have fun skating, Xiaoqiao?' Su Xiaoqiao nodded emphatically, 'Very much so.' After responding, she gave one last lingering look at the now-empty rink. Su Yan caught her longing glance and stooped to ask, 'Do you like inline skating?' 'I love it! Can we still come back next time?' Su Xiaoqiao looked up at him hopefully. 'Certainly, next time I'll be your instructor,' Su Yan assured her with a nod. Thrilled, Su Xiaoqiao affectionately embraced Su Yan's leg, 'You're the best, Uncle.' 'Should we go home and get some rest now?' he suggested, lifting her in his arms and moving swiftly away from the rink. She wasn't dressed for the chill; Su Xiaoqiao's hands were icy, and her nose was rosy from the cold. Su Yan enveloped her chilled hands in his warmth as they headed towards the elevator. 'Teacher, goodbye,' 'Goodbye,' The voices of the children saying farewell to their teacher, along with the instructor's replies, drifted from behind them. The female skating instructor's voice still stirred a faint sense of familiarity in Su Yan. Yet it was not as intense as before. Chapter 1916: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Two) Su Yue's gaze shifted, only to see the diminishing figure of a girl, her satin-like hair nearly covering her slender back. The sensation felt hauntingly familiar, reminiscent of a memory from years ago on an old street in N City of country Y... In this world, there appeared to be another girl capable of invoking such emotions within him. The girl had already descended the escalator, vanishing from Su Yue's sight. Yet, the tranquil and comforting feeling she left behind continued to meander through his heart, as though he were admiring a bridge over tranquil waters nestled in the mountains. 'Uncle, what are you looking at?' Su Xiaoqiao inquired, gazing up at Su Yue with wide-eyed curiosity. His train of thought interrupted, he redirected his attention to Xiaoqiao, offering a gentle smile and a slight shake of his head, 'It's nothing, we should head home.' With that, he took her hand and they walked toward the elevator... Despite understanding that death is a part of life, Old Master Jiang's demise weighed heavily on Ah Heng, impacting not just him but the entire Jiang family. Hearts harbor their own mysteries; certain outcomes can be anticipated, yet when they come to pass, acceptance still necessitates time. Yan Rusheng, Ming Ansheng, and their peers, having grown up under Old Master Jiang's watchful eye, stayed by Ah Heng's side, busy until late into the night. As the guests departed and the night deepened, only the male members of the Jiang family, Xin Yanting, and Yan Rusheng's group remained in the quietude of the mourning hall. Xin Yanting and Ah Heng knelt before the hall, her intermittent sobs punctuating the heavy silence. Having grown up in the Jiang household, cherished by Old Master Jiang as his prized jewel and pampered to the skies, she had been away from home for four years. During her time abroad, she maintained daily contact with her grandfather. Even at her busiest, she would call every other day, or at most every two days, if just to exchange greetings. Receiving the news of Old Master Jiang's critical condition, she hurried home but tragically missed his final moments. This likely constituted the main reason for her reluctance to rise - a tangle of guilt and remorse. The vigil was set for Old Master Jiang's nephews and Ah Heng. As the remaining visitors began to leave, Yan Rusheng and his friends decided it was time for their departure. Tranquil, ever the considerate one, took it upon herself to bid farewell, 'Ah Heng, we'll be leaving now.' She walked over to Ah Heng as she spoke. Ah Heng stood to greet her, 'Right, be careful on your way home.' He then looked towards Yan Rusheng and Ming Ansheng, nodding to acknowledge them. Tranquil observed Ah Heng's solemn face and offered her sympathies softly, 'My condolences, do take care.' 'Yes,' Ah Heng responded quietly, 'You should head back, it's late.' Tranquil nodded, 'We'll come back to visit tomorrow.' Her eyes then shifted to Xin Yanting, still kneeling in silent stillness, a world away from the outspoken, arrogant Xin Yanting of the past, invoking a deep sense of compassion. Ah! Love can transform a person, but it can also destroy one. Four years had passed without contact with Xin Yanting, and although Tranquil had often contemplated asking Ah Heng for news, she never did. Despite her continued sense of guilt, even though Su Yue had only acted in kind and ultimately only obtained that thirty percent stake in Rongsheng from her, through a lens of empathy and reason, Xin Yanting was innocent. Chapter 1917: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Three) Yet she assessed the situation from the perspective of a woman, with a heart full of compassion. In the dog-eat-dog world of business, tactics more contemptible than these had once been employed by her own mother. Wen Xuxu gave Xin Yanting a profound look but ultimately did not step forward; the words 'I offer my condolences' to Xin Yanting remained unspoken. With a helpless sigh in her heart, she turned and whispered to Yan Rusheng and Su Yue, 'Let's go.' 'Oh!' Su Yue responded, and as she turned to follow Ming Ansheng, her gaze remained fixed on Xin Yanting. Her thoughts and feelings were in accord with Wen Xuxu's, viewed from the standpoint of womanhood. Likewise, in the end, she could only press her lips together in silent resignation and follow Ming Ansheng away. 'I feel somewhat sorry for Xin Yanting.' Once in the car and on their way, Su Yue, seated in the passenger seat, suddenly spoke. She leaned back, exhausted. Ming Ansheng turned to her with a teasing smile, 'Didn't you use to dislike her?' He gazed at her tenderly, feeling reassured; he knew she had always been kind-hearted, and only those with such kindness would grapple with these feelings. Since her arrival, her attention had been on Xin Yanting, her eyes always filled with guilt. In their eyes, the matter between Su Yan and Xin Yanting was trivial. Gaining trust was a means to an end, a tactical move in the grander scheme. Su Yue pouted and sighed, 'My dislike doesn't stop me from feeling empathy for her as a fellow woman.' Ming Ansheng, with a hint of mischief, raised an eyebrow, 'A woman? Are you certain?' Seeing her furrowed brow, entangled in emotion, he didn't know how to comfort her, so he tried to lighten the mood. 'Cut it out...' Su Yue shot Ming Ansheng a glance but couldn't suppress her laughter. Her laughter lightened the mood, and Ming Ansheng continued to jest, 'We can thank President Su for this, after all.' Defending her uncle, Su Yue countered, 'But President Su did nothing wrong. He just wanted to reclaim the thirty percent stake in Rongsheng. Xin Yanting's feelings for him were unrequited; he never made any promises. It was always her who thought President Su returned her affections.' That seemed to be the case; it always had been. So why did she feel conflicted upon seeing Xin Yanting? Why did she feel guilty? As Su Yue questioned herself inwardly, Ming Ansheng posed the same question, 'So why the conflict?' 'I don't know.' Su Yue ran her fingers through her hair in frustration, 'I've heard that Xin Yanting even got a tattoo for President Su. How deeply must someone love to go to such lengths?' This she had learned from her third sister-in-law, about Xin Yanting's rose tattoo, with President Su's name etched within its petals. Upon hearing it, she felt uneasy. A woman in love can be foolishly naive, willing to declare her feelings to the world, always wanting to give her best to someone else, and once invested, becomes blind to the consequences. How deeply must Xin Yanting have loved President Su to etch his name into her flesh? She likely never imagined that she was merely a pawn in President Su's game. Perhaps it was reminiscent of the pain she once felt when Tang Feiling seared a tattoo into her chest with a hot iron – it felt as though her heart was being carved out. If that tattoo hadn't been related to Ming Ansheng, it would have been little more than a superficial wound. Chapter 1918: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Four) Su Yan wondered if Xin Yanting's tattoo still remained; if it did, whether it caused her pain every time she saw it, and if it had been removed, whether the removal was as painful as the moment she first got it. Her brows were tightly knitted as she gazed out the window, her expression somber. Ming Ansheng looked at her and smiled, "Tattoos are actually a form of art. Some people get them solely for the sake of artistic expression." He was trying to cheer her up, and it worked—she smiled. Turning towards him with a sardonic gaze, she asked, "Did you get your tattoo for the sake of art, or to commemorate the love between you and Sister Meiduo that was never fulfilled?" Ming Ansheng's lips formed a wry smile, "Perhaps we should go back to discussing Xin Yanting and your brother." He didn't want the conversation to shift back to him; it seemed better to calmly accompany her through her thoughts. Sister Meiduo was no longer with them, and Su Yan hadn't meant to disrespectfully invoke her memory just to tease Ming Ansheng—it was merely a spontaneous remark. But the past, no matter what it entailed, was already behind them. Looking out the window at the quiet night roads, a contrast to the once bustling districts, now with storefronts darkened and closed, her mood was heavy, possibly still affected by the visit to the mourning hall. The two fell into silence, and the atmosphere in the car grew still. As the car drove slowly, Su Yan's eyelids began to droop. After they passed the residential area, the interior of the car brightened significantly. Su Yan opened her eyes to see the bright lights of a hospital at the entrance, likely a private facility. The display screen above was still active, flashing with various images. She sighed, "I've heard that after discovering the truth, Xin Yanting attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. She had always looked down on Tang Feiling's obsessive pursuit of you. She was supposed to be someone who could boldly love or hate, someone who knew when to hold on and when to let go. And yet, she considered suicide over a man." This was a rumor she had picked up from Mu Li, who had mentioned it in passing, having heard it from someone else, which made its veracity uncertain. "So, you mean to say that your brother is just a mere man?" Ming Ansheng nodded, intentionally misconstruing her words. Su Yan knew he was teasing her and turned to him with a frown, "Stop twisting my words. What I mean is that, without his remarkable qualities, my brother is just an ordinary man." Setting aside those remarkable qualities, her brother was just an ordinary man... Ming Ansheng watched Su Yan with amusement, shaking his head at the peculiar logic. After a light chuckle, he probed further, "But can you reach any conclusion from all this ruminating?" "No," Su Yan replied, shaking her head, then abruptly stopped, "Let's not think about it anymore. No amount of contemplation will lead to a resolution. It won't change my brother's feelings. If he doesn't love her, he simply doesn't." Seeing her so preoccupied with her thoughts, Ming Ansheng decided to change the topic, "Are you hungry?" "Not at all. Let's pick up Xiaoqiao quickly," Su Yan said. "Alright." ... Upon arriving at Su Yan's home, they knocked on the door. Su Yan, clad in smoke-grey pajamas and bleary-eyed from sleep, answered. Recognizing Su Yan and Ming Ansheng, he understood they had come for Xiaoqiao. "Xiaoqiao has fallen asleep. Let her stay here for the night," he suggested. "She needs to go to kindergarten tomorrow morning," Su Yan pointed out. Xiaoqiao had only just started and had already missed a day. She was still adjusting and couldn't afford to miss another day. Chapter 1919: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Five) 'I'll take her there,' Su Yan said as he yawned. Turning, he pointed to the shoe cabinet, speaking lazily to Su Yue, 'The shoes are in there; grab them yourself.' Dragging his feet languidly, he made his way to the sofa and sat down, continuing to yawn in the corner. After changing her shoes, Su Yue entered the room and asked Su Yan, 'Which room is Su Xiaoqiao in?' Su Yan gestured towards a door, and Su Yue headed there. As she reached the doorway, she paused, noticing the bedside lamp was on, its light dimmed to a soft glow. Standing at the entrance, she saw Su Xiaoqiao lying there, her face serene in sleep, and she couldn't bear to disturb her, fearing she might wake her up. After a moment's consideration, she turned and tiptoed away from the door. Looking to Ming Ansheng who was seated on the sofa, she suggested, 'How about I stay here for the night, and you go back alone?' Before Ming Ansheng could reply, Su Yan quickly suggested, 'Neither of you should leave tonight. Just stay here; it's a long way from here to your house.' Given that he now had a larger house with plenty of rooms, and considering the distance between them – one in the south and the other in the north of the city – it was indeed quite far. Hearing this, Su Yue nodded without hesitation, 'Yes, that sounds good.' Then she addressed Ming Ansheng, proposing, 'Let's both stay here tonight and take Su Xiaoqiao to kindergarten together in the morning.' Ming Ansheng pursed his lips, held back a moment, and then said with a slight smile, 'You stay. I have a meeting early tomorrow at the office; I'll go back.' He had never spent the night at someone else's home, excluding hotels, especially not at the younger... his elder brother-in-law's place. He was sure he'd suffer from insomnia, and he was scared, okay? He'd rather drive for thirty to forty minutes and sleep soundly at his own home. Realizing he had work commitments in the morning, Su Yue didn't insist. She simply said, 'Then be careful on the road.' Ming Ansheng nodded, 'I know. You should go to bed early.' As he stood up, he also looked at Su Yan and nodded, 'I'm leaving now.' Even though he didn't use any formal title or call him 'Third Brother', his tone clearly showed his discomfort, something even Su Yue could detect. Trying to suppress her laughter, Su Yue escorted Ming Ansheng to the door, repeatedly reminding him to be careful, until she saw him enter the elevator and the doors closed. Then she went back inside. 'Ha ha ha...' Once she had closed the door behind her, she couldn't hold back her laughter any longer. While laughing, she walked towards Su Yan. He looked at her amusedly and asked, 'What's so funny, did you find some money?' 'I think Ming Ansheng is so tortured,' continued Su Yue as she took a seat beside Su Yan, still giggling. Su Yan frowned, 'Has he gone silly?' 'It's hard for him to call you 'Third Brother', and he's too embarrassed to say it,' Su Yue explained. Su Yan rolled his eyes, 'The one torturing him isn't me; it must be someone else.' After saying this, he lay back and closed his eyes again. 'Right, Third Brother!' Su Yue laughed again, 'You're so mean, always deliberately teasing him with this.' Hearing this, Su Yan opened his eyes again, looked at her with a frown, and asked, 'How is that teasing? Isn't he supposed to call me 'Third Brother', to call me 'Third Brother'?' 'Sure, sure, sure, are you happy now?' Su Yue stuck out her tongue, then suddenly she moved closer to Su Yan and whispered, 'Third Brother.' The atmosphere suddenly became serious. Su Yan glared at her, 'What is it?' 'Tell me honestly, have you and Xin Yanting ever had anything happen between you?' Su Yue stared intently at Su Yan, as if trying to discern any hint of deceit. Chapter 1920: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Six) Su Yan feigned ignorance. "What exactly are you referring to?" "You know exactly what I’m talking about." Su Yue pouted and huffed, "I just hope you’re not the ultimate heartbreaker." Su Yan couldn’t help but laugh. He reached out and playfully tapped Su Yue’s forehead. "What are you imagining now? Hurry up and go take a shower and head to bed." Then he stood up, stretching lazily as he walked toward the bedroom. Watching his retreating figure, Su Yue couldn’t help but smile. "So, does that mean nothing happened?" "I am a Virgo, after all," came Su Yan’s languid voice. Su Yue lifted her head to look at him, just as his tall silhouette disappeared into the room. I am a Virgo... A twitch formed at the corner of Su Yue's mouth. Despite his slight obsession with cleanliness and his quest for perfection in his emotional and professional life, she had never noticed any typical Virgo traits in him. He seemed to have no expectations of the people around him and was reserved and indifferent, hardly the image of a Virgo. But his implication was clear: nothing substantial had occurred with Xin Yanting, and that put Su Yue at ease. Letting out a deep sigh of relief, Su Yue put down the pillow she had been holding and got up, heading toward her room. ... Yan Rusheng and Wen Xuxu had been absent from the office lately, leaving Su Yan to deal with a heavier workload. Upon arriving in the morning, he had buried himself in a mound of tasks well before the other employees started to trickle in. After resolving a few challenging issues, he glanced at his watch—it was just nine o'clock. As he looked up toward the entrance, he saw the busy silhouettes of his colleagues through the frosted glass door. Each was immersed in the hustle of the morning. He turned his attention away and reached for the white porcelain cup on his desk, only to find yesterday's water still inside. He stood up and walked over to the water cooler. "Uh..." Just as Su Yan got to his feet, the office door suddenly opened, and in came his new secretary, Mi Xiao. Upon seeing Su Yan, Mi Xiao stopped in her tracks, her expression a mix of surprise and nervousness. After a moment's hesitation, she hurriedly apologized, "I'm sorry, Su Yan. I wasn't aware you had arrived so early." She stepped back, as if to leave. Su Yan shook his head with a faint smile, "It's alright." Then he resumed his walk toward the water cooler. He was accustomed to arriving early, but this was the first time the new secretary had encountered it. Nonetheless, it was hardly a matter of concern. Mi Xiao watched Su Yan for a brief moment, seeming to ensure he wasn’t upset, then she pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose and stepped into the office. Holding two green file folders, she walked up to Su Yan's desk, her gaze cautious. Su Yan filled a glass with water and took a sip as he turned back to his desk. Unless there was a board meeting or an important executive gathering, he preferred to dress without a tie—white shirt, black dress pants, and an effortless demeanor that, combined with his inherent indifferent handsomeness, was pleasant to the eye. He approached Mi Xiao, swallowed the water in his mouth, and looked down at her inquiringly, "What's the matter?" This was the first time he had stood so close to his new secretary since her employment began just over two weeks ago, and he realized how petite she was—that he needed to lower his gaze to meet hers. Her large, black-framed glasses nearly covered half her face, and her bangs were trimmed straight across her forehead. At a glance, she seemed plain. Without meaning to, Su Yan found himself taking in every detail of his new secretary, Mi Xiao. Chapter 1921: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Seven) Su Yan then chastised himself internally, for everyone around him seemed to consider him past the prime age for marriage, showing concern and urging him to socialize more with women. Indeed, he was only twenty-eight, but since Aireli and Su Yue were both anxious on his behalf, this time he deliberately chose a female secretary. But whom was he really trying to appease with this action? Su Yan's observation was discreet; thus, Mi Xiao remained unaware as she presented two portions of documents to him. 'President Su, these documents are awaiting your signature,' she said. Su Yan murmured an acknowledgment, took them, placed them on his desk, quickly perused, and then proceeded to sign. As he was signing, Mi Xiao continued, 'You have a lunch appointment with Chairman Wang from the Top 100 Group at noon.' 'Mhm, I know. Are there any other engagements?' Su Yan asked as he handed back the signed documents to Mi Xiao. Receiving the documents, Mi Xiao shook her head. 'No, that's all.' Just as she finished responding, she suddenly recalled something else. 'Oh, Miss Aireli called earlier, asking if you're free tonight.' Upon hearing the name 'Aireli,' Su Yan's expression paused momentarily, as if deep in contemplation. After a brief moment, he gave Mi Xiao a slight nod, 'I've taken note.' He did not provide Mi Xiao with a direct answer regarding his availability. 'I'll step out then.' Holding the documents, Mi Xiao gave a slight nod to Su Yan and turned to walk towards the door. The black flats she wore, with their modest three to four-centimeter heel, made her slender legs appear even more delicate. As her steps tapped lightly on the wooden floor, a soft 'tap tap' sound resonated, gentle like her presence—diminutive and unassuming, in stark contrast to Aireli's high-profile and assertive nature. Involuntarily, Su Yan's gaze shifted towards the door, catching sight of Mi Xiao's petite figure, her ponytail swaying softly behind her. He felt an unexplained sense of comfort. Just as Mi Xiao was about to step out, Su Yan unexpectedly called out, 'Mi Xiao, please make me a cup of red tea.' 'Right away.' Mi Xiao paused, turned back to Su Yan, and replied before exiting. Su Yan settled back into his seat. After a knock and his permission, Mi Xiao re-entered. When she came in, she pushed up the glasses sitting on her nose—a gesture that seemed more deliberate than natural, subtly hinting at her unfamiliarity with the new accessory. It wasn't particularly strange; perhaps she had recently started wearing glasses due to myopia, or it could be that he was mistaken. Su Yan did not ponder further but simply gave Mi Xiao a brief glance before continuing with his work. 'President Su, your red tea is ready.' Mi Xiao announced as she approached Su Yan with the brewed tea. 'Okay, just place it here,' Su Yan responded without lifting his gaze. 'Understood.' As Mi Xiao set the teacup in front of Su Yan, her hands lingered momentarily before retracting. He finally lifted his gaze, his glance unintentionally sweeping over her hands. They were small and fair, yet the knuckles stood out slightly, suggesting hands that have experienced labor. He wasn't involved in the hiring process, as it was managed by the HR department, so he knew little about this new secretary, only her name, the university she graduated from, and that she was a recent graduate on an advanced internship. Regarding the rest—her place of registration, whether she hailed from a rural or urban area, or any other internship experiences—of that, he was completely unaware. Chapter 1922: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Eight) As Su Yan mused, he lifted his gaze to Mi Xiao. From his seated position, there wasn't much difference in their heights. Yet, this shift in perspective offered a new sensation. Her dainty, oval face was calm and fair, and though her simple straight bangs and oversized black glasses were plain, they imparted a sense of ease to Su Yan, like the gentle caress of a spring breeze. It seems that the charm of a girl's appearance is angle-dependent; that's why ladies often opt for specific angles in selfies to capture their best look. As a result, the photos posted on Weibo, a platform akin to Twitter, often showcase the same pose from the same angle. With a chuckle at the thought, Su Yan shook his head, his mind briefly wandering from the presence of his new secretary before him. Mi Xiao watched Su Yan curiously, wondering what had prompted his sudden laughter. Feeling her gaze, Su Yan looked up, meeting her questioning eyes. The smile naturally receded from his face, returning to his usual detached expression. It was peculiar for him to find himself analyzing a woman in his very ordinary secretary. As the smile disappeared from Su Yan's face, Mi Xiao quickly inquired, "Su Zong, do you need anything else?" Su Yan shook his head, "No, you may go." "Alright." Mi Xiao nodded and turned to leave. Just then, Su Yan recalled something and looked up at her, "Reply to Miss Aireli that I'll be available after work tonight." "Oh," Mi Xiao responded, her tone betraying a touch of gloom. It could dampen anyone's spirits. Miss Aireli was evidently well-acquainted with Su Yan, casually visiting his office. Their seemingly special relationship was the talk among colleagues; why didn't they just contact each other directly instead of using the office phone? Later that afternoon, Su Yan received another update from Mi Xiao that Aireli had called, and they had scheduled dinner for the evening.... "Su Zong, if there's nothing pressing, may I leave now?" At 5:10 pm, ten minutes after the official end of the workday, Mi Xiao knocked on Su Yan's office door, standing there with an air of anticipation. Although she typically appeared overly cautious, her actions and decisions were marked by sound logic and high efficiency. One might expect her to err out of hastiness, yet she had never faltered, resembling a child who seems on the verge of stumbling while learning to walk but remains steadfast. Su Yan smiled at this notion, finding the sense of familiarity peculiar. Mi Xiao stood by, awaiting his reply. Gathering his thoughts, he instructed her, "Please prepare another cup of coffee for me." There was still a significant workload ahead, and he needed an energizer. "Oh..." Mi Xiao's composure gave way to a hurried stance, mirroring the urgency she felt within. She moved closer to the office, towards Su Yan, and reached for his cup. Suddenly pausing, she looked at him, asking with a trace of doubt, "Su Zong, you mean actually brew it, right?" Her expression silently conveyed her protest: the inconvenience of brewing coffee this late didn't escape her. With this in mind, Su Yan couldn't help but smile again before he reassured her, "If you're in a hurry, instant is fine too." He sensed that Mi Xiao must have something urgent to attend to, especially since it was already past working hours and there were no difficult tasks awaiting her. It wasn't necessary to keep her any longer. Chapter 1923: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Nine) 'I don't have any pressing matters,' Mi Xiao stated, shaking her head, her evenly-trimmed bangs fluttering with the movement, gleaming with a sleek darkness under the office light. Yet, there was a hint of insincerity in the clarity of her eyes that did not escape President Su's notice. She appeared clearly anxious... He chose to overlook it and waved her off with a casual gesture: 'Then proceed to make it, but without any sugar, please.' 'Understood.' Mi Xiao nodded, her delicate hands tightly clutching the cup. As she turned to leave, President Su caught a fleeting frown on her brow. He silently laughed to himself, finding it unexpectedly amusing that after a long day at work, he was compelled to tease the young intern. The coffee machine was positioned within his office. While Mi Xiao attended to it, he flipped through his phone. As the fragrance of the brewing coffee enveloped the space, he directed his gaze away from his phone. She stood in front of the coffee machine, her back to him, motionless and silent, as if lost in thought while awaiting the coffee. There was something about this kind of silent companionship that President Su cherished—the sort that didn't interrupt his work yet provided a comforting presence. It was vastly different from... Xin Yanting, who always seemed desperate to assert her presence. 'President Su, have a look at this bag I purchased today—it's the latest from Burberry, and it pairs so well with my white dress, wouldn't you agree?' 'President Su, which lipstick shade do you prefer, this one or yesterday's?' 'President Su, would you fancy some milk tea?' 'President Su, may I join you on your European journey?' 'President Su, you...' Reflecting on Xin Yanting's constant overtures for attention, President Su smirked inwardly at himself. He questioned how he had managed to tolerate it. It turned out he was not so different from most men after all—not as noble or distinctive as he had once considered himself. 'President Su, the coffee is prepared.' Roused from his thoughts by Mi Xiao's voice, he observed her approaching with the steaming beverage. The aroma mingled with the steam, teasing his senses as he took note of Mi Xiao's slightly calloused hands. 'Have a cup as well,' he suggested nonchalantly. Mi Xiao appeared momentarily taken aback by the offer, her eyes widening for a brief second before she declined, 'No, thank you.' She shook her head gently, her initial surprise quickly subsiding without the excitement that might typically accompany such an invitation. She remained composed. President Su arched an eyebrow, 'Is there something urgent on your end?' Once again, Mi Xiao shook her head, 'No, there isn't.' Her impatience was subtly apparent, though she seemed unaware of it herself. President Su, with a soft smile, decided not to prolong the teasing, 'If there's nothing else, you may leave for the day.' After acknowledging him with a nod, he sipped his coffee, ready to immerse himself in the significant workload that awaited him. Feeling relieved, Mi Xiao's earlier frustration vanished. 'I shall take my leave then,' she said, offering President Su a respectful nod before adding, 'Please remember, you have a dinner engagement with Miss Aireli at seven o'clock this evening.' 'Noted,' he acknowledged. Seven o'clock... As Mi Xiao exited his office, President Su glanced at the digital clock—it was already six. He picked up his phone, weighing his next move, when an unexpected knock at the door caught his attention. He peered through the frosted glass, his eyes set upon the enigmatic tall figure standing outside. Chapter 1924: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Thirty) "Come in." President Su shelved the tangled web of thoughts he had been sorting through, offering a muted response to someone at the door, then tidied up the array of documents scattered across his desk. As the door swung open, a stylishly tall and poised woman stepped into his office. He wasn't taken aback—his face assumed a courteous smile as he greeted her, 'Miss Aireli.' Aireli was clad in a pale aqua blouse with a delicate print, paired with white slim-fit trousers that accentuated her lithe frame. A departure from her professional look, her face bore only light makeup, enhancing her natural beauty. Her ensemble was topped with sky-high heels (at least ten centimeters), in a pale hue. The whole outfit radiated a fresh, vernal charm. With graceful strides, she approached President Su, smiling softly. "President Su, I didn't want to disturb you if you were in the middle of something, so I decided to wait for you here." President Su's lips curved into a restrained smile, though it failed to reach his preoccupied eyes, as he shook his head. "Not to worry, I've just wrapped up. We can head out." He shut down his laptop and rose, making his way to the coat stand to retrieve his jacket, slinging it over his forearm. Aireli's gaze drifted to the towering stack of work on his desk. She regarded him earnestly. "President Su, I'm free this evening and not particularly hungry. There's no rush for dinner." A rare chance for one-on-one time with him—a restaurant setting would certainly be thrilling. She would be content just to sit there, watching him work—such a simple joy. Aireli's eyes lingered on President Su's striking features, her mind drifting into a daydream, ensnared by the allure of his enigmatic presence. "We should get going a bit earlier; our reservation is for seven," President Su said, his voice cool and detached. With President Su leaving the office, Aireli found herself naturally compelled to follow. Throughout their journey, she engaged President Su in conversation, her efforts to find topics seamless and spontaneous—not the forced chatter that can be so telling. President Su gripped the steering wheel, eyes fixed ahead. The days had lengthened with the advent of early summer, and it was still light out past six. But the evening businesses had already lit up their neon signs, casting an array of vivid colors on the streets below, stirring a strange complexity in his mood. "President Su, red light!" Aireli's sudden cry jolted him from his thoughts. The car had already cruised into the intersection, past the crosswalk. The perpendicular flow of vehicles and pedestrians had commenced, and he couldn't speed through—only brake sharply. The car halted, inertia pressing them forward. Fortunately, they were braced for it and avoided injury. Once the car was steady, Aireli's concern was palpable as she inquired, "President Su, you seemed miles away just now—what was it that had you so preoccupied?" "Just work stuff," President Su replied lightly, then offered her an apologetic smile. "I'm sorry for startling you." She dismissed it with a shake of her head. "I'm fine." The red light waned, and the green beckoned them on. The car resumed its cautious advance across the street. President Su made a concerted effort to rein in his emotions and focus, ensuring he wouldn't lose concentration again. He couldn't pinpoint exactly what had distracted him so profoundly. He had been listening to Aireli discuss the stock market, yet his mind had wandered. It was seven o'clock—prime dinner time—and the upscale Western restaurant thrummed with the lively chatter of its well-heeled patrons, not an empty seat in sight. They had reserved ahead, so seating was not a concern. Their table was in a private booth, set behind traditional beaded curtains, offering privacy and a touch of elegance amidst the dining hall's hum of conversation, the clink of cutlery, and the soft melody playing in the background. Chapter 1925: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Thirty-One) The dishes were served promptly; classic steaks and signature appetizers crafted by the head chef were their choices for the evening. Aireli also picked out a bottle of red wine. A tall, slender waiter attentively arranged their table and proceeded to uncork the wine, ready to pour. Aireli looked up at him with a gracious smile and said, 'Thank you, we'll pour it ourselves.' Heeding her words, the waiter set the bottle aside, nodded courteously, and withdrew. Now alone in the private dining area, Su Yan had removed his suit jacket and was dressed in a white shirt, his cufflinks undone, sleeves casually rolled up a notch. Knife and fork in hand, he elegantly carved his steak. 'President Su, let's have a drink,' Aireli suggested, tilting the wine bottle toward his glass. Su Yan glanced at it as if to speak up, but Aireli, sensing his hesitation, paused her pouring and looked his way. After a moment, Su Yan averted his eyes and continued cutting his steak without a word. Interpreting this as consent, Aireli smiled slightly and poured wine into Su Yan's glass with finesse, then into her own. With the wine poured, she picked up her glass, lifted it towards Su Yan, and smiled, 'President Su, to our enjoyable collaboration.' Su Yan put down his utensils, raised his glass, and their glasses touched, his voice even, 'To a fruitful collaboration.' They each took a refined sip of wine. Aireli then turned to Su Yan with a smile. 'You know, I'm rather surprised.' Su Yan raised an eyebrow, inviting her to continue. 'I'm surprised you agreed to dinner today, President Su. You always seem so busy; every time I've seen you, you're engrossed in your work, barely having a moment to talk,' Aireli said. Su Yan responded with an apologetic smile, 'I'm sorry if I've ever seemed inattentive.' 'It's fine, it's the nature of successful people, I understand,' Aireli replied, taking another delicate sip from her glass. Her lips, enticingly coated with a vibrant hue, now bore a trace of the wine's color, adding a touch of irresistible charm, and whether intentional or not, she did not wipe it away but continued to smile at Su Yan. Unfortunately for Aireli, Su Yan's glance was mere courtesy, his attention quickly returning to his meal after a brief acknowledgment. Having had a busy day, with a working lunch and missing out on afternoon tea, he was truly hungry. Noticing Su Yan's concentration on his meal, Aireli felt a twinge of disappointment and listlessly wiped her mouth with a napkin. She then resumed cutting her steak, methodically bringing pieces to her lips. As a celebrated actress with a legion of fans, she maintained her composure, her interest in a man never reducing her to a lovesick fan. The remainder of their meal passed in silence, which persisted until they had finished. After paying the bill, Su Yan and Aireli walked side by side out of the restaurant, Aireli donning her sunglasses as they strolled. 'Nini, watch your step.' As they stepped out of the revolving door, a woman nearby guided a little girl into it. The girl, about three or four and plumply adorable, caught Aireli's attention. This sight prompted a question from Aireli to Su Yan, 'President Su, that adorable little girl from your office the other day, she was your niece, wasn't she?'}
