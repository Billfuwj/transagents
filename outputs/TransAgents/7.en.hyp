Chapter 455: Turnaround 3 "Allow me to demonstrate the sensing of Formless Fluctuation; it's remarkably straightforward," interjected another sorcerer, a smile evident in his voice. "Your assistance is appreciated," Lin Sheng responded, offering a nod of gratitude. Time was of the essence in finding the remaining Fragments. He had initially planned to conquer an array of Great Evil Spirits to amass substantial reserves of pure soul power. Yet, the present opportunity necessitated an immediate and decisive acquisition. Promptly, the sorcerer leader brought Lin Sheng to a daunting Evil Spirit Gate. Both extended their hands, gently touching the gate's enigmatic frame, eyes closed as one. The leader rapidly employed his Special Ability to establish a Spatial Foundation, thus setting a Coordinate Code. Through the Ritual Fluctuation of the Evil Spirit Gate, he steered Lin Sheng's perceptive consciousness, sending them both hurtling with the pulse of the ritual. "Ordinary portal rituals are designed for point-to-point directed transport," he explained. "However, our venture into New Spatial Secret Realms modifies this to point-to-multipoint. A minor adjustment to the Transmission Foundation's parameters is all that's required." While guiding Lin Sheng's awareness, the leader shared his technical wisdom. "Consequently, the Evil Spirit Gate instinctively relays our consciousness to a spectrum of potential spaces resembling our intended target. It's akin to casting energy into the winds of chance—good fortune might lead us straight to the desired Secret Realm World; misfortune, on the other hand, means more energy and attempts are needed." "Truly, it is left to the whims of fortune." Lin Sheng kept his thoughts to himself. Upon entry into the Evil Spirit Gate, his Sensing was immediately enshrouded by the Ritual Fluctuation and dispersed. Simultaneously, as if his consciousness had splintered, his awareness divided into over a dozen segments, each discerning a vastly different spatial essence. "Normally, our consciousness struggles to maintain integrity during transmission. Thus, we commit to memory the spatial coordinates that our primary consciousness encounters. To secure these coordinates, we inscribe a simple Marker..." Outside, the sorcerer leader continued his subdued instruction, aiding Lin Sheng in crafting an elementary Marker to confirm the Coordinate Code. He was oblivious, however, to Lin Sheng's soul's exceptional strength and resilience, which allowed him to remember the coordinates of all spaces his fractured consciousness touched. Multitasking was simply another exercise for Lin Sheng, who routinely practiced observation and control through his Summoned Entities via split awareness. Though he was not yet adept at commanding multiple Summoned Entities to act independently, merely memorizing Fluctuations and setting coordinates was well within his capabilities. His soul's inherent toughness granted it a more extended existence, making the task seem almost effortless. A scant ten minutes passed before his consciousness, now exhausted, faded away. Lin Sheng reopened his eyes and faced the sorcerer leader and his astonished peers. "Locate this Secret Realm World coordinate for me." Without delay, he disclosed a specific Secret Realm World coordinate that he had sensed—a realm whose essence echoed with the fragment of the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel in his grasp—to the astounded sorcerer leader and his team. "Achieved in a single attempt?" The sorcerer leader experienced a twinge of envy, recalling the grueling half-month it took to sense spatial energies and document coordinates for the first time. "The method is elementary. Initiate the Portal. I will cross," Lin Sheng instructed firmly. "At once." "Pause, my physical vessel," Tiangong Xia's soulful transmission interrupted Lin Sheng's preparations. "What arises?" As Lin Sheng observed the sorcerer leader and others commanding the Evil Spirits to assemble resources, he moved aside to await further instructions, all the while engaged in a mental dialogue with Tiangong Xia. "A situation has developed. A major shift has transpired on Bisha Island!" Tiangong Xia's tone was imbued with a solemn gravity. Lin Sheng had not encountered such a sign before. Not even when he informed her about the King of Night did she exhibit such gravity. An atypical sense of urgency seized him. "Miyue is expected to be at a clear disadvantage, correct?" Lin Sheng inquired, his brow creased with concern. "Or has a new power entered the conflict?" "It is not a new power," Tiangong Xia declared with seriousness. "The truth is Miyue has deceived everyone! The Seven-Lock Tower was summoned successfully long before. He misled all inhabitants of the three major Secret Realms. He had already emerged victorious in summoning Farudo! Using his own being as a sacrificial offering! And has merged with it into a single entity!" Lin Sheng's consciousness briefly stalled. "To offer oneself as a sacrifice?... What madness!" "What now stands before the three major Secret Realms is not simply Miyue but a monstrous synthesis of Miyue and Farudo..." Lin Sheng was momentarily speechless. "How shall we respond?" Tiangong Xia's voice carried a weight of impending consequence. The union of Farudo and Miyue was a complex multiplication of forces, not mere addition. "Remain composed. For Miyue and Farudo, the primary adversaries are still the three major Secret Realms and the legion of other significant powers. Besides, this world is more intricate than you might surmise," Lin Sheng reflected on the intelligence he had previously compiled. "The denizens of Great Star Pond and those who wield the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts are formidable entities. As long as they refrain from provoking us, we have little reason to interfere with their machinations." "I apprehend your reasoning. Yet, vigilance is advisable," Tiangong Xia recommended. "I once bore power of such cataclysmic scale. It was during the epoch when I was under the Demon Sword's dominion. I am intimately aware of the havoc such power can wreak." Lin Sheng fell into contemplation. Among his lieutenants, Tiangong Xia was unparalleled. She had once been under the influence of a particularly potent force. At that juncture, she even perceived Lin Sheng's scrutiny within her recovered memories. That mere residual impression in her memories was enough to detect Lin Sheng, who had been delving into her past. Such formidable power transcended Lin Sheng's comprehension. "I understand," Lin Sheng reassured her. "I shall make the requisite preparations. Be assured." If necessary, he would call upon the most formidable of states, summoning all his lieutenants' powers and merging them into himself. Severing the link with Tiangong Xia, Lin Sheng's attention returned to the newly established Evil Spirit Gate. His thoughts circled back to the original plan. "The portal is primed for activation, Your Excellency," the sorcerer leader intoned with a deep respect. Lin Sheng pondered the Portal, his silence replete with expectation. "Bring forth the Fairy King. Moreover, Degaar!" "Present." The Demon Hand Degaar had been near, awaiting the summons. Answering the call, he strode in from the entrance. "Your Excellency, I am at the ready to enact your will." Lin Sheng acknowledged him with a nod. "My intention is to activate several Portals concurrently, to investigate various Evil Spirit Realms." "Assemble a hundred of the Great Evil Spirits, organize them into teams of diverse sizes, and commence exploratory missions." "By your command!" Degaar, the Demon Hand, felt a surge of solemnity, aware that his sovereign must have stumbled upon a critical juncture. Otherwise, there would not be such an urgent, widespread call to exploration. Chapter 456: Moving Forward Heeding the edicts of Lin Sheng, the formidable leader of the Evil Spirit Legion, the exploration of the vast Secret Realm Worlds commenced. The Demon Hand Degaar, upon receipt of his orders, promptly engaged in the mobilization of the legions. Concurrently, the sorcerers dispatched messages to the Fairy King, initiating the assembly of their forces. Shortly thereafter, the Fairy King, accompanied by an entourage of elite Herald Officers, emerged from within an Evil Spirit Gate. 'Master, your orders?' intoned the figure of impeccable form, marred only by the presence of a single eye, as she bowed before Lin Sheng. 'I require the Fairy Empire to send forth a legion of enslaved warriors to scour the New Spatial Secret Realm. The methodology of exploration lies with you; I demand results.' The Fairy Empire, an amalgamation of fairy and human kin, necessitated a more nuanced approach than the more direct methods suitable for the Evil Spirit tribes. The deep-seated bonds and allegiances among them meant that setting objectives and expecting outcomes was the optimal strategy, allowing them to utilize their own techniques to fulfill the mission. 'Your will shall be done, my lord,' the Fairy King affirmed, her composure unshaken. She possessed a greater array of tactics for exploring new domains with minimal casualties compared to Degaar's direct approach. After delegating the tasks to both the Fairy King and the Demon Hand Degaar, Lin Sheng concentrated on the new spatial secret realms, searching for any space that might bear the whisper of fragments. Perceiving, documenting coordinates, then crafting gates and dispatching armies to delve into the unknown. Portal after portal materialized across the plaza. As time inexorably moved forward, legions of Evil Spirits and the Fairy Empire's forces embarked on their mission. Initially converging here, they then dispersed into the myriad secret realms. A considerable outlay of transportation resources was expended, and a diverse array of materials was consumed. In response, a relentless march of over ten thousand from the combined forces of Evil Spirits and Fairies entered the portals that now stood open. Days elapsed. Some gateways were sealed by Lin Sheng after being appraised for their lack of value, while others, brimming with resources or academic intrigue, were preserved. Amongst them, Lin Sheng discerned three that exuded the scent of fragments. He dispatched significant forces to each for thorough examination. The reports indicated that these realms were expansive and teeming with intelligent life. The quest for divine artifacts was too perilous to entrust entirely to his subordinates. The notion of them securing and concealing the fragments was intolerable. Upon reflection, he resolved to have his forces assess the informational landscape of these realms before he would personally venture forth. His objective: to swiftly locate the fragments and secure them. ... On Bisha Island. 'Soul Breath Gaze.' Farudo, or perhaps it was Miyue, looked upward. From her back sprouted a dense thicket of grey tendrils, weaving together to form a formidable humanoid countenance. The visage, adorned with innumerable crimson eye beads, fastened its penetrating gaze upon several Emissaries in the distance. Buzz! An imperceptible wave of energy traversed a secret conduit, instantaneously spanning kilometers to afflict the Emissaries in full flight with pinpoint precision. 'No!!!' One of them screamed in terror as his protective barriers burst like fragile bubbles. With the disappearance of his defenses, his form grotesquely contorted under the sway of some arcane force. Boom! In mere moments, the chieftain from Euro Hell Inferno twisted like a marionette, segmenting into parts that cascaded down into the sea below. The others, witnessing this, fled with even greater desperation. This was beyond a contest of numbers; it was now a matter of survival. Farudo had ascended to a realm beyond the Emissaries, where the absence of an equal force signified certain demise. 'Shadow Hand.' At Farudo's behest, a shadowy, ink-black appendage extended from his maw, reaching for the fugitives in the distance. Puff puff! Two Emissaries fell as effortlessly as lambs before the slaughter, their essences scattering as they plunged into the sea beneath. Bisha Island lay drenched in blood and strewn with remnants. The last vestiges of power unleashed by the dying Emissaries had transformed it beyond recognition. The surface of the island had been sheared away, its elevation lowered by more than ten meters. Farudo stood upon the desecrated banner of Paradise Tower, his gaze settling upon the life-drained husks of the tower's mightiest—the Golden Armor White-Winged Male and the Crimson Angel. 'It is a regrettable conclusion. Ultimately, I am the victor,' he mused, a peculiar smile playing across his decaying visage. 'Do you presume... you... are assured of your victory?' From an outcropped slab of rock, an old man, impaled and bloodied, spoke defiantly. 'Still among the living?' Farudo inquired, his gaze turning to the elder. 'Xiji, had you not intervened this time, your end might have been different,' he surmised. Now a hybrid with Miyue's memories, Farudo was a fusion of her being and the original Farudo, inheriting her personality and emotions. He was not the complete Farudo but rather a manifest representative. 'Heh... This time, it is my defeat... But this world is more complex than you perceive. There will be those who shall seek retribution for me. Just wait...' The old man's voice was chilling as he spoke. 'I await with anticipation,' Farudo declared, extending his hand as a colossal ashen mist arm formed behind him, seizing the elder with unrelenting force. Squish! A spurt of blood erupted within the grasp of the ashen hand. 'What a lamentable loss. Another old acquaintance... has departed...' Farudo gazed skyward, his sigh laden with feigned sorrow. Around him, not one Emissary from Euro Hell Inferno remained intact. As he simulated grief, a silent, silver spike stealthily targeted his nape, wielded by none other than the paramount of White Paper, Sun Crown Celestial Kaysa, his pallor indicative of the grave injuries sustained in the recent clashes. He had managed to obscure himself, yet the environs of Bisha Island were now suppressed by a formidable Crimson Halo Forcefield. To even graze the edge of the forcefield was to reveal oneself. Even at his zenith, he could scarcely endure an offhand strike from Farudo. To fail in concealment was to embrace certain doom. Hence, he was compelled to return, seizing any fleeting opportunity. 'Soul Stabilizing Spike... Just a touch, regardless of the state of injury, can render a lifeform's soul inert, suspending consciousness for a full turn of the day.' Sun Crown Celestial Kaysa steeled his will, cognizant that if he failed to incapacitate Farudo swiftly, an escape would prove elusive. Rather than resign to oblivion, he opted for a direct confrontation! His Emissary's Special Ability, the art of concealing his vital essence and life fluctuations, permitted him to vanish within an unseen, intermediary dimensional rift. Only in the instant of aggression would his presence and energy unfurl. This was the keystone of his ascendancy as the pinnacle of Sun Crown. The silver spike edged closer to Farudo's nape. Five meters. Three meters. Two meters. One meter. Suddenly, the spike lunged forward. 'Incantation: Deterrence!' Farudo's voice erupted spontaneously. Swoosh! A ripple of pure grey shockwave burst from him, radiating outward in all directions. Chapter 457: Onward, Part 2 The ripple carried a potent shock, and in a flash, it forced the Spatial Sorcerer behind Farudo into retreat. 'Incantation: Fortitude.' 'Incantation: Spectral Bind.' 'Incantation: Suffocation.' 'Advanced Murderous Manacles.' 'Advanced Deathly Gaze.' 'Ultimate Infernal Demon Blade.' As Farudo unleashed a series of demonic chants, a dense array of mystical lights of various colors burst forth around him. Simultaneously, bizarre and diverse effects of the demonic chants detonated upon the Spatial Sorcerer. Bindings, soul suppression, the stare of death, scorching flame damage, asphyxiation, psychic intimidation, and more. These high-tier evil abilities, usually requiring at least a day to prepare, were as simple tricks to Farudo. Effortlessly, he instant-cast them with spoken words. By the time the Spatial Sorcerer regained his senses, he had only managed to resist and dispel two of the demonic effects, unable to fend off the rest. Layer upon layer of these effects perfectly ensnared him, transforming him into a powerless grey and black bundle. Pfft! Without a word, Farudo extended his right hand, thrusting forward to pierce the Spatial Sorcerer's forehead. His hand, like a sharpened blade, easily penetrated the skull of the Spatial Sorcerer, pulverizing his brain into disarray. Boom!! As the Spatial Sorcerer perished, the immense energy he had amassed as an Emissary exploded, igniting into a fiery orb that suddenly engulfed Farudo. Once the red flames cleared, Farudo stood unscathed. His gaze lifted, looking towards the many military ships now hastily turning tail to flee. 'Next, by opening three distinct passages to the Netherworld, I can ensure the complete arrival of my true self. Likewise, the Hand of the Netherworld shall awaken prematurely.' '...Struggle. Let me relish more surprises... Otherwise, what fun would there be after so many dull years if my rare outing were to end up uneventful?' Farudo stepped forth, softly uttering incantations. 'Incantation: Swift March.' Swish! His body instantly turned into a streak of grey light, rocketing forth like a falling star, surging towards the fleet. ... In an unknown secret realm world. Across the expansive white snowfields, tens of thousands from the Evil Spirit Legion were locked in a ferocious battle with the opposing centaur forces, staining the pristine snow with centaur blood. Their innate immunity to physical attacks meant only a handful of energy weapons could harm the evil spirits. Only a third of the centaur soldiers possessed such weapons, representing the pinnacle of power within this secret realm. Lin Sheng, mounted on his demonic steed, the Bloodfiend, stood clad in heavy, pure white armor atop a hillside, looking down upon the battlefield. His face was concealed by a helmet, his expression unreadable, his eyes exuding a trace of detachment and ruthlessness. 'Have you found what I seek?' he suddenly asked in a deep voice. 'Yes, the Coccyx Chieftain had cunningly attached it to the ankle of his second son. I discovered and retrieved it,' the Fairy King materialized suddenly, kneeling on one knee next to Lin Sheng, presenting a peculiar white-gold bone inscribed with ghastly faces or symbols. The bone, the size of a palm and arc-shaped, bore subtle fractures, signs of past damage. Lin Sheng took hold of it and closed his eyes, feeling its pulsation akin to that of a heartbeat. 'This is it.' He tightened his grip on the bone, casting a final glance at the centaurs fighting desperately below. The Mezhe Tribe, once an unrivaled force within this secret realm, faced a brutal suppression by the Evil Spirit Legion simply for refusing to hand over the artifact Lin Sheng desired. 'Bring them to submission and allegiance. Deal with any dissenters,' Lin Sheng commanded before turning away on his mount. The Fairy Empire's generals knelt, paying their respects as he departed. In a mere four days, Lin Sheng had flattened eleven distinct secret spaces. Ranging in size from as large as a province in Miga to as small as a city in Hengrui Kara, these spaces harbored numerous formidable beings. The most defiant among them was the centaur tribe that governed this secret realm of snowy plains. Having ruled this vast snowfield for far too long, they had forgotten how to treat those more powerful than themselves with due reverence. Thus, when Lin Sheng's envoy arrived, it sparked the beginning of conflict. After the envoy sent by Lin Sheng was mercilessly executed, under Lin Sheng's command, the Evil Spirit Legion amassed and stormed into this secret realm of the snowy plains. The once-proud Mezhe Tribe finally experienced the bitter taste of defeat. The cost was nearly their extinction. Two days later, the Mezhe Tribe's mightiest, the Centaurs' King Kuhl · Warspear, faced Lin Sheng seated upon his throne in the Evil Spirit Palace with a heart heavy with sorrow. With his tribe slaughtered, only a single bloodline remained. In such dire times, the king, previously devoted solely to his martial pursuits, was forced to assume the mantle of leadership. By swearing fealty to Lin Sheng, he sought clemency for his centaur kin. Like the Fairy King before him, he had to swallow his pride and join Lin Sheng's ranks to protect the final vestiges of his people's lineage, becoming another pawn in Lin Sheng's forces. From that moment on, Lin Sheng's command included the Fairy King, the Centaurs' King, and the Demon Hand Degaar—three grand legion commanders, each a symbol of their respective race's might. Both the Fairy King and the Centaurs' King had ascended to the formidable rank of Emissaries. ... While Lin Sheng marshaled his forces and scoured for pieces of the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel, in reality, Farudo, or rather Miyue, perpetrated an atrocity that sent shockwaves across the world. Having decimated a majority of the Emissaries, Miyue—or Farudo—pursued the united world fleet, personally unleashing a ghastly massacre. He didn't just kill. With the vast-reaching Incantation: Descent into Abyss, he froze eighteen military vessels, over thirty thousand souls, in the icy depths near Bisha Island. Trapped in bodies of ice, the soldiers' spirits could only sink to the ocean floor, their minds slowly succumbing to madness in the endless silence and desolation. Boom!!! Above the blue sea, a grey smoky figure materialized behind Farudo. The figure lifted its right arm, catching a massive, elongated missile from the heavens. The intercontinental missile, white and spewing intense orange flames, exerted an unfathomable force, attempting to break the grey figure's mighty grasp. Embedded at the missile's tip was a giant green diamond crystal, pulsing with copious evil energy, fueling the missile with terrifying kinetic energy. But it was futile. Farudo tightened his grip. Creak. The ten-meter-long intercontinental missile, reduced to mere scrap metal, was twisted and crumpled into a lump in his palm. Its internal liquids and powders leaked onto the sea, not a spark of explosion or combustion to be seen. It seemed as though an otherworldly force suppressed the missile's detonation. Chapter 458: Onward Bound 3 Cannon fire shattered the silence as a deluge of artillery rained down upon Farudo from afar. 'Incantation: Reflection,' Farudo intoned, his hand outstretched as a command. A gargantuan square grey barrier materialized before him, its surface etched with maggot-like patterns coalescing around a titanic lion's head. Each pattern was intricately connected to the lion's mane. Boom, boom, boom, boom!! At once, every shell imbued with evil spirit abilities collided with the barrier, halted momentarily, and then, as if repelled by an unseen force, recoiled back along their incoming trajectory. Explosions blossomed across the distant seascape, and amidst the chaos, the infuriated roars of evil energy wielders could be heard, commanding their forces to forsake their ships. Farudo beheld the direction of the assault. 'Redeon lies nearest. Hence, to Paradise Tower shall be my course,' he mused with a smile. A gentle tap upon the ocean's surface summoned a whirlpool of colossal breadth that spun voraciously. As the spray ascended, Farudo's form had vanished from view. ............. ............. Evil Spirit Palace. Click. With a delicate touch, Lin Sheng placed a white gold bone upon a black crystal pillar, and a wonder transpired—the bone autonomously reshaped, fusing seamlessly with the pillar. Concurrently, the pillar thinned and broadened, its edges sharpening into a blade. In less than a score of seconds, the erstwhile rough black crystal pillar had transfigured into a black greatsword over two meters in length with a broad blade. The hilt, wrought from the white gold bone, was dark and unrefined, making the weapon resemble a simple, yet imposing heavy cleaver. Lin Sheng grasped the hilt, lifting the blade with a reverent motion. Hum. The sword thrummed with intensity, emitting a harmonic vibration akin to that of a tuning fork. 'With the fusion of two fragments, is the true essence beginning to emerge?' Lin Sheng pondered in the somber confines of the palace, his hand caressing the weapon birthed from the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel fragments. He sensed that this was not the wheel's ultimate shape. 'Judging from the gaps in the aura's pulsations, at least two more fragments are required to complete the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel.' Lin Sheng held the greatsword aloft, cradling it with both hands. 'One more fragment, and it should awaken the dormant power within.' The Yin-Turned Evil Wheel, a sacred artifact of legend within the Evil Spirit Realm, was said to endow its possessor with dominion over the entire realm, ascending to unmatched overlordship. While Lin Sheng was skeptical of the lore that mere possession could ensure supremacy, he was deeply enticed by the wheel's purported ability to command a multitude of evil spirit special abilities. Seated, he ran his fingers along the greatsword, attuning himself to the concealed yet formidable energy that flowed within. 'Soon... very soon... the third fragment will reveal itself. The whereabouts of the third fragment within the secret realm world have already been ascertained. All that remains is to possess it.' Lin Sheng's visage was calm, yet within his heart, a tempest of anticipation brewed. Presently, the Centaurs' King and the Fairy King had ventured to the realm of the third fragment, to subdue this vast and most formidable space. Lin Sheng awaited the news of their victory in quiet repose. With two emissaries of their stature, the Fairy King and the Centaurs' King, addressing a secret realm world, there ought to be no cause for alarm. Yet before he could immerse himself in the study of the newly fused greatsword, an officer burst into the grand hall, leading an evil spirit soldier who had been cloven in twain. 'Your Excellency, a grave matter has arisen!' The officer's countenance was grave as he proffered a black scroll to Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng received the scroll, unfurling it with a swift motion, and it erupted into a constellation of green luminescence. 'The Fairy King's Shadow Imprint Technique?' He arched an eyebrow. Such long-distance shadow imprint scrolls were exceedingly rare, capable of recording extensive critical information in a passive manner. Ordinarily, they were only activated upon the holder sustaining grievous injuries, capturing the pivotal moments of the incident. Unsure of the exact circumstances, but cognizant that the activation of the shadow imprint scroll signified a formidable adversary's presence, Lin Sheng awaited the revelation with bated breath. The lights from the scroll coalesced to form a triangular screen that began to replay the events that had unfolded. In a grand hall adorned with white pillars, a Black Giant with golden bracers roared fiercely as he engaged in combat with the Fairy King. The Black Giant was clad in a black metal vest of superior defense, and every strike unleashed a concussive force that pocked the hall's floor. The Fairy King met the onslaught with equal ferocity but was gradually being overpowered as the battle raged on. Meanwhile, the Centaurs' King, brandishing a massive spear, was locked in combat with a merfolk titan. The Centaurs' King had assumed his berserker form, his stature enlarged to manifest his full martial might. Already twice the size of an average human, his enlarged form towered nearly five meters in height and three meters in breadth, resembling an immense monolith of flesh. But his adversary was no less formidable. The merfolk titan, nearly as tall, wielded a trident that conjured fierce gale tornadoes with each thrust. The grey tornadoes relentlessly battered the Centaurs' King, disrupting his offensive and defensive maneuvers and significantly curtailing his ability to deliver a decisive blow. 'While seeking to conquer the secret realm world as you decreed, the two legion commanders chanced upon this Giant's Hall. Within resided two Giant Kings, the paramount sovereigns of the entire secret realm,' the officer, a translucent evil spirit with a serpent's head, narrated, his deep voice infusing the palace with a chill. 'Giant Kings?' Lin Sheng contemplated as he stroked the greatsword's hilt. 'Indeed, as translated from the native Evil Spirit Tongue, the indigenous people do indeed refer to them as Twin Giants' Kings,' the serpent-headed evil spirit confirmed. 'So, that realm too falls under the Evil Spirit Realm? And the Twin Kings, they too are evil spirits?' Lin Sheng surmised. 'Precisely.' Lin Sheng lapsed into a moment of contemplation, then rose, greatsword in grasp. He traversed the expanse of the palace to the Portal District. The majority of the portals were now overseen by evil spirits loyal to Demon Hand Degaar. Only those leading to unconquered secret realms remained under the watch of sorcerers from the Fairy Empire. Hiss... As he stepped onto the grounds, a slender figure staggered from the portal at the farthest end. It was the Fairy King, her green armor in disrepair. She teetered upon exiting the portal, nearly succumbing to the ground, if not for the swift intervention of a spatial sorcerer. 'Your Majesty!' The sorcerers of the Fairy Empire converged with cries of alarm. The Fairy Empire, distinct from other evil spirit tribes, held a profound reverence and loyalty for their monarch, the Fairy King. Lin Sheng gestured, and a ray of pure holy power enveloped the Fairy King, commencing the swift mending of her wounds. It was then that he observed her right arm had been severed at the shoulder, leaving a stark, bleeding stump. 'Your Excellency... I have faltered in the task entrusted...' The Fairy King knelt on one knee, her countenance devoid of emotion. Lin Sheng regarded her, wordless. Her injuries spoke volumes of her commitment, leaving no room for censure. After a moment's hush, the red-haired visage of Tiangong Xia emerged from a neighboring portal. 'Accompany me,' Lin Sheng directed Tiangong Xia. 'As you command.' Together, they passed by the Fairy King and stepped into the portal. Close behind them trailed the Evil Spirit King's Guard, Demon Hand Degaar, and a cadre of high-ranking evil spirits. With the Evil Spirit King himself entering the fray, those guards who did not accompany would face an uncertain fate. Chapter 459: Pursuit 1 In the realm of the Giant Evil Spirits. Aaaaah!!! The Centaurs' King bellowed fiercely as his spear clashed against the weapon of the merfolk titan across from him. Behind the merfolk titan, an even larger Gale Tornado had formed, its gray whirlwind generating a formidable suction force, entangling the Centaurs' King with tendril-like streams from all directions. 'Blood Ignition God Spear!! Slay!' In the Centaurs' King's grasp, the spear transformed from pitch black to gleaming silver, its tip radiating a piercing white brilliance as he thrust forward. Boom!! This thrust was once again countered by the swift parry of the merfolk titan's trident. The spear's might and swiftness were heavily impeded by the tornado's drag, making each move increasingly sluggish. Several times the Centaurs' King attempted to break away, but he was held in check by the menacing stare of another black giant nearby, discouraging any retreat. That black giant was a foe he remembered battling the Fairy King; unexpectedly, it had now disengaged to face him here. Clearly, the Fairy King had either been defeated or had taken flight. 'Damn it all!! This accursed cyclopean woman!!' Enraged, he swung his mighty spear, its power stemming from his fury as the Centaurs' King—the more enraged he was, the more ferocious his strength and speed. Thus, his combat prowess was said to surpass all his predecessors. At this moment, rage burned within him like an inferno, nearly doubling his usual might. He dominated the merfolk titan with relentless strikes. But each time he prepared to unleash a devastating blow, he would be thwarted by the black giant's chilling gaze, preventing him from gathering his full strength. This harrowing standoff had persisted for several grueling minutes, and he could feel his wrath waning. While fury could significantly boost his power, it came at the cost of rapidly depleting his vitality and will—a proportional toll. 'No! I refuse to fall here! I must find an opening!' While suppressing his adversary with his war spear, the Centaurs' King covertly surveyed his surroundings, seeking any chance to escape. But the Evil Spirit Legion he had led here was nearly annihilated by the barbarians within the Giant King's Palace. These formidable barbarians, each donned in rough-hewn cloaks and armor, brandished either hammers or vast bone blades. With each swing of their weapon, they would roar mightily, unleashing a peculiar vibrational force akin to that of the black giant—a force that could internally fracture objects, striking terror. The Evil Spirits were undone by these vibrations, their core weaknesses exposed and exploited, leading to their downfall. 'If I remain, I will perish!' The Centaurs' King's mind raced with urgency. But any action he took was matched by the merfolk titan, who persistently engaged him. If he retreated, the titan advanced. If he advanced, the titan withdrew. It appeared the giants sought to exhaust him, aiming to capture him unscathed. 'Damned, damned, damned!!! Woe unto me!!!' The Centaurs' King's heart swelled with unbridled fury. But even as his anger surged, his body, having endured the battle's heat for so long, grew increasingly unable to sustain it. 'You wretches think to slay me? To kill the great Centaurs' King Kuhl · Warspear??!!' 'I shall teach you the price of toying with me!' With all his might, the Centaurs' King swung his war spear. A tempest followed its arc, severing the tornado's filaments of force. Stepping back, gasping for breath, his eyes ablaze with righteous fury, he prepared to invoke the final gambit of his Blood Ignition Secret Technique. It was a powerful combat secret that required the sacrifice of life's flame to unleash. In an instant, it could restore him to his peak condition, and with every attack and defense, a Blood-imbued Energy Shield would coalesce, shielding him from harm. But he was loath to use the secret unless it was his sole recourse. For each use demanded a third of his lifespan—not a fixed amount but a proportionate sacrifice. As he wavered, the merfolk titan, seizing a lapse in his focus, thrust his trident with lightning speed. Slash!! The Centaurs' King's chest was unexpectedly cleaved open by a grievous wound. He realized his foe was no mere challenger but a peer of equal might, requiring a hundred exchanges to discern the victor. 'Outsider, this is not your domain. Since you have come, rest here in peace, to become a trophy beneath my brother and me. This shall be your glorious repose,' the merfolk titan spoke, his voice laden with an antique cadence, as if he had not spoken for ages and was only now finding his voice again. The Centaurs' King inhaled deeply, his blood coursing rapidly to dispel the fatigue that plagued his form. Each swing of his war spear was a burden to his flesh, and recovery grew ever more elusive. 'No... how could I meet my end here!! How could it be!!??' With resolve, the Centaurs' King steeled himself to unleash the Blood Ignition Secret Technique in a final, frenzied bid. 'I will aid you!!' At that moment, the black giant, who had thus far only been an observer, joined the fray. His right fist swelled in the air, bringing a massive shockwave crashing towards the Centaurs' King. Whizz whizz whizz!! An array of Siege Crossbows, as thick as arms and wrapped in sinister halos, shot forth with uncanny precision, aimed at the Centaurs' King. His grand stature now served as a colossal target. Even if he wished to release the Blood Ignition Secret Technique, it was too late. The black giant, the merfolk titan, and the volley of Siege Crossbows all converged in that single moment. The Centaurs' King needed but an instant to adapt and unleash the secret. Yet now, that precious instant was denied. 'No!!' His eyes shot open in horror as he could but watch the black giant's massive fist descend from above. The merfolk titan, meanwhile, had fully engaged his war spear, leaving him no means to counter this strike. 'I will die....!' 'I... will die...!!' In that instant, time seemed to crawl. The bolts from the crossbows. The fist of the Black Giant King. The trident of the merfolk titan. And the ethereal rings of magic that emerged all around him—those were the Giant King's minions casting spells to ensnare him. Time itself appeared to halt. The Centaurs' King was immobilized, his body as frozen as his thoughts. Everything was as if an insect encased within amber. 'Is this my death?' He watched in terror, unwilling, enraged at the surreal tableau unfolding before him. Such a scene was beyond his life's experience, and he had been told that at the brink of death, one would witness unfathomable events. Perhaps this was such a moment. Yet, he found himself puzzled by the shock visible in the eyes of the black giant beyond himself. And the twisted, puzzled expression on the face of the merfolk titan. 'Great Frost Stream Extreme Sword,' 'Do you witness it? This is one of the sublime arcana of my swordcraft, the freezing sword intent that claims all in an instant.' 'Sword intent is the unspoken threat of the blade's edge, felt even before the sword is drawn. And my sword intent, by my very will, can force living beings into a state of frozen oblivion.' 'When life itself is convinced of its demise, it shall wither away.' Chapter 450: Pursuit 2 The Centaurs' King's pupils abruptly contracted as he followed the sound. There, standing serenely behind the Merfolk Titan and the Black Giant King, was a red-haired woman leaning casually against a palace column, her gaze quietly intense. Her hand appeared empty, yet it held the posture of grasping an unseen sword, emanating the threat of a hidden blade. 'To understand my intent is to be engulfed by fear and to shudder. That is the essence of Sword Intent.' The woman, known as Tiangong Xia, gracefully raised her hand, executing a gentle yet decisive slash downward. Instantly, a vivid crimson gash materialized on the right shoulder of the Black Giant King. Hiss!! Blood erupted, splattering upon the ground. 'It's not that time has ceased... it's us who have halted...' the Black Giant King collapsed to his knees, his face a mask of terror. 'Your inherent weakness is the cause,' Tiangong Xia stated plainly. Boom! The grand doors of the palace burst open. A towering figure clad in white heavy armor strode in, ignoring the Giant Kings and the Centaurs' King. He made his way to the highest seat, the Giant's Throne, and sat with imposing dignity. Despite his frame not matching the grandeur of the Giant's Throne, his presence exuded an undeniable sense of oppression and authority. 'I offer you but a single choice,' the figure on the throne proclaimed calmly. 'Submit, or perish.' 'This palace, perched atop the highest peak of the Evil Spirit Realm within the Sakureimon Mountain Range, amidst a world of ice and snow, is well-positioned. It shall be requisitioned for our use,' Tiangong Xia commented with a smile. 'What use are these failures? They are better off dead than alive without function,' she added dismissively. Upon her words, the Merfolk Titan and the Black Giant began furiously striving to shatter their ethereal bonds, trying to break free from the eerie stasis that had immobilized them. 'No... Impossible... Submit to you?! Such an insult! I am the Giant King, Bo Yinghan'er!!' The Black Giant King's muscles bulged with rage, black tendrils sprouting from his fist and forming a dark metallic armor around it. 'Aaaargh!!' He broke free from Tiangong Xia's Sword Intent and swung a ferocious punch at her. The giant fist halted abruptly just inches from Tiangong Xia's face, the force of its stoppage sending her hair streaming back, yet unable to advance any further. 'Admirably executed. You've shown you're not mere refuse,' Tiangong Xia said, her eyes reflecting respect. 'No ordinary combatant could escape my Sword Intent's confines. Your valor is acknowledged.' The Black Giant attempted a roar, but no sound came out; he was denied even the right to make noise. 'Do you feel it?' A sinister smile curled Tiangong Xia's lips. 'Welcome to my Sword Realm, the Silent Resonance.' With a delicate touch, her slender finger tapped the Black Giant's forehead. 'Your blood...' 'Is too loud.' Zzzt... As she pointed, the Black Giant's blood flow began to slow, finally coming to a complete standstill. Within seconds, his blood transitioned from a boiling fury to a chilling stasis. 'Do you know what remains forever silent?' Tiangong Xia's hand caressed the Black Giant's face gently. 'Only death is forever devoid of sound.' 'Enough, Tiangong Xia,' a detached male voice emerged from the throne. Tiangong Xia stepped back, her smile lingering as the oppressive aura receded. The stifled sounds of the environment gradually returned to life. The Black Giant collapsed, weakened. The brief moment of blood stasis had rendered him utterly powerless. The forced immobilization of his blood had caused untold damage throughout his body. Lin Sheng, seated upon the Giant's Throne, surveyed the scene below: two giants, petrified by Tiangong Xia's formidable presence, and an audience equally subdued by intimidation. Those who had braved the harsh external conditions to enter here were beings of substantial vitality and strength. This was why Lin Sheng had resolved to grant the Twin Giants a chance. More armies, more powerful beings, were needed to conquer the further reaches of the Evil Spirit Realm. 'Brother!' The Merfolk Titan, witnessing his brother's dire state, was consumed by a mix of anxiety and fury. His brother's escape from the Sword Intent's grasp did not suggest he could do the same. The Merfolk Titan struggled in vain, attempting to shatter the invisible bonds that held him. If the Black Giant's strength was on par with an Emissary at the pinnacle of power, the Merfolk Titan was merely equivalent to an average civilian Emissary. Civilian Emissaries, often self-taught, could not compare to academy-trained Emissaries in terms of force or natural force fields. Thus, the Merfolk Titan ranked at the bottom tier of Emissaries. Were it not for his brother's worth, Lin Sheng would not have considered recruiting such an underwhelming force. The Merfolk Titan's futile struggle and anguished howls lent the grand hall a sense of tragic bravery. 'Disperse them, Tiangong Xia,' Lin Sheng ordered, his voice devoid of warmth. In an instant, the oppressive force enveloping the giants lifted. They shuddered, then leaped up, charging towards the palace doors. The Black Giant, still mid-air, hurled a punch back at Lin Sheng. The power in his fist was immense, the air itself wailing in agony as his punch created a ripple of distortion, speeding towards Lin Sheng. To the untrained eye, this distortion might appear as a mere shock caused by the movement of the fist. However, it was the full-force eruption of the Black Giant's shock power. To underestimate this distortion as a mere aftershock would be fatal. Lin Sheng watched the incoming distortion of the Shockwave. He stilled Tiangong Xia, who was poised to intervene, and instead raised his left hand, positioning it squarely before himself. The palm stood firm against the Shockwave, resolutely meeting it head-on. Chapter 461: Pursuit 3 With a soft thud, the shockwave distortion, twisted and forcibly compressed, struggled to break free from Lin Sheng's grasp. Yet, astonishingly, his palm, less than one-tenth the size of the distortion, obstinately held it at bay in midair. Soon, the invisible shock distortion found nowhere to propagate and was utterly extinguished upon Lin Sheng's left palm. It was neutralized as effortlessly as the residual tremors of a genuine shockwave. The Black Giant, having witnessed this, felt a chill take root in his heart. Here stood yet another inscrutable, top-tier power. He questioned the very nature of his previous punch—had it truly been just an aftereffect? Without the significant depletion of shock energy within him as proof of his punch's impact, he might have begun to doubt the very essence of his existence. 'How... How is this possible!?' The Merfolk Giant also saw this scene, and similarly harbored doubts about whether his brother had forgotten to employ his magic. Amidst their hesitation, the Centaurs' King, Kuhl · Warspear, had already secured the grand hall's entrance, obstructing their escape. Within Tiangong Xia's Sword Realm, the only ones free to move, aside from the temple's own, were these two Giant Kings. The many sorcerer warriors under the other Giant Kings' command still stood immobilized like figures encased in amber. 'Back off!!' With a single thrust of his spear, Kuhl · Warspear blocked the twin monarchs. Moments ago, he felt like a defeated dog, but now, with his leader and Tiangong Xia present, the situation had undergone a tidal turn of events. From a position of weakness to one of dominance, he now barred the doorway, looming over the two disheveled Giant Kings. 'Feeling bold, weren't you? Just moments ago, you dared to threaten to kill me, hmm??' Kuhl · Warspear basked in the joy of reversal. It was in this moment that he truly relished the might of having strong allies. Particularly when allied with a dependable leader, the transformation from a defeated dog to a mighty warrior was intoxicating. Kuhl · Warspear delivered a mighty punch to the Black Giant King's cheek. With a thunderous boom, the Black Giant King was sent flying, tumbling backward and crashing down in the center of the hall, right before Lin Sheng. Observing the feeble attempt at resistance, Kuhl · Warspear felt an intoxicating rush surge from his tailbone to his head. He was ecstatic. 'This is truly exhilarating!!!' Kuhl · Warspear laughed heartily, his loyalty to the Holy Spirit King skyrocketing in that instant. While he reveled in triumph, the Twin Giants' Kings felt humiliation so profound they nearly spewed blood. The Centaurs' King, their recent underdog, now preened before them. The sight of his repugnant, triumphant visage fueled a fiery rage within them. Just looking at him sparked an urge to annihilate him, let alone face the dramatic reversal of their fates. 'Will you not yield? Is your spine made of steel, then?' Kuhl · Warspear jeered with a sinister chuckle. 'No matter, I, the mighty Kuhl, relish the challenge of breaking in those with unyielding spirits. Hehehe!' His menacing laughter echoed as he put away his war spear and eagerly approached the two Giant Kings. What in the world... What had the Centaurs' King learned under such leadership? Lin Sheng watched Tiangong Xia, speechless. In his absence, it was Tiangong Xia who had been orchestrating the grand scheme. The Centaurs' King respected only those stronger than himself and was most loyal to Tiangong Xia. Lin Sheng had previously instructed Tiangong Xia to impart practical knowledge to the legion commanders, to broaden their understanding. But now, witnessing the scene unfold, he questioned the efficacy of those lessons... Watching the two Giant Kings struggle on the ground, panicked and trying to evade the encroaching Kuhl · Warspear, Lin Sheng felt the urge to facepalm. What direction had this farce taken? He had come to recruit two Emissaries, not to witness a spectacle unfit for minors. 'Will you surrender or not!!?' Kuhl · Warspear's contemptuous laughter filled the grand hall. 'Just kill me! I'd rather die than submit to you!! ....... No!! Don't... I surrender! I surrender!!' The Black Giant King wailed in torment, clutching his brother and desperately retreating. If they did not yield now, they feared they would be stripped bare and humiliated by Kuhl · Warspear. With so many underlings and their own offspring as witnesses, to be paraded and humiliated would be an unfathomable dishonor – one that would mar their legacy for millennia, even in death. Crude as they were, Kuhl · Warspear's tactics proved effective. Observing the two Giant Kings seething with rage and yearning to end him with their glares, Lin Sheng contemplated whether to assign Kuhl · Warspear to a role more fitting of his talents, perhaps as a master of discipline. Discipline seemed to be his true calling, even more so than war. The two stalwart giants, to preserve their dignity, ultimately succumbed to Kuhl · Warspear's coercion and pledged allegiance to the Evil Spirit Legion, becoming two of its commanding generals. The might of the Evil Spirit King's forces swelled once more. Having conquered the Giant Kings, Lin Sheng finally located the third fragment within the Giant's Hall. In the grand treasury of the Giant Kings, the fragment lay quietly as a crystal orb, shrouded in shadow, undisturbed for millennia. Without Lin Sheng's intervention, the Giant Kings might never have realized the significance of the orb, for there were at least a hundred identical orbs in the treasury, indistinguishable in shape, pattern, and substance. Only with the first fragment Lin Sheng possessed could he detect the fluctuation of this fragment and discern the correct crystal orb. Upon entering the treasury, Lin Sheng swiftly selected an array of treasures. He did not isolate the crystal orb but concealed it among a multitude of other varied treasures to extract collectively. Gold, crystals, gems, silver, an assortment of rare treasures, and various strange supernatural artifacts. The Giant Kings' trove significantly enriched Lin Sheng's personal collection as both the Evil Spirit King and the Holy Spirit King. As he secured the third fragment in the Evil Spirit Realm, poised to fuse it and begin mastering the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel's power, a new chapter unfolded in reality. Farudo, the Netherworld Demonic Orator, an existence surpassing even that of an Emissary, finally stepped onto the lands of Redeon, owned by Paradise Tower. Simultaneously, across the globe, all those fated individuals bearing the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts heard the guidance of the Great Star Pond Grandmaster. Directed to converge in a modest town called Deschel within Redeon, they were summoned to unite the power of all sacred relics to challenge Farudo, the Netherworld Demonic Orator from the realm of darkness. ............... ............... Chapter 462: The Consolidation of Power 1 At the forsaken estate on the Western Wheel Border, within a wooden cabin, sunlight filtered through the thin black mist, casting an array of strangely contorted, ever-shifting lines upon the earth. The cabin’s wooden door groaned as it swung open. Adolf, haggard and bearded, emerged from the shelter. He gazed skyward, weariness etched in his face. “Has the encroachment from the Chen'ai Shijie become this severe?” He sighed. Despite the growing incursion of the Chen'ai Shijie and the Dark Tide, such phenomena had no effect on the holders of the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifact—Adolf included. Their powers were ample to fend off the surrounding dust and gloom. Realizing that the formidable enemies of the Chen'ai Shijie would inevitably seek him out for his Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifact, Adolf spent a long time in contemplation. Crafting a feeble lie, he decisively left his birthplace, Shumingdon—abandoning his venerable mentor Lin Sheng, and the temple’s kindred spirits and elders. Confronted with the enemy’s daunting might, Adolf recognized that he must tread his future path alone, sparing others from danger. Clutching a freshly received missive, the meticulous script detailed the vile deeds of Demonic Orator Farudo: the slaying of an Emissary, the freezing and sinking of legions into the abyss of the sea. “To muster the strength of all and invoke the paramount force, to reshape everything—what is the essence of the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifact?” Adolf pondered with a heavy heart, stowing the letter. Donning a wide-brimmed hat and lowering its edge, he strode forth with resolve. This endeavor, whether it led to triumph or demise, had to yield an outcome. Success would mean restoration; failure, at its worst, would mean his death, sparing his kin and comrades. This was the awakening of Adolf. ...... Lin Sheng had never envisioned reaching this crossroads. Sitting within the coarse stone chamber of the Evil Spirit Palace, he faced a cup of searing tea, its faint white steam spiraling upwards. The chamber was modest, no larger than a small basketball court, with circular portals on either end. Along the sides lay armor and weapons acquired from the treasury of the Twin Giants’ Kings, while overhead dangled a grand chandelier brimming with candles. A crimson carpet blanketed the floor, centered by a grand statue of Lin Sheng mounted on the Warhorse Bloodfiend. Lin Sheng’s fingers grazed the crystal orb. Its exterior was slick and chilled, while inside, a silver nebula appeared to slowly revolve, emitting light. The sphere, cloaked in silver-blue, rested on a base of an unidentified pale redwood, giving off a refreshing fragrance. “Evil Energy is nearing suppressive levels, progressing further is not going to be easy. My purpose was to leverage Evil Energy to boost Holy Power, to provoke its growth. Yet now, as an Emissary, Evil Energy scarcely benefits me,” Lin Sheng reflected on his diverse yet impure powers. “Evil Energy, Dragon Blood Special Ability, Holy Power, Soul Power... these are now hindering my advancement. To enhance the quality and density of my power, I must make a choice.” Lin Sheng knew his body was a colossal compression device: only pure, concentrated energy could be compressed faster to reach a higher tier. Since his Holy Power breakthrough into the Emissary tier, he sensed his strength and cultivation progression slowing. Advancement of Evil Energy beyond suppressive levels would require extended accumulation. Holy Power had just broken through and was yet to stabilize. As for the Dragon Blood Special Ability, its potency was set—contingent on chance and bloodline purity. His dragon blood lineage had reached a saturation point; further refinement would need an increase in bloodline purity. However, purity couldn't be casually enhanced—it, too, required compression and refinement. “There is no environment within to refine the clutter of powers. A choice must be made.” After savoring the tea’s delicate aroma, which lifted his spirits, Lin Sheng deliberated. “Firstly, Evil Energy can be discarded. I have no innate aptitude for it; learning was merely for the sake of cross-reference.” Evil Energy was the first to be dismissed. “Secondly, the Dragon Blood Special Ability depends on the bloodline. Initially, my aim was to increase physical fortitude to store more Holy Power. Now, as an Emissary, I can theoretically draw endlessly from the Sea Gate, converting the infinite Soul Power of the Soul Pole Sea into pristine Holy Power.” “This, too, can be temporarily set aside.” “Thirdly, Chaotic Soul Power... An unexpected gift from my connection with the Soul Pole Sea. Infinite, yet lacking systematization, it offers no clear advancement path or direction.” Lin Sheng paused momentarily. “I won’t abandon this yet; after all, Holy Power is fundamentally soul-based. I should prioritize the soul, continuously strengthening, enlarging, and purifying it.” The soul was the cornerstone. Upon this epiphany, Lin Sheng quickly clarified his focal point. “Soul Power is my foundation. With it, Holy Power and Evil Energy are merely derivatives.” He drained his cup and arose. Clutching the crystal orb, Lin Sheng made his way to the inner sanctum of the Evil Spirit Palace—constructed and perfected by the collective effort of all evil spirits and craftsmen from the Fairy Empire, under the command of Demon Hand Degaar and the Fairy King. Initially, the Demon Hand clan led the edifice's construction. Later, the Fairy Empire’s higher echelons, excluding the Fairy King, sought to ingratiate themselves with Lin Sheng, contributing to the palace’s ever-more lavish interior. Power’s allure lies in its ability to draw all else in its wake. “Seize power, and all else will follow,” Lin Sheng mused, approaching the plaque bearing 'Yin Yang Hall' before entering. Two mighty evil spirit generals guarded the sanctum—half men, half insectoids, their lower halves resembling massive centaur-like creatures, firmly planted on dozens of black legs. These formidable warriors, encased in glossy black shells, knelt on one knee, saluting Lin Sheng in silence. Ignoring them, Lin Sheng’s gaze was solely fixed on the peculiar giant blade planted in the sanctum’s center. The Yin-Turned Evil Wheel had undergone subtle, unseen transformations, shrinking significantly and becoming much slimmer. “Three fragments now... Let us see what changes the fusion of three fragments brings...” Lin Sheng reached out, his hand grasping the hilt of the giant blade, while his other hand gently pressed the crystal orb against it. A faint hiss... Something wondrous occurred. The orb, as if liquified, hung suspended, drawn to and merging with the blade’s surface. In mere moments, the orb completely vanished from Lin Sheng’s grasp. Chapter 463: Power Unleashed - Part 2 Lin Sheng, with a calm yet firm grip, held the gargantuan blade, swiftly reclaiming the sacred energy he had embedded within as a safeguard. To deter other beings from tampering with this treasure, he had previously infused the sword’s surface with a potent concentration of holy power, designed to cloak its essence and quell any emanations. This dense holy power also functioned as a protective ward for the artifact itself. Should any entity dare to draw near with the intent to claim the blade, Lin Sheng would be alerted at once and could pursue them, unless they had the means to dispel the thick shroud of holy power he had left as a sentinel. Nonetheless, if a challenger of such might were to arise, subtlety would be redundant; they would likely confront him openly and seize the blade by sheer force. As Lin Sheng dissolved the residual holy power, his contemplative gaze remained fixed upon the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel, now whole from the merging of its three fragments. Then, a sudden, crisp snap resonated. The massive blade he wielded split and descended, its form disintegrating upon the ground as if it were ice cream succumbing to the relentless assault of the sun's rays, the meltdown unnaturally expedited. Lin Sheng, ensnared in a trance, thought he discerned the distant hum of insects and the rustling whisper of raindrops upon leaves. These murmurs swiftly transitioned into the resounding cadence of waves crashing against the shore. It was as if ethereal voices were murmuring secrets beside him, as if a multitude of visions flickered in rapid succession before his eyes. A wealth of knowledge and information, as tangible as the black smoke that arose from the dark, viscous liquid at his feet, enveloped him, shrouding him in a cocoon woven from innumerable voices and data. Time, it seemed, decelerated in this moment. A deluge of insights regarding the Evil Spirits' special abilities surged into Lin Sheng's consciousness, a sensation decidedly extraordinary. This was not a mere inundation of his mind with vast knowledge; rather, it was the presentation of a complete evolutionary scenario—ambiguous yet coherent—that elucidated the true nature of Evil Spirit special abilities. "Yin-Turned..." A voice, faint and feminine, murmured in Lin Sheng's ear. "Yin-Turned..." "Yin-Turned..." The incantation persisted, hypnotic, coaxing forth from Lin Sheng's psyche an enveloping drowsiness. His eyelids grew heavy, and amidst the encompassing darkness, a vast grey wheel slowly emerged from the shadows. The colossal wheel, akin to an immeasurable cog, was marked by spaces for four inlays at its boundary. One by one, the destined inlays revealed themselves. A black crystal pillar. A white bone shard. A crystal orb. And one space remained conspicuously unfilled. Click-click... The wheel turned laboriously, emitting the strained clicks of mechanical distress due to the missing inlay, as though the entire structure could not operate seamlessly without it. Lin Sheng beheld the wheel, noting the delicate engravings of flora and fauna, rivers and mountains that graced its rim. Its surface was alive with characters that writhed and squirmed like a host of insects. This wheel was more accurately a circular artifact of divine enigma rather than a simple wheel. He parted his lips, intending to speak, but before clarity could return to him, the heart of the wheel suddenly yawned open, revealing a small aperture from which three streams of dark crimson blood silently poured forth. With the sound of rushing water, these sanguine streams swiftly approached, encircling Lin Sheng, then burrowing into his chest’s core. Three streams of blood, each etching a unique and delicate pattern upon Lin Sheng's chest. Together, they assembled into a vast and complex wheel. Lin Sheng's eyes snapped open, he shed his armor, and, tearing at his clothing, he gazed down at his chest. Indeed, three blood-red sigils had manifested. Combined, the sigils resembled an incomplete puzzle that, once fully pieced together, would form a red wheel across his chest. At its center lay an eye-like pattern, incessantly radiating a faint grey aura. Within the halo, myriad symbols and scripts seemed to flow endlessly. Lin Sheng's hands were now empty; the massive sword had vanished, as had the pool of black liquid that once lay at his feet. The entity known as the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel seemed to have fully assimilated into his being. He closed his eyes, contemplating the vast amount of information that had just flooded his mind. "So this is the so-called Yin-Turned Evil Wheel... Rather than a wheel, it is more aptly a Forbidden Scripture." Forged by eighty-eight formidable super Evil Spirits during the pinnacle of the Evil Spirit Realm, the artifact marked an era when Evil Spirits were bereft of innate special abilities. They were unique due to their extraordinary anatomical features, but not much else. However, once the super Evil Spirits had crafted this artifact, they used it to transcend their race, employing mysterious and arcane processes to transform themselves into a lineage naturally endowed with potent special abilities. This artifact was not merely a treasure; it was the distilled essence of an entire race striving to break free from their own limitations and elevate their bloodline. It was the magnum opus of the mightiest Evil Spirits, a testament to their quest to overcome the boundaries of their blood and race. Thus, to wield the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel is not merely to comprehend the release of all Evil Spirit special abilities, but to be endowed with the automatic guardianship of protective powers, bestowed by the eighty-eight super Evil Spirits. "Eighty-eight protective powers..." Lin Sheng's eyes widened with realization. He extended his hand, clenching it lightly. He could feel a wondrous force, akin to a protective field, surrounding his body. Within this field, dozens of distinct forces, each with its own unique aura and fluctuation, roamed freely. These forces lay dormant like serpents in shadow, poised to reveal their fangs only when necessity beckoned. "Eighty-eight protective powers, eighty-eight special abilities, can be categorized into four overarching classes," Lin Sheng mentally organized the flood of information. "First, the Self-Strengthening Wheel that amplifies one's very essence." "Second, the Foe's Doom-Weakening Wheel that erodes the fortunes of adversaries." "Third, the Free-Roaming Wheel that permits unfettered traverse." "Fourth..." Lin Sheng's brow furrowed with sudden intensity. "The fourth is yet incomplete... As surmised, only with the final fragment fully integrated can the ultimate power of the wheel be harnessed." "With the first three categories of protective powers in my possession, I wield over seventy such powers. Only a few remain elusive. These absent powers are likely the keystones among them." Lin Sheng's understanding crystallized. He glanced around, not yet venturing to test the might of these protective powers within the confines of the inner sanctum. Instead, with measured strides, he exited the Evil Spirit Palace amidst the bowing Evil Spirits and stepped into the Evil Spirit Teleportation Gate where he had previously acquired the black crystal pillar. Hiss... As Lin Sheng's senses realigned from the disorientation of teleportation, he was met with a surge of pale white flame. Before he could muster a defense, a natural grey luminescence rose from his being, staunchly repelling the inferno. Lin Sheng felt a warmth spreading across his chest and looked down at the torn collar. The red wheel pattern upon his chest now pulsed with greater clarity and a more vivid, blood-red sheen. Chapter 464: Power 3 "Is this the boon of the Wheel of Calamity?" Lin Sheng mused, striding forward through the sweltering inferno with equanimity. The terror-inducing conflagration, harboring the wrath of a five-winged entity, couldn't even graze his skin. Lin Sheng did not call upon any of his formidable powers—be it malevolent energy, holy power, or the dragon blood special ability—he remained unscathed. The newly bestowed power of protection autonomously shielded him from all harm. Within the column of thick, white flame, Lin Sheng gracefully descended from midair to the earth below. "A slight aberration in teleportation, and I was delivered directly into the maw of flames," he observed. After stepping out from the fiery column, he surveyed his surroundings, then with an effortless stomp, he leapt skyward, soaring away. Several thousand meters later, atop a gentle hill, Lin Sheng paused, casting a silent, strategic gaze upon the vast expanse. The plains, riddled with spouts of gray-white flame, bore the scars of a battlefield on the verge of death, clinging to life in a desperate struggle. "This area is fitting for a trial of the guardianship's might," Lin Sheng concluded. He extended a hand, pointing a finger at a distant, erupting column of fire, ready to wield the power of the Wheel of Calamity. Shh! An invisible wave of energy erupted from Lin Sheng's fingertip, hitting the target with unerring precision. The fire column turned translucent, its hue fading until it vanished entirely, as though it had been a mere illusion. Lin Sheng lowered his finger and waited in anticipation. Time passed, and the fire column did not re-emerge. "So, does the Wheel of Calamity's guardianship mean to obliterate an adversary's existence completely?" Lin Sheng pondered, his strategic intellect engaging with the implications. The sacred artifacts, wrought by the most exalted of evil spirits, encapsulated their philosophies on weakening foes. In the Evil Spirit Realm, the supreme spirits surmised that exterminating the enemy's very soul was the ultimate victory. "Could it be that the Wheel of Calamity, by amalgamating a multitude of supernatural abilities, manifests its paramount power in the total erasure of the adversary?" Lin Sheng surmised with clarity. "Now, onto the Self-Strengthening Wheel." He glanced at the Blood Wheel Pattern etched upon his chest and raised his hands, forming the Finger-Crossed Wheel Seal as his memory dictated. "Activate!" His eyes ignited with fervor, and a deluge of blood-red light burst from his chest, enveloping him in its luminous embrace. Shh!!! A colossal beam of blood-red light speared the heavens, stirring the clouds into a maelstrom. The once-gray clouds, now dyed crimson, rumbled with the sound of thunder. The blinding light on the ground transformed into an immense inferno. Within the blaze, a distinct silhouette unfurled its arms. "What form of augmentation is most potent for an evil spirit's self-empowerment?" "The answer is astonishingly... this..." Enveloped in the sanguine glow, Lin Sheng's visage and form were indistinct, his pale golden eyes alone swirling with vortexes of golden light. "This overwhelming might... It fills me with trepidation at what I've become..." "I dread that a mere lapse in my vigilance could unravel the fabric of everything." Lin Sheng's gaze shifted toward the distant horizon, lost in the seductive allure of this boundless and formidable state. With such might at his command, no one could resist his will. Not a single soul. Meanwhile, back in the real world at the Paradise Tower in Redeon, events unfolded differently. "Hahahaha!!" In the gray skies above, Farudo, enshrouded in a black robe with his white hair billowing wildly, erupted into maniacal laughter. He unleashed concentric ripples of gray shockwaves that spread outward, annihilating everything in their wake. Below, the evil energy wielders of the Paradise Tower, assembled as armies, launched relentless barrages of bombardment and firing. It was as if a thick quilt lay between them and Farudo, their efforts failing to even come close. Their artillery and sorceries, feeble as insects, repeatedly tried to breach the barrier of gray shockwaves. Each attempt proved futile, only collapsing back in failure. "Do you now grasp the depths of despair?" Farudo bellowed with laughter. "What a disappointment... The humans of a millennium past were not so insignificant. Heroes abounded, and the mighty stood like a legion. Even I, as a Netherworld Priest, tread with caution." "But now? Behold yourselves." A trace of boredom flickered in Farudo's profound gaze. "What a perplexing sentiment... I find myself yearning for you to be stronger, to provide me with amusement, yet I do not desire your strength to grow lest it tax my spirit. To deplete more of my essence." "Farudo, do you truly intend to eradicate my Paradise Tower entirely?" Among the ranks of formidable evil energy wielders on the ground, a venerable elder with white hair and beard, an eagle perched upon his shoulder, met the gaze of the Demonic Orator in the sky with a cold stare. "As the Demonic Orator, master of the cursed incantations of the Netherworld, you forsake your duties to the Netherworld Lord below, venturing to the surface—do you not fear that the Netherworld will succumb to unrest?" The elder spoke with a calm that belied his intimate knowledge of the Netherworld's inner workings. "Oh?" Farudo voiced his mild surprise. "There remain those above ground who recall the name Farudo, I see." He peered intently at the elder. This was the first instance since departing from Bisha Island that he had given such earnest consideration to a human. "A mere mortal, yet privy to the grand machinations within the Netherworld. It seems I must reassess my view of the Paradise Tower." A smirk danced upon his lips. "What does it matter if I lay this land to waste? We can seek refuge in the secret realms and, after decades, emerge to find a world reborn. But what of you? What price will you, Farudo, who deserted the Netherworld, pay to weather this storm upon your return?" The elder's visage was steely, suggesting that the potential extinction of humanity was but a trivial concern. "How merciless... Compared to the meager numbers the secret realms can shelter, the outer world is vast. And yet, you dare forsake it all with but a single word?" Farudo was taken aback by the elder's resolve. "Is this not the outcome Miyue desired? The fall of an old era, the dawn of a new one." The elder's voice carried a chill that matched the frost in his eyes. Around him, the evil energy wielders of the Paradise Tower, eyes aflame and faces reddened with rage, contemplated the dire future. Looking at Farudo, they were filled with the desire to charge forth and battle to the death. For most of them, their loved ones resided in reality; the secret realms could not house so many. Thus, the annihilation of reality meant the end of their lineages and the destruction of their families. Such a fate was unfathomable. "Is that so?" Farudo arched an eyebrow. "Then let's put this to the test and see how many of you are truly resolved to retreat into the secret realms..." His gaze, weighted with meaning, swept over the evil energy wielders behind the elder. "If words fail to persuade, then actions will suffice. If it is the obliteration of the Paradise Tower you seek, demonstrate the extent of your willingness to sacrifice!" The elder's eyes turned icy, and within his grasp materialized an ancient and frosted Ice Rod. "Form the array!" His voice thundered, his staff striking the ground. Instantly, a vast silver-white Magic Circle illuminated the plain, ensnaring Farudo in the sky above, strategically centered within its confines. Chapter 465: The Final Fragment 1 In the resonant harmony of harp strings, a minstrel arrayed in a lavish robe, their gender as indiscernible as the flutter of a butterfly, plucked the strings of a ballad steeped in the tradition of the Fairy Empire. The ambivalent tone of the singer, as enigmatic as their visage, coaxed nods of acclaim from the legion commanders in attendance. The ballad, a cultural relic of the ancient nobility of 妖精帝国, was imbued with poignant melodies and lyrics that were both ornate and steeped in philosophy. 'Yet, to be serenaded with accolades in my own presence, isn't it somewhat unseemly?' Lin Sheng mused atop the 邪灵王宝座, his gaze falling upon the Centaurs' King at his side and the Fairy King to his right. The Centaurs' King, seeming entranced by the melody, swayed in rapt delight. The Fairy King, her wine untouched, maintained her stoic composure, her single expansive eye rendering her emotions inscrutable. Demon Hand Degaar, occupying a lesser seat within this hall where might dictated rank, stirred restlessness among his brethren, for his power was admittedly wanting. The Twin Giants' Kings, recent converts to the cause, sat with wooden expressions at the table's edge, silently indulging in their feast. Thud, thud, thud... A procession of heavy footfalls heralded an arrival from beyond the hall. 'The 罪龙母 from the 龙墓 approaches!' The announcement from the Herald Officer preceded her entrance. 'The 罪龙母?' A ripple of surprise passed among the legion commanders. Though versed in the existence of the 龙墓 by Lin Sheng and Tiangong Xia, they had not been privy to its inner workings nor laid eyes upon its formidable denizens. The moment to encounter this enigmatic new ally had arrived. As the footsteps hastened, a figure in a dark gown, a bewitching golden-haired siren, entered the grand hall with a poised smile. Amid the tranquil music, she took her central place, bending her knee in a demure curtsy to Lin Sheng. 'Great 邪灵王, the 罪龙母, along with myriad dragon spirits from the 龙墓, has come to heed your command.' Her voice, laced with a whisper of hoarseness, was melodic and alluring, hinting at her past as a beauty of formidable allure. If not for the spectral pallor marking her as an undead spirit, the legion commanders, like the Centaurs' King and the Giant Kings, would undoubtedly be drawn to vie for her favor. 'I wish to claim her as my bride!' The Centaurs' King was visibly enchanted upon bearing witness to the 罪龙母. He swallowed hard, his blood surging with an intensity that filled his eyes with an indescribable longing. 'It is within the realm of possibility,' Lin Sheng offered with a light chuckle. 'Should you overlook the fact that the 罪龙母's true form is magnitudes larger than your own, she may very well delight in your pursuit. That is, assuming you manage to survive the wedding night without being crushed beneath her.' 'Uh... The Centaurs' King felt a chill as if drenched by a sudden downpour, the fervor in his eyes swiftly extinguishing. He touched his mane with a contemplative gesture. Known for his mastery over vital essence and might that surpassed even the standard 列等使, any who beheld his sudden fervor would surmise—it was a ruse, or he was genuinely compelled. Despite his impressive stature and innate prowess, the Centaurs' King was paradoxically the least likely to succumb to impulse. He promptly withdrew from the brink of bewitchment, regaining his composure. 'I shall abstain; such divine delights should be reserved for our sovereign alone.' 'To face the mighty, one must learn humility!' It was unconscionable for the 罪龙母 to be so crassly objectified. From her lower position, her eyes flared with ire as she summoned a sliver of 黑色力场, which she directed with deadly intent at the Centaurs' King. Pfft! The Centaurs' King, swift to react, obliterated the black sliver with a thunderous stomp. 'Insolence!! In the presence of our sovereign, you dare to incite violence within this hallowed hall!? Does the 龙墓 contemplate rebellion?!' he thundered, rising to his full height. The 罪龙母, briefly taken aback by the Centaurs' King's audacity, had not expected such a forthright and fierce warrior to adopt such sly tactics. His alacrity in casting aspersions was alarmingly apt. 'I merely reciprocated your disrespect towards one of greater might; when one is lesser, humility is the virtue to embrace!' The 罪龙母, a veteran in the games of countless years, countered swiftly. 'Were it not for our sovereign's presence, you'd have already met your end within the 龙墓, serving as nourishment for the dead!' Her tone was icy, resonating with the cold embrace of the grave. 'Very well, face me with merely a single hand,' the Centaurs' King taunted, undaunted. 'You invite your demise!!' The 罪龙母, incited to fury, stood on the verge of action. 'Enough!' Tiangong Xia, seated adjacent, interjected with a tone of irritation. 'The music has been silenced! Should you wish to duel, do so outside these sacred walls, and do not disrupt my enjoyment of the song!' Her command stilled the impending clash, and both the 罪龙母 and the Centaurs' King reluctantly curbed their aggression. Tiangong Xia’s authority was unquestioned; none present, save for the 邪灵王, could contend with her might. 'Resume your seat, 罪龙母.' Lin Sheng’s timely intervention smoothed the tensions. 'Musicians, you may withdraw.' He gestured to the fairy musicians by the stone columns, who instructed the minstrels to cease their performance and ushered them out promptly. Fairy attendants, their wings shimmering with a verdant glow, danced into the hall, arranging platters laden with fruits and libations before the commanders. The grand hall's stone portals swung closed, guided by the magic array. Lin Sheng surveyed the formidable assembly before him. To his left stood Tiangong Xia, the Fairy King, and the Giant Kings. To his right, the Centaurs' King, the 罪龙母, and Demon Hand Degaar. In the span of an instant, he had subjugated five 列等使 powers under his command. The might of the 邪灵宫 swelled at an unimaginable pace, burgeoning into a leviathan. Legion Commanders were akin to Emissaries; beneath them, the ranks of 邪灵元帅. This tier of power included numerous individuals from the 妖精帝国 and a contingent under the Centaurs' King. The spirits of the 龙墓, each wielding Emissary-level combat prowess, were not wholly swayed by Lin Sheng but remained loyal to the 罪龙母. 邪灵元帅, ranking below Emissaries and akin to the acme of Six-Winged beings, were plentiful. The third tier comprised 邪灵将军. This rank was legion, with the 邪灵洞窟 alone harboring hundreds, and Lin Sheng's experiments having yielded many a creature of this caliber. The 妖精帝国 and the Centaurs' King's legions each commanded hundreds. This rank was comparable to Tri-Wing Evil Energy Wielders. As for the rank-and-file evil spirits, they were innumerable. The 邪灵宫 now stood as a formidable adversary to the three great secret realms of reality, a trial of supremacy yet to be decided. But this was not the pinnacle of Lin Sheng's ambition. 'My gratitude for your punctual arrival is profound.' Lin Sheng spread his arms wide, his voice thunderous. 'This is the 邪灵宫—the paramount sanctuary of the 邪灵界. It is also the bedrock upon which I will, in due time, unite all evil spirits under my dominion.' His voice boomed, echoing within and beyond the grand hall like the peals of thunder. Every commander within could hear him clearly, and even the 邪灵将军 nearby caught each resonant word. 'I have summoned you all to bestow upon you a path to even greater power,' Lin Sheng declared with an air of portent. Chapter 466: The Final Fragment, Part 2 'A power of even greater supremacy?' Sin Dragon Mother's eyes flashed with a surge of vigilance. Throughout her extensive lifespan, she had never encountered a fool who freely offered power without a reason. Could the Evil Spirit King possibly be such a fool? Certainly not. Her peripheral vision briefly swept over Tiangong Xia, the red-haired lady across from her, whose face showed no emotion, save for an air of ennui and detachment. If Sin Dragon Mother felt wary, then the rest were even more perturbed. The Centaurs' King had no patience for these subtleties; having resolved to fully commit to Lin Sheng, he was ready to endorse any decision made by Lin Sheng! 'It seems our lord deems our strength insufficient! Ha ha ha ha! Everything is relative, of course. But since it's a boon from our lord, I, the old stallion, won't hesitate to be the first to accept!' His laughter boomed as he promptly pledged his loyalty. When the leader speaks, support is a must. A lack of support would be even more humiliating, wouldn't it? 'I anticipate it greatly,' the Fairy King responded softly. Her severed arm had been reattached and appeared to have fully healed. 'The lord's decision is our command,' Demon Hand Degaar offered flattery directly. The Giant Kings remained silent, their expressions stoic. Having recently suffered defeat and the plundering of their treasury, they were far from content. Lin Sheng was indifferent to their sentiments. 'In all honesty, I do indeed find your strength to be somewhat insufficient,' he stated calmly. 'The era is changing. Power must not remain stagnant.' He extended a hand, palm facing upward, and slowly released a sphere of pure, white Holy Power. With a faint hiss, the sphere emerged from his palm, hovering tranquilly a few centimeters above, gently oscillating. 'This force is termed Holy Power,' Lin Sheng explained. 'The essence of Holy Power surpasses that of Soul Power, and indeed, all powers you currently wield. Should you harbor doubts, you are welcome to test it for yourselves.' With a gentle pinch, the sphere fragmented, releasing several Holy Power Rays that landed with precision before the legion commanders. The rays transformed into smaller orbs of Holy Power, levitating before them. 'These spheres of Holy Power can be engaged and neutralized with your own forces to assess which is greater. If you decide to master this new power, seek me out later. I will bestow upon you the Seed of Origin.' Without waiting for questions from the commanders, he proceeded to the next item on the agenda. 'Let's set aside this matter for now; we have more pressing issues to address.' At his gesture, the Fairy King conjured a sphere of blue water that glided towards Lin Sheng. With his touch, the sphere dispersed, unfolding into a massive, transparent polyhedron, several meters in diameter, displayed before all. The polyhedron, crystal-like, began to reveal a clear image of the Black Desert within. The desert stretched to the horizon, endless dunes rolling beneath a blazing, mysterious purple sun, with Unicorn Camels trudging through the sands. This was a realm where even the air itself was scorched into a searing, distorted haze. 'This is the Evil Spirit Realm that you will conquer,' Lin Sheng introduced. 'The key to classifying such minor secret realm worlds as Evil Spirit Realms is the emergence of pure soul entities like evil spirits.' He pointed to the Unicorn Camel within the projection. 'Any world that naturally spawns soul entities will become one of the subordinate worlds under the dominion of my Evil Spirit Palace. As for the world you behold, it is larger than most. To ascertain whether it is an Evil Spirit Realm, you will have to inspect and verify it yourselves.' 'Within three days, I require a detailed assessment report on this secret realm world. I need to know the time required to fully subjugate this minor world.' 'We submit to your will,' the legion commanders responded in unison, bowing deeply. They did not grasp Lin Sheng's motives for conquering numerous minor Evil Spirit Realms, but as it was the master's command, they were compelled to execute it. Lin Sheng concealed his intention to locate the final fragment within this secret realm. The affairs of the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel were his to keep secret. Concealing one's strength guarantees enduring prosperity. Secrecy is the best defense against machinations. For if the full measure of one's power remains enigmatic, none would dare act recklessly for fear of unwittingly confronting your might and courting their own demise. After discussing the developments of the Evil Spirit Palace, which were managed by Demon Hand Degaar, Lin Sheng shifted his attention to the initial exploration of the new Black Desert Evil Spirit Cave. The commanders, having learned of tribes and cities within the desert that resembled humans, displayed notable interest. The assembly lasted over an hour before adjourning. The commanders returned to their domains to marshal their forces for the conquest of the Black Desert. Following his initial plan, Lin Sheng retired to the Yin Yang Hall to reorganize his current power structure. To achieve an optimal environment for power enhancement and self-purification, he required a perfect, contaminant-free enclosed space. Among the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel's Eighty-Eight Guardianships was a power that satisfied this need. Although typically categorized into four major outcomes, Lin Sheng could deploy any one of them individually. Even with a few crucial guardianships lacking, Lin Sheng still possessed access to several that would fulfill his purpose. After addressing the affairs of the Evil Spirit Realm, Lin Sheng returned to Hengrui Kara through the portal. It had been some time since his last visit, and he had nearly forgotten the influence of the different time flows. Sometimes he thought he had been absent for days and would hurriedly contact home upon his return, only to be reminded that he had called just the previous day. In reality, Hengrui Kara remained unchanged, operating steadily under the protection of the Sunset Tower, like a grand, intricate machine. Hengrui Kara had now developed its own distinct social system centered around the holy temples and practitioners. Holy practitioners were emerging as a new profession. They cultivated Holy Power and worked across various industries, using their extraordinary abilities to heal and assist others. Owing to the grandiose effects of Holy Light and its purifying force field that alleviated fatigue, the temples and holy practitioners had risen in societal standing. They had become emblems of mainstream positive forces, representing justice, dignity, and the benign power to heal both body and spirit. This was the public's perception of Holy Light. Chapter 467: The Final Fragment 3 Lin Sheng took a moment to calculate the time he had spent traversing the Evil Spirit Realm. To him, it felt like an extensive stay of over a month, yet in the external world, it barely accounted for a week. The discrepancy in time flow left him slightly disoriented about the actual dates. He walked the streets of Hengrui Kara, where the safe district's once desolate buildings now bustled with life, a result of the substantial influx of people. The streets, previously lined with gasoline vehicles, had been cleared in favor of cleaner electric cars. Due to the limited space in the safe district and the need to alleviate congested traffic, these electric vehicles had been modified. The workshops of Bain University had crafted these newly designed cars—now half the size of conventional ones and capable of short stints of low-altitude flight—significantly relieving the district's transport load. Lin Sheng observed cars gliding along the ground and weaving between buildings mid-air. This scene, belonging to a futuristic metropolis, unfolded clearly before him. "Hengrui Kara has come a long way. The enhancement of the Twilight Holy Temple slipped my mind amidst the Netherworld's interference. Now, it's time to take care of that," Lin Sheng contemplated as he made his way from the research center back to the temple's branch office. The accumulation of Holy Power in the Twilight Holy Temple had grown immense, having been in an overflow state for quite some time. The scattered Holy Power even caused the air around the temple to shimmer with specks of white fluorescence—these were Holy Crystals. They would spontaneously revert to pure Holy Power whenever the temple required their use. Without alerting anyone, Lin Sheng strode into the temple and headed directly to the Prayer Hall. The hall stood empty, its doors fastened shut—entry was barred outside of designated prayer times. Approaching the prayer platform, he closed his eyes. Hiss... Before him, in the void, a vast map of Hengrui Kara emerged. The map, like a sand table, was gently rotated clockwise by Lin Sheng's will. Click... From the map came a faint sound as the sand table terrain sunk and parted. From the chasm, a grey-black stone pillar ascended, bearing a distinct palm print. 'Please verify the palm print. To advance further, the palm print of the Twilight Holy Temple's bonded individual is required,' the soft feminine voice resonated once more. Lin Sheng moved forward, pressing his right hand gently onto the palm print on the stone pillar. 'Palm print confirmed. Welcome to the selection interface.' Instantly, a new tree diagram materialized before Lin Sheng. Branching upwards from the 'Twilight Holy Temple' label, lines formed six distinct pathways. 'Available divine arts for addition: 1—Temple of Wishes. (Capable of harnessing the power of beings' wishes to create Illusory Lamp Spirits.) (Illusory Lamp Spirit: An eighth-level energy being adept in long-range magical control attacks.) Holy Power required: Fifty thousand. Maximum upgrade level: Three. 2—Twilight Crimson Pool (Draws in the power of twilight to taint and transform a unique Holy Power pool. The pool's waters can potentially transform ordinary beings into special Holy Light creatures.) (Holy Light Creature: Harmonizes with Holy Power, possessing a strong constitution and a powerful regenerative capacity.) Holy Power required: Ten thousand. Maximum upgrade level: Three. 3—Protective Halo (Creates a special force field with condensed Holy Crystals to shield all beings within the temple from mental and spiritual attacks.) Holy Power required: One hundred thousand. Maximum upgrade level: Three. 4—Holy River Confluence (Transforms the land with liquefied Holy Power, so that beings born here naturally have a closer affinity to Holy Power and better aptitude for its practice.) Holy Power required: One million. Non-upgradable. 5—Judgment Light (Combines the might of twilight with the vast accumulation in the Holy Power pool. Using the Hymn of the Sacred as the activation key, it can instantly judge and attack any entity within the temple's domain. The power of Judgment Light is proportional to the Holy Power accumulated in the pool—the more there is, the more formidable it becomes.) (Please note, authorization to use Judgment Light is limited to three individuals. Once Judgment Light is discharged, all the accumulated Holy Power in the pool will be consumed. Use with caution.) Holy Power required: One million. Non-upgradable. 6—Holy Crystal Pool. (Capacity can be expanded to ten million. Periodically, the Holy Crystals will autonomously select individuals with sufficiently pure and strong souls, consuming Holy Crystals to transform them into Holy Spirits.) (Holy Spirit: A powerful lifeform with a soul merged with Holy Power, retaining all memories and personality from before death, indistinguishable from resurrection.) Holy Power required: One million. Non-upgradable.' At the bottom of the display, Lin Sheng noted smaller text. 'These six divine arts represent the final upgradeable versions. Upon completion of the divine arts upgrades, the Twilight Holy Temple's full construction will conclude. This guidance program will then self-destruct.' "So these are their ultimate forms?" Lin Sheng felt a faint disappointment. However, he reconsidered; the temple's construction ceremony and the ritual formation were merely products crafted by the masters of Black Feather City. Their level was not particularly high. That they had reached this stage was probably the limit of their capabilities. He eyed the capacity of the Great Holy Power Pool at the bottom—exactly one million Holy Power. Without a second thought, he selected the Holy Crystal Pool option. Buzz. Something vibrated in the darkness, then quickly subsided. The total Holy Power plummeted to zero, then rapidly rebounded to stabilize at around two hundred thousand. "Is this the amount converted from the condensed Holy Crystals?" Lin Sheng speculated. Two hundred thousand Holy Power was a substantial amount. He decided to allocate it all to the Protective Halo, enhancing it to level two. With his choices made, all upgrades would unfold over the following days. Lin Sheng exited the operational space. Once he confirmed there were no issues with the temple headquarters in Hengrui Kara and the Western Wheel, he casually returned to the research center. After instructing the young girl Peach on certain precautions, he passed through the Evil Spirit Gate and re-entered the Evil Spirit Palace. This was the critical juncture; the last fragment was nearly within reach. He had to remain alert, ready to personally intervene at a moment's notice. As soon as he stepped into the Evil Spirit Palace, the Evil Spirit guards promptly handed over military intelligence. The Demon Hand Degaar presented the urgent military report with haste. Standing before the Evil Spirit Gate, Lin Sheng quickly scanned the report. 'An apex fighter has emerged in the Black Desert; the vanguard army has been routed, and the Centaurs' King has been seriously injured.' "Hm? They've encountered a formidable adversary so soon?" Lin Sheng was surprised. The Centaurs' King's strength was considerable among his forces, superior to both the Demon Hand Degaar and the Fairy King. Yet he had been gravely injured right from the start? "What's the current situation? Get me a connection to the Centaurs' King," he ordered, casually handing the report back to the Demon Hand. "The Twin Giants' Kings and the Sin Dragon Mother have already provided support. They should be able to retreat shortly," the Demon Hand replied. "Have we gathered intelligence on the adversary?" Lin Sheng inquired further. "Some information has been obtained," the Demon Hand handed a second report to Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng read it over and a look of surprise crossed his features. "Intriguing. Quite intriguing!" A mischievous smile curled the corners of his lips. The Demon Hand quickly shared, "The one who defeated the Centaurs' King is a towering man with a transparent round gem set in his chest. He calls himself the Wishmoon Stone Envoy, foretold to come and eradicate foreign invaders. Once he confirmed the identities of the Centaurs' King and the Evil Spirit Legion, he launched his attack." "How did he defeat the Centaurs' King?" Lin Sheng asked, already having an inkling of the opponent's identity. "The man is exceptionally strong, and his martial skills are profoundly adept. Most crucially, his resistances are horrifyingly strong; neither soul attacks nor any other form of magical affronts affect him. Furthermore, even if beheaded or his heart is removed, it's to no avail—he will regenerate instantly. The Centaurs' King was caught off guard and suffered a severe blow from a sneak attack." Lin Sheng nodded. "Send the Fairy King, the Twin Giants' Kings, and the Sin Dragon Mother with their forces. I want that man taken alive." If his conjecture was correct, the last fragment had developed self-awareness and had thus empowered a formidable individual lying in wait. Because when Lin Sheng had sensed the fragment, it had, in turn, sensed this place and immediately retreated. He had originally thought it was merely an automatic response from the last fragment, not realizing it was a significant sign of its self-awareness. Chapter 468: Melee 1 Ancient hymns interlaced with mysterious melodies echoed across the sky at the entrance to Redeon's Paradise Tower. Vast three-dimensional arrays of white, red, and blue, continuously spun, churning massive runes and evil essence. Countless streams of power poured from the depths of Paradise Tower, guiding the energy particles of the surrounding heavens to converge here. Thousands of arrays merged to form one grand sealing array. Against adversaries like Farudo, sealing was the superior strategy. Lin Sheng, having once conceived such methods, was aware that the architects of Paradise Tower were similarly skilled, perhaps even surpassing his own designs. They had long ago gathered many Blood Descendants, carriers of the bloodline of sealing. Their abrupt deployment of such tactics against Farudo served as a profound surprise assault. Farudo floated mid-air, his expression composed as he looked down upon the kilometer-wide array that now completely encircled him. Around the array's perimeter, countless strands of energy akin to silk threads converged, binding him. Even fragile spider silk, when amassed in sufficient quantity, can surpass the tensile strength of steel cables. And these were not mere silk but strands of malevolent essence woven by the arrays. The incalculable evil essence strands, guided by Paradise Tower and directed by the few remaining Emissaries, began to reveal ethereal angels with wings unfurling from their backs. "Angels, hm? It has been eons since such a spectacle graced my eyes..." Farudo mused with a tinge of nostalgia. "To believe that angels could seal me? You may have underestimated my prowess. A millennium ago, I could devastate angels single-handedly, and that was before my ascent to this pinnacle of power!" Farudo glanced at the countless transparent threads wrapping around his feet, which continued to multiply and thicken. "Still, to trouble even my current form, you have indeed earned some measure of pride," he remarked as he lifted his right hand. "Incantation: Primal Stone Power." "Incantation: Divine Swiftness." "Incantation: Luminance of Dread." "Incantation: Psychic Assassination." "High-Order Enhancement: Ambrus Divine Emblem." "High-Order Enchantment: Netherlight." With a soft utterance, a multitude of demonic incantations activated, cloaking him in a cascade of energy that crackled like electricity. Simultaneously, four slender, sharp long spears manifested in the void around him. The transparent spears, adorned with ribbon-like runes at their tips, were poised for assault. In an instant, the spears disappeared from their original position, reappearing among the crowds that conducted the array on the ground below. Explosions of clear shockwaves erupted amidst the masses. "This assault, aimed at the spirit and soul, cannot be blocked or evaded. One can only endure it," Farudo's smile widened. As people below scattered, many were dazed by the psychic explosion, causing the operation of the array to momentarily falter. "I will intercept his attacks. The rest of you, continue!" commanded the elder of Paradise Tower, his voice carrying authority. He stepped forward, his upper garments ripping away to reveal the silver-white armor he wore underneath. "Ice Dragon Armor Technique!" His hands spread wide as a maelstrom of vile green light shimmered behind him and a vast grey-black vortex emerged above. The vortex churned out a torrent of pale green malevolence that, upon touching down, transformed into solid, icy white under a mysterious force, encasing the elder. Soon, his entire body was covered in fierce, rugged white ice spires. Together, these sharp, dense spires formed his impregnable defense: the Ice Dragon Armor Technique. "You seek to block me?" Farudo chuckled with a note of disdain. "Given that you know I am a Netherworld Demonic Orator, you should also be aware that direct combat is not my strongest suit..." He looked up as his white hair rapidly lengthened, thickened, and wove into the shape of a giant grey-black half-giant in the sky above. This grey-black giant, with a horn and muscles like twisted roots, seemed on the verge of sprouting delicate wings from its back, and held a large black pillar in its arms. "Netherworld Pillar Guardian. Go forth and destroy this place," Farudo ordered calmly. The grey-black giant behind him hummed in response. Its formidable frame, over five meters tall, surged forward, and with hair severing, it accelerated, plummeting towards the ground array like a meteor. Rapidly, one of the Emissaries below leaped into the sky, deflecting the Netherworld Pillar Guardian with a precise block from an ancient and ornate greatshield. Thwarted, Farudo appeared undaunted. The summoned creature was but a minor player he had whimsically called forth. Its purpose was merely to buy time for his subsequent maneuver. "Madolune, Deep River Snaggletooth, Chief of Ambush, Flowing Shadow Beast, my most loyal lieutenant. By my name, Farudo, I summon you to descend here!" He pronounced another powerful entity's full and true name. True names are sacred, not to be invoked lightly. These imprints etched into the soul are unique signatures across time and space. Invoking them requires envisioning the entity's complete form, along with their powers, deeds, history, and traits. Only with the entity's consent can they be truly summoned by their true name. And this was the rite Farudo was enacting. A ritual typically demanding extensive preparations and significant resource expenditure, he had distilled with his formidable curse-speaking ability into this effortlessly wielded incantation of summoning. As Farudo's summoning incantation unfurled, a peculiar male warrior appeared from the void behind him. Towering at two meters, with thirteen pairs of arms extending from his back, he wore battle-worn, rough leather armor, bearing scars of countless encounters, with his feet bare. Most striking were the twin light purple, slightly curved, slender blades he carried on his back. The summoned warrior, bereft of consciousness with blood-red eyes, bellowed upon his arrival. In a swift motion, he drew his blades and slashed downwards. A pair of intersecting X-shaped silver blade lights descended like shooting stars. The blade lights, initially simple, expanded with distance, replicating rapidly until they became hundreds of blade flashes. With each touch to the ground, the blade flashes transformed into corporeal silver metallic beasts. Sharp-headed and slender-bodied, these beasts moved with unmatched speed, striking like serpents everywhere within the array. "Attack!" The legion from Paradise Tower's evil energy wielders, recognizing the critical moment, advanced with unwavering determination. The sealing array had sustained, containing Farudo for this length of time, proof of its effectiveness. With one final, concerted effort, they might indeed relegate Farudo back to the abyss of the Netherworld. Chapter 469: Melee 2 In an open area near the battlefield, by a shallow depression, the air imperceptibly twisted. A diverse group of individuals, ranging from those in pajamas as if they had just stepped out of their homes, to others in racing suits with helmets on, suddenly appeared amidst the chaotic battlefield. One individual, bewildered and clutching a frying pan, was among them. "We have arrived..." a young man cloaked in a white cloak, his features noble, announced as he looked up at Farudo, suspended in the sky. "That was quick? We've moved from the frontier to the riverbanks just like that?" The person holding the frying pan was visibly astonished. "It's simply a fixed-point transport through the Teleportation Array," an elderly voice echoed in everyone's ears. "Now, with Farudo before us, holders of the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts, it's time for your decisions and actions to shape destiny. The choice is yours." "Such fine words. Yet you've brought us here by force; can we truly leave if we opt not to engage?" a woman in her nightwear retorted coldly. "Let's focus on the task at hand. Now that we are here, our purpose should be clear. Within the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts themselves reside the Heroic Spirits. Just approach Farudo, activate the power, and let the Heroic Spirits take over," a stout elder behind sunglasses solemnly declared. "Regardless, your presence signifies your readiness for the trials ahead." Adolf glanced at the speaker but kept to himself, his gaze lingering on Farudo in the sky. He longed for home—the temple elders, his praying comrades, and the Lord of Night who stubbornly clung to his bed... "Let us proceed. The Sacred Relics will guide us in summoning the Heroic Spirits within," the man in sunglasses spoke firmly, leading the way towards Farudo. The rest fell silent for a moment before quickly following suit. Adolf, however, was perplexed. These individuals claimed to possess Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts, and as a fellow bearer, he should sense a resonance with them. Yet from this group, he detected nothing but a faint trace of Heavenly Mandate Relics. Though unsure, he doubted they would jest with their lives and speculated on the existence of unknown methods to conceal such energies. ........................ Boom!! Above the Black Desert, thunder roared as if boulders were rolling across the firmament, pressing through the dense clouds. In the oppressive atmosphere of the Black Desert, the Evil Spirit Legion and the Fairy warriors surged towards the opposing desert army's ranks. The desert legion, clad in white, bore Special Protective Armor embedded with Supernatural Powers. The Evil Spirit Legion, a blend of black and crimson, combined pure soul entities with flesh-and-blood lifeforms to create a formidable, multidimensional assault strategy. From a distance, the Evil Spirits initiated their assault, while the Fairy warriors engaged in close combat. The desert soldiers, strong in body and spirit but ordinary beyond their armor, suffered devastating casualties against the layered assault, retreating in disarray. Lin Sheng, mounted on the Warhorse Bloodfiend, slowly advanced into the battle zone. No Evil Spirit or soldier dared approach within ten meters of him. Directly ahead, on a sand dune, the Twin Giants' Kings were embroiled in a fierce battle with a mysterious desert colossus. The struggle had been long. Now, with insight into their adversary's strengths, the Twin Giants' Kings fought with heightened caution. The man with the gemstone embedded in his chest, now flanked by several formidable warriors, exuded an aura of considerable strength. These warriors sported delicate green wings, resembling willow leaves, nearly invisible when still. Lin Sheng observed the battle quietly, with the Fairy King and the Sin Dragon Mother standing beside him, equally composed as they watched the Twin Giants' Kings. From the enemy lines, several potent souls swept their gaze across Lin Sheng's position, only to hastily retract, unwilling to delve deeper. "This is too slow." Lin Sheng turned to the Sin Dragon Mother, who immediately understood. As a member of the Destiny Necro Dragon Tribe skilled in enchantments and ritual arrays, the Sin Dragon Mother had attempted to cast a charm spell upon Lin Sheng at their first meeting, to no effect. The encounter, however, had left a profound impression on him. With a step, the Dragon Mother activated a violet Magic Circle underfoot, which instantly transported her to the center of the battlefield. Appearing behind the desert titan, she seized the moment of surprise, tapping the back of his head. A violet glow burst, transforming into complex Array Maps that imprinted upon the titan's nape. The man swayed, overtaken, his eyes rolling back as he collapsed. "Wasn't that quite simple?" she asked the Twin Giants' Kings with a smirk. Pfft! Without warning, an axe swung violently from behind her. The Sin Dragon Mother's slender waist was struck, sending her crashing into another sand dune. "Fool!" the Black Giant King scorned, his fists ready as he lunged towards the reawakening desert colossus. Their clashing Emissary Force Fields distorted the air, creating a maelstrom of sand. Ahhh!!! Thrown into disgrace, with her dress torn, the Sin Dragon Mother emerged from the dune in a fury. Her frame expanded massively, transforming into a behemoth dragon over ten meters long, its limbs planting firmly on the ground as it let out a ferocious roar. The dragon, its body akin to a massive lizard with wing-like spines on its back, bellowed, spewing a cloud of fine ashen mist that petrified the sand upon contact. Corpses touched by the mist likewise turned to stone sculptures. Two figures leaped forth from behind the desert colossus, their hands radiating a golden light to counter the petrifying breath. They joined the fray, stalling the Dragon Mother's onslaught. "There are so many formidable ones... They appear well-prepared," Lin Sheng mused behind his visor. "You too, go," he instructed Tiangong Xia, who had been following him. "I hope to swing my blade more today," Tiangong Xia replied, his lips curling into a smile as he stepped towards the battlefield. Lin Sheng, however, turned away from the confrontation, his gaze stretching toward the northwest. There, a power related to his own was stealthily observing the battle. "The final Fragment?" Lin Sheng's lips twisted into a smirk. "Launch the full assault, Fairy King." "The outcome remains undecided; a full attack now could lead to friendly fire," the Fairy King cautioned in a low voice. "Proceed as I've directed," Lin Sheng remained unyielding. Shriek! Suddenly, a sharp cry erupted from behind him. Lin Sheng felt a chill strike his back as the Assassin's blade pierced through the gaps in his Dawn Heavy Armor, finding its mark on his flesh. Chapter 470: Skirmish 3 Thunk. Following a sound reminiscent of chopping through wood, the assassin’s sharp blade aimed precisely at the center of Lin Sheng's back. But it couldn't pierce through. Time seemed to freeze. The blade was wedged tightly in the armor's gap, immobilized. Simultaneously, an immense, viscous natural force field supplanted the prior, eerily tranquil one. Lin Sheng, without a glance backward, thrust out a palm. His palm moved with incredible swiftness, the assassin's chest pierced in the mere moment he raised it. "This assassin’s strength is commendable." He tossed the body aside and a flicker of Pure Holy Power cleansed the blood and filth from his hands. Woooo~~~~! Amidst the prolonged horn sounds, all the troops of the Evil Spirit Palace surged forward. The reserve legions began their silent and swift advance. At a glance, the army seemed boundless, sweeping over the opposing desert legion like a sudden flood. Lin Sheng paid no heed to the outcome. Astride the Warhorse Bloodfiend, he proceeded toward the source of the aura fluctuations. Each step from the Warhorse Bloodfiend, though seemingly slow, was remarkably fast. This formidable Evil Spirit warrior, bearing Lin Sheng on its back, proceeded in that direction. Quickly, he crested dune after dune, leaving everyone far behind. The Warhorse Bloodfiend came to a halt at the edge of an inky green oasis, observing three figures standing at its periphery. They were three formidable desert warriors, each with a crimson gem embedded in their chests. The trio's gaze was heavy upon Lin Sheng. The enemy they had lain in wait for, donned in heavy armor and mounted upon a robust, armor-clad black steed, exuded an intimidating presence. Before even nearing, they felt an oppressive might descend, stifling their breaths. "Demon! It’s him!" the sole woman among them declared coldly. "The Wishmoon Stone has lured him to us! Kill!!" She unsheathed her curved blade with blue electricity crackling and leaping about her, the first to sprint towards Lin Sheng. At the same instant, the other two men, brandishing their swords, attacked from different angles. The trio coordinated seamlessly, as if they had battled together for many years. Three arcs of purple lightning unfurled from their swords, roaring into three thunder dragons that charged at Lin Sheng. From afar, in the oasis, several robed women swiftly emerged from the shrubbery. Uttering incantations, a mysterious power descended from above, abruptly suppressing much of the power from Lin Sheng’s Yin-Turned Evil Wheel Guardian’s Power. "Oh?" Lin Sheng’s brow quirked, "So, they dared to draw me out because they indeed had means to suppress the Guardian's Power on me." He remained seated on his mount, facing the barrage, and suddenly clenched his hand. Sshh!! Pure Holy Power condensed into a massive Holy Light Greatsword over three meters long within his grasp. Swoosh! He brought the Holy Light Greatsword down towards the three desert warriors hurtling his way. The blade hadn’t even made contact with the opponents’ swords when an invisible, terrifying force field crushed the thunder dragons they had unleashed. Puff puff puff!! The thunder dragons dissipated in the blink of an eye. With a terrifying might, the Holy Light Greatsword struck down before the front-running lady swordsman. Boom!!! A pitch-black fissure, over ten meters in length, suddenly appeared before Lin Sheng. He drew up the greatsword, looking down imperiously at the lady swordsman who had narrowly dodged. "What saved you from my strike just now?" "Answer me!" His eyes shot open, and he swung his sword through the air to his right. Bang!! An invisible disturbance was cleaved asunder on the spot. Several robed figures in the distance, who were in the midst of casting, spat blood and slumped to the ground, their faces a ghastly pallor. "Demon!! This is the birthplace of the Wishmoon Stone, the unblemished Origin Pool known as the Land of Flawlessness! Regret your audacity in coming here alone, for this day next year shall mark your death anniversary!!" From the depths of the oasis emerged another figure, a robust old man. Each of his hands gripped a massive warhammer. Each warhammer was nearly the size of a grown man. Just by their appearance, one could tell they were anything but ordinary. The old man's hair was fashioned into numerous small braids, his beard disheveled across his chest. He wore pitch-black, somewhat ancient armor, fiercely contrasting with Lin Sheng’s pristine white armor. "At such an advanced age, instead of enjoying tranquility at home, you seek death here." Lin Sheng's gaze flickered curiously as he assessed the elder. "I have just turned five hundred and four a few days ago. I had not imagined, nearing the end of my days, that the heavens would grant me a grand battle." The elder laughed boisterously. "If you wish to slay me, let's see if you possess the prowess!!" Behind him, a tiger's roar resounded, and a towering, majestic black tiger manifested. The tiger appeared to have been readied with armor and weaponry. The elder mounted it, slammed his warhammers together, and bellowed. "An old man's head is here, come and claim it!!" With a roar, the tiger leapt forward, bounding high and traversing over ten meters towards Lin Sheng in a single leap. Lin Sheng's eyes narrowed, keenly sensing an intense Fragment fluctuation emanating and rippling from the elder. "Have you staked all your treasures on this old man?" He scoffed, hoisting the sword for an upward strike! Swoosh!! Boom!!!!!! The blade released a swath of white light, clashing with the warhammer that descended from above. A wave of transparent ripples burst forth between the two, scattering in all directions. Wherever the ripples traversed, gravel flew and the oasis's shrubbery was sliced apart. It seemed as though an invisible blade had cut through everything in an instant. The elder's strength was astonishingly formidable. In a direct confrontation, he managed to contend with Lin Sheng without falling short. Lin Sheng was equally taken aback. In order to break his own limits, he had almost forsaken half of his human lineage in favor of Rock Dragon blood. With the blood of a Rock Dragon coursing through him, he wielded nearly the might of half of such a dragon. Yet, even so, this elder managed to stand his ground against him? His mind reeled, but his hands did not cease. The Holy Light Greatsword moved rhythmically, continuously clashing with the warhammers. From the moment they engaged, they recognized each other as formidable foes rarely encountered in their lifetime. The elder, an undefeated War God in the Evil Spirit Realm for centuries, had never been bested. In martial skills, physical prowess, and strength, he had reached the pinnacle attainable by humankind. Unexpectedly, the man before him could match him in a head-to-head struggle, even slightly overpowering him. Lin Sheng had assimilated the soul memories of innumerable fierce battles, his combat experience was exceedingly vast, and he was adept in a plethora of sword techniques and fatal skills, thanks to the soul fragments he had merged with. Previously, he had rarely the chance to employ his exaggerated martial capability, as he could easily resolve conflicts with other powers. But now, with his Guardian's Power suppressed, and unwilling to reveal his trump for the moment, wishing to first ascertain the full extent of his foe's capabilities. He simply employed his martial prowess. Who would have thought he'd be checked by this elder? The two, armed with heavy weaponry, traded blows like lightning. The greatsword and warhammers collided, parrying each other, creating a series of devastating shockwave ripples. Within several tens of meters around them, it had become a veritable zone of death. Chapter 471: Prelude to Conflict Adolf's gaze pierced the skies, fixating on Farudo, who remained trapped by the Spatial Foundation's influence. A heavy premonition of doom burgeoned within him, an unease too intricate to voice. Now bound by the grand cause of humanity, they had been coerced into this predicament, regardless of their wishes. The prospect of retreating based on a mere hunch could lead to dire, unknown consequences. Concealed by an ally whose Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifact rendered them invisible, the group stealthily crept closer to the sealed battleground. From a distance, the danger seemed benign. But as they drew near, the imminent threat of the battlefield was palpable. Chaotic currents of Evil Spirit Power, each laced with its caster's will, collided and compressed like an unruly undercurrent. The mere proximity to the battleground, still a hundred meters out, allowed them to feel the earth quake with each concussive blast. Battle cries and monstrous roars ebbed and flowed like the relentless tide. Adolf, standing on the fringes of war, felt a prickle of dread crawl across his scalp. It wasn't just him; even his stalwart companions had gone pale, their knees buckling under the weight of fear. Thrust from a peaceful existence into the maw of this supernatural slaughter, they were ill-prepared. The battlefield's edge was littered with severed limbs, spilt innards, and the grotesque carcasses of beasts, prompting the pajama-clad woman among them to succumb to retching. 'Enough delay. We simply need to activate the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts and converge their power, right?' the elder's voice cut through the tension. 'Correct. Afterward, the Heroic Soul will assume control over them,' the Grandmaster's voice resonated in their ears. 'Then let us commence,' the elder stated, turning to address the group. Heads nodded in understanding as the Grandmaster's guidance reached them all. In unison, they began to release their inner energies. For Adolf, as the power flowed from him, the foreboding in his heart only sharpened... 'To arms!' Amidst the Black Desert, two towering silhouettes met in a devastating clash resonant of ancient, titanic battles, their weapons colliding with ferocious might. With brute force, Lin Sheng pressed on relentlessly. Boom! Beneath the elder, the massive black tiger could no longer bear the weight, collapsing to its knees with a pitiful cry, sinking into the sandy abyss. The elder's face betrayed his concern. They had been locked in combat for over three hours. Yet his demonic adversary showed no signs of fatigue; rather, his strength seemed infinite, increasing as the battle raged on. Injuries healed within moments on his foe, and the white armor he donned proved nearly impregnable. Even for a War God such as himself, the elder had never encountered an opponent capable of sustaining such a punishing battle for so long. 'Were it not for the sudden loss of the Wishmoon Stone's power, I would wield strength far beyond this,' he muttered, leading the giant tiger in retreat. 'The Wishmoon Stone? You think its power has simply vanished? Were it not for its influence, my power would be unfathomable,' Lin Sheng countered with a scornful laugh. 'Now, surely you've gleaned the true purpose behind the Wishmoon Stone's summoning,' he intoned ominously. The elder hesitated, following Lin Sheng's gaze to the once-vibrant companions who now lay strewn across the battlefield, their bodies testament to the relentless onslaught. A sinister realization crept upon him. 'Or did you truly believe it summoned you to eliminate me? Or, to put it another way, did you actually think your numbers sufficient to slay me?' Lin Sheng's voice boomed across the desert. The elder's attention was drawn to a detail on the battlefield: several corpses, their chests devoid of the Wishmoon Stones they once bore, now vanished without trace. 'Could it be... !' The most horrifying possibility flashed through his mind. 'You're correct. It is reclaiming the powers it once granted. These powers should have already become one with you, and the only path to reclaim them... is through death,' Lin Sheng revealed, a trace of pity in his voice. The elder had entertained the notion but had refused to believe that the stone he had held for centuries might be so treacherous. 'Your might is admirable. Without the Wishmoon Stone, you stand exceptional. In my ranks, only Tiangong Xia can rival your prowess,' Lin Sheng conceded. 'So, what say you—join my legion? I shall bestow upon you an extended life. In return, you shall fight for me.' The elder's combat prowess was indeed formidable. Among Lin Sheng's ranks, only Tiangong Xia could be considered his equal. The elder's weapon harbored a vast force of Shock Energy, elevating the impact of every strike to its ultimate zenith. Coupled with an apparent mastery of an art that could resist various energies, the elder was, in truth, a berserker of immense strength and advanced magical resistance. In his presence, the Emissary's Force Field was as brittle as a bubble. 'Moreover... until now, I've merely toyed with you.' Lin Sheng discarded his now-cracked Holy Light Greatsword, reforming it anew. His body began to manifest a dense layer of dragon scales, and sharp spiral horns emerged from his head. His form swelled, growing to a stature half again as large as before. 'Now, embrace the thrill of combat!' With a roar that echoed with the might of dragons, Lin Sheng surged forward, his greatsword's white gleam striking the elder's shoulder with blinding speed. The elder, caught off-guard by the sudden revelation, was struck before he could mount a defense. His strength may have neared that of Tiangong Xia, but it was no match for Lin Sheng now. The power Lin Sheng had gained from the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel had surged beyond imagination. Although the Wishmoon Stone had suppressed many of the Eighty-Eight Guardianships, the intrinsic changes and enhancements to Lin Sheng's being persisted. The sword's speed and strength had reached the air's threshold of tolerance. Its motion was so rapid that it roared like thunder, flames and lightning trailing from the friction. It was only after the elder was struck did the sound of Lin Sheng's sword reach him. The elder and the giant tiger were driven into the sandy ground by the greatsword, immobilized. He spat a mouthful of blood, his will to fight already eroded by the Wishmoon Stone's treachery. Struck by Lin Sheng's sword, he was utterly overwhelmed. 'So, you're saying you're not a demon? The Wishmoon Stone is?' he asked, wiping the blood from his lips with a bitter smile. 'Indeed, I am the Holy Spirit King. My vast Holy Power originates from a force that heals and saves lives. How could I possibly be a demon?' Lin Sheng declared with conviction. Chapter 472: Conflict 2 "Holy Spirit King..." The elder, Ning Jia, harbored lingering doubts within. Yet, the insistent pull of the Wishmoon Stone crystal at his chest urged a pivotal choice. Was it to be a futile death in allegiance to the Wishmoon Stone, or a temporary suspension of skepticism to join the adversary? The answer was unequivocal. "Have you reached a decision?" Lin Sheng discerned Ning Jia's resolution in his eyes. "Could I request some time to deliberate?" Ning Jia implored with a wistful smile. "Of course. Those of distinction and talent are worthy of special consideration," Lin Sheng affirmed, his smile genuine. The need for combat dissolved between them, and Ning Jia's hostility waned. Treated by Lin Sheng with the potent Sacred Power, Ning Jia firsthand experienced its extraordinary healing prowess, solidifying his belief in Lin Sheng's claim to the Holy Spirit King title. Ning Jia, known as Ning Jia, conveyed to Lin Sheng the desert's history. Ages past, the celestial Wishmoon Stone descended, bestowing upon the populace the cultivation method of the Wishmoon Force. Lin Sheng delved into the nuances of the Wishmoon Force's cultivation. From Ning Jia, he obtained what was referred to as the Wishmoon Stone crystal—the very gem set into his chest. True to Lin Sheng's prediction, this crystal was indeed a fragment of the celestial Wishmoon Stone, an offspring purposed to assimilate the life forces cultivated by the practitioners. Clasping the crystal, Lin Sheng bade Ning Jia to guide him to the Wishmoon Stone's original touchdown. There, Ning Jia was met with a harrowing vista—numerous cultivators of the Wishmoon Force lay deceased, fallen without strife. The Wishmoon Stone had not only reaped their crystals but had also drained their life force entirely. The stark revelation of the Wishmoon Stone's true visage spurred Ning Jia. Revived by Lin Sheng's Sacred Power and resolute in his purpose, he resolved to rally the Evil Spirit Palace's legions against the Wishmoon Stone. Their campaign was swift. Ning Jia's defection, coupled with a steady emergence of bodies devoid of Wishmoon crystals, rapidly turned the desert secret realm into a vanguard for the Evil Spirit Palace. Stripped of his Wishmoon Stone crystal, Ning Jia was nonetheless graced with a seedling of Sacred Power by Lin Sheng. His soul's formidable resilience to the Wishmoon Stone's distant siphoning allowed his Sacred Power training to progress at an astonishing pace, and inversely, the Sacred Power rejuvenated his aging flesh. Although his years of cultivated power were forfeited, the intrinsic attributes of Sacred Power compensated him with a resurgence of vigour and might. Hence, his prowess scarcely faltered. He remained a dominant force, a match for any Emissary save for Tiangong Xia, and even outstripped the Sin Dragon Mother. Embracing Sacred Power, he emerged as yet another peerless warrior in Lin Sheng's retinue. The armies of the Evil Spirit Palace, devoid of cause for conflict, incrementally withdrew. Under the war-god Ning Jia's aegis, the Black Desert's might was fully marshaled. The dispossessed, ineligible to cultivate Wishmoon crystals, and those formidable beings akin to Ning Jia, immune to the Wishmoon Stone's absorption due to their immense strength, coalesced under a shared banner of dread and vengeance. They converged under Ning Jia's standard, reinforcing the Evil Spirit Palace's might. They shepherded Lin Sheng directly to the secret realm's core, the dwelling of the Wishmoon Stone—Blackgold City. Their intent to annihilate the Wishmoon Stone now surpassed even Lin Sheng's. Their very existence hinged upon it. In the temporal realm, the protracted battle for Redeon's sealing, after days of stalemate, had at last reached its conclusion. Redeon swore fealty to the Netherworld. The gates of Paradise Tower clamped shut, the plains beyond strewn with debris. No vestige of the vanquished nor the antecedent formations remained. The land was seemingly enshrouded by a thick mantle of red soil, expunging all traces beneath. Braving the monstrosities of the Dark Tide, evil energy wielders ventured towards Paradise Tower, met with an enigmatic sealed realm, impenetrable to any emanations. The once-dreaded demonic orator Farudo had vanished into the ether. Some postulated that the sealing had succeeded; others contended that Farudo had delved into the realm's secrets. Nonetheless, the world lapsed into a transitory calm. ... In the secret realm's heart, Paradise Tower, amid its lofty white spires, the Twilight Holy Temple stood supreme. Now transmuted into a nether prison shrouded in pallid mists and nefarious energies. Stone columns pierced the earth, shackled with dark crimson chains, binding the wailing naked thralls. These were the erstwhile bearers of dark forces from Paradise Tower. Unwilling to bend to Farudo's will, they were deemed too insignificant for his subjugation, unworthy of his time. Thus, he consigned them to nether energy pillars, amassing power to forge a portal to the Netherworld. The strife elucidated to Farudo the complexities of conquering a secret realm. Resolute, he endeavoured to inaugurate a portal forthwith, summoning a projection of his genuine self to descend, and thereby bolster his might anew. But prior to this, he had to address some unexpected captives seized during the conflict. Farudo traversed to the rear of the Twilight Holy Temple, to a small chamber, formerly a transient sanctuary for those awaiting audience, now transformed into an experimental proving ground. Six souls, ordinary humans endowed with unique powers, were his captives, seized at the battlefield's fringe. In the wake of the Paradise Tower forces' downfall, he chanced upon this cadre of surreptitious beings, radiating subtle malice toward him. To his age, they were indeed mere striplings, their collective lifespans but a mere fraction of his own. The peculiar powers they harboured piqued his curiosity. Having ascertained they posed no threat, he subdued them with ease, ushering them into Paradise Tower, and consigned them there. Farudo invoked the Eye of Oblivion, a hallmark ability of a Netherworld Demonic Orator, to scrutinize the essence and provenance of powers. The Eye of Oblivion perused each detainee. In short order, the extraordinary power within one provoked a momentary arrest in Farudo. "What is this? A radiance? A white force?" Farudo's Eye of Oblivion settled on Adolf, whose aura appeared luminous, strikingly brilliant against the chamber's gloom. He drew near the long-held bearer of the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifact. "Enlighten me, what is this force?" he demanded, seizing Adolf's jaw and infusing a pulse of nether energy to rouse him. Nether energy, the prerogative of the Netherworld's elite, possessed the capacity to ignite latent potential, granting an ephemeral resurgence. Chapter 473: Conflict 3 Adolf, already grievously wounded and starved for days without even a sip of water, was on the brink of exhaustion. He couldn't fathom why, with all abilities assembled, the prophesied Heroic Soul of Heavenly Mandate remained absent. Yet, this was the path he had chosen, and he held no regrets. "Heh..." A weak smile crept across his face, betraying no intent to converse. "Admirable," Farudo intoned with approval. "Alas, the staunchest often meet swift ends in the unforgiving reality." "Then do it... end me," Adolf said evenly. He had left everything behind solely to spare others. With the endgame playing out as he had foreseen, all else faded to insignificance. His death was imminent. And the karma that ensued would be his and his alone to bear, implicating no one else. "Pitiable," Farudo remarked, discerning Adolf's determination. He turned his gaze to the six captive bearers of the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Artifacts. "Netherworld Demonic Orator." He raised his right hand. "From order to the chaos at entropy's edge. Shadow of radiance, land of decline, by my name, Farudo, I summon thee." In his palm, a mass of abyssal hair emerged. Like tendrils of the darkest night, it wove across the floor, casting an umbral veil over the grand hall. "Netherworld Demonic Speaker, my voice heralds the abyss. With this sacrifice of flesh, I call forth my slumbering essence from within the divine column. Herein lies the pact." Farudo's hand dropped, and the ebon strands severed, scattering about, seeking refuge in the shadows. He approached the six. "Evil Soul Eye." His eyes shifted, revealing an arcane sight crafted to ensnare life's essence, doubling the potency of the sacrificed souls. Approaching the first, his gaze shimmered with triangular, pyramidal patterns of sable and violet, fixated on the captive's brow. Hiss... A spectral form, bubble-like and azure, seeped from the captive, stretching into a thread that shot into Farudo's right eye. "One soul claimed." He moved on to the second, and another ethereal figure followed the path of the first. Then onto the third. Xie Qiaoyue, slumped against Adolf, paralyzed by the sight of soul after soul being harvested, felt a dread that shook her very core. She had been summoned inexplicably, only to fall into captivity before achieving her goal. Weakened by deprivation, resistance was beyond her grasp. Farudo now stood before her, his soul-stealing gaze fixed on her. Suddenly, he paused, his attention captured by Adolf at her side. After a moment's hesitation, he opted to confront the enigmatic Adolf first, to avert any unforeseen perils. An ethereal force began its work, Farudo's pupils casting a sinister, otherworldly field, enveloping Adolf. The power began to corrode his being, intent on usurping his soul. At that instant. Flash!! A brilliant burst of sanctity flared from Adolf. The luminescence, sovereign and divine, severed the tether of soul extraction. Sensing the assault's might, the white light swathed Adolf protectively. "Hmm?!" Farudo's surprise was fleeting. Could any power defy his Evil Soul Eye? He intensified the gaze, staring down the anomaly that was Adolf. "Seize!!" The power surged, eliciting a reaction from the white light—a formidable, indistinct will awakening within its brilliance. "You, who bested my disciple, reveal yourself," the will resonated with a consciousness that vibrated through the hall. "Who dares?" Farudo's gaze narrowed. Only a select few could project their will through pure energy. The entity within the radiance was no ordinary adversary. "Me? Merely an unheralded warden," the voice within the light murmured. "But as I have stirred, my true form is alerted." "So, vanquish my disciple, but his death you shall not claim. In life, defeat is but a prelude. Where death is absent, I offer redemption anew." "Death denied?" A sneer curled Farudo's lips. "Heed this counsel," the voice in the light spoke calmly. "For most, life teems with second chances. But you, confronted with my presence, are afforded but a single query." "Your query is noted. And my response..." Farudo's finger darted forward. Pu. It met Adolf's brow with lethal precision. A surge of the Netherworld's shadow flooded his senses, ravaging his mind beyond repair. "You have your answer." He retracted his hand. "Harvest the soul!!" The invisible force of damnation swelled at his side. With ruthless vigour, it wrenched the pale, translucent soul from Adolf's form. As a Demonic Orator of the Netherworld, Farudo was unmoved by threats. The realm of man held no sway over him, let alone the whispers of an energy-entwined will. Amidst harrowing screams, Adolf's azure essence was caught in a ferocious tug-of-war. The divine light strained to restore the soul to its earthly vessel, while the Evil Soul Eye sought to claim it for the void. "Excellent! Most excellent!!" The will within the light jeered, its ire alight with laughter. "Our encounter is imminent." With a piercing gaze, the light's presence began to wane, the protective power ceding to Farudo's might. "My vigil awaits you." Farudo's lips curled into a smile. Clutching the soul of Adolf, his pupils alight with amethyst law patterns. .................... .................... Evil Spirit Palace. Lin Sheng sat enthroned, his hair draped low, a silent sentinel. Bang!!! A furious sweep cast the table before him asunder. The draconic force flung goblets and confections against the palace wall with abandon. The embossed dragon, shattered at the neck, plummeted to the ground, a cascade of rubble in its wake. "Netherworld's mouthpiece? Farudo??! Heh..." He rose, amidst the cowering fairy attendants, and strode toward the inner sanctum of the Yin Yang Hall. Ever since the Yin-Turned Evil Wheel came under his dominion, his path had been unmarred by adversity. Such a streak inflated his ego, perhaps too much. But now, Farudo's lone gesture evoked a bitterness long forgotten, a defeat both profound and personal. It had also cost him a disciple, one dear to his heart, forever. His misstep. Had he remained unseen, perhaps Adolf would not have fallen so easily... Fury blazed within him. Lin Sheng advanced into the Yin Yang Hall, where the machinations of the Fairy King lay in wait. A unique spellwork capable of connecting the Legion Commanders was at his disposal. He was poised to activate the arcane network, summoning the commanders to his side, ready to pierce the veil of reality. But then, a more audacious scheme took root in his mind. "Guardian of Transposition." A gesture to the earth below conjured a spiraling door of carmine. Without hesitation. Lin Sheng crossed the threshold, his form vanishing into the vortex's embrace. Chapter 475: Rescue (Part 1) Legends are birthed here. History is swallowed into oblivion. A colossal, grey-black vortex spins eternally in the sky. On the ground below, enormous pillars of twisted black smoke rise, with faces of souls in agony occasionally visible within. These are innumerable spirits captured from various worlds. Some were humans, others were not, but regardless of their origin, once their souls enter this place, they are destined to become mere sustenance. Gigantic columns of black smoke connect the earth to the heavens, like titanic pillars holding up the world, turning this entire realm into a cavernous expanse. Known as the Netherworld, or the Dust World, it exists on the flipside of reality, sustained for ages by absorbing the souls of the dead. Here, every soul, whether virtuous or vile, is considered a delectable nourishment. Across the land, dense smoke columns filled with dark fissures stand tall. Within the thickest of these columns: Whoosh! A massive, dark claw cautiously emerges. Three sharp, large talons lead the way, followed by a robust grey arm, a torso, and a colossal crocodile head. Stepping out from the smoke is a gargantuan crocodilian behemoth, towering a hundred meters tall. His green eyes gleam with feral brutality, drawn by a faint summons in his consciousness. With a swipe, he tears a dark fissure in space, stepping into it with deliberate steps. "So, Farudo hastens to call forth more of his essence? How ludicrous. I, Demon Blade Officer Silvis, answer your summons," a powerful, cryptic voice reverberates through the surroundings. As he prepares to seal the spatial rift, a pillar of pure white light descends from above, striking precisely next to the massive column of smoke, right at the edge of the tear. Compared to the column, the beam is slender and sharp, like a white lance driven into the earth. Though smaller, its power is no less potent. "Is this the Netherworld?" As Demon Blade Officer Silvis watches in bewilderment, a deep voice emanates from within the beam. Hiss!!! Instantaneously, the column of white light blooms like ink into water, swiftly spreading out an abundance of white glyphs. Amidst this radiant tapestry, a knight clad in heavy white armor floats silently, gently bobbing within the light. "This is the Grandmaster's Pillar, where the Netherworld's officials slumber. Who might you be?" the Demon Blade Officer, sensing the domineering nature of the pure light, queries first. "I am the Evil Spirit King!" The white knight's body abruptly expands, his form becoming immense as two sharp spiral horns sprout from his forehead. A maelstrom of terrifying holy light and chaotic soul power spreads in all directions. This divine light and chaotic soul force, upon entering the Netherworld, ravage like wolves among sheep, leaving no stronghold unchallenged, no resistance unbroken. Boom! The surge of holy power and chaotic soul force, exceeding the might of an Emissary, explodes, radiating across hundreds of meters and turning the area into a white-enshrouded landscape. This compels Demon Blade Officer Silvis, who had initially underestimated the figure's size, to reassess his stance. His instincts warn him that the nature of this intruder's power is antithetical to his own. In a confrontation, even with his greater might, the outcome may not be favorable. "The Evil Spirit King? I am Silvis, the Vanguard Demon Blade Officer of the Netherworld!" The crocodilian behemoth reemerges from the spatial fissure, resuming his stance, looking down imperiously upon Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng, in turn, raises his gaze to the towering behemoth. The discrepancy in their statures is pronounced, yet their auras seem evenly matched. "I've never heard of the title 'Evil Spirit King'; however, there is a space nearby inhabited by a race claiming the name 'Evil Spirits.'" Silvis, having lived through countless eras, is naturally acquainted with the lore of the Evil Spirits. "My power has not yet fully awakened, and yet you, Farudo the Netherworld Demonic Orator, dared to exploit my moment of vulnerability, slaying my disciple and seizing his soul!" Lin Sheng's voice is cold as the abyss, bypassing the other's speculation. "Netherworld Demonic Orator Farudo?" Demon Blade Officer Silvis bursts into laughter. "It seems you seek retribution against that miscreant as well. Farudo has no shortage of enemies within the Netherworld. What say you? Shall we join forces to bring about his end?" "An adversary?" Lin Sheng had braced for an immediate battle upon his arrival, yet now he encounters unexpected intelligence. Fortunately, as masters of soul power, they converse directly through this medium, avoiding the barriers of language that might otherwise rob him of crucial information. "Precisely," the Demon Blade Officer chuckles. "Why else would he be the only official to have cleverly slipped away? Within the Grandmaster's Pillar, he has antagonized many an official. It's merely that with numerous adversaries, his existence here has become precarious. Were those officials to learn of his surreptitious escape, they wouldn't let him escape easily." "I see," Lin Sheng muses inwardly. "So, you must know where to find Demonic Orator Farudo's true form, yes?" "I do not. If his true form were so easily discernible by other officials, Farudo wouldn't have survived unscathed for so long," Silvis responds with a sneer. "Your arrival's aura suggests you're not from the mortal realm; we must find another passage to the human world..." "I can forge a path to the human world," Lin Sheng states firmly. "However, if we both desire Farudo's death, what plan do you have in mind?" "A plan exists. Farudo has many enemies in the Netherworld, so he must take every opportunity to escape this realm. Having found his chance, we must strike decisively; we must obliterate his soul in one fell swoop. Therefore, the intricacies of the plan cannot be lightly disclosed to you," Silvis admits openly. "Understood," Lin Sheng nods. "Yet, if I assist in opening the gateway to the human world, that should suffice to prove that I am not one of Farudo's agents, correct?" "That would suffice," the Demon Blade Officer agrees readily. "Once you open the gateway and pinpoint Farudo's essence, I've enlisted another official; together, we will act." "It would be best to wait until Farudo has fully summoned his essence before we strike as one. I want his soul to be annihilated, leaving not even a trace behind," Lin Sheng declares with vehemence. "However, for this to happen, you must first guide us into the human world. If we arrive unprepared, our strength will be insufficient to vanquish Farudo. Even if we cannot overpower him, as a Netherworld Demonic Orator, his escape artistry is formidable. We cannot afford the slightest oversight," Silvis murmurs. "Agreed," Lin Sheng concedes, his exterior seething with fury, though inwardly, his heart remains undisturbed. The obtuse Demon Blade Officer desires to slay Farudo while using the pretext to revel in the human world. Little does he realize, the human world's vulnerability to the Netherworld's incursion is not the gravest threat. The true danger comes from the Dark Tide. The Dust World's Netherworld and the Dark Tide are threats of vastly different scales. At first glance, the Netherworld's necrotic energy and the Dark Tide's dark miasma might seem akin. Yet, they are distinct forces, each of a unique essence.
