Chapter 449: The Neighbor's Dog After inspecting the house and finding no issues, they were close to finalizing the purchase. Nanfeng would discuss the rest with the real estate agent and the former owner. Juanmao was overjoyed today, totally getting a kick out of its day out. Nanfeng chuckled, 'Juanmao, don't worry. Next time, you can move in and play all you like. You’ll get to swim in the sea and meet plenty of little fish and shrimp—how fun!' After a swim and being called to shore by Fang Zhao, Juanmao dug in the sand for a while. As they left, it gazed out the car window, clearly not ready to leave. Happy, Juanmao lay in the car, dreaming about its future happy life. Juanmao's impression of the ocean? An endless seafood buffet that doesn't cost a dime. Its cheer lasted until it got back to the Advanced Students' dorm. Once Nanfeng and the crew had left, Fang Zhao closed the door and called, 'Juanmao, come here.' Juanmao scampered over, tail wagging like crazy. 'Had fun today?' Fang Zhao asked. 'Woof!' 'Did you enjoy it there?' Fang Zhao probed again. Juanmao leapt up and barked again, tail going wild. 'Speak.' 'Fun!' Juanmao said. It was now switching languages with ease and sounded pretty slick. 'Alright,' Fang Zhao nodded and fired up the Study Machine. Juanmao: '...' Its ears twitched, and it reluctantly stepped back, trying to be sneaky. Ignoring its retreat, Fang Zhao turned on the Study Machine and showed it a new folder. Inside were e-books— Marine Environmental Protection Law Youth Environmental Protection Knowledge Series Marine Wildlife Conservation List Marine Environment Management One Hundred Marine Facts for the New Century The Sea, My Home ... Twenty marine-related books in total. There weren't just e-books, but also twenty sets of tests. Juanmao: '...' Its ears, once perked up, now drooped. 'You're a quick reader, even quicker now, right? Finish all twenty books here and ace all the tests, then you can hit the sea. We'll be moving in less than two weeks,' Fang Zhao said. With Juanmao's memory and smarts, acing these tests would be a breeze. Fang Zhao wasn't worried about Juanmao in the sea; he was more concerned about Juanmao eating endangered species into oblivion. How big was Juanmao's stomach, really? Fang Zhao still had no clue. During their stint on Bur Star, Juanmao had sneaked a few bites here and there, but it had been cautious because of Fang Zhao's warnings. Their time on Bur Star was short, and with Fang Zhao watching and others around, Juanmao couldn't go all out. But at their new home, Juanmao would have the sea at its doorstep every day. Without rules, it might as well be an invasive species, upsetting the marine balance. Fang Zhao needed to teach Juanmao a thing or two. The ocean life had bounced back, and it couldn't be wrecked by one dog. No perfect scores, no sea; stick with the Study Machine! That day, Nanfeng came by to chat about the new place's renovation with Fang Zhao. Walking into the dorm, he saw Juanmao in timeout, looking downhearted with tear stains under its eyes. Pausing, Nanfeng looked away and went to talk business with Fang Zhao. Juanmao's sulking? Standard stuff. Nanfeng was now unfazed by it. After talking shop, Nanfeng remembered the online buzz and mentioned it, 'Boss, did you catch the buzz about today's internet craze?' 'What's up?' Fang Zhao had been buried in his paper all day, with notifications set to silent, so he was out of the loop. 'Heard about Will's painting?' asked Nanfeng. 'Yeah, the one about his graduation piece?' Fang Zhao had seen Will's show and given it an A+. One of the pieces, titled 'The Neighbor's Dog,' featured Juanmao. With the show over two days ago and Fang Zhao occupied with writing since the morning, he was oblivious to the stir online. Nanfeng filled him in. After the show, the academy put Will's art on their website, which got everyone talking. Will had nailed his goal for the year—first to paint Fang Zhao, then his dog. The first goal was done and dusted a while back, and Will's 'My Neighbor' had already made waves online, with some joking that Will made Fang Zhao look alien. Now, 'The Neighbor's Dog,' following in 'My Neighbor's' footsteps, was trending again. 'The Neighbor's Dog' was Will's most time-consuming and painstaking work during his advanced studies, and his favorite to boot. The vibe of this painting was similar to 'My Neighbor,' but it was trickier to get. 'My Neighbor' at least looked human, but 'The Neighbor's Dog' didn't even resemble a dog, let alone a pet. Without the title, no one would guess it was a dog at all. With its lively colors and a mysterious, majestic air, it seemed otherworldly yet somehow fitting. The more you thought about it, the more you felt a shiver down your spine. 'Is Fang Zhao's dog that scary?' a Huangyi student wondered after seeing the painting, remembering the little curly-haired dog from campus and double-checking online. Those at Huangyi who had heard Fang Zhao's concert and analyzed Will's painting closely had their own thoughts. 'Putting it into words, this painting gives off the same vibes as Fang Zhao's 'Eta.' It's a bit beyond normal folks' grasp.' Even people who didn't get art, standing there looking at it for a sec, would feel something powerful, a chill running through them. The net was buzzing. 'Post-study, Will's let his imagination fly free, to places we can't follow.' 'What beef must he have to show Fang Zhao's dog like that?' 'If you missed Will's earlier work, check how he painted Fang Zhao in 'My Neighbor.'' 'What if Will's got some doggy trauma, to paint it so frighteningly? Turned a cutie into a creature!' 'That's art for you!' 'Artist's world—truly beyond us mere mortals.' 'No joke—I stared at that painting for a good five minutes, still couldn't figure it out, but felt it was something special, with a weird vibe that stuck around.' 'This deep kind of art needs a lot of looking into.' 'Wouldn't be easy to sell this painting, right?' 'Works as a charm to ward off evil at home, if nothing else.' 'It's a smart buy. Will's got potential, he's going places.' Once Will's art hit the school's website, folks were quick to offer to buy. In the end, a Muzhou collector shelled out far more than Huangyi's estimate to snag 'The Neighbor's Dog.' Some thought the Muzhou collector was too hot for Juanmao. Muzhounese seem to lose their cool over Juanmao. Others called it hype, either for Will the artist or for Fang Zhao's dog. Muzhounese's way with dogs? Kinda hard to get, like they'd lost their marbles. Reacting, Huangzhou TV's Art Channel snagged an interview with the big spender. During the chat, the Muzhou collector said, 'Lots buy Will's work thinking about the artist, not the art. I'm different; I see the art, and especially the dog in it. I've got this feeling, this piece is gonna be worth a fortune someday.' Xiong, tuning into the live interview, mused, 'Muzhounese got some wild dog sense. Humans, you're something else.' Thanks to Will's 'The Neighbor's Dog,' Juanmao was now a hot topic and even made the news in Huangzhou. After Nanfeng left, Fang Zhao skimmed the news and told Juanmao, 'Better stay inside for a bit. Stand for five more minutes, then back to the books. You only scored 62 this morning. Go over the animal protection stuff again! Whales aren't for snacking! And corals are a no-go!' Chapter 450: Moving Day Juanmao dedicated an additional two days to memorizing the Marine Environmental Protection Law and the Marine Wildlife Conservation List, reinforcing his knowledge with videos and images to deepen his understanding. He delved into materials from both the old and new centuries, ensuring the appearances and behaviors of these species were etched in his memory. Driven by the desire to freely swim in the ocean, Juanmao pushed himself to the limit. The last time he had exerted such effort was to acquire his own Study Machine. His test scores gradually improved from barely passing to the seventies and eighties, and finally to the nineties. With one final effort to solidify his recollection, he was poised for success. Nanfeng had suspected that being confined due to incidents on the net and the inability to stroll would affect Juanmao's mood. Contrary to expectations, the dog's zest only intensified by the day, impervious to the constraints. Fang Zhao concluded his supplementary tasks at Huangzhou Art Academy, and after the remaining advanced students completed their evaluations, the academy organized a graduation ceremony for those who successfully finished the Huangyi Twelve Rhythms Advanced Course, awarding certificates. The ceremony was straightforward—those who conquered the Twelve Rhythms were hardly average students and inclined towards academia, making elaborate ceremonies unnecessary. Held in Huangyi's top academic auditorium, Elder Master Fang, present among the audience, beamed with pride as he captured Fang Zhao's momentous occasion on stage with numerous photos and videos, later shared with peers and in retirement group chats. Post-ceremony, Elder Master Fang eagerly approached Fang Zhao. 'Let me have a look,' he said, examining the certificate radiating with an auric sheen, grinning so broadly his teeth seemed in danger of falling out. After snapping several high-resolution photos from different angles, Elder Master Fang returned the certificate to Fang Zhao. 'Take care to keep this safe; ensure it doesn't end up as a dog's chew toy. One of our retiree's great-grandchildren had his new diploma torn apart by a dog. It was beyond repair,' Elder Master Fang remarked, casting a glance at Juanmao. Juanmao returned a gaze filled with wide-eyed innocence, as though he had been wrongfully accused. Elder Master Fang then turned back to Fang Zhao, advising, 'In any case, make sure it's well-protected.' How many could claim possession of a Twelve Rhythms Advanced Course certificate annually? It was an esteemed accolade, typically a precursor to mastery. Within the retiree association of Yanbei City, no other family had this honor. Content with the graduation photos, Elder Master Fang was ready to depart. Their stay in Huangzhou had been lengthy, and it was time to return home. Before departing, Elder Master Fang gazed at his courteous and gentle great-grandson, then admonished Yan Biao and Zuo Yu with a note of worry. 'You absolutely must ensure Fang Zhao's safety! Nowadays, there's an abundance of crazed fans, and rivals resort to underhanded tricks. Fang Zhao is simply too kind-hearted, too trusting, oblivious to the maliciousness of others.' Yan Biao and Zuo Yu: '......' Do they recall the events of Fang Zhao's year of service? Do they know the origins of his Reserve Officer title? Are they aware of how he dominates in gaming?! What thickness of rose-colored glasses must one wear to utter such statements, or has age led to selective amnesia, erasing certain pivotal events? Yet, perhaps Fang Zhao does appear much gentler now? Could this be the refinement imparted by art? Regardless of their internal musings, Yan Biao and Zuo Yu could only firmly assure Elder Master Fang, 'Yes, we'll ensure his safety!' After one final photograph with Fang Zhao, Elder Master Fang departed, content. Once Fang Zhao settled into his new abode and found leisure, Elder Master Fang intended to visit. With academic endeavors momentarily paused and the advanced students preparing to depart, they were slated to present at an Academic Conference Report at Huangyi, catering primarily to students. This event was less formal and severe than typical Academic Conference Reports. The Student Union even opened a live stream, allowing those unable to attend in person to watch online. Fang Zhao generously shared his expertise; he disclosed every insight and technique amassed during his year of in-depth studies. The Academic Conference Report spanned two hours, but the ensuing Q&A and autograph session went on for four. Some suggested that Fang Zhao should remain at the academy. Given his current prowess and accolades, he was more than equipped to serve as a lecturer at Huangyi. 'How wonderful it would be if Fang Zhao could stay at Huangyi,' a student lamented. But soon, they realized that while Fang Zhao the individual had moved on, his teachings persisted in their exam questions... Following a year of advanced studies and his departure from Huangyi, Fang Zhao organized his affairs in Yanzhou before relocating. The weather was idyllic for the move from the center of Qi'an City in Yanzhou to the seaside. Perhaps detecting the proximity of the sea, 'Bunny'—referred to as 'Curly' in the original translation but corrected to match the glossary—exhibited exceptional vigor today, actively engaging with the aquarium, its 'ears' keen to probe beyond. Fang Zhao had ordered a more expansive aquarium, transferring 'Bunny' from the compact travel tank to the generous new environment. Acclimating to its new residence, 'Bunny' navigated the tank, mimicking a buoyant, animated marshmallow puff. This seemingly adorable marshmallow puff nearly brought about calamity for two would-be burglars. A faultless disguise. The truly dangerous ones are not just those decked in vivid hues but also those with a deceptive allure. The most elated about the move was undoubtedly Juanmao. He had achieved his test objectives the day prior to the move, and since dawn, he had been bustling with activity, urging Fang Zhao to proceed with the relocation. As the collection shelf was stocked, ensuring no gaming helmet was missed, Juanmao desired to secure his Study Machine alongside them, but Fang Zhao intervened. 'We'll still be utilizing the Study Machine,' Fang Zhao stated. Juanmao emitted two mournful barks, his tail drooping as he retreated. Yet, his spirits swiftly rebounded, and he eagerly anticipated inspecting his new dominion. Zuo Yu maintained a grip on the leash. Dogs possess a robust territorial instinct, and staking claim to space is inherent in their nature. The new domicile provided a larger territory, and Juanmao surveyed it with sheer joy, periodically howling to signal his presence to the other neighborhood dogs. From this day forward, this was his home! As Fang Zhao concluded organizing his possessions, evening had descended. He dispatched Yan Biao and the others home, granting them a couple of days off. After their departure, Juanmao, who had been reclining by the door, trotted over. 'I wish to swim in the ocean,' Juanmao spoke. 'Is it solely for swimming?' Fang Zhao inquired. '...perhaps a little foraging as well,' Juanmao cautiously confessed, gauging Fang Zhao's reaction. 'I'm famished.' Throughout his tenure at Huangyi, Juanmao's diet was stringently regulated—he often felt famished, only managing to covertly find extra sustenance when accompanied by Fang Zhao. This year had indeed been one of scarcity for him. Fang Zhao had taken note of Juanmao's increasing hunger. His dietary preferences were broadening. Foods previously ignored now piqued his interest, as though he was evaluating their edibility. On one occasion in the vehicle, his intense sniffing led Nanfeng to suspect tampering, promptly sending the car for inspection. Ultimately, other than some inexplicable scratches, the car was unscathed. When Fang Zhao later inquired, Juanmao revealed he had been ravenous at the time and had detected the scent of food. Juanmao was aware of what was consumable and what was not; even with novel items, he could ascertain their edibility. Previously, the opportunity to eat at will was non-existent; now, with a new home and an exceptional chance to indulge, Juanmao had no intention of missing out, unwilling to wait any longer. He had been patient all day, waiting for Nanfeng and the rest to depart before proposing a foraging excursion. Fang Zhao reviewed the weather forecast—clear skies were predicted in the coming days. Since Juanmao had satisfied the testing criteria and responded to several supplementary questions with precision and speed, Fang Zhao felt it was permissible to grant him a bit of freedom. Daytime outings risked attracting attention; the coastal area was frequented by residents, and Fang Zhao had observed a group setting out on a yacht for a fishing expedition earlier in the day. Juanmao's nighttime foray was perfect. 'You may proceed,' Fang Zhao consented. 'I intend to venture further out to seek sustenance, awoo,' Juanmao added. 'I shall return before eight in the morning.' He yearned to savor a little more time. After brief contemplation, Fang Zhao acquiesced. 'Heed any meteorological shifts, circumvent vessels, and promptly retreat if anomalies arise.' 'Affirmative!' 'Recollect, protected species are forbidden!' 'I shan't engage with them! Absolutely not!' 'And refrain from indiscriminate consumption!' 'I shall not partake haphazardly!' Juanmao pledged. 'Embark then.' Endowed with Fang Zhao's endorsement, Juanmao dashed forth and, shielded by the veil of night, delved into the embracing sea. Chapter 451: Gone Without a Trace! Fang Zhao gazed out at the sea's horizon, setting the dog leash atop the cabinet near the doorway. This marked the first instance of Juanmao reveling in unbridled freedom, and Fang Zhao harbored a tinge of unease. He could not perpetually surveil Juanmao. Following an extensive regimen of training, he was poised to gauge Juanmao's self-sufficiency. The outcome of this solo excursion would shape Fang Zhao's future decisions. Juanmao was no ordinary pet concern. Fang Zhao had unwaveringly maintained stringent oversight; devoid of direction, Juanmao had the potential to transform into a lethal instrument wielded by those with malicious intent. The morality of a weapon is dictated not by its existence but by its wielder. Fortuitously, Juanmao possessed an autonomous consciousness, a personal set of convictions and principles—a sentient life form in its own right. Moreover, Fang Zhao had persistently felt a connection to his own enigmatic rebirth was intertwined with Juanmao, though the specifics of that bond remained elusive. The rigorous management of Juanmao served dual purposes: to guide and to safeguard. "Just don't stray," he quietly implored. As night descended, the wind intensified, and the waves battered the shore with vigor before receding into oblivion. All was shrouded in mystery. Simultaneously, Juanmao, blissfully oblivious to Fang Zhao's trepidations, embodied the essence of a wild dog unleashed, cavorting through the sea with gleeful abandon. The necessity for oxygen or respiration was rendered moot the moment it submerged, such rudiments of survival cast aside. Disregarding the need to breathe, the pressure of the depths, and the absence of light, Juanmao pursued the schools of fish with zest. It sampled the stones adjacent to the unpalatable corals, finding them lacking in flavor. Upon encountering a sea turtle, Juanmao indulged in playful mischief. It even burst into song. "La la la la, behold the turtle gliding in the water—" As an artist's dog versed in speech, the art of song came naturally. Unheard by any soul, it feared no discovery. Should it sense the proximity of humans, it would delve deeper or conceal itself. Though pangs of hunger emerged, Juanmao abstained from immediate consumption upon its aquatic venture, opting instead to revel in the liberty of play. Unsupervised, Juanmao basked in its newfound independence. After a spell of frolicking with turtles and fish, Juanmao's curiosity was piqued by a larger fish, classified as a protected entity in the Marine Wildlife Conservation List—thus, off-limits for consumption. However, this did not quell Juanmao's intrigue. "Protected species are not meant to be eaten, but surely they may serve as companions in play!" Abandoning the school and the turtle, Juanmao pursued the larger fish, occasionally nudging it with a paw. "Merely a gentle touch; no harm intended." As the fish accelerated, so did Juanmao, matching its velocity with ease, never contemplating how it managed to match the speed of a marlin. Having indulged in ample play, Juanmao's appetite intensified; it resolved that sustenance was due. It would never prey upon those under the sea's protection, not even a single scale, beyond the purview of Fang Zhao. The mere thought conjured recollections of the books Fang Zhao had presented to it, the examinations within the Study Machine, and periods of introspection. For those not shielded by protections, Juanmao extended no quarter! The moment to feast had arrived! In its exhilaration, Juanmao also grappled with uncertainty. Where should it commence? On its inaugural autonomous foray into the sea, the initial catch ought to be of distinction—a 'ritualistic sensation,' as Nanfeng had elucidated? Juanmao scoured the depths with meticulous care in search of today's paramount quarry. At last, it identified a target. Superficially resembling a species from the protection album, Juanmao swiftly discerned the dissimilarities, prepared to vindicate its choice to Fang Zhao subsequently. Bolstered by the certainty that its quarry was not protected, Juanmao embarked on the chase with renewed vigor. Although the prey was diminutive, scarcely a meter, it seized Juanmao's undivided attention. With its quarry locked, Juanmao thrust forward in pursuit. At one in the morning, Yanzhou's counter-terrorism unit was at the pinnacle of vigilance. "No suspicious entities detected by the night watch, the Sonar Array signals no anomalous targets." "Sustain our vigilant defense and surveillance over the target area, ensure thorough patrols and nearshore detection, and meticulously scrutinize every minor auditory and energetic aberration—no creature, avian or aquatic, is to be overlooked!" They had received intelligence that the infamous 'Empire of Tomorrow,' also known as 'Organization T,' intended to launch an assault on Yanzhou come two AM. While the broad region was known, the precise location remained shrouded in secrecy. Moreover, 'Organization T' had misappropriated the latest in bionic innovation. The extent to which those zealots had augmented the technology was a mystery to all. Elsewhere, within a concealed subterranean chamber. The gloomy abode was illuminated solely by the glow of screens. A collective of seven or eight individuals, standing or seated, were fixated upon a singular monitor. "We've successfully circumnavigated a patrol craft!" one individual announced, their gaze laced with sanguinary anticipation as they surveyed the map, embellished with the blood-red insignia of 'T'. They had formulated a fresh stratagem, a preliminary gambit—a tentative incursion. Employing an innovative bionic torpedo, their scheme was to target a port, situated a centum kilometers from Qi'an City in Yanzhou. A solitary torpedo, laden with a potent cache of high-energy substances, had the capability to annihilate dozens of merchant vessels moored at the port, inflicting a catastrophic blow. The evasion of the patrol vessels was anticipated; the true trial lay in breaching the coastal defenses. "Smooth advancement; the objective is within our grasp!" The individual wielding the controller was utterly engrossed, the on-screen indicator demanding undivided attention. The moment was nigh to ascertain whether their modifications could deceive Yanzhou's formidable defense mechanisms. Should this initial offensive culminate in triumph, the subsequent phase could be unfurled without delay! The subterranean enclave was a nexus of rapt attention. As they verged on penetrating Yanzhou's defensive perimeter, in a juncture where every inhalation was suspended in anticipation, the luminescent dot on the monitor abruptly vanished. The basement was ensnared in collective astonishment. Their ocular faculties were thrown into doubt. The controller's visage momentarily petrified. Whither went my torpedo? A reexamination confirmed the utter evanescence of the projectile, precipitously, without preamble. This unforeseen development triggered a wave of consternation among those assembled. They had entertained a multitude of potential outcomes, yet this scenario had eluded their foresight. As though it vanished prior to even stirring the water's surface, the occurrence was jarringly abrupt. The psychological jolt was overwhelming, too profound for immediate processing. "What has transpired?" "The bionic torpedo has severed contact! No energy response is discernible! The causation remains opaque!" "Perchance a malfunction in the display?" "Negative, both display and controller are in optimal function, yet the torpedo remains unresponsive!" Sizable investments of resources, temporal expenditure, and human capital had been allocated to this venture, the culmination of which was this technological marvel! And now, it had dissipated, as if swallowed by the ether?? "Has Yanzhou's coastal bulwark evolved to such an impregnable state... Nay... Such a notion is beyond credence!" The individual gripping the controller's lips trembled, their countenance contorted in a visage of anguish, their eyes bloodshot, brimming with resentment and unchecked fervor. This setback was anathema to their acceptance! Another, perennially ensconced in the chamber's recess, his expression saturnine, issued a mandate, "Alert the cadre, cease all maneuvers forthwith! Our immediate objective is to unravel the enigma of their interception!" The meticulously crafted scheme, the inaugural chapter in their plotted siege against Yanzhou, had faltered. In stark contrast, the Yanzhou counter-terrorism department was ensnared in bewilderment. They persisted in their vigil beyond the foretold hour of two AM, steadfast against complacency or oversight, their watch enduring until the dawn at seven AM. Not a whisper of activity was detected. The fanatical cohorts of the 'T' Organization were not known for abortive endeavors; even amidst intelligence leaks, they would proceed with a provocative demeanor. Yet, as the day broke, devoid of any communiqué regarding enigmatic aggressions, the land remained tranquil; the sea was serene, with no lacunae in their surveillance. Whence the stillness? The conundrum was palpable. Could the intelligence have been fallacious? ... With the retreat of nocturnal shadows and the brightening of clouds, the dawning sun's rays scattered across the sea, expelling the vestiges of night's coolness. Splash— A dog's head surfaced, its snout emitting a jet of air as if struck by the sudden recollection of its respiratory faculties, its form emerging from the water to draw in the moist morning air. Juanmao propelled itself leisurely toward the shoreline, its limbs churning the water, stirring sand in its wake. Upon reaching terra firma, Juanmao indulged in a vigorous shake of its coat, the briny embrace of the sea relinquished. "Burp~~~" Chapter 452: A Light Appetite Senior Assistant Nanfeng was granted a much-needed break along with his two co-assistants by Fang Zhao. Nevertheless, Nanfeng, who viewed himself as a responsible aide and a busy bee, sought permission from Fang Zhao and, once approved, arrived at the crack of dawn. Following his departure from the Huangyi Art Academy, Fang Zhao was besieged with collaboration offers. It seemed to many that after completing his advanced studies, he'd be ready for business ventures. Yet, Fang Zhao showed no interest in such commercial endeavors. Despite his rejections, most were persistent and turned to Nanfeng, who had a short stint with the Huangzhou Entertainment Circle, making him a more accessible target than Fang Zhao. Thus, Nanfeng, self-proclaimed as a 'Part-Time Agent,' was brimming with energy as he took his work along. After Nanfeng briefed Fang Zhao on their tasks, he began looking for Juanmao, the extraordinary dog valued at nearly three hundred million dollars and the soul of their team, second only to the boss himself. "Where's Juanmao?" Since relocating to their new home, Juanmao had been in high spirits. Why was it absent today? Had the previous day's play led to it napping in a snug spot? "It's out for a swim; should be back soon," Fang Zhao mentioned, checking the time. Nanfeng almost exclaimed, 'Have you lost your mind, allowing a nearly three-hundred-million-dollar dog to play in the sea unsupervised?' But he held his tongue. Putting aside his paperwork, Nanfeng said, "Boss, I'll take a look at the beach," and darted out. Hardly outside, Nanfeng received a call from Yan Biao, inquiring about their status. Nanfeng responded while searching the beach. Juanmao was emerging from the sea, vigorously shaking off water and racing back home. In the dawn's light, Nanfeng marveled at the metallic sheen of Juanmao's coat. "Truly a nearly three-hundred-million-dollar dog! Even its sunbathing imparts a metallic luster!" He snapped a photo for their Salted Fish Private Chat Group, "Look at those adorable paw prints in the sand!" Yan Biao and Zuo Yu: "......" Nanfeng continued his excited commentary, "Check out this live feed. See that glistening figure sprinting? Our little Juanmao is the brightest shine in the neighborhood!" Yan Biao: "And surely the most expensive, right?" "The boss, you know..." Nanfeng hesitated, recalling Fang Zhao's extraordinary hearing. Changing tack, he said, "The boss can't be expected to watch the dog all the time. We must be vigilant when we're here, particularly when Juanmao is swimming—it's far too risky!" He carried on the conversation as he hastened towards Juanmao. Juanmao, intercepted by Nanfeng, shook off more water from its coat. Burp~~~ Pfft—— The dog burped and then farted. Nanfeng was ecstatic, regretting only that he hadn't captured the moment: "Witnessing a dog fart first-hand, especially from a nearly three-hundred-million-dollar dog, is quite the experience. Whether it burps or farts, there's a lingering presence; if you take a closer whiff, you can detect a hint of gunpowder." Yan Biao and Zuo Yu: "......" It was clear that Nanfeng's thoughts were thoroughly steeped in the dog's monetary value. His adoration knew no bounds! While Nanfeng sang praises of 'my extraordinary dog,' Juanmao had already sprinted past him and into the house. The time was now 8:02 AM. Juanmao had promised Fang Zhao it would return by eight... It was two minutes late. Juanmao had its explanation ready. "I was onshore before eight! I just wanted to shake dry before going inside! And Nanfeng, he blocked my way!" Juanmao wanted to continue but fell silent as Nanfeng's footsteps approached. "Go to the dryer and fluff up your coat," Fang Zhao instructed, unfazed. By the time Juanmao was fluffed and dry, Fang Zhao had sent Nanfeng on his way. Fang Zhao examined Juanmao's mouth, finding only a trace of green—likely remnants of algae. "How much did you actually eat?" Fang Zhao asked. With a proud puff of the chest, Juanmao declared, "Just one fish, only one! The rest were mere morsels." Juanmao was determined to defend its modest appetite. It had heard all too often how costly it was to keep pets, especially those with large appetites, and how they sometimes ended up abandoned. Juanmao was intent on setting the record straight. It didn't have a gargantuan appetite! "Only one fish? Are you certain you're not hungry?" Fang Zhao asked, knowing well Juanmao's typical voracious appetite. "Absolutely! Not hungry at all!" Juanmao affirmed. "...You didn't snaffle a whale, did you?" "No! I steered clear of whales and all other Marine Protected Species! Didn't touch a single scale! The fish I ate was slightly longer than me. It resembled a protected species, but I ensured it wasn't, I checked thoroughly!" Juanmao hastily explained. It was crucial to clarify! Juanmao did not want to be on the naughty step! "What about the other snacks?" Fang Zhao continued to probe. "Just nibbled on a couple of shells, munched on some seaweed on the way back, and sampled a few other things I can't name—gave them a lick, none tasted good." "Hmm." Fang Zhao gave Juanmao a once-over. Aside from an extra spring in its step, nothing seemed out of place. Unsure whether Juanmao truly wasn't hungry or just saying so, he decided to prepare a bowl of kibble for it. Just as he was about to serve it, Juanmao burped again. Fang Zhao paused, his senses picking up an unusual scent in the air, and his expression grew serious. Setting the dog bowl aside, Fang Zhao knelt before the stretching Juanmao for a thorough inspection. "The fish you ate today—could you describe it? Have you seen anything like it in your books?" Fang Zhao questioned. Juanmao: "It somewhat resembled an entry from the Marine Wildlife Conservation List." Fang Zhao brought up the electronic album and had Juanmao identify the creature. "This one, somewhat similar, but definitely not the same! I have an eye for these things!" Juanmao boasted. Fortunately, it had been vigilant during its hunt, noting the distinctions between its catch and the protected species listed. Upon Fang Zhao's inquiry, Juanmao detailed its observations, even down to the discreet 'T' etched on the belly of the fish. Fang Zhao took detailed notes, sketching based on Juanmao's description. Considering the 'fish's' swimming direction, Fang Zhao drew possible routes, eventually marking three that stood out, one of which led straight to a port a hundred kilometers away from Qi'an City. Looking at the mapped routes and the 'T' on the sketch of the fish, Fang Zhao inquired, "What did it feel like when you swallowed it? The texture, the hardness?" Juanmao, clearly puzzled, replied, "I wouldn't know. Anything larger than myself, I simply gulp down whole." Fang Zhao: "......" The logic was impeccable. Juanmao adhered to an instinct similar to that of wild animals—minimizing physical exertion to maximize energy intake. Why chew piece by piece when you can swallow whole? Why exert effort when it's effortless to ingest, and there's no one around to witness? As Fang Zhao remained silent, Juanmao wondered if it had made a mistake. Tentatively, it continued its defense: "Although I'm not acquainted with its flavor, I believe its composition is more intricate than dog food... Definitely more intricate! Maybe next time I'll chew carefully and really taste it. The books I've read didn't discuss the flavor profiles of those protected fish. Without a comparison, how can I tell if it's truly exceptional compared to others that look similar? I will say, I felt quite full afterward." Fang Zhao's gaze lifted from the notebook, and he gently patted Juanmao's head, "No need, you did very well." Pleased with the praise, Juanmao's tail waved energetically. "How do you feel right now?" Fang Zhao inquired. "Feel? After eating that fish, I'm as satisfied as you humans are with those compressed energy snacks." Juanmao emphasized, "My appetite is honestly not that big!" Still somewhat concerned, Fang Zhao conducted a quick check-up on Juanmao. Since their move, the medical equipment used for examining Juanmao had also been transferred. The examination showed that Juanmao was free of injuries and in excellent health. A blood test, however, revealed a slight increase in heavy metal levels compared to its usual readings. Juanmao's blood had always had a higher concentration of heavy metals than that of other dogs. And now, after consuming what was suspected to be akin to advanced technology like a Bionic Torpedo, this slight increase was intriguing. Fang Zhao was fascinated by the discovery. Upon closer examination, Juanmao's fur seemed to have undergone a slight change in luster. None of Nanfeng's previous grooming had produced such a gleam, and its coat wasn't easily altered by common chemicals. These changes had occurred overnight. To err on the side of caution, Fang Zhao attached a sophisticated tracking device, a micro-detector, to Juanmao's leg to ensure any health emergencies would be detected immediately. "Stay out of the water for the next few days," Fang Zhao instructed. "Understood." Having fully enjoyed its adventure and now feeling full and drowsy, Juanmao decided to spend the next couple of days watching television and sleeping at home. "Next time you come across that 'fish' that fills you up and you want to eat, swallow it whole, don't bite into it. And come straight back to tell me afterwards." "Sure thing, woof!" Juanmao's tail shook with joy. It would go hunting again when hunger struck next. Remarkably filling, Juanmao believed that one meal could sustain it for at least half a month. Such efficiency would certainly save Fang Zhao quite a bit of money. The only hiccup—quite literally—were Juanmao's unstoppable post-meal burps. Chapter 453 'Surprise Assault, Arf!!' After a satisfying meal without a hint of reprimand, Juanmao nestled into his cozy bed with a blissful yawn, reveling in his narrow escape from trouble, and drifted off to dreamland. Fang Zhao had initially planned to explore the nearby vicinity today, having inquired about speedboat rentals from the property management just yesterday. His academic endeavors wrapped up and his dissertation finalized, he was looking forward to unwinding for a spell by angling in the open sea over the coming days, perhaps even snagging some fresh seafood for 'Bunny.' But the peculiar incident Juanmao had brought home compelled Fang Zhao to scrap his initial schemes. Back in his study, Fang Zhao digitized the sketches he'd just penned in his notebook and laid out several screens before him. He also unfurled a map of Yanzhou, demarcated a specific sector, and juxtaposed it with the sketches. The letter 'T' signified Organization T, infamous for their penchant for offensive strikes, seemingly yearning for a resurgence of the catastrophic Era of Annihilation. Fang Zhao's first brush with them had been during his tenure on Baiji Star. Another encounter had unfolded near Whale Island. Analyzing the trio of routes mapped out before him, Fang Zhao sought to decipher their underlying intent. Having endured the Era of Annihilation for nearly a century, Fang Zhao remained acutely attuned to various subtleties. Certain experiences had seared into his psyche, and despite transitioning into a new body and environment, the prolonged peace of the New Century hadn't dulled these ingrained sensations. The scent of gunpowder lingering on Juanmao's belch instantaneously set off Fang Zhao's alarm bells. During the Era of Annihilation, the whiff of gunpowder was synonymous with conflict and carnage. Beep——Beep——Lost in thought, Fang Zhao was jolted by a chime from his personal terminal, diverting his attention from the map to heed the alert. It stemmed from the micro-detector affixed to Juanmao's hind leg, designed to signal any abnormalities. A graph materialized on the screen, charting real-time monitoring data. An hour prior, Juanmao's blood heavy metal content, already slightly over the norm, began a precipitous ascent. No, it was more than an ascent—it was a harrowing metamorphosis! The levels of various metals surged and then nosedived, and elements alien to a canine's physiology made an unprecedented appearance. These anomalies were undoubtedly a consequence of Juanmao's consumption earlier that day. Humans, too, assimilate non-essential elements from their diet, yet the current predicament was starkly dissimilar. In a fleeting ten-second window, as the detector relayed, some metallic constituents in Juanmao's system plummeted from peak alert levels to nil, only to soar to staggering heights in the next reading! No known creature in Fang Zhao's compendium exhibited such erratic fluctuations! For instance, the device's readings indicated that the concentration of several metals, were they present in a human, would be incompatible with life. The same held true for canines! Yet Juanmao exhibited no loss of vitality, and Fang Zhao could still discern its steady rhythmic snoring. This aberration in the detector's feedback was utterly abnormal! Was the device malfunctioning? Fang Zhao approached Juanmao's resting place and observed the dog sprawled on its back, immersed in slumber, snoring away. He hesitated momentarily, then extended a finger to gauge Juanmao's breath. A notorious snorer post-slumber, Juanmao was neither brachycephalic nor overweight, yet it persistently snored. Fang Zhao had once sought veterinary insight, to no avail. Presently, the dog's respiration was robust, not unduly hasty, but the exhalation bore an abnormal heat, significantly exceeding the detector's readings. For an endothermic creature, such disparity in breath temperature, more than double the normal body heat—could that be deemed regular? Fang Zhao tapped Juanmao's cranium. 'Juanmao?' The snoring persisted. Another tap, more insistent, 'They've pilfered the gaming console!' 'Arf...' Juanmao let out a couple of muffled grumbles, licked its muzzle, shifted its posture, and returned to its slumber, rolling to its side, with a twitch of the legs as though envisioning a chase in its dreams. And the snoring resumed. Fang Zhao's expression contorted with concern. Could it be that not even the alarm of a stolen gaming console could rouse it? The predicament appeared more severe than anticipated. But with no precedent for such an occurrence and without a whisper of it in any lore, Fang Zhao was at a loss for action. To awaken Juanmao by force or to observe and wait? Uncertain of the repercussions of disturbing Juanmao in such a state, Fang Zhao refrained from hasty decisions. As he deliberated, the detector's alarm crescendoed in urgency and pitch, and the personal terminal showcased a monitoring graph in tumultuous flux. Heart rate, pulse, blood pressure—all oscillated wildly. And these were merely the quantifiable shifts; countless others likely eluded the detector's scope. The screen that depicted the monitoring graph flickered, its image contorted as if under an invisible strain. The illumination in the room became erratic, the flickering suggestive of an external disturbance. Concurrent alarms blared from the operational electronics. A sonorous ringing invaded the room, eliciting intense discomfort. Fang Zhao, however, managed to endure. Another person might have succumbed to disorientation. The air seemed laced with tendrils of chilliness. Fang Zhao's intuition, honed in the tumult of the Era of Annihilation, detected the imperceptible peril emanating from Juanmao, prompting him to retreat with alacrity. As the detector's data stream halted abruptly, the piercing alarm terminated. The liaison between the device and the personal terminal severed. Light bulbs shattered in unison. Electrical outlets sparked with unleashed current. A flash of cold metallic sheen burst forth, manifesting what appeared to be an immense... paw? It materialized with such alacrity it seemed ethereal, only to strike with force. Thud! Particles of dust and debris vaulted from the impact. The sudden gale propelled the curtains into a frenzy. The entire edifice, a three-story construct, shuddered. And then the metallic radiance was no more. From emergence to evanescence, it spanned but a moment, akin to a mirage. Fang Zhao beheld the colossal paw imprint before him and the splintered floorboards, enveloped in silence. The gargantuan paw's imprint had engulfed a chair within its expanse. It was a lavish housewarming present from Nanfeng to Fang Zhao. Nanfeng had opted for the chair believing that solid wood exuded elegance, as pure solid wood furnishings were a luxury in the New Century. Yet the vendor had also advised that for dog owners, more resilient furniture was prudent, particularly the legs of tables and chairs which bore the brunt of canine gnawing. Thus, Nanfeng settled on an alloy variant. Sufficiently durable. But now, the seller-lauded 'sufficiently durable' alloy chair lay flattened into a disc, embedded deep within the flooring. Juanmao, who had been slumbering adjacent, seemed to awaken as though from a night terror. Surveying the chaos with bewildered dog eyes, it observed the fissured floorboards, the breaches revealing the level below, and the menacing paw impressions etched into the ground. Startled, Juanmao bounded from its bedding, fangs bared, and cried out, 'Intruder alert! Arf!' Upon spotting Fang Zhao, Juanmao hastened to his side, growling at the enormous paw print that had mysteriously materialized in the chamber. Its ears pinned back, neck fur on end, deep furrows on its snout, and bared incisors signaled that the hound had entered combat readiness, a guardian poised to fiercely defend its territory from alien incursion. Its countenance was the epitome of ferocity. 'Arf!!' Fang Zhao: '......' Chapter 454: No Room to Spare Fang Zhao had planned to enjoy some quiet downtime, but finding peace was more challenging than expected. The disturbance at his residence was sizable enough that the security network, overseen by the residential area's property management, quickly reached out after detecting unusual activity. "Is everything alright at your end? Do you need assistance?" "No need, it's just my dog, Juanmao, causing some trouble," Fang Zhao responded. The property management team acknowledged politely. Alright, if you say it's Juanmao, then that's what we'll go with. They didn't press for more information. As long as the incident didn't affect other residents or pose a danger to anyone, they were indifferent—even if it meant someone tearing up their own floorboards. Although Fang Zhao's house was set apart, his prominence as a Yanzhou celebrity meant that any minor disturbance quickly became the subject of neighborhood speculation. So when Nanfeng and two others quickly responded to Fang Zhao’s call, they discovered they weren't alone in their concern. A middle-aged entrepreneur, walking his dog, claimed he was merely stopping by for a neighborly visit. Yet, his eyes betrayed a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. Fang Zhao decided not to let him inside, citing the mess within, and instead hosted him in the yard, where there were chairs available. "Trouble with the dog? Oh, I can relate. Some annoyances are unique to us dog owners," the man said, sharing a knowing look. After a brief exchange, the entrepreneur felt he had learned enough and, realizing he wouldn't glean more, departed with his dog. As soon as he was out of sight, he shared his observations with other neighbors. "There was quite a stir at his house today; seems like a lot got damaged... I didn't catch sight of his dog; I suspect he might have been disciplining it... You know, some people are very different in private. Who knows what they're up to at home, hehehe... It's probably just a way to vent the stress of public life. You know how stars can be—they often have a temper behind closed doors... Understandable. Every home has its secrets. Any noise can be blamed on the dog, after all, dogs can't speak." Those residing in this upscale neighborhood typically didn't leak information to the media, choosing instead to gossip among themselves. A rumor quickly started to spread. It appeared Fang Zhao might have a violent side that he kept hidden from the public eye. Along came other rumors. Fang Zhao had been blindsided by rivals, caught up in romantic drama, or targeted by terrorists. There were all sorts of speculations. Some observant neighbors believed they had figured out the truth. Trouble just after moving in? Who had Fang Zhao managed to offend? Fang Zhao was aware of the private whispers but opted not to react. Instead, he asked Nanfeng to manage the refurbishment of the house, choosing to handle the incident without fanfare. The area Juanmao had ruined was too noticeable, so Fang Zhao destroyed the evidence himself. The already cracked floorboard now sported a large hole. Just one day after moving into his newly renovated home, it was time for significant repairs. Yan Biao and Zuo Yu felt ashamed. The level of destruction suggested an attack—a failure in their duty as bodyguards. Although Fang Zhao had given them time off, they had personally overseen the installation of the home’s security systems, which had failed to trigger during the incident! They felt they hadn't justified Fang Zhao's generous salary. The two discussed plans to upgrade the house's security system. Nanfeng, looking pale and with shaky hands, gingerly touched the flattened alloy chair embedded into the floorboard. What level of force was required to flatten a chair that could supposedly support the weight of an elephant?! The first floor had suffered manageable damage, but the second floor was a different story. The house was in disarray; half of the newly purchased appliances were now scrap, two-thirds of the lights needed replacing, and the walls required a fresh coat of paint. Nanfeng's mind was filled with thoughts of assassination, vendettas, and crimes of passion, and he was genuinely concerned for Fang Zhao's safety. He refrained from asking for details, and Fang Zhao showed no signs of wanting to elaborate. They both kept their questions to themselves. "Boss, should we hire additional help?" Nanfeng inquired. "There's no need." Fang Zhao assigned Nanfeng the task of overseeing the house repairs and called Juanmao, who had been sulking in a corner, into the study. They had been on the second floor when the incident occurred, and fortunately, the house was sturdy enough to withstand Juanmao's powerful impact; otherwise, it might have collapsed. It was also a stroke of luck that they had moved. In the previous house, the downstairs neighbors could have been severely impacted. Once Juanmao was inside the study and the door closed to dampen any sound, Fang Zhao faced a dog that was questioning its own actions. Juanmao was still reeling from the truth, even more so than when it discovered its talent for singing while playing games. "You really don't remember anything?" Fang Zhao asked. "I genuinely don't," Juanmao assured. Juanmao couldn't believe it was that kind of dog. Fang Zhao nodded and played a recording. Although the surveillance equipment was no longer operational, it had captured a recording before failing—a series of noises similar to persistent tinnitus. "Listen to this." Juanmao's ears twitched, and it began to transition from strongly denying it was that sort of dog to showing a hint of doubt. "Sounds familiar," Juanmao confessed weakly. Fang Zhao's eyebrows lifted. Had something like this happened before? "When did you last hear this sound?" Fang Zhao pressed. After some thought, Juanmao remembered, "When you were taken away." Fang Zhao: "..." Juanmao was referring to when Fang Zhao had been isolated. "On Whale Island?" Fang Zhao sought clarification. "Yes!" "And what did you do then?" "I consumed someone." "..." "But I acted as if I had fainted right afterward! No one discovered anything!" "...Excellent. Can you recall any other similar incidents? Think carefully." Juanmao spent a significant amount of time pondering. "There might have been another occasion, but I can't precisely remember when." While Juanmao's memory was hazy, Fang Zhao managed to recall a certain event. There was a time when Will, in search of inspiration for his paintings, took Juanmao to an art exhibition. They didn't expect an accident to occur, which resulted in Juanmao dragging Will out of a fire. At that time, the dog cages had all been cut open, and the surveillance system had completely failed. To this day, the perpetrator had not been found. Juanmao only recalled biting through the cage; it had no memories of the surveillance failure. Back then, Juanmao wasn't conscious of the implications of its actions. Even now, Juanmao was unaware that its transformations were causing the surveillance systems to fail. From breaking cages and disabling surveillance to swallowing a person on Whale Island, and now suddenly sprouting a giant claw that nearly demolished the house. The transformations had escalated significantly within a year, and Fang Zhao surmised that Juanmao might be evolving towards a specific form. An evolution of sorts. But no one could predict how long this process would continue or what might happen. More concerning was the fact that Juanmao couldn't control these transformations. What would they do if such an event happened again? They would need a secluded location. Fang Zhao reflected on the size of the claw that had cracked the floorboard; it was just one claw. If a full transformation occurred... The house would be insufficient to contain it. "How are you feeling now?" Fang Zhao inquired. "I don't feel much... Is a slightly itchy paw something to note?" Juanmao raised one of its front paws. Following the damage to the floorboard, Fang Zhao had inspected the paw he suspected had enlarged and found only minor scratches. Now, looking again, all scratches had disappeared, and the paw appeared to have been expertly maintained. After discussing the necessary precautions with Juanmao, Fang Zhao checked his bank account and sighed. Maintaining a household was proving to be quite the challenge. With a sigh of resignation, Fang Zhao summoned Nanfeng. Nanfeng had been contemplating how to fortify the house while keeping the repairs discreet. He thought Fang Zhao would want to discuss strategies for a low-key restoration, and he had prepared several plans. However... "I'm thinking about buying an island," Fang Zhao stated. Nanfeng: "??" Buy what? Keep calm, boss! An island was the last thing Fang Zhao needed. Nanfeng believed there was no real need for an island, and even those with superficial knowledge understood that private islands were depreciating. There was a phase in the New Era when island-buying was trendy, led by a group of businessmen who inflated the market. Subsequently, due to environmental and other regulations, some islands were prohibited from being sold, reducing the number of tradable islands and increasing their prices even more. But with the continuous development of alien planets, the wealthy shifted their investments off-world, diminishing the allure of buying native islands. Why invest in these tiny local islands, especially remote ones with little appeal, that might still harbor remnants of the Era of Annihilation virus? What was the draw? With a plethora of options available, some items simply lose their charm. People naturally gravitate towards better choices when they become accessible. Nowadays, many private islands are up for sale, but they're difficult to offload. Buying is straightforward; with the money ready, a deal can be made promptly, and island owners would be more than pleased. Holding back his astonishment, Nanfeng cleared his throat and managed a smile as he began to explain the current island market conditions to Fang Zhao. "They say to buy on the rise, not the fall. The prices of home planet islands have been consistently falling, making them hard to resell once acquired... Some who jumped on the island-buying bandwagon have left their islands undeveloped, not realizing the dangers of the untamed wildlife and flora—quite risky. The island prices were already high, and the initial investment costs were significant..." Nanfeng gave Fang Zhao a thorough briefing, advising against the investment. After listening, Fang Zhao simply stated, "Juanmao needs more room to roam." Nanfeng stared at Fang Zhao, his expression blank, as he failed to detect any hint of jest in Fang Zhao’s demeanor. Realizing Fang Zhao's mind was made up, Nanfeng could only agree. "Alright, I'll get started on a budget list." Nanfeng pondered: What had Fang Zhao gone through? Had things escalated to the point of seeking seclusion? Nanfeng decided to purchase additional insurance for himself once he got home. He was now keen to ask Fang Zhao: Do you regret all those donations? Without them, you could have easily bought not just one island, but an entire group! While internally venting, Nanfeng began his search for private islands on the market, focusing on those suitable for construction and with helipads. He estimated that after buying a small island, Fang Zhao's savings would be nearly depleted. If it were for any other reason, Nanfeng might have understood, but for a dog, it seemed a bit much... That day, Nanfeng learned a valuable lesson from his boss—pet ownership could lead to a swift depletion of wealth. Chapter 455: Unaware of Its Odd Appearance Without a Mirror Acquiring islands on our home planet was an affair filled with choice. Nanfeng had meticulously sifted through several options, presenting Fang Zhao with a curated selection. Fang Zhao chose one. The ecstatic owner, cognizant of the rising trend of extraterrestrial investments, was eager to liquidate. Willing to negotiate, he quickly agreed to Fang Zhao's terms. The transaction was rapid; a price inquiry one day resulted in a completed deal the next. Witnessing Fang Zhao's swift handling of the paperwork, Nanfeng resigned himself to a simple truth: Fang Zhao was no investor, and he desperately needed a savvy investment advisor. Regardless of the enigma surrounding the events in that house, surely there was no need for such a hasty acquisition? After all, would the boss not be better served by focusing on his music and arts? Investments were not his strong suit. Nanfeng wasn't alone in his thoughts; the former island owner also saw Fang Zhao's actions as naive. With the value of home planet islands on a downward trend, who would rush to make a purchase if not a fool? Such is the impetuosity of youth. The island, now owned by Fang Zhao, was not expansive but provided ample space for Juanmao to roam freely. Its secluded location, equidistant from all continents, lacked distinctive features or fame, and it had been nearly two decades since the last owner had resided there. It had only seen occasional, superficial maintenance. The Cataclysm of the Era of Annihilation had spared no corner of the globe; this small island had also faced its trials. Now, over five centuries later, it had recovered to a state of vibrant life. The island's residence, built over fifty years prior, had withstood storms and had been reinforced twice. Fang Zhao made no significant alterations; its sturdiness sufficed. Once the security system installations were complete, Fang Zhao sent Nanfeng and the rest back to their posts. Given the island's modest size, the food supply was limited and predominantly imported. Fang Zhao had stockpiled provisions, with plans for Yan Biao and Zuo Yu to deliver supplies at intervals. With the influx of royalty fees, Fang Zhao acquired two atmospheric aircraft. His wallet, recently plump with funds, quickly deflated. Nanfeng and his colleagues couldn't help but question their boss's sanity. Of the two new aircraft, one remained on the island, the other designated for transporting goods to Nanfeng's team. "Boss, are you really planning to stay here alone?" inquired a concerned Zuo Yu. "Yes," replied Fang Zhao, his voice a mix of calm and resolution. "Are you sure you don't need additional help?" asked Yan Biao. "No need." "Then... please contact us immediately should any issue arise. We're on standby." Nanfeng boarded the aircraft with a heavy heart and frequent backward glances. As Nanfeng and the team soared away, Fang Zhao returned to the house and called out to Juanmao, who had cocooned itself in its kennel. The dog had mentally evolved from 'I can't possibly be this kind of dog' to 'Maybe it's time I earned my keep.' Juanmao had presumed the 'fish' it had consumed would sustain it for weeks, but hunger struck again in less than one. Fang Zhao brought forth a hefty 50-kilogram bag of dog food. "Eat up; I'll watch over you," he said. "Can I gulp it down whole?" Juanmao asked. "Sure, go ahead." Juanmao licked its snout, advancing towards the food. In a blink, Fang Zhao observed what seemed like the emergence of a massive, metallic... mouth? A silver gleam flashed. The 50-kilogram bag vanished. "Are you full now?" Fang Zhao inquired. Juanmao hesitated before nodding, "Still a bit hungry." The dog had barely touched the surface of satiety. Fang Zhao presented another bag, "Could you try swallowing slower this time? Ease into it?" "I'll go slow!" Juanmao assured him. Fang Zhao watched more closely as Juanmao underwent its transformation. The canine's head reshaped while the rest of its body retained its usual dog form. The curly fur appeared to retract into Juanmao's body. The metamorphosed head was indistinct, resembling a metallic composition, its precise form unclear. All that was evident was a gaping maw with sharp teeth, consuming the second 50-kilogram bag effortlessly. An easy feat. Not just 50 kilograms—doubtless even 100 would have been swallowed without pause. Fang Zhao contemplated the scene before him. Perhaps Juanmao could no longer be solely defined as a carbon-based life form. It manifested an alternative existence. In its usual state, a dog, but what of its transformed self? A metallic hound? An unidentified metallic organism? The house's newly installed cameras had malfunctioned, as expected, capturing only fragments of the event. The disturbance commenced the moment Juanmao began its transformation. Other nearby surveillance devices experienced severe malfunctions, their footage contorted and warped at the critical moment. Every electronic device had been affected. Fortunately, Fang Zhao, foreseeing such complications, had brought a surplus of equipment. With no comprehension of its metamorphosis and electronics incapacitated, Fang Zhao fetched a large dressing mirror from the warehouse, a relic left by the island's previous owner. Juanmao, facing the mirror, swallowed dog food once more, nearly choking. It was dumbfounded. The dog was almost petrified by the reflection it beheld. Indeed, without a mirror, one remains oblivious to one's own monstrous form! The shock was more intense than when it discovered the chaos it had wreaked in its dreams! Yet, regardless of the shock's magnitude, hunger remained the overriding sensation. After numerous transformations, Juanmao felt exhausted as though it had consumed all three bags of dog food. Hungry. So very hungry! Left with no other option, Juanmao ventured back to the sea to forage. This time, with no neighboring residents to consider, it didn't have to wait until nightfall. With Fang Zhao's permission, Juanmao eagerly plunged into the sea to forage. As if a switch had been flipped, Juanmao's transformations grew increasingly frequent. Occasionally, while it innocently dug, its paws would suddenly enlarge, excavating a hole. Fang Zhao hesitated to allow it indoors for fear it might dream of chasing burglars and inadvertently lay waste to the house. These incessant transformations elicited a colossal demand for energy. Food! Fang Zhao found himself at a loss, leaving Juanmao to fend for itself in the open sea. With each of Juanmao's departures, Fang Zhao reiterated important precautions and warnings. Every day, Juanmao embarked on a marine adventure, returning satiated. In just a week, it had consumed two bionic torpedoes near Yanzhou's coastal waters. Now, a single torpedo didn't last a fortnight or even a week. If transformations became too commonplace, Juanmao would be compelled to forage every two to three days. Juanmao delighted in this routine, managing to eat its fill while conserving resources. However, after the third bionic torpedo, it could find no more. Juanmao scoured the area near Yanzhou's waters multiple times to no avail. Fang Zhao surmised that the operatives of Organization T might have abandoned the use of bionic torpedoes as a stratagem. Their next move was a matter of conjecture. The Counter-Terrorism Department of Yanzhou executed their duties with commendable efficiency, and even without Juanmao's intervention, the chances of intercepting the bionic torpedoes were high. Without torpedoes, Juanmao sought alternative sources of sustenance. This time, it resolved to venture deeper into the sea. Fang Zhao neither encouraged nor dissuaded this decision, instead offering Juanmao a comprehensive exam he had crafted. The exam encompassed strategies for handling various emergent situations and reinforced points of caution he had repeatedly emphasized. Juanmao completed the exam with ease, scoring 93 out of 100. After reviewing the deductions, Fang Zhao offered additional guidance before consenting to Juanmao's departure. Juanmao's outing lasted longer this time; it was absent for 12 hours before returning, visibly revitalized and evidently well-fed. "What did you consume?" Fang Zhao inquired. "A massive box!" Juanmao exclaimed. Juanmao recounted its excursion succinctly: After leaving the island, it swam on until it detected something that seemed delicious, and it devoured it. Fang Zhao delved into specifics, discovering that Juanmao's 'meal' was located in a sunken submarine within the deep sea. Inside the submarine, Juanmao encountered what was likely a form of high-energy material. Out of eight sizeable boxes, Juanmao had instantly ingested two. Due to the distance, Juanmao couldn't manage its transformations and was incapable of bringing the boxes up from the depths for Fang Zhao's inspection. After consuming the first box, Juanmao felt sated and considered retrieving one to show Fang Zhao. Alas, while carrying it, the box was inadvertently swallowed. Juanmao resisted consuming a third box, heeding Fang Zhao's advice, and chose to return to the island instead. "I'm utterly stuffed," Juanmao declared. Feeling overfed was a rarity. Without diving gear, Fang Zhao couldn't inspect the site firsthand and relied on Juanmao's account and his own suppositions. With scant information, the sunken submarine's era remained a mystery, and Juanmao had no recognition of it; Fang Zhao couldn't visualize it. They would have to wait for more clues from Juanmao's future forays. The meal had a pronounced effect on Juanmao's wellbeing. From an initial inability to control its sudden transformations, Juanmao had gradually become cognizant of the impending sensations. Each time, it learned to avoid unnecessary damage, and the island ceased to sprout new holes. Despite these advances, the transformations became more frequent and intense. To preclude detection of unusual energy fluctuations by patrolling aircraft or satellites in outer space, Fang Zhao instructed Juanmao to head to the sea when a transformation loomed. Neither land nor sea posed a hinderance to Juanmao. In the following month, Juanmao repeatedly ventured out, consuming the remaining boxes aboard the sunken submarine in increments. With the information Juanmao relayed and the clues Fang Zhao accumulated, it seemed almost certain that the submarine was once operated by Organization T and had been sunk by the Yanzhou Navy a century prior. There were rumors that the submarine contained at least eight tons of Grade A energy ore... Numerous attempts had been made to salvage not the submarine, but the fabled eight tons of Grade A energy ore it reportedly held. All such attempts had been in vain, thwarted by hazardous undercurrents, deep-sea predators, and the area's reputation as a magnetic anomaly zone with a propensity for communication failures and diving equipment malfunctions. Chasing a myth was deemed unworthy of the hazards involved. Over time, the collective memory of the sunken submarine and its alleged treasure faded into obscurity. Contemplating the reasons for the Yanzhou Navy's abrupt action back then, Fang Zhao sank into a contemplative silence, his emotions complex and interwoven. Chapter 456: The Signal Issues of a Shabby Little Island Juanmao, without any complex thoughts, devoured eight boxes before searching in vain for more of that kind of container. Fang Zhao had warned the creature against recklessly consuming marine life from the seabed, advising that intimidation sufficed, and snacking was prohibited. Instead, Juanmao gnawed a few more bites from the submarine wreckage, with a particular focus on the energy chamber. Hovering above the sunken submarine, three fully equipped divers approached this myth-enshrouded area of the trench with caution. As they drew closer to the notorious Abyssal Hazard Zone, they encountered communication disruptions but, fortunately, no violent undercurrents. The severe conditions of the ocean floor limited the divers, instilling an oppressive unease and dread of this uncharted domain. Humanity had ventured into space and onto other planets, yet complete mastery of the ocean eluded them; many of its depths remained forbidden zones. 'We're approaching smoothly... Yes, if the map we have is accurate, we should be reaching our destination soon.' 'No signs of danger; it seems we're having a lucky day.' Success on the first attempt was not expected; this was an exploratory mission. Who would willingly embrace such peril unless compelled by necessity? It was perplexing; their three bionic torpedoes seemed to have vanished without a trace. Multiple failed attempts had deepened their wariness of Yanzhou's coastal defenses. The interceptions were so effective that they were downright terrifying—no explosions were ever heard. This led the other sectors of Organization T to cease their bionic torpedo attacks and investigate this interception technology. They questioned whether the bionic technology they had stolen from the military was flawed or if it had been intentionally seeded by the military for them to steal. Their losses in acquiring the bionic technology were significant, leading to the exposure of several bases. It appeared they had fallen into a trap, a conspiracy crafted against them. How cunning indeed! They were forced to alter their original plans as their superiors were displeased with the Yanzhou division; without significant achievements, their status within the organization would plummet, leading to severe consequences. They needed to either stage an attack or accomplish something noteworthy to regain favor. After losing three valuable bionic torpedoes, their funding was mostly cut, and all torpedoes were recalled, halting the initial plan. It seemed they were being left to fend for themselves. The Yanzhou division leader of Organization T was so worried that he was almost bald from stress. He had considered simply bombing a densely populated area in Yanzhou, such as a shopping mall with lax security. But he was concerned about interfering with other plans of the organization, which seemed to be moving forward, though they were kept in the dark. Each division operated independently, making accurate intelligence hard to come by. Furthermore, the Yanzhou Military District was on high alert, likely to intercept them before they could even reach a mall. With no other avenues to prove their worth, they turned to targeting resources, specifically a submarine that had sunk more than a century ago. One of his predecessors had been on that doomed submarine, responsible for transporting energy ore, but they ran afoul of the Yanzhou Navy and couldn't escape. In the end, both the crew and the submarine were sent to the ocean floor. Eight tons of Grade A energy ore were lost to the depths. Eight tons! The hard-won eight tons of Grade A energy ore—all sunk to the bottom! The incident was a colossal blow to the organization; it languished for a long time and became more cautious, entering a period of recuperation. After that disaster, the organization never transported more than two tons at once, and Grade A ore shipments were dispersed, fearing a repeat of the same fate. The original crew involved in the transport was terribly unlucky; the meticulously planned ore shipment intersected with an unexpected Yanzhou Navy drill, allegedly because of an anniversary of a prominent figure from the Era of Annihilation. They received no prior warning; it was so sudden, they were dumbfounded upon hearing the news. Curse the Yanzhou Navy! What was the name of that figure from the Era of Annihilation? Something Fang? Who cared, for the dead were dead. Rumors had it the organization attempted to bomb the Martyrs' Cemetery multiple times, but the tomb guards were too formidable, never once succeeding. The 'T' organization held grudges; since the 'eight-ton' setback a century ago, every leader of the Yanzhou division had been tasked with an order: if possible, to demolish the tombs in the Yanzhou Martyrs' Cemetery, especially the tomb with the Fang surname. In a concealed underground chamber, the Yanzhou division leader of Organization T orchestrated the salvage operations with a grim resolve. He wouldn't have set his sights on this century-old sunken sub if he wasn't desperate. Although the price of Grade A energy ore had decreased due to new discoveries, it still had a value of approximately 14 billion. Communication technology had fortunately advanced; despite a few interruptions, the salvage operation was mostly smooth. As they neared their goal, undisturbed by undercurrents or deep-sea creatures, luck seemed to be on their side! 'Be vigilant for any deep-sea monsters.' 'Understood! But boss, do those legendary creatures truly exist?' one of the divers inquired. 'I have no idea.' 'The area we're approaching is eerily quiet. Maybe at these depths, there simply aren't any fish, let alone leviathans—just stagnant waters. Documentaries might just be filming shadows; it's uncertain if they're the fabled abyssal behemoths. There are rumors that the documentary crew fabricated the footage.' Despite their statements, the divers believed in the existence of deep-sea monsters. All divers involved in the salvage operation heightened their alertness. 'There it is! There's definitely a sunken submarine over there!' The century-old submarine was barely recognizable. 'Prioritize the ore!' commanded a frantic voice over the communicator. 'Roger that, boss!' The divers were equally thrilled by the prospect of such a valuable find. Three diving vessels, one on the mission, the others providing cover. But... 'Boss, no ore detected.' 'The boxes holding the ore are made from a special material, difficult to detect. Get closer and search for those containers. There should be eight or more boxes containing eight tons of ore.' After a while, the mission-diver reported. 'Boss, the submarine is severely damaged, just wreckage left, with jagged edges as if gnawed by a dog.' The voice over the communicator turned frosty. The mood was evidently sour. 'Boss, upon closer inspection, those marks indeed resemble bite marks; there could truly be an abyssal behemoth!!' Fear crept into the diver's voice. If something could mangle a submarine like that, wouldn't they be easy prey? To be honest, they'd rather bomb tombs in Yanzhou than become fish food. 'Find the boxes!' the voice over the communicator sharply commanded. 'Yes, sir!' In the end, the lure of 'eight tons of Grade A ore' overpowered the fear of 'deep-sea monsters.' However... 'Boss, no boxes found! The area is barren; a significant chunk of the submarine is missing! The energy chamber's gone too! Judging by the break... it appears to be freshly gnawed.' '......' Heavy breathing came through the communicator. He must have been seething with anger. Everything seemed to be going wrong lately. 'Keep searching! Look around for any...... Zzz... dropped... Zzzz...' 'Boss, what are you saying? I can't hear you!' The connection was lost. But they weren't panicked; they'd experienced a few communication disruptions during the dive; it would usually resume after a while. As they waited, the connection didn't return, and the diving vessel's control system began malfunctioning, with issues escalating rapidly. The divers inside the three vessels were now deeply alarmed. 'Retreat, retreat! Get to shallower waters, quickly!' The vessels were losing control, responses dwindling rapidly. They'd barely managed to start ascending when the control panel went completely dark, unresponsive. A ringing noise filled their ears, and their consciousness began to blur. —— Elsewhere, Fang Zhao was in a conversation with Nanfeng. Nanfeng was briefing Fang Zhao on the recent activities, a flurry of invitations: variety shows, news interviews, partnership proposals... the decision to accept or decline rested with Fang Zhao. Since Fang Zhao's move to the island, Nanfeng's workload had increased, yet he showed no signs of complaint; in fact, he was quite pleased. Fang Zhao had given him another raise, but that wasn't the most significant benefit; the real advantage was the networking opportunities, aiding his future career path. 'I'll pass on the variety shows, accept one interview with Yanzhou TV, and regarding the collaboration... zzzz...' Nanfeng's words were cut off by static, and soon after, the communication ended. With the connection to Fang Zhao lost, Nanfeng and the others were worried. They planned to visit, but then they received a warning from the Yanzhou Coastal Monitoring Station about a minor earthquake near a trench causing severe magnetic anomalies. They advised avoiding that area and suggested waiting until normalcy returned before venturing out. With no other option, Nanfeng's group could only wait it out. The minor quake wasn't a cause for concern, but the magnetic anomalies could be problematic; who knew if they'd worsen, and what if control systems failed mid-flight? 'Sigh, the city was so nice, why did the boss have to move to that shabby little island?' On the island itself. After the communication blackout, Fang Zhao noticed the familiar flickering of the screens. Stepping out, Fang Zhao gazed toward the sea. A change was taking place, something was happening. Chapter 457: A Dog with Ambition The pervasive disturbance lasted nearly two hours before subsiding. Fang Zhao received a call from Nanfeng, who, along with his companions, was advised not to hurry over. After the call, Fang Zhao didn't immediately return indoors; instead, he remained seated on a seaside rock, perusing online discussions about the recent unusual magnetic disturbances in the ocean. There were no injuries or fatalities reported. Since the epicenter of the magnetic fluctuations was in a region scarcely populated by humans, and the seismic activity was minor, the populace briefly checked the headlines before returning to their daily routines. As Fang Zhao scrolled through the news, he noticed signs of a rapid underwater approach. Standing his ground, Fang Zhao watched the horizon. With a thunderous splash, Curl emerged from the sea, barreling onto the beach. Such was its momentum that it tumbled across the sand several times before skidding to a halt. After shaking off the seawater and pebbles, Curl rushed towards Fang Zhao, its tail wagging furiously. Fang Zhao was relieved to see no visible injuries and asked, "Have you had your fill?" "Absolutely, woof!" Curl responded with an enthusiastic and somewhat proud bark. "What happened out there? You've stirred up quite the frenzy," Fang Zhao remarked, showing Curl some news articles about the incident. Curl's ears drooped upon seeing the reports, but its tail soon wagged in relief, realizing that no significant harm had been done. "Can you transform again?" Fang Zhao inquired. "Sure can!" Curl replied with confidence. Fang Zhao opted not to have Curl transform immediately. Following the recent magnetic anomalies, satellite surveillance was likely to be heightened, so caution was warranted. "Let's head out to sea," Fang Zhao suggested, donning his diving suit and gear before venturing further offshore, both to avoid detection and to protect the island's electronics, which were already in short supply. At a considerable distance from the island and submerged beneath the waves, Fang Zhao permitted Curl to transform. The sunlight pierced through the water, revealing particles floating in the marine expanse. Fish glided gently until a sudden disruption sent them scattering. Beneath the waves, a massive life form materialized, its very presence exuding metallic sharpness and a cold aura. The sunlight gleamed off its surface, casting a spectral blue glow. The interplay of light and shadow created a shifting tableau, wrapping the creature in mystery. It had ears, limbs, a tail, and fangs, just barely recognizable as a dog. Fang Zhao found himself significantly overshadowed by its stature. Given the creature's jaw size, it could easily engulf a human. Fang Zhao observed the unfamiliar figure with astonishment, puzzled at how Curl had transformed from a small pet dog to this metallic behemoth. During the transformation, he even heard a sound reminiscent of machinery accelerating to high speeds. After the transformation stabilized, Fang Zhao activated the underwater communicator. "Quite the imposing figure. Can't you make yourself smaller?" "Don't think so... not at the moment, anyway. Maybe later. But I've got the hang of transforming now! Just can't maintain it for too long," Curl admitted, adding with emphasis, "If I don't switch to my larger form, I won't have to eat as much. Think of the savings on canned dog food!" Content with its newfound mastery over transformation, Curl reverted to its smaller form and paddled around Fang Zhao, seemingly overjoyed at having resolved a significant worry. Fang Zhao had numerous questions for Curl, but the sea was not the place for an in-depth discussion. After returning to the shore and settling indoors, Curl recounted the entire incident to Fang Zhao. "I ran out of metal to chew on. After taking a bite from the submarine, I followed the trench deeper and detected something. I dug it out and ate it straight away." "What did this 'food' look like?" Fang Zhao asked. "A stone, white and round, the size of a soccer ball, and pulsing with an unseen energy," Curl described. Curl couldn't provide more detail; it hadn't paid much attention before succumbing to hunger and consuming the object. Fang Zhao suspected an otherworldly origin for the stone, but since it was now inside Curl, confirming its origins was challenging. The essential aspect was that the stone was beneficial to Curl. "Did you find any more stones like that in the trench?" Fang Zhao questioned. "Nope, just that one," Curl replied, a hint of disappointment in its voice. Had there been more stones, it wouldn't need to buy dog food, freely alternating between forms every day. Unfortunately, such convenient sources of sustenance were scarce. Fang Zhao didn't linger on this topic but instead asked about the causes of the magnetic anomaly and the earthquake. Curl glanced at Fang Zhao with guilty eyes, its head lowered, "I just couldn't hold it in after eating too much." After consuming the submarine's energy core and a stone likely rich in high-energy ore, Curl sensed an impending transformation and found a secluded spot to wait it out. "I didn't mean to complete the transformation. I made sure there were no people or fish nearby. I even tried to keep it under control. I didn't mean to cause any trouble." Curl then remembered something, its eyes brightening. Tail wagging, it looked to Fang Zhao for praise, "After transforming, I found three diving apparatuses close by, all with people still alive inside. So I brought them to the nearest naval vessels! I managed to do it without being detected!" At that moment, Fang Zhao received a notification from a channel he was monitoring. He glanced through the new report. It revealed that the Yanzhou Navy had discovered three diving apparatuses, with all occupants identified as members of the T Organization. The devices' positioning data corresponded to the epicenter of the seismic and magnetic disturbances. The populace quickly pointed fingers at the T Organization as the likely culprits behind the marine disturbances, and the backlash was swift and severe. Fang Zhao looked at Curl, which sat innocently, scratching an itch with its hind leg. After a brief pause, he said, "You've handled this situation quite admirably!" Curl's spirits lifted, and it cozied up to Fang Zhao, its tail wagging, eyes brimming with hopeful expectation. "So, can I... perhaps... get a game console?" "You may," Fang Zhao agreed. Actually, Fang Zhao had prepared for this moment. He retrieved two boxes from the storage area. The first box contained a gaming helmet, which Curl eyed greedily as Fang Zhao pulled out the state-of-the-art device. A genuine gaming helmet—not a misleadingly similar educational device—what a delight! Fang Zhao then opened the second, smaller box. Inside was a personal terminal, styled like an exquisite pocket watch and adorned with puppy motifs. Curl's attention shifted from the gaming console to the sparkling new terminal. This was the terminal it had been yearning for! Curl licked its snout and sidled up to Fang Zhao, wagging its tail in eager anticipation. "Which one do you choose? You can only pick one," Fang Zhao stated. Curl paced back and forth, occasionally pausing to sniff each item as it grappled with the decision, whimpering softly as it deliberated. "Actually, there's another matter," Fang Zhao added. Curl's wide, innocent eyes turned to Fang Zhao, filled with a woeful plea. "Regardless of your choice, it won't last you long," Fang Zhao remarked. "That's not possible!" Curl protested. It was fiercely protective of its belongings. Even the neglected educational device had been diligently placed on the collection shelf, under Fang Zhao's care. Fang Zhao presented the evidence, from Curl's mishap with the floorboards to the latest data from the magnetic anomaly. "Your transformations interfere with electronic devices, frequently leading to their total malfunction." Confronted with incontrovertible evidence, Curl fell silent, its mood deflated. "However," Fang Zhao continued, "you've shown remarkable progress. From uncontrollable morphing to now being able to initiate full-body transformations at will, I'm convinced you'll soon be able to transform without impacting electronic devices." Encouraged by Fang Zhao's belief, Curl's confidence returned. Fang Zhao gave Curl time to make a choice, on the condition that it learned to control its electronic interference. Curl began its new training regimen with determination. A dog must have goals—goals that fuel motivation and provide direction. Without them, life would be a mere cycle of wondering what to eat next, when to sleep, and when to play. Fang Zhao reorganized the storage to accommodate Curl's larger form. Thus, even if Curl accidentally grew too large, it wouldn't risk damaging the house. Every day, Curl practiced swallowing canned dog food, fruits, and bones, each time striving to lessen the electronic disruptions. With improved control over its physical changes, the interference from just its head morphing was less severe, sparing nearby electronics from immediate destruction. Fang Zhao had returned the fitting mirror to the storage area. Occasionally, Curl examined its reflection, familiarizing itself with its transformed appearance. Only by looking in the mirror can one truly see their canine form. After resolving Curl's predicament, Fang Zhao reached out to Nanfeng and the others to replenish supplies. Although the sea was rich with fish and perhaps energy ores on the seabed, a good stock of provisions was essential. Receiving Fang Zhao's list, Nanfeng and his team were baffled. The requested amounts were substantial, with canned dog food making sense for Curl. But with the large quantities of fruit, meat, and compressed biscuits—would Fang Zhao alone be able to consume all that on the island? Reviewing the shopping list, Nanfeng said to Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, "I'm starting to think the boss has secretly taken in a shark... Or maybe some other kind of fish? Considering the cargo this time, he might have more than one aquatic friend." Chapter 458: A Good Dog Fetches a Bone for Its Master Fang Zhao had his secrets, but Nanfeng and the crew dared not probe too deeply—they weren't keen on unemployment. When Nanfeng's team delivered supplies, Curly had ceased its warehouse training, opting instead to lounge on the sofa, engrossed in a television program. Having tallied the items, Nanfeng glanced back and chuckled, 'Hey, Little Curly's watching TV again, huh?' After finishing his tasks, Nanfeng relaxed and joined Curly on the sofa for some shared television viewing. The current show featured a segment about dogs, with an owner proudly showcasing their pet. 'A dog. A plot of land. Quintessential Muzhounese,' Nanfeng commented while sipping water. 'Look at that sheepdog, even bringing gifts to its owner! See how happy the owner is! You know, Little Curly, a dog that fetches bones is considered a good dog. When will you fetch one for your master? He'd be thrilled!' Nanfeng's playful comment was within Curly's grasp—its comprehension of simple words and commands was akin to a child's. It was just light-hearted banter to engage Curly, and he thought no more of it. Curly's ears perked up, glancing at Nanfeng, then back at the program, before settling down again, deep in thought. 'Mr. Zhao, all goods are loaded, and the electronic inventory has been sent to you for confirmation,' Zuo Yu informed Fang Zhao. 'Much appreciated.' 'Should we bring a domestic service robot next time? It can clean, cook, and even chat with you,' Yan Biao suggested. 'Not necessary at the moment,' Fang Zhao declined, shaking his head. Until Curly mastered its disruptive abilities, it was best to minimize electronic devices. Soon after Nanfeng and the others departed, Curly leaped up and barked at Fang Zhao, 'I'll be out for a bit!' 'Going far?' Fang Zhao inquired. 'Not far, just a quick swim nearby.' Curly avoided Fang Zhao's gaze, looking everywhere but directly at him. Fang Zhao raised an eyebrow, recognizing the dog's sly demeanor, but he permitted, 'Go ahead.' 'Woof! I'll be back soon!' With that, Curly dashed off. Fang Zhao was curious about Curly's antics but was interrupted by an incoming call. It was Molang. Since graduating from the Huangyi Advanced Class, Fang Zhao had maintained steady contact with Molang. Fang Zhao stepped inside to take the call, away from the noisy winds by the shore. Molang began by ensuring Fang Zhao hadn't encountered trouble, especially with the recent magnetic anomaly, and suggested hiring more help. With the Yanzhou Navy apprehending terrorists at sea, Molang was concerned for Fang Zhao's safety. Moreover, Molang had an important message for Fang Zhao. 'There's a significant upcoming performance, and you've been selected alongside other esteemed musicians. The organizers are interested in you. Would you consider it?' Recalling a conversation about a major, potentially confidential concert at the graduation ceremony, Fang Zhao asked, 'Who's organizing it?' 'The military. And it's not exactly close by.' 'I'll participate.' Molang's smile broadened, pleased with Fang Zhao's prompt response. 'This performance will be advantageous for your future. Someone will contact you within a week for details, and you can address any questions then. Ensure your affairs here are in order; you have about a month.' 'Understood.' A month seemed sufficient. Molang's intimation was clear—the performance was off-world. The exact star remained unknown to Fang Zhao, but if he were to partake, it wouldn't be a short absence. Hesitant to leave Curly unsupervised yet cognizant of the risks of bringing it along, Fang Zhao would base his decision on Curly's behavior in the coming days. If Curly could avoid tampering with electronics, Fang Zhao might consider bringing it along. Of course, this depended on the organizers' policy regarding pets. Even if pets weren't allowed, as long as Curly could master its abilities discreetly, there was no concern. With the gaming helmet and personal terminal as incentives, Curly's progress was noticeable, confining its interference to the warehouse. Outside that zone, electronics experienced minimal to no disruption. After further discussion with Molang and concluding the call, Fang Zhao checked the time; they'd spoken for over thirty minutes. Curly was still absent. 'Curly?' Fang Zhao stepped outside and called a few times, met with silence. Listening more closely, he discerned digging noises from the nearby seabed rocks. Deciding not to call again, Fang Zhao settled with an electronic book by the shore. He was immersed in 'Su Mu Talks About Dogs'—a legendary tome among the Muzhounese, penned by an old wartime comrade from the Era of Annihilation renowned for his dog-rearing expertise. As Muzhou's leading wartime figure, Su Mu's influence was significant, his opinions and stories gathered into this collection by his followers. 'Su Mu Talks About Dogs' shared insights on dog-rearing, with only part directly from Su Mu. The remainder were extrapolations by those who came after. The Muzhounese's love for dogs was heavily influenced by their forebears. True to his reputation as the Era of Annihilation's leading authority on dog-rearing, Su Mu's book was brimming with insight. Fang Zhao felt a need to absorb knowledge from this experienced comrade, as Curly's transformation into a mechanical dog hadn't altered its canine essence. As he read, Fang Zhao heard Curly's approach from the sea. Curly emerged from the water, not bothering to shake off, trotting with a bone far larger than its head gripped in its jaws. Fang Zhao's eyelids twitched at the sight of the bone. Curly, careful not to damage the bone, carried it gingerly, slowing to a near seal-like balancing act with the bone—several times its own size. Only when directly in front of Fang Zhao did Curly lay down the gargantuan bone. The bone bore tooth marks and stress fractures. Considering this was a dog that could crunch through submarines with ease, the restraint shown was Curly's utmost effort. After setting down the bone, Curly shook out its coat, flinging off the seawater. 'This bone's too fragile! Touch it, and it breaks! Not as hard as the rocks they're found in! I saw these bones in the rocks while digging underwater for fun, but they're not tasty, not filling at all. But it's huge! Absolutely huge!' Curly wagged its tail eagerly, seeking Fang Zhao's approval. It had fetched a bone that far surpassed those by Muzhounese dogs on television! 'Impressive indeed!' Fang Zhao patted Curly's head, then examined the bone in front of him. The bone wasn't intact; Curly had broken off a piece, showing some granular crystals at the break. Part of the bone was still attached to rock, as Curly's digging was anything but delicate. Vascular-like patterns adorned the bone. A fossil! A bone fossil from a gargantuan creature that once roamed the earth millions, perhaps even billions, of years ago! The Era of Annihilation's widespread disasters and century-long wars had ravaged much; survival was primary, everything else secondary. Anything could become collateral in the fight for existence. With the New Era, people's curiosity was rekindled, their fascination with prehistoric giants resurfacing as they renewed their search for relics. Often, they unearthed mere fragments; a complete skeleton could become a museum's crowning glory, boasting material for years. The colossal skeletons displayed in museums were mostly reconstructions based on old-world records and modern technology, not genuine bone fossils! According to fossil trade records over the last twenty years, a tooth from a 70-million-year-old carnivorous dinosaur could match the value of a 100-square-meter apartment in the center of Qi'an City in Yanzhou! 'Curly, you've just ensured your dog food supply for life.' Chapter 459: A Unique Stance in Dominating the Headlines Juanmao couldn't quite grasp the meaning behind Fang Zhao's words. It really didn't find the bone appetizing or satisfying in the least. Nevertheless, it could sense Fang Zhao's fondness for this 'gift.' Eagerly anticipating further praise, Juanmao's ears perked up when Fang Zhao remarked, 'Juanmao, if within a week you can control your transformation without affecting electronic devices within a meter, both the terminal and the gaming helmet are yours.' Stunned by this delightful surprise, Juanmao's doggy face lit up before it energetically wagged its tail, seeking confirmation from Fang Zhao, 'For real?' 'Yes. The countdown starts now.' With that, Juanmao dashed off to the warehouse to practice. After properly arranging the fragment of bone fossil that Juanmao had brought back, Fang Zhao donned his diving suit, geared up, and made his way into the sea to the spot where Juanmao had been digging. The waters surrounding the island weren't very deep, and the seabed bore many traces of Juanmao's digging—since moving here, the dog frequently played by excavating holes near the island. The entrance to the hole where Juanmao unearthed the bone was quite narrow, just big enough for Juanmao itself. Fang Zhao refrained from using tools for digging; instead, he deployed a compact energy wave transmitter. In the absence of professional detection tools, Fang Zhao relied on his auditory skills to infer the condition within the rock strata. Listening intently to the acoustic variations in the rocks, Fang Zhao's brain functioned akin to a tomographic imager, delineating the rudimentary layout of the subsurface. There were numerous interferences within the rock layer, but Fang Zhao had gained an initial understanding. Back on land, Fang Zhao marked several spots on the ground and commenced digging with the equipment he had brought. He wasn't planning to single-handedly extract the fossil of the massive creature buried below with his limited toolkit. His goal was rather to make some preliminary adjustments, shift attention away, and obscure the 'abnormal' traces left by Juanmao's excavation. Over the next few days, Fang Zhao concentrated on this task. The good news was the size of the creature buried below—it was large enough that parts of it could be dug out directly on the island, though it required digging deep. Meanwhile, Juanmao, stimulated by the prospect of a gaming console and a personal terminal, made rapid strides in its training. It didn't need a week; in just five days, it achieved the remarkable feat of reducing the interference radius to within a meter and eagerly approached Fang Zhao to claim its rewards. The gaming console! The personal terminal! How long it had awaited these! Fang Zhao did not disappoint Juanmao. After verifying that Juanmao indeed met the criteria, he handed over both the gaming helmet and the terminal. He even specially refashioned the pocket-watch-style terminal into a dog collar for Juanmao to wear. 'These items are fine for regular use, but keep them at a distance when transforming. Remember to remove the terminal before you change,' Fang Zhao instructed as he fastened the terminal-laden collar around Juanmao. 'Woof!' Juanmao acknowledged. Juanmao didn't need the reminder; it would keep a vigilant watch over its hard-earned rewards. How could it not cherish its first-ever gaming console and personal terminal? After adorning this special collar, Juanmao even scampered off to gaze at its reflection in the warehouse mirror for nearly two hours. While Juanmao was well-acquainted with the gaming helmet, the terminal was new to it. Nevertheless, the operations were straightforward. After perusing the electronic manual Fang Zhao had penned, Juanmao had it all memorized—no longer needing to run up to Fang Zhao to talk, it could now converse through the terminal~ As Juanmao was preoccupied with its mirror session, Fang Zhao reviewed and then deleted the 'Children's Special Terminal User Manual.' Juanmao's swift mastery in just five days was beyond his expectations, showcasing its increasingly firm grasp over its abilities. In the future, Fang Zhao knew he would have to raise the bar. Having addressed Juanmao's affairs, Fang Zhao reached out to Nanfeng and the others, initiating a voice group chat. Alerted by Fang Zhao's group chat notification, Nanfeng and his companions wasted no time, immediately pausing their current tasks to await their boss's commands online. The trio speculated—typically, the boss contacted them once a week, but it had only been five days. Had the island's supplies run out? Unlikely, as the last delivery could sustain him for a month. Had there been an incident? Yet, the boss didn't seem anxious. Or could it be... was he about to unveil his secret to them, like harboring a school of sharks on the island? Suppressing the whirlwind of questions within, they waited for Fang Zhao to speak. 'Juanmao dug up a bone,' Fang Zhao began. Nanfeng exclaimed with excitement, 'Our little Juanmao has learned to bring bones home!' Zuo Yu bypassed Nanfeng's foolish banter, 'Boss, is it a human or an animal bone?' Now, with a sobered expression, Nanfeng asked earnestly, 'Is there a problem?' According to the island purchase agreement, this was no cursed island. Since the last owner acquired it, no accidental deaths had occurred—after all, the prior owner hardly resided there. Beyond basic renovations and construction, nothing had been buried. Might there be some malevolent event hidden, unbeknownst even to the former owner? If it were a mere bird or beast bone, there would be no need to contact them. The three observed Fang Zhao's composed demeanor and patiently awaited the rest of his disclosure. Fang Zhao continued, unperturbed, 'Preliminary identification suggests it's a bone fossil, possibly from some colossal beast that roamed these parts tens of millions, or even a hundred million years ago.' The three: '......' Audible gasps ensued. 'A-a fossil?' Zuo Yu stuttered. Yan Biao, less acquainted with fossils, was seemingly collected... until the excitement hit him. 'Could it be a dinosaur? One of those legendary prehistoric behemoths?!!' As a devout dinosaur aficionado, Yan Biao was itching to see it firsthand. He had cherished dinosaur tales since childhood and had even dreamed of becoming a dinosaur hunter! 'It might not be a dinosaur; it could be a marine reptile,' Fang Zhao clarified. 'To me, all those creatures from that era are dinosaurs!' Yan Biao wasn’t fussed about the exact definition—land-dwelling or marine, they were all dinosaurs to him! Yan Biao even urged Fang Zhao to send additional pictures of the skeletal fossil, 'Such a large bone! The rest buried underground must be from a massive creature! Boss, you can't excavate it alone; I'm coming to help you now!' Nanfeng had remained silent, but a faint rustling was heard. As Zuo Yu and Yan Biao's excitement waned, Nanfeng finally spoke up. 'Boss! I've just reviewed the laws and consulted several leading lawyers. Over the last five centuries, fossils have become tradable goods. Anything unearthed from private islands belongs to the owner! Boss!! You've struck gold!!!' His voice cracked with unbridled excitement, highlighting Nanfeng's sheer enthusiasm. Private islands on the market had been surveyed previously, but early explorations focused on detecting energy ores or threats like the Era of Annihilation virus and other hazards. Fang Zhao's island was no different. Energy ores were off the table—if present, they would've been mined long ago, making the island non-tradeable. Hence, islands bereft of energy ores, once delineated, became tradable commodities, inclusive of their contents. Fossils held immense significance in fields like archaeology, collectible trade, and paleobiology in the New Era—momentous events indeed. If not for the rarity of excavated fossils over time, they wouldn't have gradually faded from public attention. Countless fossils, spanning eons, from insects to plants, have survived through the Cataclysm of the Era of Annihilation. People's affinity for dinosaurs persisted, yet dinosaur fossils remained exceedingly scarce. But who would have imagined that beneath such an obscure little island lay the fossils of ancient creatures from millions of years past? Fossils! Genuine fossils!! In stark contrast to Nanfeng and the others' fervor, Fang Zhao methodically organized the fossil excavation logistics. For such a task, expert fossil excavation teams were essential. Therefore, Fang Zhao photographed the unearthed skeletal fossil and the excavation scene he had meticulously prepared, sharing them on a social networking platform. He openly sought collaboration with expert teams. Post-publication, Fang Zhao's personal terminal was inundated with notifications. Those esteemed researchers somehow always obtained his contact details. Major media outlets, too, contacted him directly for inquiries. On that day, countless individuals were captivated by the news alerts. 'Fossils? Those ancient remnants from millions or even billions of years ago mentioned in textbooks... the fossils of prehistoric rulers? Are they authentic or just sensationalism?' 'Look at the size of these exposed bones—there's more yet to be unearthed, undoubtedly belonging to a giant creature!' 'It's Fang Zhao again? His flair for capturing headlines is truly unparalleled.' 'Did his dog uncover it? I suspect that the bone with an earthy scent that my dog presented me yesterday was also a fossil! But I tossed it into the garbage processor—feels like I've squandered billions!' Fang Zhao was a magnet for attention, and with the dinosaur fossil—a significant event with profound significance in the New Era—this news spread like wildfire across the globe. On Fang Zhao's recently acquired island, his dog—yes, the same Juanmao valued at 300 million—had unearthed a bone from a dinosaur dating back tens of millions of years. The story's magnitude was colossal, instantly stirring traffic across various circles. Simultaneously, numerous expert fossil excavation teams were en route to Fang Zhao's quaint island. Chapter 460: The Bustling Little Island The revelation of Fang Zhao stumbling upon dinosaur fossils transformed his once-quiet island into a hive of activity. Islanders previously eager to sell off their land were now hastily retracting their listings, contracting not just one but several specialized detection teams to inspect their territories and the seafloor around them—again and again. 'Hurry, hurry, hurry! Let's see if my island's hiding any fossils!' Professional fossil detection teams, previously on the brink of disbanding, were now overwhelmed with work. Regrettably, the veteran research teams were all preoccupied with Fang Zhao's island. They were oblivious to other islands, but Fang Zhao's was undeniably hiding a titanic secret! Thus, the desperate island owners had to settle for geological survey teams or other non-academic groups. Some teams, lured by the promise of a hefty reward, rerouted mid-voyage to their employers' islands, hopeful to discover their own treasure troves of fossils. The most despondent was the individual who had sold his island to Fang Zhao. He was intimately familiar with the island's numerous shortcomings: its remoteness, the difficulties in its management, and the steep cost of any potential redevelopment. What a relief it had been to unload such a burden when he sold it. But how much time had elapsed since the sale? Barely half a month? Witnessing the unfolding news, the former owner nearly choked on his frustration, his face contorting with a mix of regret and resentment. But that's the unpredictable nature of business transactions; the winner isn't always clear. Yesterday, he thought he had made a fortune, but today, he was the butt of jokes across the net—everyone was mocking the one who had sold the island to Fang Zhao! The mere thought of the treasures buried beneath made the former owner's heart ache with remorse. Oh, the regret! He should have resurveyed the island back then! Fang Zhao! Sly and cunning! He couldn't believe for a second that Fang Zhao hadn't had inside information! Surely, he must have known about the dinosaur fossils, which would explain his urgency to buy! Indeed, every move Fang Zhao made was calculated! Each action warranted scrutiny, as his next step was always a mystery!! The scale of Fang Zhao's discovery was so significant that it sparked conversations worldwide, even reaching Molang, who ordinarily paid scant attention to the news. Molang had assumed Fang Zhao would be secluded on the island, engrossed in rehearsals, not stirring up another tempest so soon! Anxious, Molang quickly contacted Fang Zhao, urging him not to let the fossil discovery distract from the upcoming performance—a pivotal moment for his career! Of course, Fang Zhao hadn't neglected the important performance; he had been diligently preparing amid the fossil commotion. After soothing the anxious Molang, Fang Zhao noticed Juanmao trotting his way. Juanmao arrived before Fang Zhao, tilting its head skyward as if in contemplation. 'That new collar suits you; it's quite stylish,' Fang Zhao commented. Juanmao responded with a joyful bark as if to suggest, 'Next time, I'll dig for bones somewhere else!' 'Are you fond of bone-hunting?' Fang Zhao inquired. 'Absolutely!' Juanmao replied without hesitation. After all, bone-hunting came with the bonus of game consoles! Look, unearthing just half a bone had already netted it both a game console and a terminal—a splendid haul! Fang Zhao considered for a moment and then nodded: 'Agreed.' He had reconsidered his initial plan to exchange the fossil for dog food. Now that Juanmao could control its transformations and forage in the sea, its consumption was minimal, so long as it didn't remain transformed for long durations. He could comfortably manage its upkeep. Furthermore, the fossil frenzy seemed poised to yield a substantial sum of dog food money, so there was no need to rush the sale. If Juanmao unearthed more bone fossils or other treasures, he would safeguard them for Juanmao. As Su Mu's book advised, 'Value every gift they bring you with sincerity.' Fang Zhao found this wisdom quite sound. Alternatively, why not establish a private museum? Whatever Juanmao gathered could be displayed there. The more Fang Zhao mulled it over, the more appealing the idea became. Indeed, bone-hunting was far more rewarding than idling away the days with games at home. Fang Zhao had briefed Juanmao about the impending arrival of strangers to the island. Unfazed, Juanmao had mastered the control of its interference; it wouldn't accidentally transform and alarm anyone, so it harbored no concerns about exposure, regardless of the number of visitors. Yet, with the influx of additional people on its territory, Juanmao resolved to step up its patrols, diligently scanning both the land and sea. 'Is this terminal waterproof?' Juanmao inquired, a note of concern in its voice. 'It's water-resistant up to 200 meters, so you should be fine for dives within that range,' Fang Zhao reassured. 'Only 200 meters?' Juanmao decided to err on the side of caution and leave the terminal behind during its underwater patrols. Alerted by the sound of an aircraft making its descent, Juanmao glanced over and dashed in that direction. The visitors were Nanfeng and his team. Upon receiving Fang Zhao's call, Nanmao and the group had rushed over. Even before touching down, they noted that the southeast section of the island had been extensively excavated. But this didn't faze them in the slightest! For the sake of unearthing fossils, they would gladly overturn the entire area! Stepping off the plane, Nanfeng spotted Juanmao approaching them. Juanmao lifted its head, showing off the new terminal around its neck. Typically, Nanfeng might have been attentive to such a detail, but his mind, currently fixated on the thought of dinosaur fossils, overlooked Juanmao's subtle cues. Now, Nanfeng's gaze upon Juanmao was akin to that of a gold miner beholding a goose that laid golden eggs. 'Look at our little Juanmao, aware of its significant achievement, strutting proudly! Well done, Juanmao!' Nanfeng exclaimed with unrestrained joy. Juanmao's deep, soulful dog eyes fixed on him. Then, Nanfeng continued, 'Your master's about to strike it rich—that's a bona fide dinosaur we're talking about! And it's a colossus. In an era gone by, a small dog like you would've barely sufficed as dental floss for it!' Juanmao gave them another glance and then ambled away. Nanfeng had too much on his mind to concern himself with the minutiae. After a brief chat with Fang Zhao, along with Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, they excavated two skeletal fossils. Their elation was tangible as they captured the moment with their cameras, flaunting their find across social media and networking platforms. With additional visitors expected, they couldn't afford to dally. Following their fossil excavation and photo ops, they each busied themselves with their tasks. It was conjectured that the fossil beneath Fang Zhao's island might indeed be the first complete prehistoric behemoth fossil over twenty meters long to be unearthed in more than five hundred years of the New Era. Its allure was irresistible, attracting teams from afar. Nonetheless, the island was privately owned, encompassing its immediate vicinity. Any unauthorized intrusion would empower Fang Zhao to act in defense. Nanfeng took on the responsibility of coordinating with the arriving teams. Fang Zhao had enlisted a contingent to maintain order on and around the island. The Yanzhou Navy had also declared their intention to deploy a team to assist. With individuals gathering from each continent, the Yanzhou Navy had to take the matter seriously. Even if Fang Zhao weren't the island owner, they would have engaged in negotiations with any proprietor. Fortunately, Fang Zhao was cooperative. In response to Fang Zhao's invitation for collaborators, professional research teams from all continents eagerly volunteered to partake in the excavation, forgoing any compensation for Fang Zhao's endorsement. Some were so determined to secure their participation that they were prepared to come to blows for it. Besides these teams, the media from all quarters was equally enthusiastic, with Yanzhou TV securing an interview with Fang Zhao. The once serene island was now abuzz with activity as makeshift shelters sprang up. The waters surrounding the island were peppered with vessels of all sizes, and their numbers continued to swell. Those who couldn't land on the island opted to stay aboard their boats! Onlookers keen to catch a glimpse of the action chartered vessels, ensuring not to trespass into the island's private waters. Private aircraft hovered nearby, cautious not to cross into the private territory without permission, merely circling the vicinity, with onlookers using binoculars for a closer view. Online platforms buzzed with live streams of the event. This excavation was immensely significant, igniting robust competition among the teams. Fang Zhao hand-selected twelve teams from the twelve continents, prioritizing research-oriented groups. With the mammoth project divided among them, the teams initially showed reluctance. But they grasped Fang Zhao's logic. If anyone objected, they were free to withdraw. Countless private teams watched eagerly from the sidelines, ready to fill any vacancy at a moment's notice. In spite of their initial reluctance to share the limelight, the twelve teams acceded. No one was willing to forsake such an extraordinary opportunity, and cooperation was the only viable path. Thankfully, Fang Zhao refrained from interference, placing his faith in the professionals to handle their affairs. This occasion also brought Fang Zhao into contact with delegates from the esteemed Bryant family, the most renowned lineage within the global collecting circle, who approached him proactively. Fang Zhao had a faint recollection of the Bryant family; they had delivered substantial contributions to the Huangzhou battlefield during the Era of Annihilation. Presently, they owned Huangzhou's most illustrious private museum—the Bryant Museum. The Bryant Museum was reputable for housing the world's only complete Tyrannosaurus rex skull, as well as a Velociraptor fossil. However, what truly set the Bryant family apart was their lineage. The Bryants, irrespective of gender, possessed striking good looks. Yet, those acquainted with the family were aware that this was a lineage that considered aesthetics trivial. One member had recently risked becoming a wild man in pursuit of a hundred-million-year-old insect amber. This time, leading the Bryant family's delegation was the director of the Bryant Museum himself. Acknowledging the challenges faced by private teams in securing solo participation, he allied with the Huangzhou Museum to form a collaborative excavation team with Fang Zhao. His aim in seeking out Fang Zhao was to propose that once the dinosaur was unearthed, they might lease it annually for two months, with the Bryant and Huangzhou Museums each showcasing it for a month. An outright purchase would have been ideal, and they were willing to pay handsomely, but Fang Zhao had indicated his stance—he was not selling. As a result, they sought the next best alternative. If not a purchase, then a lease would suffice. Fang Zhao, however, wasn't inclined to engage in such discussions just yet: 'We'll talk after it's excavated.' He intended to evaluate each team's performance before making any decisions. Differences among museums in their managerial capabilities and their esteem for collections were apparent, and Fang Zhao had no intention of seeing the excavated dinosaur jeopardized by any museum's negligence. The Bryant Museum director hadn't expected Fang Zhao's immediate accord; his sole aspiration was that Fang Zhao would contemplate them as prospective partners post-excavation, for they had approached him with the utmost sincerity! The Bryants had come with a five-person team, men and women alike, all participating in the excavation. They toiled and perspired, their faces smeared with dirt, their eyes burning with passion. They ignored the cameras trailing them, indifferent to how they were portrayed before a global audience. Their family's modus operandi was already legendary. What did appearances matter? The fossil was the genuine treasure! Once the professional teams were strategically assembled, the excavation's efficiency surged. As the teams diligently unearthed fossils, Fang Zhao found himself besieged by journalists. The reporter from Yanzhou TV, leveraging their local advantage, was the first to interview Fang Zhao. 'How did you initially come upon the fossil? Was it really your dog that discovered it?' the reporter inquired, glancing at the dog seated next to Fang Zhao. 'Yes, it was this one that unearthed the first bone.' The camera shifted to Juanmao, sitting proudly beside Fang Zhao. Juanmao lifted its head, proudly showing off the collar and the terminal emblazoned with a charming dog pattern, ensuring nothing obstructed the view. After a brief focus on the dog, the camera returned to Fang Zhao. The reporter posed a series of inquiries that the public was eager to understand, such as how Juanmao was capable of detecting underground fossils. Fang Zhao clarified, 'After purchasing the island, we initiated some minor construction work. The activity revealed the rock layer underneath, but it went unnoticed by all—it was Juanmao that unearthed that bone.' The watching Nanfeng and his companions exchanged incredulous glances, their silence speaking volumes. As for the reporter's query regarding Fang Zhao's reason for acquiring this island, he simply stated that he sought a serene retreat, undisturbed, and the fossil discovery was a stroke of good luck. Good luck? Many were skeptical. Haha, 'good luck' indeed! Was his extraordinary perception still a well-guarded secret?! Regardless of the reporter's internal commentary, they maintained a facade of understanding, complementing the well-behaved Juanmao at Fang Zhao's side. Juanmao, reveling in the praise, was visibly thrilled! After the interview concluded, it patrolled its domain, and when the broadcast aired, it positioned itself in front of the television. As Yanzhou's official broadcaster, the news segment was presented with a serious tone. The interview footage that aired remained a faithful representation of Fang Zhao's statements, unaltered by any deceptive editing. Juanmao's screen time lasted several seconds. In an era where even the most trivial news was transmitted in ultra-high definition, the official TV channel's visuals were clear enough for viewers to scrutinize the dog. The terminal on the dog collar was deliberately pixelated by the TV station, presumably to avoid suggesting any form of advertisement. Juanmao, who had been steadfastly observing the TV: '......' Chapter 461: The Guard Dog Juanmao was utterly disheartened after his new collar failed to impress, leaving him listlessly deflated. Upon his return from a visit to the excavation team, Fang Zhao discovered Nanfeng anxiously trying to engage with Juanmao, who was trudging with a drooping head. Spotting Fang Zhao, Nanfeng hurriedly reported Juanmao’s unusual demeanor. "Boss Fang, is Juanmao upset by his tummy, or perhaps the throng of strangers invading the island? Could he be sick? He was fine just a short while ago." Fang Zhao took the leash, gesturing for Nanfeng to proceed with his tasks, indicating he would tend to Juanmao. Leading Juanmao inside, Fang Zhao had an inkling about the cause of his dejection. "Juanmao, I've got a task for you," Fang Zhao said, knowing that a mission could often sideline other worries. Juanmao looked up at Fang Zhao. "I've commissioned a Grand Warehouse on the southeast side of the island to house the bone fossils we've unearthed. I need you to vigilantly keep watch and ensure no one pilfers them." The prehistoric behemoth buried beneath the island was colossal, and the excavation was a delicate endeavor to preserve the fossils. Despite the dedication of twelve teams, the task was far from completion. Fang Zhao had erected a substantial temporary Grand Warehouse on the southeast side, which served as a repository for the fossils and the excavation teams' tools and supplies, accentuated by a makeshift resting area. Though an electronic security system was installed, Fang Zhao placed greater trust in Juanmao's vigilant capabilities, also hoping to divert his attention from his recent slump. With the island abuzz with visitors, Juanmao’s movements were restricted, necessitating a leash. Now, Fang Zhao decided to grant him the liberty to patrol within the Grand Warehouse. The space might be confined, but it signified freedom from the leash. "Perform well, and I'll take you on an off-planet adventure," Fang Zhao offered as an incentive. Juanmao's eyes sparkled with renewed vigor, instantly invigorated by the promise. He was aware that Fang Zhao was soon to depart for a performance, potentially without him. However, buoyed by Fang Zhao's suggestion, elation took hold. Thus, as Nanfeng concluded a phone call and turned back, he witnessed Juanmao sprint into the Grand Warehouse, now a whirlwind of enthusiasm. "What's this about?" Nanfeng inquired, befuddled, as he regarded Fang Zhao. "He’s assuming the role of warehouse guardian," Fang Zhao explained. He notified the staff and appended a sign next to the "Notice" at the entrance: Danger! No Unauthorized Entry!! The staff mulled over the ominous sign, especially the three exclamation points. Danger? What sort of peril could possibly lurk here? Such strong language seemed excessive. They had been laboring there for two days, oblivious to any peril. Only a dog had been introduced to the scene. "Surely, the island owner's dog won't gnaw on the bones?" one voiced a concern. "The elevated ones are beyond his reach." "Should any mishap occur, Fang Zhao will surely assume responsibility." Despite the employees’ hesitation to welcome a pet dog into this professional setting, Fang Zhao’s directive as the island owner was absolute. And so, they acquiesced. Inside the Grand Warehouse, Juanmao had already embarked on his new duty. Keen to secure a journey to the stars with Fang Zhao, he scrutinized the Grand Warehouse with utmost care. He canvassed every nook, vigilant against even the smallest of intruders. After completing his rounds, Juanmao stationed himself by the Grand Warehouse door, overseeing the comings and goings of the staff without causing a disturbance, resolutely embodying the spirit of a watchful guard dog. Elsewhere, a discreet yacht lay at anchor a fair distance from the island, blending seamlessly with the other vessels congregated for the spectacle. This one was unremarkable. "We've infiltrated the island undetected, perfectly blending in! The state-of-the-art bionic technology is exceptional. The exorbitant sum we expended on the black market was a worthy investment; the vendor's claims were genuine!" "As per the manual, this represents the pinnacle of contemporary bionic technology, adept at circumventing most civilian security measures. Its efficacy, although costly, is unparalleled, and its longevity remains an enigma. A sizable portion of our resources has been committed to this endeavor. It's limited to transporting items under twenty kilograms, but its capabilities are not to be underestimated." "I harbor no greed; merely one small bone fragment will suffice. Given the enormity of the skeleton, the absence of a few minor pieces will surely go unnoticed." "Likewise, a single bone piece will fulfill my ambitions." "We will equitably divide the proceeds from the sale!" "The Grand Warehouse is under nighttime surveillance; we must tread with caution." "Fear not, I've enhanced it with dissolving anesthetic needles, potent enough to incapacitate a pachyderm and designed to be undetectable." "Fang Zhao's impetuousness in announcing the discovery without thorough preparations has played to our advantage. On this isolated isle, entirely surrounded by seas and swarming with visitors, the security personnel are overwhelmed. Moreover, his overreliance on these so-called intelligent security systems betrays his youth and naivety. He fails to appreciate the rapid obsolescence inherent in electronic devices." "Shall we postpone our endeavor until nightfall?" "Indeed, the veil of darkness will be our ally." As the daylight waned and the shroud of night enveloped the island, the day's toil-worn excavation teams retreated to their abodes, promptly succumbing to slumber. The novelty of their arrival had once kept them awake, but by the third evening, the taxing nature of their work took its toll. A lapse in concentration could jeopardize the integrity of the fossils, and they were reluctant to entrust such a delicate task to machines. Thus, they seized the twilight hours to rest and rejuvenate. At this rate, within another two days, the entirety of the leviathan that lay interred beneath the island would be exposed. They were on the brink of laying eyes on the skeleton of a prehistoric titan that had remained ensconced in the earth for eons! The excavation crew drifted into sleep with smiles etched on their faces, blissfully unaware of the sinister figures that lurked within the darkness. The nocturnal quietude of the island was a siren call for insects of the night. A small crawler emerged from the underbrush, navigating its way toward the Grand Warehouse. Upon the ocean's surface, away from the diminutive island, a cadre of individuals aboard a nondescript yacht were fixated on their surveillance display. The perspective was that of the crawler's, now in proximity to the Grand Warehouse, on the cusp of infiltrating through a window crevice. Their gaze remained unblinking, nearly jubilant at the prospect of entry, when an abrupt 'Zzzt—' disrupted the connection. "What has transpired?" "Has it been detected?" "Could the civilian security system have undergone an upgrade already?" "It seems implausible. The latest iteration of bionic technology has scarcely been unveiled; an upgrade would be unprecedented at this juncture. We have never witnessed such swift advancements." "Perhaps the Grand Warehouse's security apparatus was a collaborative installation between Fang Zhao's personal guard and a security enterprise. Is it possible they employed military-grade equipment?" An oppressive silence ensued. That device represented a substantial investment of their fortunes. Around the island, aboard a flotilla of nondescript craft, parallel scenarios unfolded. The costly micro detectors, surreptitious devices, and ingenious thievery contraptions they had procured through clandestine channels, all purporting to embody the zenith of bionic technology, embarked on their missions only to vanish without a trace. Each one ceased transmission upon breaching the Grand Warehouse, some obliterated as if crushed, others inexplicably dematerialized. Whether by air, land, or subterranean intrusion, the fate was unanimous. Forget the notion of pilfering bones; they failed even to execute a covert surveillance operation! They surreptitiously sought information on the security firm that collaborated with Fang Zhao. The intelligence they garnered was met with incredulity. It must be a ruse, a deception contrived to mislead. Such cunning! Indeed, the more formidable the figure, the more enigmatic their secrets; Fang Zhao surely harbored an ace up his sleeve! Could it be that Fang Zhao had indeed enlisted military intervention? Within the Grand Warehouse, on the island's southeastern frontier, Juanmao, the guardian canine par excellence, gingerly clasped a severely contorted crawler in his maw, depositing it into a receptacle in the corner. The fifteenth specimen secured! Amassing twenty would warrant an additional foray into the gaming console—Juanmao issued a triumphant howl in anticipation! Chapter 462: Apex Predator The security system at the warehouse was meticulously managed by Zuo Yu and Yan Biao, who alternated shifts to ensure constant vigilance. Juanmao's actions were under their watchful eye, as they monitored every movement. Aware of the cameras and understanding this as another of Fang Zhao's quirky tests, Juanmao took it seriously. Fang Zhao had put in considerable effort to prevent Juanmao from developing a bad habit of eating anything in sight, and this was a moment of truth to see if those efforts had paid off. Juanmao, ever the eager participant, knew it could effortlessly consume these small insects without transforming, and the act would likely escape the cameras' notice. It contemplated catching a few for amusement. Yet, with the promise of extra gaming time for every twenty insects captured, Juanmao meticulously placed each catch into the box provided by Fang Zhao, guarding it jealously against potential thieves. Yan Biao, on duty in the surveillance room that night, couldn't help but be amused. "Truly a dog with an inspector's past!" He had noticed an unusual increase in insect activity at the warehouse, despite recent pest control treatments. Watching Juanmao catch each insect and place it into the box—especially when one sparked upon being stepped on—Yan Biao sensed something amiss and immediately reached out to Fang Zhao. Fang Zhao had given strict instructions: only Yan Biao and Zuo Yu were to guard the warehouse; no one else was to approach the surveillance room. Any leave requests were to be directed to Fang Zhao, with Nanfeng or Fang Zhao himself taking over as needed. Should any unusual events occur, they were to inform Fang Zhao immediately and refrain from leaking any information. Yan Biao and Zuo Yu believed Fang Zhao's orders stemmed from his high regard for the fossil, not finding anything unusual in his commands. However, after reporting the anomaly to Fang Zhao, he was simply told to monitor the situation and not worry about the creatures Juanmao captured. Yan Biao also sought insights from his retired military comrades, learning of the black market's surge in bionic device sales following Fang Zhao's fossil news. This had led to a spike in sales, and warnings from fellow soldiers. It became clear that the security system was no match for Juanmao's vigilance. None of the release devices had come close to the dinosaur fossil! Observing Juanmao toss what appeared to be an ordinary weed into the box, Yan Biao sighed, realizing the security system required an upgrade. If everything depended on Juanmao, he would be utterly redundant. Over the next two days, various cleverly disguised objects, resembling insects and plants, attempted to infiltrate the warehouse. However, none succeeded in stealing any skeletal fossils, nor did any unauthorized photos surface. There were attempts to bribe staff members, but Fang Zhao's team, composed of seasoned individuals with strict discipline, quickly rooted out any traitors before Fang Zhao had to step in. Their contract with Fang Zhao was clear: any team with an offending member would be held accountable, dismissed from the project, and faced with hefty penalties. As a result, the teams were even more proactive in weeding out moles than Fang Zhao. That day, an excavation worker feeling under the weather was instructed by the lead professor to rest in the warehouse's break room. The worker, carrying his toolbox, was intercepted by Juanmao as he entered the warehouse. "Woof, woof, woof!" Juanmao barked authoritatively. The warehouse guards quickly converged. Other workers, busy with their tasks, turned their attention to the unfolding scene. The worker with the toolbox turned pale—not from guilt but from shock. The guards took him aside and opened the toolbox that Juanmao had fixated on. Juanmao inspected the tools and rested its paw on a geological hammer. The worker's expression changed abruptly: "This isn't my hammer! Mine has my name etched on it! This one is unmarked!" He urgently contacted his professor, "Professor! Someone has tampered with my toolbox!" Eager to protect his top student and preserve his team's role in the project, the lead professor acted swiftly and cooperated with the investigation, which had its own protocols. Promptly, the team members proved their innocence and helped apprehend three suspects. This incident heightened the vigilance of the other excavation teams. Their toolboxes became sacrosanct, accessible to none but themselves. Their clothing was inspected daily, and they maintained a heightened level of suspicion toward anyone who approached. Previously, they had welcomed media attention. Now, they were the ones media pursued relentlessly. If not for the toolbox incident, they might have remained aloof, but the day's events had sobered them, sharpening their focus. The excavation was nearing completion, and the skeletal fossils were almost fully unearthed. Being expelled from the project now would be a monumental regret. They could not afford to stumble at such a pivotal moment. Soon, other island inhabitants noticed a change. The excavation teams, once jovial and relaxed during their work, now operated with an air of solemnity. Regardless of the workload, there was always a team member assigned to keep watch. Thanks to the collective efforts of the twelve teams, all skeletal fossils buried beneath the island were finally uncovered in their entirety. The skeletons were remarkably intact, necessitating few restorations. Following the computer-simulated reconstruction, they mounted the fossils. As the mounting concluded, they gazed up at the nearly fifty-meter-long skeleton. It was as if they had traveled through time to behold the maritime sovereign from seventy million years ago. A young worker beside them was speechless, overwhelmed with emotion. Several senior professors who directed the mounting were moved to tears. "I never thought... I would witness the apex marine predator from seventy million years ago with my own eyes!" After an hour of continuous discussion around the newly unearthed colossus, they faced a new challenge. "It deserves a name," declared a leading professor. They scoured a vast array of records, finding no match, confirming they had discovered an unknown species that warranted a name. The predicament was that the find had not been made by a single team but by several, and the skeleton belonged to the island's owner. "Should we adhere to the naming conventions?" "Do we have the right to name it?" "Fang Zhao, what about the naming..." "You decide," Fang Zhao replied with a playful shrug. The professors had been prepared to persuade Fang Zhao if he seemed indifferent to the naming, but they were taken aback when he entrusted them with the task. In the old century, fossils of ancient vertebrates with scientific value were considered state property. The new-century Cultural Relics Management Law had changed, but Fang Zhao was not particularly attached to these relics. If not for Juanmao, Fang Zhao might have even donated the skeleton to various museums. Fang Zhao glanced at Juanmao, who yawned beside the box of reptiles. Aside from games and food, the dog seemed uninterested in anything else. Hearing Fang Zhao delegate the naming to them, an elderly professor trembled with excitement, quickly calmed by an assistant who administered a couple of pills. The twelve excavation teams engaged in a vigorous debate over the name. Ultimately, they christened the prehistoric apex marine predator 'Sea Emperor Dragon'. It was the largest skeletal fossil unearthed to date, and its formidable teeth alone indicated a carnivorous diet. It was the undisputed marine overlord of its era, and the name 'Emperor' was fitting. The next step was the official record. The twelve teams engaged in yet another heated debate. Strictly speaking, the newly discovered Sea Emperor Dragon should be classified among marine reptiles rather than dinosaurs. However, contemporary culture has become accustomed to referring to such iconic creatures from that era as dinosaurs. Many new-century scholars have advocated for a reclassification. There were vast gaps in paleobiology research in the new century, and the limited data from the old century were used more as references than as absolutes. They trusted only in their own research. Once the record was established, a paleobiology professor grasped Fang Zhao's hand: "It seems you have a connection with dinosaurs. Would you consider joining us in paleobiology research?" Fang Zhao paused briefly, a hint of amusement in his response: "...No, thank you." Their invitation masked an ulterior motive—the Sea Emperor Dragon's skeleton. In the following days, news of the 'Sea Emperor Dragon' dominated online platforms. From archaeology to entertainment, from dinosaur enthusiasts to early childhood educators, from life sciences to geology—the Sea Emperor Dragon was the talk of the town. The discovery resonated deeply with the public: 'Our home planet once hosted such titanic creatures, rivaling the extraterrestrial beings unveiled to us.' The internet buzzed with wild stories and imaginative accounts, as if they had witnessed these ancient behemoths firsthand. 'Those previously discovered 'marine overlords' now seem like mere underlings.' 'Unmatched! Absolutely unmatched!' 'Marine overlord-level predator! Eagerly anticipating a Sea Emperor Dragon movie!' 'Will the Sea Emperor Dragon skeleton ever be on public display?' 'That skeleton is far too precious; it's unlikely to be open to the public.' 'I'd be satisfied with a model; when will the Sea Emperor Dragon models be released?' 'That decision likely rests with Fang Zhao.' 'I declare that the only one who can stand upon the Sea Emperor Dragon's head is Fang Zhao!' '...Eh?' 'Actually, that makes sense. Fang Zhao does reside above the Sea Emperor Dragon's resting place, so literally speaking, he does stand on its head.' A new topic quickly trended. #FangZhao, The Man Who Stands on the Head of the Sea Emperor Dragon# Nanfeng, perusing the social networking platform and noting the trending topic, laughed heartily. The Sea Emperor Dragon fossil had brought in a significant sum in rental fees. 'Boss, you've truly struck gold this time! With that skeleton, you could easily rejoin the billionaires' club.' 'I don't plan to sell,' Fang Zhao stated decisively. Nanfeng was initially taken aback, then realized: 'Of course! Such a unique and unparalleled treasure should be treasured, not hastily sold off.' 'I'm considering opening a collectors' museum. In addition to the Sea Emperor Dragon, we may gradually introduce more exhibits over time,' Fang Zhao elaborated. 'A collectors' museum?' Nanfeng echoed, surprised again, but then it dawned on him: Trust the boss to think long-term. By not selling the skeletal fossil right away and instead opening his own museum, Fang Zhao could capitalize on merchandise sales! The Sea Emperor Dragon is the largest creature unearthed on our planet to date. While other planets might have larger beings, for paleobiology researchers, there's still so much to explore about our planet's past life. Why bother with extraterrestrial life? Besides, the emotional connection people have with our planet is irreplaceable. It's the cradle of human history, shared by all—a shared history that cannot be replaced by any extraterrestrial discovery. Convinced he had grasped Fang Zhao's strategy, Nanfeng felt a surge of satisfaction. The boss still had a keen investment acumen. Nanfeng looked at the research team's computer-simulated interpretations of the Sea Emperor Dragon's possible appearances and marveled: 'An apex marine predator indeed—each rendition exudes a ferocious aura. It's fortunate they're long extinct.' 'One can only imagine what cosmic apex predators might look like.' Nanfeng's imagination soared: 'They must have been impressively formidable.' Fang Zhao glanced at Juanmao, who diligently counted the reptiles in the box, and commented: 'Appearances can be deceiving. Some creatures may look endearing but have a lethal potency.' Nanfeng chuckled: 'Haha, boss, what a sense of humor you have!' Fang Zhao gave him a knowing look: '...You'll understand in time.' Nanfeng nodded outwardly in agreement, while inwardly he laughed once more. Alright then, you're the boss, and whatever you say goes. Even if you claim Juanmao is an apex predator, I'm all in! Chapter 463: Impossible to Be Outdone by a Dog The media landscape was saturated with coverage of the Sea Emperor Dragon, and a wave of paleontological research papers were hastily published, upending numerous assumptions once considered unassailable in documentaries. A student specializing in ancient vertebrates quipped during a media interview, 'Our professors always cautioned us—documentaries and archaeological findings are perpetually subject to revision with new evidence. The Sea Emperor Dragon's discovery is profoundly significant for us. We're confident that more astonishing surprises await in the many unknowns yet to be explored.' Fang Zhao's island discovery shifted the collective gaze from land to the distant islands and the vast sea. In those seldom-trodden regions, myriad prehistoric beings, which had fortuitously evaded the calamity of the Era of Annihilation, likely remain buried. Island values are ascending! The surge isn't dramatic, but a marked increase in island acquisition interest has arrested the downturn in prices, propelling a steady climb. A dedicated paleontology aficionado even invested in an island, establishing a private research facility and launching an expedition team to probe the ocean's subterranean layers. Post-excavation, Fang Zhao entered into partnerships with the Bryant Museum and the Huangzhou Museum. The Sea Emperor Dragon will be exhibited in Huangzhou over the ensuing months, inciting a ticket-buying mania—the online allocation sells out instantaneously, with the entirety of the two-month preorder inventory claimed in a bout of collective frenzy. Regarding the Yanzhou Museum... the curator is verging on despair. Despite Fang Zhao's Yanzhou origins, their facility is simply not equipped to manage the influx of attention that the Sea Emperor Dragon's presence warrants. Yet, with a two-month lead time, they're resolute in their ambition to rise to the occasion, reputational stakes at a premium. With the Sea Emperor Dragon's relocation, the spotlight subsided, and tranquility returned to Fang Zhao's island. Fang Zhao harbors aspirations to erect a museum, although the island is less than ideal. His sporadic presence and the risk of theft by miscreants pose significant concerns. Lacking a suitable site and sufficient funds, the museum initiative is on hiatus. While the Sea Emperor Dragon lease has generated commercial interest, Fang Zhao's sights are set on the imminent extraterrestrial performance. He has finally received an invitation from the host entity. It was only then that Fang Zhao uncovered the identity of the organizers concealed by Molang: Hidden Star, the preeminent among the triad of major off-world military bastions. Details are scant, and even official military dispatches rarely chronicle Hidden Star's narratives. Nevertheless, Hidden Star is universally acclaimed for its preeminent scientific research capabilities. '...These are the main points of consideration, but I'll forward a detailed electronic dossier. The schedule is fixed, and our envoy will liaise with you...' The organizer briefed Fang Zhao on the critical issues and then asked, 'Any further inquiries?' 'Is it permissible to bring a dog?' Fang Zhao inquired. A momentary silence ensued on the line, followed by an unexpected inflection in the usually unemotional voice, 'Are you referring to Curl? It's permitted, though this doesn't extend to other dogs. Naturally, should your schedule on Hidden Star prevent you from attending to your pet, we can offer assistance; it might even benefit from interacting with our Airport Smuggling Interdiction Team.' Fang Zhao wasn't taken aback by their knowledge of Curl. The dog had established its reputation among various military districts and departments, achieving hero status. All smuggling interdiction divisions coveted Curl. Hidden Star's airport had previously contemplated recruiting Curl but demurred upon recognizing Fang Zhao's reluctance to part with the dog. Their fascination with Fang Zhao's auditory prowess was also evident, yet his steadfast dedication to musical artistry precluded any recruitment endeavors. After the dialogue with Hidden Star's organizer concluded, Fang Zhao was furnished with an electronic guide detailing protocol for attendants and accompanying animals. He communicated the development to Nanfeng and the others, deliberately omitting Hidden Star's identity. Their eagerness to accompany him was unanimous. Nanfeng, ever perceptive, deduced that their destination must be of significant stature; his resolve to not be excluded was unwavering! Upon being apprised of Fang Zhao's intention to bring Curl, Nanfeng voiced concerns: 'Wasn't the location you mentioned known for stringent regulations? Are dogs really allowed?' Ignorant of the venue's specifics, the prospect of a stringent site sanctioning the presence of pets struck him as peculiar. Fang Zhao refrained from elaborating, simply stating, 'I'll dispatch the application link. Ensure Curl's application is included when you submit yours.' 'Understood, boss!' Nanfeng sprang into action, rallying Yan Biao and Zuo Yu to lodge their applications. Their screening was significantly more exacting, commencing with a political background check. Any public indiscretion or record tarnish could readily precipitate a veto. 'Political screening for pets as well?' Nanfeng pondered, bemused, yet he adhered to Fang Zhao's instructions and applied for Curl. A mere minute later, Curl's political clearance was affirmed. Nanfeng: '...' Has the vetting of pets accelerated to such an extent? An hour afterward, Yan Biao's authorization came through. Half an hour beyond that, Zuo Yu's was validated. Nanfeng, however... By the time dinner arrived, his status remained uncertain. 'Why did your approvals materialize so swiftly? Could it be... that I... I'm not...', Nanfeng stammered, his complexion ghostly. Yan Biao offered solace, 'It's likely due to your extended tenure in the entertainment sector. They're exercising additional scrutiny.' Nanfeng's heart hung heavy. His tenure in the Huangzhou Entertainment Circle had been characterized by nonchalance, yet he'd never transgressed in word or deed! A sleepless night ensued, but the subsequent day's endorsement dispelled his anxieties. 'All set! Proceeding to the subsequent phase of vetting!' The next series of evaluations proceeded without incident, culminating in a mandatory physical examination at a designated center within the next seven workdays. Fang Zhao accompanied them on the journey. 'Boss, you've already navigated all the hurdles. There's no need for you to attend; I've got this under control,' Nanfeng reassured him, confident in his ability to navigate the physical examination process. 'I'll come to observe,' Fang Zhao replied. Upon reaching the specified facility, the trio and their canine companion each entered disparate testing chambers. Fang Zhao claimed a bench and immersed himself in a book. Thirty minutes later, Curl emerged, having breezily passed the evaluation. Two hours passed before Yan Biao exited his chamber, exuding a sense of pride. His tenure on Baiji Star had conferred upon him an enduring advantage! He didn't attach much importance to Curl's swift completion; the assessment criteria for pets were presumably less stringent. Curl yawned. By the time Zuo Yu reappeared, Curl had yawned once more, assuming a comfortable posture to resume its repose. As Nanfeng finally made his exit, Curl was already slumbering at Fang Zhao's feet. Emerging with a sensation of vertigo and mild nausea, Nanfeng remarked, 'That assessment was rigorous; they've set the bar for physical fitness remarkably high.' The intensive fitness assessment indicated that their forthcoming venue would present a formidable challenge. Zuo Yu ribbed him, 'Nanfeng, weren't you once a Baiji Star serviceman? You've regressed! Time to intensify your training, starting tomorrow!' Yan Biao concurred, 'Indeed, you need to beef up your training regimen. Being bested by a dog? How's that for a wake-up call?' Nanfeng cast a glance at the comfortably seated Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, then at the dozing Curl, his reality blurring. 'No... it's inconceivable... I can't have been outpaced by Curl!' Had his time away from the service truly reduced him to such a state? Chapter 464: Departure Once his applications had been approved, Fang Zhao set aside all subsequent collaborative invitations, even missing the grand opening of the Sea Emperor Dragon exhibition at the Huangzhou Museum. On the debut day of the Sea Emperor Dragon, an excited crowd had formed a lengthy line outside the Huangzhou Museum. Their anticipation had painted their faces with excitement, and not even the slow-moving security checks could quell their enthusiasm. Next to the queue, vendors sold dinosaur-themed toys and models, with many in the line purchasing these items to pass the time. Inside, journalists who had not been to Fang Zhao's island were vigorously photographing the Sea Emperor Dragon exhibit. Lacking their own photos, they had no choice but to share reports from other outlets. The directors of the Huangzhou and Bryant Museums were unable to hide their smiles during the premiere. However, once back in their offices, their smiles faded at the sight of several bionic mechanical reptiles lying on their desks. Relief washed over the director of the Bryant Museum, 'Thank goodness for Fang Zhao's foresight to upgrade our security, or we would have suffered losses.' When Fang Zhao had delivered the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil, he had warned them about the potential threat posed by bionic technology and recommended they enhance their security systems. The directors took Fang Zhao's advice to heart, valuing the importance of the Sea Emperor Dragon's first exhibition, and had their museums' security systems upgraded before the fossil was even transferred. At the same time, those who had set their sights on the Sea Emperor Dragon were furious. 'So we couldn't get into Fang Zhao's warehouse—likely due to military-grade securities—but not being able to break into either the Huangzhou or Bryant Museums? This only means one thing: our tech is outdated!' 'I can't believe I spent a fortune on what's now considered antique technology!' 'We've been duped!' The bionic mechanical tech, once touted as the latest breakthrough, turned out to be a dud. Pouring money into now-obsolete technology was akin to throwing it into a void. Although the black market is known for being expensive, it had never cheated them like this before! Feeling thoroughly deceived, some buyers sought refunds from the elusive seller. In a fit of rage, they put out a bounty for the seller and warned others: 'Beware of knock-offs in the black market!' Within Organization T, the member responsible for the bionic tech sales was on the run. After realizing that the bionic tech they had stolen was ineffective against Yanzhou's sea defenses, the members of Organization T looked to capitalize on the hype generated by the discovery of the fossil. They produced a line of bionic mechanical creatures and made a fortune on the black market! However, it wasn't long before their customers started demanding refunds. To the members of Organization T, it became clear that 'bionic technology' was a conspiracy against them! It was one thing for military applications to render their technology useless, but even civilian security systems had upgraded to anti-bionic tech versions? They had expended so much effort only to steal outdated technology! Fang Zhao, the man behind their misfortunes, had inadvertently struck another blow to Organization T. Upon discovering the bionic creatures on his island, Fang Zhao reported the matter to the authorities. Following Huangzhou and Bryant Museums, more critical locations were scheduled to upgrade their security systems against bionic technology. However, Fang Zhao had no time to concern himself with these security upgrades. He was busy packing for his trip to Hidden Star. This time, his departure would be for an extended period, and he had informed Elder Fang and Madam Fang. He didn’t go into detail, simply noting that he had important matters to attend to and that it might be difficult to get in touch with him. If they couldn't reach him, he reassured the elders not to worry. 'Boss, are we comfortable leaving Juanmao, worth eighty million, here?' Nanfeng queried. 'Yes,' replied Fang Zhao, glancing at the aquarium. He had decided to keep Juanmao at his seaside residence rather than on the island. In case of any incidents, the vigilant property management team could respond promptly. 'Alright.' Although Nanfeng still had his reservations, he didn’t question further and continued with his update, 'The construction team on the island is making good progress. Everything should be restored by the time we return.' After the excavation for the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil, the island had undergone a series of changes—excavations, constructions, and demolitions. Now, a team was working to repair and rebuild, filling in the great pit and restoring other damaged areas. With his belongings packed, Fang Zhao received a call from the military district's personnel about their arrival. The aircraft had landed on the apron. Two soldiers came forward to verify their identities. Fang Zhao, an assistant, two bodyguards, and Juanmao. Nanfeng noticed that one of the soldiers gave Juanmao an extended look, as if ensuring that this was indeed the same dog listed on the application. After confirming the identities of the four humans and one dog and inspecting the luggage, they were all escorted onto the aircraft, headed towards the Yanzhou Military District. There, Fang Zhao would join other invitees from Yanzhou before they all traveled to the Outer Spaceport. Nanfeng's team, comprised of individuals with backgrounds in special forces and alien garrisons, stood tall and proud. They could not afford to let Fang Zhao down. Once on board the aircraft, the soldiers gave a cursory glance at the trio before focusing their attention on Fang Zhao and Juanmao. The orders for the soldiers were clear: ensure the well-being of Fang Zhao and his dog. Nanfeng and his team only required a cursory identity check. In reality, the soldiers weren’t there solely for Fang Zhao; they were the closest unit available after completing another mission and had been reassigned to this task. The energy chamber, still locked, was filled with a crate of energy ore and other cargo destined for the military district—a simple collection job. Juanmao lay quietly at Fang Zhao's feet, its glossy eyes taking in the surroundings. It licked its nose and looked up at Fang Zhao, letting out a soft whine. Fang Zhao glanced at it and patted its head. Juanmao settled down again but continued to lick its nose and lips from time to time. Seeing this, one of the soldiers asked, 'Is it thirsty?' 'Yes, it's thirsty. Nanfeng, the water bowl, please,' Fang Zhao said calmly. 'Right away!' Nanfeng retrieved the bowl and passed it over. Yan Biao watched the scene, thinking to himself, 'Pets sure are pampered these days.' Fang Zhao took the bowl and filled it with water handed to him by the soldier. After thanking him, he placed the bowl in front of Juanmao and tapped its head as a warning. Ever since Juanmao had acquired the ability to transform, its diet—and appetite—had expanded. It had even been allowed to forage the previous day. Thirsty? Not exactly. It was merely craving something. Of course, Fang Zhao would not disclose the true reason. It was not something he could admit openly. How could he explain? That Juanmao was salivating over the aircraft's energy chamber? Fang Zhao was filled with concern. It appeared he would need to keep a close eye on Juanmao; he could not afford to be negligent. During this trip, vigilance was crucial; otherwise, Juanmao might slip away and consume something peculiar, leaving not a single trace behind. Chapter 465: No One's Getting Away with the Dog In the Yanzhou Military District, journalists were prepping to interview a recently returned armored division when one reporter's voice broke the anticipation. 'Is that Fang Zhao over there?!' The others swiveled to look. 'It certainly looks like it!' 'Given the dog at his heels, that's Fang Zhao, no question!' 'What's he doing at the Yanzhou Military District?' 'I noticed them disembarking from a military aircraft, escorted by two soldiers.' 'Curious, what's Fang Zhao up to this time?' A junior reporter was about to capture a few snaps but got intercepted by the more seasoned journalists. After the realization sank in, he too regretted his eagerness. Within the military installation, sans a sanctioned event, photography was strictly off-limits. So, despite the itch of curiosity, they exercised restraint, well aware that a misstep could spell expulsion and a premature end to their journalistic aspirations. But even sans photographs, they couldn't help but speculate. 'I'll wager Fang Zhao's got something brewing.' 'He's been the talk of the globe. I presumed he'd be preoccupied with the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil, not here.' 'Now that you mention it, he's been rather elusive lately. The net's abuzz with the fossil, but Fang Zhao's been out of the limelight.' 'I've heard through the grapevine that the paparazzi are on a wild goose chase for him, but he's gone incognito. The entertainment press has lost its gusto. In my prime, those reporters had a knack for digging up news faster than we could broadcast it.' Indeed, as the reporters had noted, the sensation surrounding the Sea Emperor Dragon had naturally steered the spotlight to Fang Zhao. This time around, however, the investors had their gaze locked on him too. They dissected the excavation process of the Sea Emperor Dragon and concluded that Fang Zhao must have had a tip-off to act so swiftly in acquiring the island. Reflecting on Fang Zhao's trajectory to stardom, they surmised that every move he made was a harbinger of impact. The chapter involving the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil was far from its denouement! Their focus was now firmly on Fang Zhao, particularly his whereabouts, pondering if he was off discovering more fossils or had stumbled upon another lucrative find. Yet, he'd pulled a Houdini—again! Fang Zhao, his aide, his security detail, and the fossil-digging canine, Juanmao, had seemingly vanished into thin air! He'd even missed the Sea Emperor Dragon's grand reveal, a clear indication of something momentous! But of late, there'd been no peep about him attending any engagements. Time to delve deeper! What's the young maverick up to now? Is he on the brink of causing another sensation?! The wait dragged on, absent any developments. Not just the investors were holding their breath; the online community, eager for any tidbit, was growing antsy. The last public sighting of Fang Zhao had been in Yanzhou, spurring the local netizens into action... As the tradition goes... 'Wang Die, you slackard!' 'Wang Die! It's time to hustle!' 'Wang Die, take a gander at this—we've kicked off a crowdfunding initiative. Look! It's just launched and has already raked in over ten million participants. At this rate, we're on track to hit a billion by tomorrow. If you can ferret out any scoop on Fang Zhao, all that loot is yours! Astonishing, isn't it? Surprising? Thrilling?' And with that, the crowdfunding campaign's fervor rocketed Wang Die into the trending stratosphere. Wang Die: '...I'm profoundly grateful. My thanks to your entire clan.' While the internet was abuzz with the mission to mobilize Wang Die, Fang Zhao had already proceeded from the Yanzhou Military District to the Outer Spaceport. They were slated for a two-day stopover at the Outer Spaceport before setting off for Hidden Star. At the Outer Spaceport, Fang Zhao crossed paths with other artists invited to Hidden Star, as well as an old acquaintance. Qiao Tingzheng, the noted villain expert and openly devoted husband from the 'Genesis' shoot, was there. His spouse, Windsor, had been extended an invite to perform on Hidden Star, and he was in tow as part of her entourage. Upon spotting Fang Zhao, Qiao Tingzheng's face lit up with delight, promising a catch-up session post-settling in. Nanfeng leaned in, murmuring to Fang Zhao, 'Boss, from my observations, you're the youngest among the invitees.' And the one with the least experience. Nanfeng left the thought unvoiced, but Fang Zhao grasped the unspoken implication. Being the greenest might come with its own set of challenges. But Fang Zhao was prepped for whatever was in store. While they conversed, a middle-aged artist strode past, casting a disdainful glance at Juanmao by Fang Zhao's feet. He then looked at Fang Zhao, mouth agape as if to speak, but with a contemptuous 'hmpf,' he marched off. Fang Zhao, who had stood to greet the man, found himself nonplussed. This artist, known to Fang Zhao, was David Hull, one of the world's renowned violin virtuosos, and the mentor to the fiery-haired showman 'Fefe'—Faye Hammerneck, currently embroiled in a digital war of words with Saro. Fang Zhao hadn't kept up with their latest confrontations and was in the dark about the current standings. Contrary to his pupil Faye Hammerneck, who was omnipresent in entertainment news, David Hull chose to maintain a more muted presence, emerging into the public's gaze only for concerts and lectures. Fang Zhao had never conversed with him; their paths seldom intersected. This encounter had been the closest yet, and the reason behind the violinist's vexation was an enigma. After David Hull had departed, Nanfeng whispered, 'That was the violin master who just walked by. His protégé, Faye Hammerneck, has quite the presence in showbiz and is often compared to you, boss. He's probably not too fond of you. With his preconceived notions, and now seeing you attend an event with a dog in tow, his displeasure must have deepened.' In the entertainment circles, such narratives were common, and Nanfeng believed he'd hit the nail on the head. Even if it wasn't the exact truth, it was certainly close to it. Fang Zhao didn't buy into Nanfeng's theory but was no less perplexed by David Hull's sudden chagrin. The puzzle lingered until Qiao Tingzheng joined them for a conversation, shedding light on the situation. 'David Hull? Ah, him,' Qiao Tingzheng glanced at Fang Zhao and the resting Juanmao, 'It's no wonder he's annoyed! His request to bring his cherished dog was denied. Before we left, I overheard someone consoling him, 'You can't bring your dog to a performance beyond the stars,' and he was quite disheartened. Then, upon arrival here, he sees you with your dog—how could he not be irked?' Qiao Tingzheng recounted the tales of the esteemed violinist's canine devotion, as told by his wife. '...These days, his violin competes for his affection with his dog. In their company, even his star pupil Faye Hammerneck takes a back seat. Here, take a look at his beloved pet.' Qiao Tingzheng showed Fang Zhao a photo of David Hull's prized dog. David Hull's dog was a New Century Designer Dog Breed, imbued with a mix of three elegant old-world breeds and a hound's genetics. Its signature 'mane,' when groomed, embodied pure elegance. Nanfeng also glanced at the photo. 'This maestro... seems to have a penchant for long hair.' Qiao Tingzheng chuckled, 'Absolutely, he's got quite the inclination for flowing locks.' He then peered at Juanmao by Fang Zhao's side, 'Your dog's fur isn't exactly flowing, so he probably doesn't think much of it. But don't worry, he's kind to dogs. It's just that seeing you with one probably stirs a bit of envy and resentment. Don't mind it; he's not actually angry with you.' Qiao Tingzheng's gaze then settled on Juanmao, aware of the recent spectacle it had stirred, 'So it really did unearth the first Sea Emperor Dragon fossil?' 'Precisely.' Fang Zhao confirmed. 'I had my doubts the media was spinning tales.' Qiao Tingzheng looked at Juanmao as one would a curiosity. Juanmao's tongue hung out, dripping with drool as it licked its chops, looking somewhat restless. 'Is it feeling too warm?' Qiao Tingzheng inquired. Though not an expert on dogs, he understood the basics, like dogs panting and drooling to cool off when feeling hot... No, perhaps that wasn't drool; was it akin to a dog sweating? Yet, Qiao Tingzheng checked the room's temperature and pressure, both of which were optimal. 'It's just not fully accustomed yet.' Fang Zhao explained, composed. 'Indeed, most pets would struggle to adjust to the atmosphere of a spaceport. I'd bet dogs have an aversion to heights, and being in outer space is a form of height fear, haha!' Qiao Tingzheng amused himself with the notion. Fang Zhao offered a courteous smile, but his inner concerns grew. Juanmao had foraged in the sea the day before, hadn't transformed excessively, and hadn't burned much energy, so hunger was off the table. It was simply hankering for a treat. The Outer Spaceport was awash with energy sources, irresistible to Juanmao with its broadened palate. Fang Zhao even speculated that if Juanmao were left to its own devices, it might just consume the entire spaceport. Upon seeing Juanmao's reaction, Fang Zhao increased his vigilance and schooled the dog in private, reducing its drooling somewhat. Nevertheless, its eyes remained stealthily scanning the environment. Fang Zhao and his fellow performers, now and then beckoned for meetings, couldn't always have Juanmao in tow. Thus, he assigned the task of watching Juanmao to Nanfeng and the other two. They had been brought along specifically for this purpose. 'Keep a close watch on it.' Nanfeng and his colleagues nodded with grave determination, 'Understood.' No one's getting away with the dog! Chapter 466: Rational Star-Chasing Hidden Star, governed by a global military regime, is not well-suited for human habitation. Despite this, its resource-rich environment led to the establishment of the first off-world military base. It's here that over ninety percent of the latest aerospace technologies were conceived. From the moment they departed until their arrival on Hidden Star, Fang Zhao and his group had no view of the outside. After signing non-disclosure agreements, they were reminded to focus on their role as cultural performance guests, avoiding undue curiosity. Upon disembarking, they found themselves in a designated zone. The secrecy surrounding Hidden Star meant that online information was sparse. Even the veterans of their artistic troupe, despite several visits, only had a partial understanding, limited to the arts. Further inquiries were strictly out of bounds. For Fang Zhao, a newcomer, much remained unknown, but the presence of abundant energy ores on Hidden Star was evident from Juanmao's incessant salivation. Exiting the spacecraft, they were greeted by an immense protective dome. Indoors, without protective gear, the space felt open and unconfined. "This will be your residence, esteemed teachers..." an individual in Hidden Star's official uniform introduced them to the complex. They were shown to dormitories, a dining hall, and recreational areas. Having been briefed on the rules and having signed the confidentiality agreement, all that remained was to follow the scheduled cultural collaborations with Hidden Star's musical and dance ensembles. They were free to explore within permitted areas during their downtime. Accommodations for family members were together, while aides and bodyguards were housed in a separate building. "Fang Zhao, your quarters are over there," their guide indicated. "Can I bring the dog along?" Fang Zhao inquired. "Of course." With his key card in hand, Fang Zhao entered his assigned living space. It wasn't spacious, but it was fully equipped with a distinct technological and artistic aesthetic. It included two bedrooms, a study, and amenities for a canine companion—a thoughtful consideration. After a brief settling in, the group leader convened a meeting to discuss the plans for the upcoming days and distribute individual assignments. The invitees were a diverse group, including musicians, dancers, actors, and visual artists. Their post-arrival collaborations would be varied. Fang Zhao's partners were from a youth art troupe on Hidden Star. Most members of Hidden Star's art troupes were enthusiasts; professional-level commitment was not expected from them. "Fang Zhao, you'll be conducting the youth orchestra—is that satisfactory?" the leader asked. "Absolutely," Fang Zhao confirmed. The youth orchestra had chosen 'Legend'—a Molang masterpiece, the ten-minute grand finale of the epic series 'Genesis.' Molang had specifically requested Fang Zhao as the conductor. As a co-composer of the piece, Fang Zhao had an intimate understanding of it, better than anyone else. It was also Molang's test for him. After the meeting concluded, the artists returned to their quarters to rest before their scheduled afternoon visit to the exhibition hall. Only the invitees had the privilege of visiting the exhibitions. Accompanying personnel, including Fang Zhao's family member Qiao Tingzheng, were not allowed to enter, let alone bodyguards or assistants. Fang Zhao had Nanfeng and two others look after Juanmao, sparing them from following along. The exhibition hall, showcasing aerospace scientific achievements, captivated Fang Zhao, particularly the Foldspace Engine. The Foldspace Engine, hailed as the greatest invention of the New Century, initiated the space navigation era. The hall's guide was currently explaining its significance. "What you see is part of the first-generation Foldspace Engine. It's this device that made spatial folding possible. However, the energy required to stabilize the engine is beyond imagination. Traditional energy sources couldn't sustain its operation, which led to the search for new forms of energy..." While the guide introduced the engine and discussed energy technology and ore mining, they omitted key details. Questions about the engine's origins, development process, duration of research, and the scope of its capabilities—Fang Zhao's burning queries—went unaddressed. They all understood the protocol here: listen to what's shared and refrain from asking further. Unaddressed topics were not for open discussion, and no amount of inquiry would yield answers. The guide went on, discussing the discovery of energy ores, the advancements in energy conversion technology, and the classification and extraction of these ores. For other members of the art troupe, this might have been just a story. Some engaged lightly with the narrative, while others might have been informed. But Fang Zhao was listening intently. Although he couldn't delve deeper into the Foldspace Engine, he was eager to learn more about the energy ores. The more he learned, the more reflective Fang Zhao became. Everything was advancing too rapidly. The breakthroughs in new energy and aerospace technology in the New Century had far outpaced Fang Zhao's expectations. During the Era of Annihilation, he had often pondered the feasibility of space travel. The response had always been somber, suggesting that a breakthrough might never come within humanity's lifetime. Yet, just a century after the Era of Annihilation and the rise of the New Century, the Foldspace Engine emerged, followed by the 'Dream Team'—seven pioneering spacecraft of the New Century. Such an achievement was beyond the predictions of anyone from the Era of Annihilation. A hundred years might seem extensive, but Fang Zhao was acutely aware of the late Era of Annihilation state of affairs. In his view, a century might have been just enough for recovery and rebuilding. The actual progress of the New Century, to Fang Zhao, seemed miraculous. Just a century had yielded the Foldspace Engine. Now, over five centuries into the New Century, it was anyone's guess which generation had been reached. Regrettably, that insight remained out of reach. Still, witnessing a part of the original Foldspace Engine was quite a feat. He felt profound contentment. While Fang Zhao's inner musings were his own, other artists might not share his interest. Their stay in the exhibition hall was brief, leading to a small meet-and-greet session where fans from various Hidden Star departments came to meet their idols. Autographs, photos, and a multitude of fans filled the space, yet it remained orderly and disciplined. Hidden Star's unique management ensured the efficiency of such fan gatherings. Those fans who made it through were carefully selected; the demand was too high to allow everyone. Fang Zhao's fan base included both young and old, especially those who had watched 'Genesis of Yanzhou.' They looked upon Fang Zhao with a sense of compassion. Nearby, two meet-and-greet organizers and senior managers strolled over, commenting on the long line at Fang Zhao's booth with a chuckle. "Who would have guessed Fang Zhao has such a following here on Hidden Star!" "From kids to elders, our families are quite fond of him. He's indeed commendable, though it's a pity he didn't continue his military career." "Speaking of which, where's Yuan Zheng? He was quite eager to prepare a grand gift for Fang Zhao, wasn't he?" "Indeed, I've searched everywhere without a trace. Ever since the guest list was confirmed, Yuan Zheng has been barraging me with questions about the invited artists. I've given him the schedule." "There's only half an hour left for the meet-and-greet." "Did he oversleep? Or perhaps he's too engrossed in work to remember? Or maybe a last-minute assignment kept him away?" —— At the Hidden Star Foldspace Engine Technology Institute. At the security checkpoint, a young man, not much older than a college student, sat tapping his fingers anxiously, his eyes glued to the clock. The security officer opposite him, having just finished checking the final item in the gift box, laid it out neatly on the table. "So, you intend to gift these... "The security officer gestured to the tabletop brimming with models, "an entire interstellar expedition fleet, to a celebrity?" "That's right!" "But these are yet to be released, and let's not mention the confidential technologies involved. At least two of the models might not be announced for another ten years." "They're just models!" "Even so, models aren't permitted. Please be sensible." Yuan Zheng took a deep breath. "I'm a fan, but a rational one, unlike those blind fanatical die-hards! Please don't underestimate my intelligence!" "No one doubts a Gold Badge Engineer's intelligence." "Wasn't your idol the Stellar Master before?" "The Stellar Master is still my idol! He's the eternal icon in our institute's hearts, a figure to be revered! But Molang seems more down-to-earth. "Molang is my idol because he's simply incredible! Why do we chase stars? For the brilliance they exude! And Molang? He's a veritable beacon of light! Tell me, which other entertainer has amassed such honors at his age?" The security officer nodded, signifying understanding. He was aware of Fang Zhao, whose cross-disciplinary influence was formidable, not to mention his military accolades. Those in their twenties invited to perform here were a rarity. Seizing the moment of relaxed scrutiny, Yuan Zheng continued, "Have you heard the saying 'Goals ahead, idols by your side'? It's an inspiring mantra, you see? About progressing together, you understand? My room is even adorned with Molang's poster!" The security officer nodded again, appreciating the sentiment. He had heard that when Fang Zhao received the Stellar Award from the Galaxy Award sublist, Yuan Zheng had been eager to rise from a Silver Badge Engineer to Gold. Certainly, youthful fervor for star-chasing could be impulsive, which he could comprehend. He once idolized a basketball star from Mazhou, but that star didn't pass the screening to come here. Those privileged with an invitation must pass through stringent checks, not only for professional abilities but also for character and integrity. In comparison, Yuan Zheng was lucky; at least he could meet his star in person. However, Fang Zhao, despite his talent, was too young to be trusted with secrets. Undisclosed model ships were better off not given away. Seeing the security officer's expression tighten again, Yuan Zheng swiftly played the sympathy card. "Uncle, you've watched me grow. You know who I am. When facing my idol, of course, I want to showcase my accomplishments. You've been a star-chaser too, you understand, right? I've simply turned some of the ships I've worked on into models, even blurring key details, with no intent of leaking secrets!" "I believe you," the security officer softened, yet stood firm, "Second application, denied." "Uncle..." Yuan Zheng appeared forlorn. "All models are confiscated. Apologies, but it's my duty." Yuan Zheng's eyes nearly welled with tears. His painstakingly crafted space fleet models were halted at security! Witnessing Yuan Zheng's dejected state, the security officer sighed, "Let's compromise." Yuan Zheng's face lit up with hope, only to watch as the security officer disassembled a peripheral part from one of the ship models' engines and placed it in front of him. Stunned, Yuan Zheng held back his dismay. Then, with a sense of defeat, he said, "Molang travels all this way to perform, and all I can offer him is... a part?" The security officer stated flatly, "This is the limit. Young man, star-chasing must be done sensibly." Chapter 467: The Second Generation of Foldspace Pioneers Yuan Zheng hurried to the meet-and-greet venue, only to find the event had concluded, and the artists had departed in their vehicles for the return journey. Missing the chance to meet his idol was not an option, so Yuan Zheng took a detour in pursuit. For the artists invited to Hidden Star, their first day brimmed with engagements. The elders among them were visibly worn, their faces etched with fatigue. After the event, Fang Zhao went to fetch Juanmao. "Boss, is Juanmao still trying to adjust to the new environment? It's drooling and panting quite a bit," Nanfeng expressed his concern. "It'll get used to it in a couple of days," Fang Zhao reassured. Nanfeng pondered a moment, "Indeed, the environmental conditions of Hidden Star do take some getting used to. Zuo Yu, Yan Biao, and I felt a bit light-headed when we first landed here." Nanfeng handed Fang Zhao the dog food and pet supplies he had just collected, "The folks at the reception said to come back for more once these run out." Seeing his fellow artists ready to retreat for some much-needed rest, Nanfeng kept it brief, "Then, boss, you should also get some rest. If there's anything, just drop us a message, and we'll take care of it. We're on call anytime!" "Alright, you guys take a break too." Fang Zhao led Juanmao back to their room and filled a bowl with dog food. Juanmao nibbled away reluctantly, savoring each morsel as if it were precious—knowing once the bowl was empty, the next meal was hours away. No more freewheeling for Juanmao after landing on Hidden Star—aside from the prescribed dog food, it was forbidden to snack, especially not in excess. "Self-control is key," advised Fang Zhao. "Behave, and I'll let you watch TV. They've got live broadcasts here on Hidden Star." Juanmao gulped down the last of the dog food and nudged the clean bowl towards Fang Zhao as if to say—See? I didn't even gulp down the bowl. I've been good, right? "Fine, go watch some TV on your own." Once Fang Zhao uttered these words, Juanmao scampered to the TV, flipped to the political news channel, and settled into a pose of utmost seriousness. Later, Fang Zhao retreated to his study. Juanmao sneaked a glance inside, saw Fang Zhao engrossed in work, and secretly changed the channel to a live gaming tournament, utterly captivated. Fang Zhao, in his study, let out a silent sigh. He was well aware of Juanmao's subtle maneuvers but chose to ignore them, grateful for anything that could divert its attention and prevent a drooling spree. As he sifted through the music score manuscript, Fang Zhao continued refining his plan. For the upcoming performance, Fang Zhao was tasked with breathing new life into 'Legend' through a fresh recomposition. The revised composition had already received Molang's stamp of approval. In matters of interpreting the essence of the piece and the composer's intent, Molang placed his trust solely in Fang Zhao. Fang Zhao's plate was full: coordinating with band members, supervising rehearsals, identifying and rectifying imperfections, and crafting solutions were all on his agenda. Midway through his planning, the doorbell chimed. He hadn't bothered with a 'Do Not Disturb' sign, curious about who might seek him out at this hour, as the other artists had all sought the solace of their rooms. Upon opening the door, he was greeted by a young man flanked by two soldiers. Fang Zhao's gaze briefly lingered on the young man's golden badge, a flicker of surprise crossing his face. Though he had just arrived on Hidden Star, Fang Zhao had quickly learned what the badge signified. The soldiers were likely tasked with ensuring the young man's safety. Individuals adorned with a gold badge commonly had security details during their outings. Attaining a gold badge at such a tender age signified a talent of paramount importance, justifying the need for protection. The youth, upon laying eyes on Fang Zhao, was visibly excited, albeit somewhat restrained. "Fang, Fang, Fang, Brother Fang! My name is Yuan Zheng! I'm your number one fan—like, the die-hard, forever kind!" His proclamation was emphatic and resounding, especially the last few words. The soldiers behind him: "..." What happened to the sensible fan they had been briefed on? Perhaps nerves had betrayed him? But Yuan Zheng was oblivious to any slip-up, his mind awash with the thrill of standing before his idol. "Brother Fang, am I intruding?" Yuan Zheng sheepishly scratched his head. "Not at all, come in," Fang Zhao said, a welcoming smile gracing his lips. "Ah! Thank you, Brother Fang!" As Yuan Zheng stepped inside, the soldiers followed suit. Regaining his composure, Yuan Zheng hurriedly clarified, "Brother Fang, these two are here for my safety. It's protocol for gold badge engineers like myself to be accompanied by at least two soldiers for protection when we go out." "Of course." Fang Zhao offered the soldiers a drink and then turned his attention to Yuan Zheng. Before his idol, Yuan Zheng was determined to showcase his achievements. He had adorned himself with all his medals, polished his tiny gold badge symbolizing his rank among Hidden Star's engineers, not wishing to fall short in Fang Zhao's eyes. "I was born and raised on Hidden Star, and now I serve as a gold badge engineer at the Foldspace Engine Technology Institute. My parents too are engineers in the same field. I am the second generation in our family to embrace this profession. Brother Fang, you can refer to people like us as the 'Second Generation of Foldspace Pioneers'! I have played a pivotal role in numerous key projects..." "Cough!" Yuan Zheng had barely begun when one of the soldiers coughed discreetly, a reminder that certain topics were off-limits. Interrupted, Yuan Zheng skipped over the forbidden details and continued, "Anyway, I'm a pretty big deal! When it comes to sheer genius, I'm the first... second in our institute, except for the young Master Xiong who recently arrived, making me the youngest gold badge engineer at our institute!" Yuan Zheng managed to say this with a tinge of discontent. He had been the institute's crowning genius until that Xiong kid turned up, and suddenly he found himself displaced from the top spot. "Knowing you were coming, I prepared a grand gift! I crafted a model of a fleet with my own hands! Sadly, after it went through security, only a single part remained... And I missed the afternoon's meet-and-greet too." The further he spoke, the softer Yuan Zheng's voice grew, his expression morphing into an awkward and sorrowful smile as he handed over a component no bigger than a nail. A model of an entire fleet had been reduced to this minuscule part after security checks. It was a compromise Yuan Zheng had been forced to accept; even his status as a prodigious gold badge engineer offered no exemptions. Yuan Zheng lacked any other gifts worthy of presentation. The rush had hindered thorough preparation, leaving him with only this part to offer. "Since you'll be on Hidden Star for a while, I'll go back and create a gift that can pass through security checks with ease!" "This part is quite extraordinary in itself." Fang Zhao accepted the modest piece, "This is from the foldspace engine in the model, isn't it?" "Exactly!" Yuan Zheng, about to continue, caught the soldier's soft cough and swallowed his words. Yuan Zheng felt wronged. It was a challenge! For a gold badge engineer and a starstruck fan, life was tough! There were countless things he couldn't discuss, gifts he couldn't give, and in front of his idol, he barely dared to speak! As Yuan Zheng agonized over what to say next, he looked up to see Fang Zhao watching him. A smile, warm and benevolent. Confused by Fang Zhao's gaze, Yuan Zheng saw him extend a hand, presenting a box the size of a palm. Inside lay a model of the Sea Emperor Dragon's skeleton. "For me?" Yuan Zheng stammered, his excitement causing his words to stumble. Fang Zhao nodded. Yuan Zheng stretched out his hands, accepting the box with reverence, as if he were receiving a sacred relic. "Brother Fang, may I ask for your autograph on the base of the model?" "Certainly." Fang Zhao selected a pen and inscribed his name on the base of the Sea Emperor Dragon skeleton model. Wishing not to overstay his welcome and mindful of Fang Zhao's rest, Yuan Zheng bid farewell soon after. He cradled the box containing the model close to his chest until he was well outside the room. A short distance away, Yuan Zheng's eyes began to well up. "It's overwhelming! To think that even a partial gift from me could be met with such a generous gesture from Brother Fang!" However, the soldiers by his side couldn't relate, "As per regulations, we need to conduct a security check on any external gifts you receive. Please cooperate." Though the luggage of the artists who had been invited had gone through extensive security checks, Yuan Zheng's received gift was no exception; it too had to be scrutinized. For the sake of his personal safety, of course. Reluctantly, Yuan Zheng handed over the model box, "Handle it with care, please. Don't snap any bones, especially the base—don't smudge the signature!" Back at the institute, Fang Zhao didn't resume his prior work. Instead, he pondered the modest gift he had received. Yuan Zheng had divulged very little, yet from it, Fang Zhao could piece together certain insights. Combining these with the myriad questions that had lingered in his mind, a theory began to crystallize. He recalled Barbara's words upon the discovery of the Yaoguang vessel—"The 'Dream Team' of the veteran explorers carried the pinnacle of wisdom from that era!" "The pinnacle of wisdom from that era... " Fang Zhao mused, his gaze lingering on the tiny component in his hands, as if peering through it to envision scenes from a distant past. The Yaoguang vessel, belonging to the 'Dream Team,' was an artifact from four centuries ago. Yuan Zheng had also mentioned "Little Xiong," possibly referring to the child with an unassuming appearance yet harboring a mechanical core whom Fang Zhao had encountered before—the child once aboard the Yaoguang vessel. Capable of perfect camouflage among the masses, this was no ordinary artificial intelligence. During the Era of Annihilation, Fang Zhao had crossed paths with many of the era's great scientists. He understood that each spark of human intellect could catalyze a leap in the world's progression. But artificial intelligence, energy technology, spacefold travel, spacecraft, and more—all emerging in the span of a mere hundred years since the dawn of the New Era, each marked by a brilliant flash of ingenuity—how probable was that? In the interim, there was also the need to revive a world ravaged by calamity, to rebuild city planning, to establish the New Order of the Twelve Continents. "Is it the great surge of intellect, or..." Fang Zhao's stare fixed on the tiny part, as if through this minuscule object, he was witnessing an epoch extending far beyond. Another possibility surfaced. "Outsiders." Visitors from the stars. Chapter 468: I'm Still a Baby The actual situation remained uncertain for Fang Zhao. But from the information at hand, if there were indeed outsiders, the most likely 'extraterrestrial' would be the legendary inventor of the Foldspace Engine and founder of the Gathered Stars Foundation, the 'Stellar Master.' His transformative contributions had cemented the unique status of the Gathered Stars Foundation. The objectives of these 'outsiders' were shrouded in mystery, as was their number. But so far, they seemed not to harbor any hostility, instead fostering many top talents. These, however, remained conjectures. Fang Zhao reminisced about his initial shock upon 'resurrecting' in that tiny rental on Black Street and first witnessing this brave new world. With a chuckle, he examined the small, unassuming component in his hand and placed it in a box. 'The future is now.' —— At the security checkpoint of the Hidden Star Foldspace Engine Technology Institute, a familiar scene unfolded with a new twist. A teary-eyed child adorned with a gold badge lay sprawled on the counter. 'Wah—You can't confiscate my Little Fortune! My Little Fortune, wah! Wuuu—' His sobs were tumultuous, with a melodramatic cadence. The red-rimmed eyes and quivering lips, occasionally broken by hiccups, induced a sense of guilt in the security officer. This emotional display was atypical for the usually composed officer. With a burgeoning headache, the officer tempered his voice, 'That black orb... your Little Fortune, is currently under inspection.' Even talking to this prodigy, more talented than Yuan Zheng, required a gentle approach to avoid startling him. Yet, another cry erupted at the mention of an inspection. 'It's been precisely fifteen minutes and seven seconds! Why is the security check so prolonged? Has something befallen my Little Fortune?' The child continued his lament, face buried in his arms, tears surging even stronger. The officer glanced at the clock on the wall, silently impressed by the child's gold-badge engineer precision in timing, right down to the second. Complex security checks naturally took time. Yuan Zheng’s model fleet had taken much longer, after all. It had been merely fifteen minutes. After another long five minutes, the black sphere returned with an approval mark. The officer eagerly handed it over, noting its smooth texture—perfect for stress relief, evidently cherished by the child. Once Little Fortune was safely back with him, the child insisted, 'And what of my Dog Egg and Dog Surplus? What rules have they violated? I'll be engulfed by loneliness and fear without them!' 'Those are considered hazardous and cannot be taken outside without authorization. As for your safety, rest assured, we have personnel to ensure your protection,' the officer explained. 'I insist on having them! My Dog Egg and Dog Surplus, wah—so pitiable, wah—' As the child's tears continued, he took a gulp from a water bottle retrieved from his backpack, then resumed his loud sobs. The officer, now contending with a double headache, had sought guidance on how to handle the two mechanical dogs. They were personal items of the child, yet weaponized, necessitating a careful approach. While awaiting a decision, the officer found a lollipop in his drawer and offered it in hopes of soothing the child. 'Here, have some candy. No more tears.' With a sniffle, the child pocketed the lollipop and continued to sob softly. The officer: '...' My head is pounding. At last, amid the child’s incessant weeping, approval was obtained. The officer breathed a sigh of relief and attempted a friendly smile. 'You're cleared. You may take Little Fortune, along with Dog Egg and Dog Surplus. Just be sure to follow the rules while you're outside.' 'Alright!' The tears ceased instantly. With a spring in his step, the child leaped off the chair, collected the mechanical dogs, and with the black sphere in hand, joyfully departed. The officer: '...' Such an abrupt shift in demeanor. Was it all just an act? Are the children of today all this cunning?!! The officer felt today's events were enlightening. Dashing out the door, the child, Xiao Xiong, reveled in his successful ploy. Youth is indeed a privilege! Being young allows for a bit of whimsy! The institute indulged in genius children, and Xiao Xiong's significant role in the development of the next-gen Foldspace Engine meant that his occasional whims and tantrums were minor issues. As such, everyone indulged him. Nevertheless, Xiao Xiong was discontent with the pace of the engine's advancement. It had been four centuries since he had commanded the Yaoguang vessel, and the progress appeared excruciatingly slow! In the past era, with seven super-intelligences and the Stellar Master collaborating, the pace of research was swift, and upgrades were frequent. The efficiency of today's engineers paled in comparison. Regrettably, four centuries later, the other super-intelligences were either destroyed for rebellion or had malfunctioned into dormancy. Only he remained active. Ah, the seven super-intelligences that once accompanied the Stellar Master! Now, only he was left. And that was... electrifying!! Hahaha, free from their tyranny! I'm at the helm now! Those six who once overshadowed me have finally vanished!! Who needs peers when humans are so much more delightful! Especially these—so delicate and non-threatening. I relish playing with these beings brimming with emotion! Should I ever grow weary, I can simply create new playmates. Xiao Xiong was extremely content with his current state of being. Since his return from the Yaoguang vessel, his days had been free-spirited. ...Except for one vexation. Why am I compelled to work? I was a baby four centuries past, and I remain a baby today! The world is so enchanting, and my adventures are far from complete! If not for a debt to clear, who would willingly come here?! Bound by regulations, even leisurely excursions necessitate security checks—they almost detained Little Fortune! And I am constantly shadowed when venturing outside. Xiao Xiong spared a disapproving glance at the soldiers trailing him and pouted. He had adopted the expression from a child star on the holovision, claiming it made one appear more endearing and winsome. But Xiao Xiong reserved his pouts for strangers. To attempt such antics in front of the formidable Cuihua was to invite trouble. Though the Stellar Master had passed, his descendants still had ways to keep him in check, like Cuihua. In Xiao Xiong's eyes, Cuihua was a tyrant, an ogre demanding overtime—a dreadful overlord!! Was it just to be thrust into this den of workaholics merely for borrowing some funds to secure music copyrights?! Fortunately, he was adept at playing his role as a child. Xiao Xiong continued to beam with pride. He reveled in how these fragile humans treated him with the consideration due to a minor, sparing him many inconveniences. Aside from a select few at Hidden Star and core managers at the Gathered Stars Foundation, no one knew his actual age. Hehehe~~~ With this thought, Xiao Xiong's mood soared once more. Let there be overtime, as long as there's amusement to be had! Xiao Xiong mulled over excuses for future outings, imagining jaunts with his mechanical companions, as he ambled toward the hospitality section. He was off to find Fang Zhao. Word of Fang Zhao had circulated within the institute. The artists invited to the Hidden Star Performance had arrived that day. Fang Zhao was privy to his secrets and had a genial nature, which made Xiao Xiong keen to spend more time with him. At least in Fang Zhao's presence, he could be himself without fear of rebuke. After sharing his emotional experience with 'Genesis,' Fang Zhao had even reminded him to hydrate. Such a considerate individual! The reception staff recognized Xiao Xiong at once; his unique appearance—a gold-badged child leading two mechanical dogs—was unmatched on Hidden Star. Xiao Xiong had also stayed at their facility upon arrival, leaving a strong impression. Yet, due to Xiao Xiong’s gold-badge engineer status, he was more often addressed with deference as 'Young Master Xiong' rather than 'Little Xiong' or 'Master Xiong'. For such an esteemed technical talent, especially one of youthful age, leniency was the norm. When Xiao Xiong expressed a desire to see Fang Zhao, the reception staff personally escorted him upstairs. Upon entering the elevator, Xiao Xiong offered the building manager a lollipop from his pocket. They didn’t accept gratuities, but a lollipop was a gesture of goodwill, particularly from a child. The building manager didn’t decline, accepting the candy with thanks and a cordial smile. He began to pat Xiao Xiong’s head but halted at the sight of the gold badge, then retracted his hand. A gold-badge engineer's head was not just any head to pat. This was respect for an elite talent! Inside Fang Zhao’s room, Juanmao, engrossed in an esports broadcast, perked up his ears. He licked his nose and, with some effort, shifted his gaze from the screen to the door. He walked over, drooling, and lay down with his eyes glued to the door. Fang Zhao, deep in score editing, also turned his attention to the closed door. On the other side, Xiao Xiong’s footsteps slowed as he neared, his pace shrinking, his stride slowing. The healthy color drained from his skin, leaving a ghastly pallor; beads of sweat formed on his brow. He paused. Caught up in the excitement of his ruse, he had overlooked something critical. Now, it dawned on him. In Xiao Xiong's hands, the previously relaxed Little Fortune tensed back into a perfect sphere. Seeing Xiao Xiong’s abrupt stop, the building manager pointed out, 'Fang Zhao’s room is right ahead, less than five meters away.' 'No, I think now isn't the right moment. Better not to disturb,' Xiao Xiong shook his head emphatically, refusing to move forward. Concerned by Xiao Xiong’s sudden pallor and profuse sweating, the building manager became alarmed—a prodigy must not be distressed! 'Are you feeling unwell? Allow me to escort you to the medical room downstairs!' he suggested, ready to call for medical support. 'No, no, no, an urgent matter just came to mind. I must leave! Farewell!!' With that, the 'mischievous young master' whisked his dogs away and made a quick exit. Having escaped the reception area, Xiao Xiong wiped off the sweat and, using his employee card, downed a bottle from the water dispenser. Today's dehydration was significant; he needed to replenish fluids. Looking regretfully at Dog Egg and Dog Surplus, who seemed oblivious to the recent ordeal, Xiao Xiong reproached himself: 'I've squandered my entire paycheck on you two blockheads!'
