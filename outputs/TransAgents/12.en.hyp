Chapter 1906: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twelve) As she mulled over these thoughts, Su Yan couldn't help but feel a surge of compassion for her brother, clinging to his arm with a determination not to let go. She pouted and expressed her heartfelt desire, "Brother, I really do hope you'll find a sister-in-law for me soon, someone to look after you, and maybe I'll even get a little nephew to pamper." "Who has you so concerned?" Su Yan, with a smile still gracing his face, affectionately pinched Su Yue's pouting lips. Eager to avoid the topic, Su Yue perceived his reluctance. Not wishing to press him further, she sat upright and sighed, "Okay, I'll stop. Bringing up this topic always makes me anxious." Her hands continued to embrace his arm tenderly. With a slight smile, Su Yan confidently said, "Given my favorable circumstances, bachelorhood is not my destined path." "Hmph," Su Yue rolled her eyes playfully, "Vain. Third Brother's habits are rubbing off on you." Su Yan laughed softly, his shoulders giving a noncommittal shrug that seemed to say: 'Indeed, that's the case.' Su Yue reached for her cup again, finding the tea had cooled to a perfect drinkable warmth. She tested the temperature and then downed the cup in one gulp, looking quite parched. Su Yan watched her curiously, "Where have you been to come back so thirsty?" After finishing the water, Su Yue put down the cup and truthfully responded, "I went to check on Qiao Chen's mother. On the way back, I just found myself drawn here without realizing it." "Oh." Su Yan nodded, then inquired, "Did little Xiaoqiao accompany you?" His eyes fell on Xiaoqiao, who was contentedly nibbling on an apple, her legs swinging freely in the air, exuding a carefree innocence that beckoned one to protect her from the slightest harm. He yearned for her to experience the warm and colorful childhood that his mother had been denied. At one time, when he had considered stepping in, there was Qiao Chen, the man who had risked his life for Su Yue. He had hoped that Qiao Chen would be the salve for the shadows that darkened Su Yue's childhood and adolescence. He had imagined Qiao Chen would be Su Yue's best and ultimate partner. Yet, as it turned out, while he was the best, he was not the last. That man still occasionally burst into his thoughts and dreams. Thus, it was imperative that Xiaoqiao never forget him. And he hoped that Ming Ansheng would not fall short of Qiao Chen, that his love for Su Yue would be just as deep. This was the selfish wish of an older brother. "Yes," Su Yue replied, lips pursed in thought, "But I didn't enter. I just stood at the door for a while. I was afraid that my presence might bring back memories of Qiao Chen and cause her heartache." Su Yan offered a comforting smile, cleverly steering the conversation elsewhere, "How's Xiaoqiao adjusting to kindergarten?" "Quite well," Su Yue nodded, "With Yan Yan and the others around, she's making friends and playing well with the other children." "That's good to hear," Su Yan said with a gentle smile, then suggested, "Do bring Xiaoqiao to the new product launch. She will enjoy it." Su Yue's eyes sparkled with uncontained excitement, "Certainly, I'll bring Ming Ansheng along too." "Does he need your invitation?" Su Yan raised an eyebrow, "Isn't he supposed to be the one bringing you?" Su Yue pouted, "When it comes to importance, from Rongsheng's perspective, I'm the main event." Their conversation was abruptly interrupted by the office door swinging open without any prior knock. Su Yue looked over in surprise, half-expecting Third Brother to be the intruder. However, she was instead taken aback by the unexpected presence of a tall woman making her entrance. Chapter 1907: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Thirteen) Su Yan was taken aback by the woman who nonchalantly entered the room. This... Wasn't this the very same Aireli, the acclaimed celebrity from earlier? What could have prompted her return? No... The actual question should be, what was her business in her brother's office, and most importantly, why did she forgo the common courtesy of knocking? Her manners appeared to be lacking. As Aireli marched in with undeniable confidence, her pale green Hermès bag—an emblem of her status—hung elegantly over one arm, and the sunglasses she had just removed in the other, Su Yan felt a surge of annoyance she couldn't quite understand, settling on a general sense of discontent. The click of Aireli's high heels against the wooden floor reverberated, announcing her presence dominantly. Her gaze first flitted to President Su's office and then to Su Xiaoqiao, her striking face registering a flicker of surprise before she regarded Su Xiaoqiao with a puzzled expression. However, Su Xiaoqiao, deeply engrossed in the cartoon on the screen, did not notice Aireli's presence, her bright eyes glued to the screen, unblinking. After observing Su Xiaoqiao for a short while, Aireli was about to divert her attention when Su Yan suddenly called out, 'Miss Aireli.' He stood up to greet her, with Su Yan rising as well, her arms still entwined with his, their closeness projecting a natural affinity. At the sound of her name, Aireli turned with a smile that momentarily faltered when her eyes met Su Yan's. 'President Su,' she acknowledged, her inquisitive gaze resting on Su Yan, revealing a glimmer of complexity. Su Yan perceived the shift in Aireli's demeanor as soon as she caught sight of her, and instinctively, she clung tighter to President Su's arm, leaning her head on his shoulder. It was evident that Aireli harbored feelings for her brother, and despite Su Yan's internal resistance to this notion, she couldn't deny a burgeoning sense of pride. Yet, she couldn't shake off the unexplainable aversion she felt toward the actress. Perhaps, she mused, her brother's detached nature was incompatible with a woman from the entertainment industry, especially one who seemed assertive. But these were her personal reflections, not to be ascribed to anyone else, least of all her brother. 'President Su, who might this be?' Aireli inquired after a moment, her gesture indicating Su Yan. With a straightforward introduction, he responded, 'This is my sister, Su Yan.' The words seemed to bring a springtime warmth to Aireli's face, a semblance of hope rekindled. Her reaction, Su Yan noted with an internal critique, was hardly befitting an actress of her caliber, lacking the subtlety one might expect from an award-winning performer. Yet, it underscored the allure her brother held, even for someone of Aireli's celebrated status. With pride swelling within, Su Yan observed as Aireli approached with a welcoming smile that blended professionalism and personal charm, 'Hello, Su Yan.' Aireli extended her hand with a polish that spoke of her worldliness. Once, Su Yan might have met the gesture with disdain, but time had taught her the intricacies of social grace. She reciprocated the handshake, her smile was subtle yet sincere, 'Hello, Miss Aireli.' After the cordial exchange, Su Yan smoothly retracted her hand, mirroring Aireli's effortless poise. Aireli turned back to President Su with a warm smile, 'I just remembered I left my scarf here.' Chapter 1908: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Fourteen) As she spoke, her gaze swept over the sofa and finally settled in its corner. Her eyes, heavily adorned with makeup, lit up as she pointed and said, 'It's over there. I've been too careless, always losing and forgetting things.' She laughed at herself, walked over, and picked up the scarf. It was a large floral scarf, yet its design was refreshingly elegant, avoiding any hint of vulgarity. This is the hallmark of prestigious brands and top designers. Su Yan’s attention was caught by the scarf in Aireli's hand, her thoughts elsewhere. She came to talk business but managed to leave her scarf behind without bringing an assistant. Was the scarf genuinely forgotten, or was it intentionally left as an excuse to talk to her brother again? Oh, Su Yan, why so narrow-minded? Perhaps you've read too many novels. She shook off the melodramatic thoughts that had invaded her mind and pouted at Aireli, feeling a twinge of sourness in her heart. For some reason, she did want her brother, Su Yan, to find a girlfriend and settle down. Yet she clung to Su Yan's arm, never letting go, hugging it tightly as if claiming her territory before Aireli, as if to show her disapproval of her. Aireli, scarf in hand, returned to where the siblings stood. Su Yan, with a hint of politeness, offered, 'A phone call would have sufficed; I could've had someone bring it down to you.' Aireli responded with a bright smile, 'I was free anyway, so I came up to get it myself.' An actress of her caliber, with such popularity, must have exceptional charm. Su Yan couldn't help but find Aireli's dimples when she smiled quite captivating. Especially her face, seemingly perfect yet with an ineffable flaw, contrasted with the surgically perfected faces of many online celebrities and stars, it possessed a unique appeal. Su Yan's gaze involuntarily drifted to Aireli again. When Aireli caught her looking, she maintained her generous smile. After a brief glance at Su Yan, she turned to President Su and complimented, 'President Su, your sister is quite beautiful.' Before President Su could reply, she quickly added, 'And she looks a lot like you.' President Su's lips curled up slightly, but he said nothing. Upon hearing this, Su Yan inwardly rolled her eyes at Aireli. She could have simply praised her brother's good looks; there was no need to use her as a pretext. Internally criticizing Aireli repeatedly, Su Yan acknowledged her success, charisma, and allure, but... She simply couldn't take a liking to her. Feelings about people are indeed inexplicable. Aireli seemed in no hurry to leave, continuously seeking topics to engage President Su in conversation. As they chatted about inconsequential matters, Su Yan grew bored and let go of President Su's arm, planning to visit Little Seastar. 'Knock, knock, knock' Suddenly, a series of knocks came from the door. Before President Su could respond, the door was already being pushed open. 'President Su, Third Brother Su and I need to leave now,' Wen Xuxu entered in haste, bag in hand, making her greetings. Upon seeing Aireli, she paused, then moderated her hurried demeanor. 'Third sister-in-law,' Su Yan greeted, changing direction to walk happily toward Wen Xuxu. 'Wen Xuxu's here,' Su Yan said, her smile forced as she curved her lips. President Su, growing concerned, asked, 'What's happened? Is everything alright?' He moved towards Wen Xuxu as he spoke. Wen Xuxu's expression turned mournful, 'Ah Heng's grandfather has passed away at the Cardio-Cerebrovascular Hospital; Third Brother Su and I are on our way there now.' Chapter 1909: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Fifteen) Her heart was heavy with grief as she reminisced about her relationship with Jiang Zhuoheng and the kind regard the late Old Master Jiang and his family had shown her. Despite his longevity, his passing caused her profound sadness. Upon hearing the news, Su Yan's expression briefly registered surprise. 'Then you must make haste,' he said. 'Certainly.' Wen Xuxu nodded with determination and turned to Su Yue, 'We need to leave now.' She quickened her pace to the door, only to be stopped by Su Xiaoqiao's voice, 'Auntie.' Wen Xuxu paused, turning back with a comforting smile. 'Xiaoqiao, auntie has something urgent to take care of and can't play with you now. Be a good girl, okay?' 'Okay.' Su Xiaoqiao nodded obediently and waved her little hand, 'Goodbye, Auntie.' 'Goodbye!' Wen Xuxu left in a hurry, and Su Yan watched the office door close, deep in thought. 'Brother, isn't Ah Heng's grandfather also Xin Yanting's grandfather?' 'Yes.' 'Aren't you going to pay your respects?' 'Don't be nosy.' 'Hmph, I dislike this attitude.' 'President Su, I shall take my leave now.' 'Miss Aireli, take care.' Su Yan acknowledged Aireli with a nod before calling out, 'Mi Xiao.' At this, Su Yue's curiosity was piqued. 'Who is Mi Xiao?' Before she finished her question, the office door opened, and a young woman entered, dressed in a white blouse and black business slacks, epitomizing professionalism. The young woman adjusted the black-framed glasses perched on her nose. She looked to be around Su Yue's age, perhaps even a bit younger. At first glance, her features seemed quite plain. Su Yue scrutinized the newcomer. The woman adjusted her glasses and looked to Su Yan, 'President Su?' 'Escort Miss Aireli out, please,' Su Yan directed. 'Understood.' Mi Xiao nodded, then turned to Aireli. She seemed a touch nervous, possibly unaccustomed to her new responsibilities. 'Miss Aireli, this way, please.' Mi Xiao bowed slightly and followed Aireli out, carefully closing the office door with a soft click behind her. 'Brother, who was that?' Su Yue redirected her gaze from the door back to Su Yan. 'Isn't it the secretary's job to see out guests?' Indeed, that was the standard practice. 'Indeed, she is my new secretary,' Su Yan replied nonchalantly, strolling toward Su Xiaoqiao with his hands casually in his pockets. A new secretary? Su Yue's eyes widened in astonishment, 'Oh!' She quickened her pace to keep up with Su Yan's tall figure. 'Is there a problem?' Su Yan glanced at Su Yue with a trace of bemusement, feigning ignorance. With his sharp intuition, he knew exactly why Su Yue was reacting this way. Su Yue nodded emphatically. 'Yes, it's quite a big deal.' As they walked, she continued, 'Hadn't you always refrained from hiring female secretaries? The last time I accompanied you on a trip, you had that very striking male secretary, right?' Upon hearing this, Su Yan smiled amusedly. 'I've just never found the right person before. You're overthinking it.' He then flicked Su Yue's forehead affectionately. Su Yue winced, rubbing her forehead, and pouted, 'Ouch! But the secretary we just met... she didn't seem particularly striking.' She laughed, 'But, brother, you've finally opened up to the idea of having a woman close by. That alleviates my concerns. You've always been escorted by a handsome man on your business trips, which was quite worrisome for me. I was almost afraid you might... change your preferences.' Chapter 1910: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Sixteen) 'What?' Brother Su's eyebrows knit together, a dangerous glint in his eyes as he again withdrew his hand from his pocket. Su Yue hurriedly tucked in her neck, swiftly raising her hands to protect her head, while smiling appeasingly at Brother Su, 'Hehe, my apologies, I misspoke...' Indeed, it had been too much, making such a joke with her own brother. Even as she begged for leniency, Brother Su's gaze remained piercingly fixed on her. Su Yue looked back with caution, 'What are you doing? Why are you looking at me like that?' Brother Su's lips curved into a smile, 'It just occurred to me, you're idling at home right now, so why not come to work? That way, I wouldn't need to hire anyone else.' His tone was ambiguous, leaving Su Yue uncertain of his sincerity. Regardless of his intent, Su Yue immediately shook her head in refusal, 'No way, I'm not interested.' Recalling something, she retorted with a pout, 'Who says I'm doing nothing? My online store is still up and running.' And it was indeed thriving. She scoffed at the idea of giving up her freedom for a nine-to-five job. 'Besides, if I were to work, to be a secretary, I'd rather be Ming Ansheng's secretary, not join Rongsheng.' Brother Su nodded as if in understanding, 'Ah, the proverbial spilled water of a married daughter, but...' He paused, then suddenly chuckled, 'But you haven't been married off yet, have you?' 'Stop it,' Su Yue's face flushed, and she playfully punched Brother Su on the shoulder. Brother Su chuckled, then his expression turned serious, 'I've got some work to do. You entertain Little Seastar, okay?' 'Alright.' Su Yue nodded, 'I'll take Little Seastar upstairs and downstairs for a bit, and we can all go for dinner after you finish work.' 'Okay.' ... 'As expected, traffic is always congested around this time, without fail.' At six o'clock on the ring road, the cars moved slower than a sloth speaking, prompting Su Yue to grumble. 'Are you hungry?' Brother Su pointed to the glove compartment in front of Su Yue, 'There should be a bag of cookies in there.' Su Yue shook her head, 'Not hungry, just anxious.' Every traffic light seemed to take an eternity, but the real frustration was the slow pace of traffic. Seeing Su Yue's anxiety, Brother Su smiled affectionately, 'You still act like a kid.' At that moment, Su Yue's phone rang. It was Ming Ansheng calling. She quickly answered. 'Hello?' 'Oh, then I should probably stop by as well.' 'Mmhmm.' After a short talk with Ming Ansheng, Su Yue hung up and looked to Brother Su, 'Brother, I'm afraid I can't join you for dinner. Grandfather Jiang has passed away, and Ming Ansheng is helping out there. I think I should be there too.' She hadn't had much interaction with Jiang Zhuoheng, but their connections were intricate, and most importantly, her relationship with Ming Ansheng was deep. She was his... Wife. They were living together, and they even had a child. That pretty much made her his wife, right? So she felt it was appropriate for her to go. Brother Su, upon hearing this, simply said, 'I'll take you there.' 'Okay.' Su Yue nodded, then glanced at Little Seastar, who was engrossed in the scenery outside. After a moment's thought, she turned to Brother Su, 'Could you take care of Little Seastar for me, or maybe take her home? It's late, and it's not really a place for a child to be.' Chapter 1911: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Seventeen) Su Yan nodded with pleasure, 'I'll take her to have a meal.' As they reached the next traffic light, Su Yan changed direction. The Jiang family, a prominent name in Kyoto, coupled with Jiang Shaomei's prestigious connections, ensured that news of Old Master Jiang's passing spread swiftly. Within just a few hours, those with favorable business relations had arrived to pay their respects. Old Master Jiang was highly esteemed, and the Jiang family unanimously decided to set up the 灵堂 at their residence. The entrance to the Jiang estate was as crowded as a shopping mall parking lot, with cars lined up to the intersection, forming a long queue. Thankfully, the road had been cleared, allowing Su Yan to drop off Su Yue at the Jiang residence's entrance. 'Xiaoqiao, Uncle will take you out to eat, and Mommy will pick you up tonight.' Su Yue affectionately patted Su Xiaoqiao's head before stepping out of the car, 'Brother, drive safely.' After signalling to Su Yan, Su Yue reached to shut the car door. She looked up, paused, and her actions froze. Behind them, a black Cadillac had come to a stop. From the driver's side, a simply dressed woman stepped out. Her raven-black hair was tied back in a basic ponytail, carrying a black bag, her face bare, eyes red and swollen from weeping. 'Xin Yanting.' Su Yue called out almost instinctively upon seeing Xin Yanting. Hearing her name, Xin too paused and looked up to see Su Yue, a flicker of surprise in her eyes. Then, her gaze instinctively shifted to the driver's seat. Seeing a glimpse of Su Yan's side profile, her grip on the bag tightened. Abruptly, she lowered her head and walked past Su Yan's car. 'Brother, you can go back now.' Su Yue closed the car door and quickly followed after Xin Yanting. She wanted to speak, yet didn't know what to say, and considering Xin's likely grief, she decided it was best not to. Thus, she slowed her pace. Near the entrance, she turned back; Su Yan's car was nowhere in sight. She pouted and sighed in resignation. To love is to love; to be indifferent is just that. It's not so much that her brother is aloof, but more unfeeling. Oh dear, Su Yue, how can you think this way about your own brother? She felt sorry for Xin Yanting, seeing her as innocent. But why should women make things difficult for one another? She had always felt guilty and sympathetic towards Xin Yanting. 'What are you thinking about?' While Su Yue was deep in thought, a familiar voice from ahead interrupted—it was Ming Ansheng. She composed herself and looked up, shaking her head slightly, 'Nothing particular.' She ascended the steps, approaching Ming Ansheng. ......  'Xiaoqiao, is there anything else you want to eat?' After dinner, around eight o'clock, with the traffic finally easing, Su Yan drove around the vibrant district with Su Xiaoqiao. The city's multicolored neon lights flickered, casting a mesmerizing glow. At a red light, Su Yan gently pressed the brakes. From the back seat, Su Xiaoqiao's voice rose, 'I want some ice cream.' Su Yan shifted his gaze from the window back to Su Xiaoqiao, a smile spreading across his face, 'You want ice cream again?' Su Xiaoqiao pressed her lips together, her silence a tacit confirmation. Really, who needs to be asked about wanting ice cream? It's a well-known secret among all earthlings, isn't it? Chapter 1912: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Eighteen) Watching her adorable little mannerisms, how could Su Yan bear to refuse her? He suggested, 'Then we shall only get a small serving.' Su Xiaoqiao nodded like she was pounding garlic, 'Mhm.' Her chubby cheeks curved into a smile, her eyes forming beautiful crescents that were as pretty and adorable as the crescent moon itself. As Su Yan drove past several traffic lights, he kept an eye out for an ice cream parlor. He seldom went out shopping or eating out, so the search was somewhat blind. Eventually, as they passed a mall, a Häagen-Dazs sign stood out prominently. His eyes lit up, and pointing towards the Häagen-Dazs, he asked Su Xiaoqiao, 'Häagen-Dazs, is that alright?' 'Yeah, yeah, yeah!' Su Xiaoqiao nodded like she was pounding garlic. To her, as long as it was ice cream and she could have some, the brand mattered little. She was quite unpretentious in her desires. Su Yan parked the car in a space along the curb, then carried Xiaoqiao towards the beckoning Häagen-Dazs store. The time was post-dinner, and there were many people out and about, enjoying a stroll after their meals. The weather was neither too cold nor too warm, and inside the Häagen-Dazs, there were many teenagers, mostly girls, seated in groups, occupying most of the available seating. 'What flavor would you like, Xiaoqiao?' Su Yan asked, hoisting her up to have a look at the large posters displaying the variety of flavors. After a brief glance at the poster, Su Xiaoqiao pointed decisively at one and said, 'I want vanilla and strawberry.' 'Alright then.' Su Yan pointed to the two flavors Xiaoqiao had chosen and told the server, 'We'll have vanilla and strawberry, a double scoop, please.' The server smiled slightly, 'Today our branch is having a promotion with the movie theater in the mall. If you buy a three-flavor ice cream, you'll get two free Little Seastar movie tickets.' She looked at Su Xiaoqiao when she mentioned 'Little Seastar,' a name that obviously catered to children. She was trying to captivate a child's eager heart. Su Xiaoqiao blinked and asked, 'Is Little Seastar any good?' 'The promotional poster over there talks about Little Seastar's adventures with its ocean friends,' the server pointed towards the entrance where the promotional poster was displayed. The poster was filled with various colorful sea creatures, vibrant and enchanting. Interest sparked, Su Xiaoqiao turned back to Su Yan, pouting her lips and in a sweet tone, she said, 'Uncle, I want to watch Little Seastar.' Even though Su Yan treated her very well and doted on her, they didn't spend much time together, so the little girl didn't dare to act too spoiled around him. Every expression she made, even the tiniest bit of willfulness, was so endearing that it made it difficult for anyone to say no, let alone when she tried to please. Su Yan reached out and playfully pinched her little nose, saying with a smile, 'But we can only have a little ice cream, okay?' Su Xiaoqiao knew that meant he had agreed. She nodded and gestured with her chubby little hands, 'Mhm, just a little bit, this little.' 'Okay.' 'Smack...' Seeing Su Yan nod in agreement, Su Xiaoqiao enthusiastically hugged Su Yan and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Her soft little lips left Su Yan momentarily stunned. As he regained his composure, he held her even tighter, wishing nothing more than to cherish her to his very core. It fulfilled a childhood longing he never realized he harbored. Watching his sister being taken to the orphanage, crying and calling out, he had so desperately wanted to hold her and take her home. Chapter 1913: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Nineteen) After purchasing the Tri-Color Ice Cream, three little scoops with three different colors in a paper cup, Su Yan carried Xiaoqiao with one arm and the ice cream in the other as they made their way to her table. Xiaoqiao, wielding a fork, blissfully ate while walking, her face becoming adorably smeared with ice cream. They had obtained two movie ticket vouchers; the cinema was located on the mall's top floor, which had ten floors in total. The elevator in the mall, much like the one in the hospital, stopped nearly at every floor, testing the patience of the adults, but Xiaoqiao, absorbed in her ice cream, was not the least bit hurried. "I'm sorry, there are no tickets left for the next show, and the following one isn't until 9:40 PM." At the cinema's ticket counter, the clerk informed them that the soonest show was sold out, and they would have to wait over an hour for the next one. Su Yan glanced at his wristwatch and said to Xiaoqiao, "It starts at 9:30 PM, and it'll be after 11:00 PM when it's over. That's too late; Xiaoqiao, you can't watch it." He pouted, anticipating the little girl's reaction. Hearing his words, Xiaoqiao's lips drooped in disappointment, and she whispered softly, "I want to watch it." Her enthusiasm had been kindled, and to be told abruptly that they couldn't continue was truly disheartening. "But it's late, and if Xiaoqiao doesn't sleep, she won't grow taller," Su Yan said as he affectionately ruffled her hair with a tender coaxing voice. Xiaoqiao, rather than throwing a tantrum, simply bowed her head and sulked, her downcast expression more heart-wrenching than any outburst. Su Yan felt a twinge of pity; looking around, he noticed a long line across from them. Curious, he glanced upwards to see 'Snowy Love Ice Rink, National Champion Inline Skating Coaches...' His eyes lit up, and pointing in that direction, he proposed to Xiaoqiao, "There's an ice rink over there; how about I take you skating instead?" Following Su Yan's direction, Xiaoqiao saw the long queue of people outside the rink, bustling with activity. She blinked, still pouting, her thoughts lingering on the 'Little Seastar' movie. Yet, since Uncle had mentioned it was quite late and the movie seemed out of the question, she decided that skating would be an acceptable alternative – certainly better than missing out on everything. After some internal deliberation, Xiaoqiao nodded hesitantly, "Alright, let's skate then." Her tone bore a hint of reluctance. Su Yan gently stroked her cheek, reassuring her, "Uncle will take you to see 'Little Seastar' next weekend." Xiaoqiao's eyes brightened, and she held out her pinky to Su Yan, demanding, "Pinky promise." Su Yan extended his pinky, locking it with the little girl's and sealing the promise with a 'stamp'. Dressed in a crisp shirt and exuding an impressive demeanor, Su Yan's height and presence made him stand out in the crowd, and his high attractiveness drew glances from passersby, both married women and single young ladies alike. They envied the adorable interaction between him and Xiaoqiao, wishing they could be the little girl embraced by such an attractive man. They decided to go inline skating on a whim, they lacked any gear, but that was easily resolved with a single word – 'buy.' Money was no obstacle to getting equipped. Su Yan and Xiaoqiao, after ordering and paying, were handed two complete sets of inline skating gear by the sales clerk. "Sir, we have several inline skating coaches from the national team here, including national champions who are experts at teaching children," the clerk enthusiastically recommended their skating coaches to Su Yan. Chapter 1914: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty) Su Yan patiently listened as the instructor finished his introduction, then politely shook his head to decline, 'No need, thank you.' He took the complete set of equipment and led Su Xiaoqiao to a bench in the resting area to change into their skating gear. ... 'Are you ready, my dear? Feeling scared?' After gearing up, Su Yan stood up first then gently pulled Su Xiaoqiao to her feet. They made their way to the rink, step by careful step. The ground was covered with a thick layer of ice, with drafts of cold air rising up, causing Su Xiaoqiao to shiver. She then looked up at Su Yan and shook her head firmly, 'I'm not afraid.' Observing the other children on the rink, their screams and laughter, Su Xiaoqiao's disappointment at not seeing the movie slowly dissipated. Her plump little face blossomed into a bright, flower-like smile. 'You're doing wonderfully, Xiaoqiao. There's no need to fear. Uncle will always hold your hand and protect you,' Su Yan reassured her as he gently coaxed her onto the ice. Holding her small hands, he faced her and pulled her along, skating backward with ease. Su Xiaoqiao expressed surprise, 'Uncle, you can skate?' Su Yan winked at her in response, 'Just watch; you'll see.' He then carefully let go of Su Xiaoqiao's hands and started to glide backward slowly. Suddenly, he spun around with lightning speed, closing the distance in the blink of an eye. Su Xiaoqiao watched with her mouth agape in disbelief, looking at Su Yan with absolute admiration, 'Uncle, that was amazing, you're so skilled!' 'So, do you believe now that your uncle won't let you fall?' Su Yan asked as he smoothly returned to Xiaoqiao's side, taking her hand and guiding her in a slow glide across the ice, all while instructing her with great patience. He wore his own casual clothes, and despite having access to all the gear, he only switched to a pair of skates, foregoing knee pads and the like. However, he spared no effort in ensuring Su Xiaoqiao's safety, outfitting her with knee pads, elbow guards, a helmet, and more. 'Mmhmm,' Su Xiaoqiao nodded, her trust in her uncle immeasurable, her admiration without bounds. At that moment, she would've even helped him count money if he had decided to 'sell' her. 'Uncle, you're the best.' The uncle-niece pair skated in sync, their conversation flowing with delight, when suddenly, from afar, applause broke out. Su Xiaoqiao's gaze shifted toward the sound, and the next moment, she excitedly clutched Su Yan's hand tighter, pointing in the direction she was looking, 'Uncle, look at that sister, she's incredible.' Hearing this, Su Yan turned to look where Su Xiaoqiao was pointing, his expression neutral. He didn't look out of curiosity, but rather instinctively. From that corner, across from them, came the clapping and cheering of children gathered around a girl in a white tracksuit... she must have been just over twenty, surrounded by a group of kids. Su Yan observed her performing consecutive 360-degree spins, just like the move he had shown Xiaoqiao. Her hair, wound up in a topknot, spun so fast her face was indiscernible. She must be the inline skating coach here, with such skills not out of the ordinary. Su Yan glanced at her briefly, intending to look away. Suddenly, the elastic band holding her hair broke, and her raven-black locks tumbled down, forming an elegant curve in the air as she spun. This unexpected event dazzled the spectators with its natural and surprising elegance. However, the skater herself hadn't anticipated this. Surprised by her loose hair, she immediately stopped. Because she halted so abruptly, her body lurched forward, staggering unsteadily. Chapter 1915: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-One) Su Yan instinctively extended his hands, a natural reaction born from his tendency to offer assistance out of compassion. Yet, he had been momentarily distracted, forgetting to maintain the proper distance. 'Teacher, teacher,' The girl teetered, trying to keep her balance. Her pupils quickly encircled her, working together to steady her before she could fall. Recovering her balance, the girl teacher stood tall, head bowed, and cheekily stuck out her tongue to the children, 'How embarrassing, your teacher almost took a spill right in front of everyone.' The incident took place in front of both the children and a circle of observing parents. Despite the potential for embarrassment, her voice revealed no discomfort but instead conveyed a natural and composed demeanor. Such poise... Su Yan was intrigued, his attention irresistibly pulled back to her. With her head down, her long hair fell and shielded her face, leaving him with a singular impression... Tranquility. She seemed to embody what he always sought after... Comfort, serenity, and peace. 'Teacher, you're so pretty,' 'Teacher, you're like a goddess,' The consoling words came from a band of little boys, each eager to be the hero, lavishing their teacher with enthusiastic compliments. The teacher grinned at the boys and tenderly tousled their hair, 'How come you boys are so sweet?' Her voice... it sounded somewhat... Familiar? Recognition sparked within Su Yan; the voice of the skating instructor felt strangely familiar, yet he couldn't place where he had encountered it before. His train of thought was interrupted as Su Xiaoqiao tugged at his sleeve, asking, 'Uncle, isn't that sister very pretty?' Shifting his gaze to his niece, he smiled warmly, 'But not as pretty as you, Xiaoqiao.' Girls of all ages love compliments, and Su Xiaoqiao was no different. She smiled radiantly, 'Uncle, you have great taste.' Su Yan allowed himself a fuller smile. He glanced back towards where the children were, but the skating instructor was no longer in sight. He lightly pursed his lips and looked away. The skating rink would close at half-past nine, and they had skated for just under an hour. After removing their skates, Su Yan efficiently packed the gear and took it in hand. Leading Su Xiaoqiao to the exit, he inquired, 'Did you have fun skating, Xiaoqiao?' Su Xiaoqiao nodded emphatically, 'Very much so.' After responding, she gave one last lingering look at the now-empty rink. Su Yan caught her longing glance and stooped to ask, 'Do you like inline skating?' 'I love it! Can we still come back next time?' Su Xiaoqiao looked up at him hopefully. 'Certainly, next time I'll be your instructor,' Su Yan assured her with a nod. Thrilled, Su Xiaoqiao affectionately embraced Su Yan's leg, 'You're the best, Uncle.' 'Should we go home and get some rest now?' he suggested, lifting her in his arms and moving swiftly away from the rink. She wasn't dressed for the chill; Su Xiaoqiao's hands were icy, and her nose was rosy from the cold. Su Yan enveloped her chilled hands in his warmth as they headed towards the elevator. 'Teacher, goodbye,' 'Goodbye,' The voices of the children saying farewell to their teacher, along with the instructor's replies, drifted from behind them. The female skating instructor's voice still stirred a faint sense of familiarity in Su Yan. Yet it was not as intense as before. Chapter 1916: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Two) Su Yue's gaze shifted, only to see the diminishing figure of a girl, her satin-like hair nearly covering her slender back. The sensation felt hauntingly familiar, reminiscent of a memory from years ago on an old street in N City of country Y... In this world, there appeared to be another girl capable of invoking such emotions within him. The girl had already descended the escalator, vanishing from Su Yue's sight. Yet, the tranquil and comforting feeling she left behind continued to meander through his heart, as though he were admiring a bridge over tranquil waters nestled in the mountains. 'Uncle, what are you looking at?' Su Xiaoqiao inquired, gazing up at Su Yue with wide-eyed curiosity. His train of thought interrupted, he redirected his attention to Xiaoqiao, offering a gentle smile and a slight shake of his head, 'It's nothing, we should head home.' With that, he took her hand and they walked toward the elevator... Despite understanding that death is a part of life, Old Master Jiang's demise weighed heavily on Ah Heng, impacting not just him but the entire Jiang family. Hearts harbor their own mysteries; certain outcomes can be anticipated, yet when they come to pass, acceptance still necessitates time. Yan Rusheng, Ming Ansheng, and their peers, having grown up under Old Master Jiang's watchful eye, stayed by Ah Heng's side, busy until late into the night. As the guests departed and the night deepened, only the male members of the Jiang family, Xin Yanting, and Yan Rusheng's group remained in the quietude of the mourning hall. Xin Yanting and Ah Heng knelt before the hall, her intermittent sobs punctuating the heavy silence. Having grown up in the Jiang household, cherished by Old Master Jiang as his prized jewel and pampered to the skies, she had been away from home for four years. During her time abroad, she maintained daily contact with her grandfather. Even at her busiest, she would call every other day, or at most every two days, if just to exchange greetings. Receiving the news of Old Master Jiang's critical condition, she hurried home but tragically missed his final moments. This likely constituted the main reason for her reluctance to rise - a tangle of guilt and remorse. The vigil was set for Old Master Jiang's nephews and Ah Heng. As the remaining visitors began to leave, Yan Rusheng and his friends decided it was time for their departure. Tranquil, ever the considerate one, took it upon herself to bid farewell, 'Ah Heng, we'll be leaving now.' She walked over to Ah Heng as she spoke. Ah Heng stood to greet her, 'Right, be careful on your way home.' He then looked towards Yan Rusheng and Ming Ansheng, nodding to acknowledge them. Tranquil observed Ah Heng's solemn face and offered her sympathies softly, 'My condolences, do take care.' 'Yes,' Ah Heng responded quietly, 'You should head back, it's late.' Tranquil nodded, 'We'll come back to visit tomorrow.' Her eyes then shifted to Xin Yanting, still kneeling in silent stillness, a world away from the outspoken, arrogant Xin Yanting of the past, invoking a deep sense of compassion. Ah! Love can transform a person, but it can also destroy one. Four years had passed without contact with Xin Yanting, and although Tranquil had often contemplated asking Ah Heng for news, she never did. Despite her continued sense of guilt, even though Su Yue had only acted in kind and ultimately only obtained that thirty percent stake in Rongsheng from her, through a lens of empathy and reason, Xin Yanting was innocent. Chapter 1917: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Three) Yet she assessed the situation from the perspective of a woman, with a heart full of compassion. In the dog-eat-dog world of business, tactics more contemptible than these had once been employed by her own mother. Wen Xuxu gave Xin Yanting a profound look but ultimately did not step forward; the words 'I offer my condolences' to Xin Yanting remained unspoken. With a helpless sigh in her heart, she turned and whispered to Yan Rusheng and Su Yue, 'Let's go.' 'Oh!' Su Yue responded, and as she turned to follow Ming Ansheng, her gaze remained fixed on Xin Yanting. Her thoughts and feelings were in accord with Wen Xuxu's, viewed from the standpoint of womanhood. Likewise, in the end, she could only press her lips together in silent resignation and follow Ming Ansheng away. 'I feel somewhat sorry for Xin Yanting.' Once in the car and on their way, Su Yue, seated in the passenger seat, suddenly spoke. She leaned back, exhausted. Ming Ansheng turned to her with a teasing smile, 'Didn't you use to dislike her?' He gazed at her tenderly, feeling reassured; he knew she had always been kind-hearted, and only those with such kindness would grapple with these feelings. Since her arrival, her attention had been on Xin Yanting, her eyes always filled with guilt. In their eyes, the matter between Su Yan and Xin Yanting was trivial. Gaining trust was a means to an end, a tactical move in the grander scheme. Su Yue pouted and sighed, 'My dislike doesn't stop me from feeling empathy for her as a fellow woman.' Ming Ansheng, with a hint of mischief, raised an eyebrow, 'A woman? Are you certain?' Seeing her furrowed brow, entangled in emotion, he didn't know how to comfort her, so he tried to lighten the mood. 'Cut it out...' Su Yue shot Ming Ansheng a glance but couldn't suppress her laughter. Her laughter lightened the mood, and Ming Ansheng continued to jest, 'We can thank President Su for this, after all.' Defending her uncle, Su Yue countered, 'But President Su did nothing wrong. He just wanted to reclaim the thirty percent stake in Rongsheng. Xin Yanting's feelings for him were unrequited; he never made any promises. It was always her who thought President Su returned her affections.' That seemed to be the case; it always had been. So why did she feel conflicted upon seeing Xin Yanting? Why did she feel guilty? As Su Yue questioned herself inwardly, Ming Ansheng posed the same question, 'So why the conflict?' 'I don't know.' Su Yue ran her fingers through her hair in frustration, 'I've heard that Xin Yanting even got a tattoo for President Su. How deeply must someone love to go to such lengths?' This she had learned from her third sister-in-law, about Xin Yanting's rose tattoo, with President Su's name etched within its petals. Upon hearing it, she felt uneasy. A woman in love can be foolishly naive, willing to declare her feelings to the world, always wanting to give her best to someone else, and once invested, becomes blind to the consequences. How deeply must Xin Yanting have loved President Su to etch his name into her flesh? She likely never imagined that she was merely a pawn in President Su's game. Perhaps it was reminiscent of the pain she once felt when Tang Feiling seared a tattoo into her chest with a hot iron – it felt as though her heart was being carved out. If that tattoo hadn't been related to Ming Ansheng, it would have been little more than a superficial wound. Chapter 1918: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Four) Su Yan wondered if Xin Yanting's tattoo still remained; if it did, whether it caused her pain every time she saw it, and if it had been removed, whether the removal was as painful as the moment she first got it. Her brows were tightly knitted as she gazed out the window, her expression somber. Ming Ansheng looked at her and smiled, "Tattoos are actually a form of art. Some people get them solely for the sake of artistic expression." He was trying to cheer her up, and it worked—she smiled. Turning towards him with a sardonic gaze, she asked, "Did you get your tattoo for the sake of art, or to commemorate the love between you and Sister Meiduo that was never fulfilled?" Ming Ansheng's lips formed a wry smile, "Perhaps we should go back to discussing Xin Yanting and your brother." He didn't want the conversation to shift back to him; it seemed better to calmly accompany her through her thoughts. Sister Meiduo was no longer with them, and Su Yan hadn't meant to disrespectfully invoke her memory just to tease Ming Ansheng—it was merely a spontaneous remark. But the past, no matter what it entailed, was already behind them. Looking out the window at the quiet night roads, a contrast to the once bustling districts, now with storefronts darkened and closed, her mood was heavy, possibly still affected by the visit to the mourning hall. The two fell into silence, and the atmosphere in the car grew still. As the car drove slowly, Su Yan's eyelids began to droop. After they passed the residential area, the interior of the car brightened significantly. Su Yan opened her eyes to see the bright lights of a hospital at the entrance, likely a private facility. The display screen above was still active, flashing with various images. She sighed, "I've heard that after discovering the truth, Xin Yanting attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. She had always looked down on Tang Feiling's obsessive pursuit of you. She was supposed to be someone who could boldly love or hate, someone who knew when to hold on and when to let go. And yet, she considered suicide over a man." This was a rumor she had picked up from Mu Li, who had mentioned it in passing, having heard it from someone else, which made its veracity uncertain. "So, you mean to say that your brother is just a mere man?" Ming Ansheng nodded, intentionally misconstruing her words. Su Yan knew he was teasing her and turned to him with a frown, "Stop twisting my words. What I mean is that, without his remarkable qualities, my brother is just an ordinary man." Setting aside those remarkable qualities, her brother was just an ordinary man... Ming Ansheng watched Su Yan with amusement, shaking his head at the peculiar logic. After a light chuckle, he probed further, "But can you reach any conclusion from all this ruminating?" "No," Su Yan replied, shaking her head, then abruptly stopped, "Let's not think about it anymore. No amount of contemplation will lead to a resolution. It won't change my brother's feelings. If he doesn't love her, he simply doesn't." Seeing her so preoccupied with her thoughts, Ming Ansheng decided to change the topic, "Are you hungry?" "Not at all. Let's pick up Xiaoqiao quickly," Su Yan said. "Alright." ... Upon arriving at Su Yan's home, they knocked on the door. Su Yan, clad in smoke-grey pajamas and bleary-eyed from sleep, answered. Recognizing Su Yan and Ming Ansheng, he understood they had come for Xiaoqiao. "Xiaoqiao has fallen asleep. Let her stay here for the night," he suggested. "She needs to go to kindergarten tomorrow morning," Su Yan pointed out. Xiaoqiao had only just started and had already missed a day. She was still adjusting and couldn't afford to miss another day. Chapter 1919: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Five) 'I'll take her there,' Su Yan said as he yawned. Turning, he pointed to the shoe cabinet, speaking lazily to Su Yue, 'The shoes are in there; grab them yourself.' Dragging his feet languidly, he made his way to the sofa and sat down, continuing to yawn in the corner. After changing her shoes, Su Yue entered the room and asked Su Yan, 'Which room is Su Xiaoqiao in?' Su Yan gestured towards a door, and Su Yue headed there. As she reached the doorway, she paused, noticing the bedside lamp was on, its light dimmed to a soft glow. Standing at the entrance, she saw Su Xiaoqiao lying there, her face serene in sleep, and she couldn't bear to disturb her, fearing she might wake her up. After a moment's consideration, she turned and tiptoed away from the door. Looking to Ming Ansheng who was seated on the sofa, she suggested, 'How about I stay here for the night, and you go back alone?' Before Ming Ansheng could reply, Su Yan quickly suggested, 'Neither of you should leave tonight. Just stay here; it's a long way from here to your house.' Given that he now had a larger house with plenty of rooms, and considering the distance between them – one in the south and the other in the north of the city – it was indeed quite far. Hearing this, Su Yue nodded without hesitation, 'Yes, that sounds good.' Then she addressed Ming Ansheng, proposing, 'Let's both stay here tonight and take Su Xiaoqiao to kindergarten together in the morning.' Ming Ansheng pursed his lips, held back a moment, and then said with a slight smile, 'You stay. I have a meeting early tomorrow at the office; I'll go back.' He had never spent the night at someone else's home, excluding hotels, especially not at the younger... his elder brother-in-law's place. He was sure he'd suffer from insomnia, and he was scared, okay? He'd rather drive for thirty to forty minutes and sleep soundly at his own home. Realizing he had work commitments in the morning, Su Yue didn't insist. She simply said, 'Then be careful on the road.' Ming Ansheng nodded, 'I know. You should go to bed early.' As he stood up, he also looked at Su Yan and nodded, 'I'm leaving now.' Even though he didn't use any formal title or call him 'Third Brother', his tone clearly showed his discomfort, something even Su Yue could detect. Trying to suppress her laughter, Su Yue escorted Ming Ansheng to the door, repeatedly reminding him to be careful, until she saw him enter the elevator and the doors closed. Then she went back inside. 'Ha ha ha...' Once she had closed the door behind her, she couldn't hold back her laughter any longer. While laughing, she walked towards Su Yan. He looked at her amusedly and asked, 'What's so funny, did you find some money?' 'I think Ming Ansheng is so tortured,' continued Su Yue as she took a seat beside Su Yan, still giggling. Su Yan frowned, 'Has he gone silly?' 'It's hard for him to call you 'Third Brother', and he's too embarrassed to say it,' Su Yue explained. Su Yan rolled his eyes, 'The one torturing him isn't me; it must be someone else.' After saying this, he lay back and closed his eyes again. 'Right, Third Brother!' Su Yue laughed again, 'You're so mean, always deliberately teasing him with this.' Hearing this, Su Yan opened his eyes again, looked at her with a frown, and asked, 'How is that teasing? Isn't he supposed to call me 'Third Brother', to call me 'Third Brother'?' 'Sure, sure, sure, are you happy now?' Su Yue stuck out her tongue, then suddenly she moved closer to Su Yan and whispered, 'Third Brother.' The atmosphere suddenly became serious. Su Yan glared at her, 'What is it?' 'Tell me honestly, have you and Xin Yanting ever had anything happen between you?' Su Yue stared intently at Su Yan, as if trying to discern any hint of deceit. Chapter 1920: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Six) Su Yan feigned ignorance. "What exactly are you referring to?" "You know exactly what I’m talking about." Su Yue pouted and huffed, "I just hope you’re not the ultimate heartbreaker." Su Yan couldn’t help but laugh. He reached out and playfully tapped Su Yue’s forehead. "What are you imagining now? Hurry up and go take a shower and head to bed." Then he stood up, stretching lazily as he walked toward the bedroom. Watching his retreating figure, Su Yue couldn’t help but smile. "So, does that mean nothing happened?" "I am a Virgo, after all," came Su Yan’s languid voice. Su Yue lifted her head to look at him, just as his tall silhouette disappeared into the room. I am a Virgo... A twitch formed at the corner of Su Yue's mouth. Despite his slight obsession with cleanliness and his quest for perfection in his emotional and professional life, she had never noticed any typical Virgo traits in him. He seemed to have no expectations of the people around him and was reserved and indifferent, hardly the image of a Virgo. But his implication was clear: nothing substantial had occurred with Xin Yanting, and that put Su Yue at ease. Letting out a deep sigh of relief, Su Yue put down the pillow she had been holding and got up, heading toward her room. ... Yan Rusheng and Wen Xuxu had been absent from the office lately, leaving Su Yan to deal with a heavier workload. Upon arriving in the morning, he had buried himself in a mound of tasks well before the other employees started to trickle in. After resolving a few challenging issues, he glanced at his watch—it was just nine o'clock. As he looked up toward the entrance, he saw the busy silhouettes of his colleagues through the frosted glass door. Each was immersed in the hustle of the morning. He turned his attention away and reached for the white porcelain cup on his desk, only to find yesterday's water still inside. He stood up and walked over to the water cooler. "Uh..." Just as Su Yan got to his feet, the office door suddenly opened, and in came his new secretary, Mi Xiao. Upon seeing Su Yan, Mi Xiao stopped in her tracks, her expression a mix of surprise and nervousness. After a moment's hesitation, she hurriedly apologized, "I'm sorry, Su Yan. I wasn't aware you had arrived so early." She stepped back, as if to leave. Su Yan shook his head with a faint smile, "It's alright." Then he resumed his walk toward the water cooler. He was accustomed to arriving early, but this was the first time the new secretary had encountered it. Nonetheless, it was hardly a matter of concern. Mi Xiao watched Su Yan for a brief moment, seeming to ensure he wasn’t upset, then she pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose and stepped into the office. Holding two green file folders, she walked up to Su Yan's desk, her gaze cautious. Su Yan filled a glass with water and took a sip as he turned back to his desk. Unless there was a board meeting or an important executive gathering, he preferred to dress without a tie—white shirt, black dress pants, and an effortless demeanor that, combined with his inherent indifferent handsomeness, was pleasant to the eye. He approached Mi Xiao, swallowed the water in his mouth, and looked down at her inquiringly, "What's the matter?" This was the first time he had stood so close to his new secretary since her employment began just over two weeks ago, and he realized how petite she was—that he needed to lower his gaze to meet hers. Her large, black-framed glasses nearly covered half her face, and her bangs were trimmed straight across her forehead. At a glance, she seemed plain. Without meaning to, Su Yan found himself taking in every detail of his new secretary, Mi Xiao. Chapter 1921: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Seven) Su Yan then chastised himself internally, for everyone around him seemed to consider him past the prime age for marriage, showing concern and urging him to socialize more with women. Indeed, he was only twenty-eight, but since Aireli and Su Yue were both anxious on his behalf, this time he deliberately chose a female secretary. But whom was he really trying to appease with this action? Su Yan's observation was discreet; thus, Mi Xiao remained unaware as she presented two portions of documents to him. 'President Su, these documents are awaiting your signature,' she said. Su Yan murmured an acknowledgment, took them, placed them on his desk, quickly perused, and then proceeded to sign. As he was signing, Mi Xiao continued, 'You have a lunch appointment with Chairman Wang from the Top 100 Group at noon.' 'Mhm, I know. Are there any other engagements?' Su Yan asked as he handed back the signed documents to Mi Xiao. Receiving the documents, Mi Xiao shook her head. 'No, that's all.' Just as she finished responding, she suddenly recalled something else. 'Oh, Miss Aireli called earlier, asking if you're free tonight.' Upon hearing the name 'Aireli,' Su Yan's expression paused momentarily, as if deep in contemplation. After a brief moment, he gave Mi Xiao a slight nod, 'I've taken note.' He did not provide Mi Xiao with a direct answer regarding his availability. 'I'll step out then.' Holding the documents, Mi Xiao gave a slight nod to Su Yan and turned to walk towards the door. The black flats she wore, with their modest three to four-centimeter heel, made her slender legs appear even more delicate. As her steps tapped lightly on the wooden floor, a soft 'tap tap' sound resonated, gentle like her presence—diminutive and unassuming, in stark contrast to Aireli's high-profile and assertive nature. Involuntarily, Su Yan's gaze shifted towards the door, catching sight of Mi Xiao's petite figure, her ponytail swaying softly behind her. He felt an unexplained sense of comfort. Just as Mi Xiao was about to step out, Su Yan unexpectedly called out, 'Mi Xiao, please make me a cup of red tea.' 'Right away.' Mi Xiao paused, turned back to Su Yan, and replied before exiting. Su Yan settled back into his seat. After a knock and his permission, Mi Xiao re-entered. When she came in, she pushed up the glasses sitting on her nose—a gesture that seemed more deliberate than natural, subtly hinting at her unfamiliarity with the new accessory. It wasn't particularly strange; perhaps she had recently started wearing glasses due to myopia, or it could be that he was mistaken. Su Yan did not ponder further but simply gave Mi Xiao a brief glance before continuing with his work. 'President Su, your red tea is ready.' Mi Xiao announced as she approached Su Yan with the brewed tea. 'Okay, just place it here,' Su Yan responded without lifting his gaze. 'Understood.' As Mi Xiao set the teacup in front of Su Yan, her hands lingered momentarily before retracting. He finally lifted his gaze, his glance unintentionally sweeping over her hands. They were small and fair, yet the knuckles stood out slightly, suggesting hands that have experienced labor. He wasn't involved in the hiring process, as it was managed by the HR department, so he knew little about this new secretary, only her name, the university she graduated from, and that she was a recent graduate on an advanced internship. Regarding the rest—her place of registration, whether she hailed from a rural or urban area, or any other internship experiences—of that, he was completely unaware. Chapter 1922: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Eight) As Su Yan mused, he lifted his gaze to Mi Xiao. From his seated position, there wasn't much difference in their heights. Yet, this shift in perspective offered a new sensation. Her dainty, oval face was calm and fair, and though her simple straight bangs and oversized black glasses were plain, they imparted a sense of ease to Su Yan, like the gentle caress of a spring breeze. It seems that the charm of a girl's appearance is angle-dependent; that's why ladies often opt for specific angles in selfies to capture their best look. As a result, the photos posted on Weibo, a platform akin to Twitter, often showcase the same pose from the same angle. With a chuckle at the thought, Su Yan shook his head, his mind briefly wandering from the presence of his new secretary before him. Mi Xiao watched Su Yan curiously, wondering what had prompted his sudden laughter. Feeling her gaze, Su Yan looked up, meeting her questioning eyes. The smile naturally receded from his face, returning to his usual detached expression. It was peculiar for him to find himself analyzing a woman in his very ordinary secretary. As the smile disappeared from Su Yan's face, Mi Xiao quickly inquired, "Su Zong, do you need anything else?" Su Yan shook his head, "No, you may go." "Alright." Mi Xiao nodded and turned to leave. Just then, Su Yan recalled something and looked up at her, "Reply to Miss Aireli that I'll be available after work tonight." "Oh," Mi Xiao responded, her tone betraying a touch of gloom. It could dampen anyone's spirits. Miss Aireli was evidently well-acquainted with Su Yan, casually visiting his office. Their seemingly special relationship was the talk among colleagues; why didn't they just contact each other directly instead of using the office phone? Later that afternoon, Su Yan received another update from Mi Xiao that Aireli had called, and they had scheduled dinner for the evening.... "Su Zong, if there's nothing pressing, may I leave now?" At 5:10 pm, ten minutes after the official end of the workday, Mi Xiao knocked on Su Yan's office door, standing there with an air of anticipation. Although she typically appeared overly cautious, her actions and decisions were marked by sound logic and high efficiency. One might expect her to err out of hastiness, yet she had never faltered, resembling a child who seems on the verge of stumbling while learning to walk but remains steadfast. Su Yan smiled at this notion, finding the sense of familiarity peculiar. Mi Xiao stood by, awaiting his reply. Gathering his thoughts, he instructed her, "Please prepare another cup of coffee for me." There was still a significant workload ahead, and he needed an energizer. "Oh..." Mi Xiao's composure gave way to a hurried stance, mirroring the urgency she felt within. She moved closer to the office, towards Su Yan, and reached for his cup. Suddenly pausing, she looked at him, asking with a trace of doubt, "Su Zong, you mean actually brew it, right?" Her expression silently conveyed her protest: the inconvenience of brewing coffee this late didn't escape her. With this in mind, Su Yan couldn't help but smile again before he reassured her, "If you're in a hurry, instant is fine too." He sensed that Mi Xiao must have something urgent to attend to, especially since it was already past working hours and there were no difficult tasks awaiting her. It wasn't necessary to keep her any longer. Chapter 1923: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Twenty-Nine) 'I don't have any pressing matters,' Mi Xiao stated, shaking her head, her evenly-trimmed bangs fluttering with the movement, gleaming with a sleek darkness under the office light. Yet, there was a hint of insincerity in the clarity of her eyes that did not escape President Su's notice. She appeared clearly anxious... He chose to overlook it and waved her off with a casual gesture: 'Then proceed to make it, but without any sugar, please.' 'Understood.' Mi Xiao nodded, her delicate hands tightly clutching the cup. As she turned to leave, President Su caught a fleeting frown on her brow. He silently laughed to himself, finding it unexpectedly amusing that after a long day at work, he was compelled to tease the young intern. The coffee machine was positioned within his office. While Mi Xiao attended to it, he flipped through his phone. As the fragrance of the brewing coffee enveloped the space, he directed his gaze away from his phone. She stood in front of the coffee machine, her back to him, motionless and silent, as if lost in thought while awaiting the coffee. There was something about this kind of silent companionship that President Su cherished—the sort that didn't interrupt his work yet provided a comforting presence. It was vastly different from... Xin Yanting, who always seemed desperate to assert her presence. 'President Su, have a look at this bag I purchased today—it's the latest from Burberry, and it pairs so well with my white dress, wouldn't you agree?' 'President Su, which lipstick shade do you prefer, this one or yesterday's?' 'President Su, would you fancy some milk tea?' 'President Su, may I join you on your European journey?' 'President Su, you...' Reflecting on Xin Yanting's constant overtures for attention, President Su smirked inwardly at himself. He questioned how he had managed to tolerate it. It turned out he was not so different from most men after all—not as noble or distinctive as he had once considered himself. 'President Su, the coffee is prepared.' Roused from his thoughts by Mi Xiao's voice, he observed her approaching with the steaming beverage. The aroma mingled with the steam, teasing his senses as he took note of Mi Xiao's slightly calloused hands. 'Have a cup as well,' he suggested nonchalantly. Mi Xiao appeared momentarily taken aback by the offer, her eyes widening for a brief second before she declined, 'No, thank you.' She shook her head gently, her initial surprise quickly subsiding without the excitement that might typically accompany such an invitation. She remained composed. President Su arched an eyebrow, 'Is there something urgent on your end?' Once again, Mi Xiao shook her head, 'No, there isn't.' Her impatience was subtly apparent, though she seemed unaware of it herself. President Su, with a soft smile, decided not to prolong the teasing, 'If there's nothing else, you may leave for the day.' After acknowledging him with a nod, he sipped his coffee, ready to immerse himself in the significant workload that awaited him. Feeling relieved, Mi Xiao's earlier frustration vanished. 'I shall take my leave then,' she said, offering President Su a respectful nod before adding, 'Please remember, you have a dinner engagement with Miss Aireli at seven o'clock this evening.' 'Noted,' he acknowledged. Seven o'clock... As Mi Xiao exited his office, President Su glanced at the digital clock—it was already six. He picked up his phone, weighing his next move, when an unexpected knock at the door caught his attention. He peered through the frosted glass, his eyes set upon the enigmatic tall figure standing outside. Chapter 1924: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Thirty) "Come in." President Su shelved the tangled web of thoughts he had been sorting through, offering a muted response to someone at the door, then tidied up the array of documents scattered across his desk. As the door swung open, a stylishly tall and poised woman stepped into his office. He wasn't taken aback—his face assumed a courteous smile as he greeted her, 'Miss Aireli.' Aireli was clad in a pale aqua blouse with a delicate print, paired with white slim-fit trousers that accentuated her lithe frame. A departure from her professional look, her face bore only light makeup, enhancing her natural beauty. Her ensemble was topped with sky-high heels (at least ten centimeters), in a pale hue. The whole outfit radiated a fresh, vernal charm. With graceful strides, she approached President Su, smiling softly. "President Su, I didn't want to disturb you if you were in the middle of something, so I decided to wait for you here." President Su's lips curved into a restrained smile, though it failed to reach his preoccupied eyes, as he shook his head. "Not to worry, I've just wrapped up. We can head out." He shut down his laptop and rose, making his way to the coat stand to retrieve his jacket, slinging it over his forearm. Aireli's gaze drifted to the towering stack of work on his desk. She regarded him earnestly. "President Su, I'm free this evening and not particularly hungry. There's no rush for dinner." A rare chance for one-on-one time with him—a restaurant setting would certainly be thrilling. She would be content just to sit there, watching him work—such a simple joy. Aireli's eyes lingered on President Su's striking features, her mind drifting into a daydream, ensnared by the allure of his enigmatic presence. "We should get going a bit earlier; our reservation is for seven," President Su said, his voice cool and detached. With President Su leaving the office, Aireli found herself naturally compelled to follow. Throughout their journey, she engaged President Su in conversation, her efforts to find topics seamless and spontaneous—not the forced chatter that can be so telling. President Su gripped the steering wheel, eyes fixed ahead. The days had lengthened with the advent of early summer, and it was still light out past six. But the evening businesses had already lit up their neon signs, casting an array of vivid colors on the streets below, stirring a strange complexity in his mood. "President Su, red light!" Aireli's sudden cry jolted him from his thoughts. The car had already cruised into the intersection, past the crosswalk. The perpendicular flow of vehicles and pedestrians had commenced, and he couldn't speed through—only brake sharply. The car halted, inertia pressing them forward. Fortunately, they were braced for it and avoided injury. Once the car was steady, Aireli's concern was palpable as she inquired, "President Su, you seemed miles away just now—what was it that had you so preoccupied?" "Just work stuff," President Su replied lightly, then offered her an apologetic smile. "I'm sorry for startling you." She dismissed it with a shake of her head. "I'm fine." The red light waned, and the green beckoned them on. The car resumed its cautious advance across the street. President Su made a concerted effort to rein in his emotions and focus, ensuring he wouldn't lose concentration again. He couldn't pinpoint exactly what had distracted him so profoundly. He had been listening to Aireli discuss the stock market, yet his mind had wandered. It was seven o'clock—prime dinner time—and the upscale Western restaurant thrummed with the lively chatter of its well-heeled patrons, not an empty seat in sight. They had reserved ahead, so seating was not a concern. Their table was in a private booth, set behind traditional beaded curtains, offering privacy and a touch of elegance amidst the dining hall's hum of conversation, the clink of cutlery, and the soft melody playing in the background. Chapter 1925: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Thirty-One) The dishes were served promptly; classic steaks and signature appetizers crafted by the head chef were their choices for the evening. Aireli also picked out a bottle of red wine. A tall, slender waiter attentively arranged their table and proceeded to uncork the wine, ready to pour. Aireli looked up at him with a gracious smile and said, 'Thank you, we'll pour it ourselves.' Heeding her words, the waiter set the bottle aside, nodded courteously, and withdrew. Now alone in the private dining area, Su Yan had removed his suit jacket and was dressed in a white shirt, his cufflinks undone, sleeves casually rolled up a notch. Knife and fork in hand, he elegantly carved his steak. 'President Su, let's have a drink,' Aireli suggested, tilting the wine bottle toward his glass. Su Yan glanced at it as if to speak up, but Aireli, sensing his hesitation, paused her pouring and looked his way. After a moment, Su Yan averted his eyes and continued cutting his steak without a word. Interpreting this as consent, Aireli smiled slightly and poured wine into Su Yan's glass with finesse, then into her own. With the wine poured, she picked up her glass, lifted it towards Su Yan, and smiled, 'President Su, to our enjoyable collaboration.' Su Yan put down his utensils, raised his glass, and their glasses touched, his voice even, 'To a fruitful collaboration.' They each took a refined sip of wine. Aireli then turned to Su Yan with a smile. 'You know, I'm rather surprised.' Su Yan raised an eyebrow, inviting her to continue. 'I'm surprised you agreed to dinner today, President Su. You always seem so busy; every time I've seen you, you're engrossed in your work, barely having a moment to talk,' Aireli said. Su Yan responded with an apologetic smile, 'I'm sorry if I've ever seemed inattentive.' 'It's fine, it's the nature of successful people, I understand,' Aireli replied, taking another delicate sip from her glass. Her lips, enticingly coated with a vibrant hue, now bore a trace of the wine's color, adding a touch of irresistible charm, and whether intentional or not, she did not wipe it away but continued to smile at Su Yan. Unfortunately for Aireli, Su Yan's glance was mere courtesy, his attention quickly returning to his meal after a brief acknowledgment. Having had a busy day, with a working lunch and missing out on afternoon tea, he was truly hungry. Noticing Su Yan's concentration on his meal, Aireli felt a twinge of disappointment and listlessly wiped her mouth with a napkin. She then resumed cutting her steak, methodically bringing pieces to her lips. As a celebrated actress with a legion of fans, she maintained her composure, her interest in a man never reducing her to a lovesick fan. The remainder of their meal passed in silence, which persisted until they had finished. After paying the bill, Su Yan and Aireli walked side by side out of the restaurant, Aireli donning her sunglasses as they strolled. 'Nini, watch your step.' As they stepped out of the revolving door, a woman nearby guided a little girl into it. The girl, about three or four and plumply adorable, caught Aireli's attention. This sight prompted a question from Aireli to Su Yan, 'President Su, that adorable little girl from your office the other day, she was your niece, wasn't she?'}
