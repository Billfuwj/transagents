Chapter 834: Return to the Sacred Land (Part Two) "朱雀." Within the Bamboo House, Bai Yan watched Bai Xiaochen and Xiao Long'er, her children, as they frolicked and scuffled. Suddenly, her reflections were interrupted by a disturbance outside. Her 柳眉 (willow-leaf eyebrows) furrowed slightly, and she inquired, "What commotion unfolds beyond these walls? Why is there such a clamor? Investigate for me, please." "Certainly, 王后 (Wanghou)." 朱雀 (Vermilion Bird) performed a respectful fist-and-palm salute before departing to carry out the task. A short time later, she returned, cautiously opening the door, and hesitantly reported, "王后 (Wanghou), two individuals are outside requesting to see you..." "Seeking me?" Bai Yan's eyebrows lifted in curiosity. "Then I shall go and see who has come to find me." She rose gracefully from her chair and proceeded towards the entrance. Outside, beneath a crimson sky, two figures crawled forward, quivering as if carrying an immense burden. Their passage left a vivid trail of blood, which caught Bai Yan's eye, striking a harsh contrast. "What is this behavior?" Bai Yan asked sharply, her voice slicing through the stillness as her brows drew together. The Second Elder's countenance was ghostly pale, and he lay splayed on the ground, tremors running through him as he confessed, "王后 (Wanghou), I come seeking your pardon. It was I who naively trusted the impostor, causing your misjudgment of the Emperor. The fault is mine alone, and I willingly accept any punishment you decree." "No, 王后 (Wanghou), the fault lies with me for failing to relay the Emperor's edict. He left the palace to unseal the Demon Realm and bade me inform you, which I did not, allowing scoundrels an opportunity," Huo Yu implored, kneeling with a face streaked by tears. He offered up a bamboo staff, held between both hands to Bai Yan, and bowed deeply, resigned to his fate. Bai Yan's hand slowly took hold of the staff proffered before her, her expression serene, her eyes reflecting an inscrutable light. As Huo Yu felt the staff leave his grasp, he stiffened, bracing for the imminent strike. Yet, the expected pain did not come. Confounded, Huo Yu looked up only to witness Bai Yan command a flame that consumed the staff, reducing it to cinders in a blink. "Have your ordeals along this path not been sufficient penance?" "王后 (Wanghou)?" Huo Yu looked at Bai Yan, befuddled by her enigmatic utterance. "If that is the case, then consider your debts repaid. Stand," Bai Yan decreed with a voice that resonated with authority. Bai Yan has always been a person of clear convictions. Her animosity was reserved solely for those who plotted against her. If she herself could be deceived, then how could she reproach the Great Elder and Huo Yu? Thus, she harbored no resentment towards them... Huo Yu remained motionless, struggling to comprehend that Bai Yan had so effortlessly forgiven them. They had braced themselves for severe chastisement, yet she had spared them without delivering even a single blow, absolving their sins with but a simple gesture. Observing the pair still kneeling, dumbstruck and immobile, Bai Yan's voice grew stern, "Do you still expect me to help you to your feet?" Her incisive words jolted Huo Yu into action, and he ascended from the ground, his legs wobbly, his trousers soaked in blood. Despite this, he stood resolutely, his legs quaking but not collapsing into a kneel again. Recognizing their plight, Bai Yan gestured towards a stone seat nearby, "Take a seat. Once you have rested, you may descend the mountain." Chapter 835: Return to the Sacred Land (Part Three) Tears of gratitude glistened in Huo Yu's eyes as he touched the damp trails on his pale cheeks, his face a canvas of deep appreciation. 'Your Majesty, the depth of your benevolence and mercy to Huo Yu is something I shall remember for a lifetime.' Without the Queen's absolution, he would no longer have a place in the Demon Realm. Her vast magnanimity was his deliverance. 'The fault does not lie with you; I too was hoodwinked, and thus have no grounds to reproach you,' Bai Yan spoke with a touch of melancholy. 'Furthermore, I acknowledge your genuine allegiance to the Demon Realm. I expect your unwavering fidelity to Emperor Cang from this point forward.' The Second Elder approached a stone throne and seated himself, his eyes heavy with contrition. 'The Queen's forbearance in not casting blame speaks to her greatness. However, I cannot exonerate my own conduct. Henceforth, my absolute loyalty is vowed to both the King and Queen.' Bai Yan let out a soft sigh and offered, 'These are two elixirs for mending wounds. Once ingested, your injuries shall heal. The Vermilion Bird prefers solitude; it would be prudent for you to depart from the mountain soon.' After handing over the elixirs, she turned and entered the Bamboo House. The Vermilion Bird, choosing not to enter, observed the Second Elder consume the elixir before landing a resolute kick upon him. The strike toppled the Second Elder, but fortunately, the elixir had already begun to soothe any further injury. 'Great Vermilion Bird,' the Second Elder began, his posture undone, eliciting a measure of sympathy. 'In the midst of that turmoil, why did you not seek my judgment?' The Vermilion Bird, her anger barely restrained, demanded an explanation. Trembling, the Second Elder replied feebly, 'The King... rather, the impostor, expressly forbade me from informing anyone, including the Great Elder and yourself. He was overwhelmed by the fear that the Queen might be apprised.' 'Fool!' The ire in the Vermilion Bird's eyes was unmistakable as she rebuked him, 'Were it not for the Queen's mercy, and my reluctance to contravene her wishes, your punishment would have been more severe than a mere kick! Now that you have regained your strength, leave immediately!' At her command, they withdrew from the mountain swiftly, disappearing as quickly as clemency was extended. After their exit, the Vermilion Bird entered the house, her gaze falling warmly upon Bai Yan. A sliver of hurt passed through her fiery red eyes, 'Your Majesty, my outrage was aimed solely at his imbecility. You... do you harbor any resentment towards me?' Bai Yan shook her head, her laughter light, 'You were simply incensed. With your anger now released, do you feel at ease?' The Vermilion Bird nodded fervently, her eyes brimming with tentative hope, 'Your Majesty, with your return, will you... will you stay in the Demon Realm, or is another departure imminent?' Bai Yan hesitated, her lips curling into a tender smile, 'Regrettably, I must venture away from the Demon Realm temporarily, but rest assured, my return will be swift.' The Vermilion Bird's mood lifted at Bai Yan's words, her eyes gleaming with joy. Her visage was captivating, her fiery garment a dazzling display of splendor. 'Your Majesty, I am currently bound to the Sacred Mountain, but when you encounter the Black Tortoise, please bring them back to me. Then, I will be free from this place...' Like a warrior from a bygone era, ready to rejoin you in the impending battles! A glint of nostalgia shone in the Vermilion Bird's eyes, as though through the crimson sky, she could glimpse the glory and fervor of days long past... Chapter 836: Return to the Sacred Land (Part Four) She held firm to the belief that one day, she would have a heartfelt reunion with her brothers, and that the erstwhile Queen would make a formidable comeback. 'Chen'er, Xiao Long'er, let's go.' Bai Yan's smile was a tender beacon, her hand clasping Bai Xiaochen's, and the other enfolding Xiao Long'er's little hand, her eyes aglow with joyous laughter. 'Mother, where are we going?' Bai Xiaochen's large, innocent eyes shimmered with curiosity as he looked up at Bai Yan. 'We're going to see your father...' Bai Yan paused briefly, 'With the crisis in the Demon Realm averted, it's time I revisited the Sacred Land.' 'The Sacred Land?' Bai Xiaochen's eyes sparkled, 'Does that mean we will see Honorary Uncle? I've missed Honorary Uncle and Chu Sister.' With a fond tap on Bai Xiaochen's forehead, Bai Yan replied affectionately, 'I've told you many times, she is your Honorary Uncle's sister. If you call her 'Sister,' does that not misplace her a generation below us?' Bai Xiaochen touched his forehead, his little face a look of innocent bewilderment, 'But... Chu Sister won't let me call her 'Auntie,' or else she won't engage in mischief with fire with me...' Realizing what he had just said, Bai Xiaochen's eyes darted about in a flurry of anxiety as he quickly tried to clarify, 'Mother, you must have misunderstood, I didn't mean I wanted to engage in mischief with fire... I was just...' 'No need for explanations!' Bai Yan laughed coldly, 'I had thought it was Chu Yiyi who was a bad influence on you, but it seems you have a natural penchant for fire! I will make sure to mention this to your Grandmaster. After all, you share the blame for the burning of the Treasure Pavilion!' 'Mother...' Bai Xiaochen's plea was tinged with desperation as he clutched Bai Yan's sleeve, 'I know I was wrong. Could you perhaps not mention it to the Grandmaster?' 'Hmm...' Bai Yan pondered, stroking her chin thoughtfully, 'I shall decide based on my mood.' With that, she led the two delicate children by the hand, her laughter soft and light as they stepped out of the Bamboo House. Despite the seals being lifted, the sky above the Demon Realm still bled crimson, as if submerged in a sea of blood, the scarlet hue enshrouding the entire world... ... Within the grand hall, Emperor Cang rested his chin in his hand, his domineering presence filling the space, making the man reporting to him sweat profusely, his form trembling slightly. Suddenly, a figure in red caught Emperor Cang's eye. His typically dominating and icy gaze softened. With a flutter of his robes, he was instantly at the woman's side, his hand tenderly drawing her into his embrace. 'What brings you here? Did I not ask you to rest upon the Sacred Mountain?' His voice, once unheard of in its tenderness, suggested that as if nothing else in the world mattered but the woman in his arms. 'I have come to discuss something with you; I need to make a brief return to the Sacred Land.' 'Very well, I shall accompany you later.' Emperor Cang furrowed his brow, deep in thought, before relaxing, his lips curving into a faint smile. 'That won't be necessary.' Bai Yan gently declined, 'I shall return promptly, and you have many matters to attend to. There's no need for you to accompany me this time.' In that instant, Bai Yan recalled the words of the Holy Master. At this moment... The gulf between her strength and Emperor Cang's was immense. She must quickly enhance her abilities to fight alongside him as an equal. And for her, the only way to increase her power was to return to the Sacred Land. 'Are you worried I might clash with Chu Yifeng?' Emperor Cang's voice carried a hint of jealousy. Chu Yifeng held a special place in Bai Yan's heart. He had been a constant presence when she needed support the most, often appearing at her side. This fact alone was enough to rouse the emperor's jealousy. Chapter 837: Assigning Her as the Referee (Part One) As Emperor Cang concluded his remarks, the woman before him rose on her toes for a tender kiss, her arms encircling his neck. Her kiss was deep and affectionate, spinning an endless yarn of love. After a moment, Bai Yan released her hold, her delicate hands caressing his head with care: "Be patient, wait for me here, I'll return before long..." Her voice, as gentle as one soothing a timid creature, irresistibly softened his heart. Hence, he could not find it in himself to refuse her any longer, and he whispered softly in agreement, "All right, after I've resolved the Demon Realm's affairs, I will come for you." Bai Yan nodded slightly: "Xiaochen, Xiao Long'er, let us head to the Sacred Land." "Father," Bai Xiaochen glanced at Bai Yan and then at Emperor Cang, his large eyes sparkling like stars, "Please, remember the promise you made to Xiaochen. After I visit my godfather and the Grandmaster, I will return to the Demon Realm, and then you must allow me to train in the Secret Realm." Emperor Cang's chuckle was filled with warmth: "When have I ever broken a promise? Upon your return, I will personally escort you to the Secret Realm for training." "Agreed." Bai Xiaochen's smile radiated innocence and brilliance, outshining even the sun's romantic glow. "Xiaochen will strive to grow stronger, to become the wings that shelter Mother from all storms." His youthful face was brimming with unwavering determination, his eyes filled with steadfast resolve. He feared no peril of the Secret Realm if it meant protecting his mother! Bai Yan was about to caution Bai Xiaochen, but seeing the excitement on the child's face, she found herself speechless, the words of restraint impossible to utter. Emperor Cang, sensing Bai Yan's concern, reassuringly embraced her shoulders: "You needn't worry; I will ensure Xiaochen's safety. Besides, as the Crown Prince of the Demon Realm, his duty is to protect his mother and sister! It is his inevitable destiny." Bai Yan gave Emperor Cang a questioning look: "And where might his sister be?" With a sly grin, Emperor Cang whispered into Bai Yan's ear, his voice laden with implication: "Should you wish, we could always have another..." The most beautiful of intimations are those left unspoken; like when children are mentioned, met with a whisper, 'If you wish for more, they can be yours at any time.' In that moment, Bai Yan's ears grew warm; she coughed lightly, turning away from Emperor Cang's phoenix eyes, which were filled with desire. "The day grows late; I must depart." A thought suddenly crossed her mind, and she looked up at Emperor Cang: "Furthermore, I have forgiven the Second Elder and Huo Yu; you no longer need to trouble yourself with them." A frown momentarily crossed Emperor Cang's brow. Truthfully, had it not been for those two, Yan'er would not have felt compelled to leave. Nevertheless... Since Yan'er had decided upon forgiveness, he would honor her decision. "Mischievous Father, farewell for now." Bai Xiaochen gestured a playful goodbye to Emperor Cang, following Bai Yan as they moved towards the exit. "Hold on." Suddenly, a voice resonated from behind. Bai Yan paused, turning to see the silver-haired man approaching. "Emperor Cang, is there something else?" "I will escort you." With an assertive yet smiling gaze, Emperor Cang walked beside Bai Yan, his grip on her hand firm. "Very well." This time, Bai Yan did not resist; with a light smile, she replied, "After all, I am to return; why such urgency?" "I simply wish to cherish every moment I spend with you," he declared. She had preferred he stay behind, and he had respected her wishes, yet he longed for just a few moments more by her side. Chapter 838: Let Her Be the Referee (Part Two) Bai Xiaochen trailed behind the two adults, lips pursed in a sulk, her delicate face painted with disappointment. "I can't shake the feeling... ever since Mother accepted 坏蛋爹爹 (Naughty Daddy), I've become redundant," she muttered. Xiao Long'er, his large eyes blinking with innocence, turned to the figure beside him, carved with delicate grace. "Why do you say that?" "Mother used to hold me all the time, but now that 坏蛋爹爹 (Naughty Daddy) is here, if she just hugs me once, he throws me out..." Bai Xiaochen's lips puckered more deeply, "So, I feel like maybe I'm not really 坏蛋爹爹 (Naughty Daddy)'s own child... Maybe I was picked up somewhere?" The Sacred Land, shrouded in a mystical fog, appeared as a celestial haven. Now, the Sacred Land buzzed with noise. Bai Yan, arriving at its edge, was met with a sea of people. Confusion flickered across her eyes as she whispered to herself, "What has happened in the Sacred Land?" She had been gone only a short while; why were there so many people gathered here now? "Miss, are you not here for the Sacred Land's 招生大会 (Recruitment Conference)? How come you don't know what's happening?" A youth, noticing Bai Yan's perplexed expression, spoke up with a gentle explanation. "A 招生大会 (Recruitment Conference) in the Sacred Land again?" Bai Yan's exquisite face showed a hint of surprise. The Sacred Land had just recently sent people to recruit disciples; why was there another event so soon? Could it be that something significant had occurred within the Sacred Land? "Mother," Bai Xiaochen yawned, "I wish to see 干爹 (Godfather) and 师公 (Grandmaster). Shall we go in now?" "Of course." Bai Yan, holding Bai Xiaochen with one hand and Xiao Long'er with the other, made her way briskly towards the Sacred Land's main gate. But the path ahead was clogged with too many people, forcing them to weave through the crowd to reach the Sacred Land. "Make way!" Suddenly, a hand reached out from the side, aiming to shove Bai Yan aside. Bai Yan's gaze sharpened, and she quickly pulled Bai Xiaochen to the side, dodging the intrusive hand. The owner of the hand, upon noticing this, shot a glare back at Bai Yan and scolded in a cold voice, "Have you not seen that the young mistress of the 火炎门 (Flame Sect) has arrived? Everyone else, step aside immediately!" The 火炎门 (Flame Sect), a revered second-tier sect, commanded a significant presence just below the 妖兽宗 (Beast Demon Sect) on this continent. With the proclamation of the young mistress's arrival, the crowd at the front hastily dispersed, parting to create a clear pathway. In the midst of all the onlookers, a woman in a resplendent red dress walked up from behind. A silver snake coiled around her wrist, her lips curled into a serene smile as she advanced with grace. "That's 火云 (Huo Yun), the young mistress of the 火炎门 (Flame Sect), renowned as a 驯兽师 (Beast Tamer). See that 银蛇 (silver snake) on her arm? It's a testament to her skill, subdued by her own hands." "Impressive. With such talent, even the 妖兽宗 (Beast Demon Sect) would eagerly recruit her. Unfortunately, 火云 (Huo Yun) is the precious daughter of the 火炎门 (Flame Sect); she's unlikely to become a disciple of another sect." Admiring murmurs spread through the crowd. With the young mistress of the 火炎门 (Flame Sect) attending the Sacred Land's 招生大会 (Recruitment Conference), their own prospects seemed diminished. "Mother, that lady looks quite plain, yet she dares to wear red. Only you, Mother, can truly complement such a splendid color," Bai Xiaochen's candid voice pierced the crowd's hush, swiftly drawing all eyes upon them. Chapter 839: Appointing Her as Referee (Part Three) Bai Xiaochen's cheeks puffed with indignation, his gaze locked onto the Silver Snake coiled around Huo Yun's wrist, exuding a domineering air despite his youth. His lack of affection for Huo Yun was understandable; not only were the Flame Sect guards notably arrogant, but Huo Yun was also allied with the serpent tribe. Bai Xiaochen's bond with Qing Luan and Sister Qing Xue left him with a deep-seated aversion to all serpent-kind. If not for those despised serpents, his mother would have been spared much suffering... Sensing the imposing aura from Bai Xiaochen, the Silver Snake shrank back, its forked tongue no longer flicking out, and fear shone in its tiny eyes. 'How dare you!' The Flame Sect guard was enraged. Few on this continent dared display such insolence toward his mistress! However, just as the guard was about to erupt in fury, Huo Yun furrowed her brow and held him back. 'We are in the Sacred Land! Without my command, no one is to cause trouble!' Huo Yun was aware of her place; despite her usual audacity, she wouldn't dare to incite disorder at the gates of the Sacred Land. And as for the mother of this child... She was clearly here for the Recruitment Conference. Huo Yun could wait to confront her at the event and settle their score. 'Let's proceed; our cousin should be here to receive us.' As Huo Yun turned away, she was oblivious to Bai Yan having already reined in her own menacing aura. Had Huo Yun not intervened, the guard might very well have been drenched in his own blood. 'Mother,' Bai Xiaochen blinked, turning to Bai Yan, 'may Chen'er seek retribution?' Bai Yan's lips lifted in a faint smile: 'If we are not offended, we do not initiate conflict. But should they offend you, Chen'er, show no mercy.' Her message was unequivocal—if these individuals wronged Bai Xiaochen, he was at liberty to retaliate, and she would stand by his actions. As Huo Yun reached the entrance, the crowd saw a man emerge to greet her, his delighted stride heading towards Huo Yun. 'Cousin, you've finally arrived.' Huo Yun's demeanor shifted from ice to a shy blossom, her eyes cast demurely downward: 'Cousin brother, father must have informed you that I am here to participate in the Recruitment Conference; I rely on Cousin Ya Han's assistance.' Lin Ya Han's laughter boomed, 'Do not fret, with your esteemed lineage, admission to the Sacred Land is certain. Shortly, we shall be fellow disciples.' The crowd watched Huo Yun and Lin Ya Han vanish into the Sacred Land, their eyes gleaming with envy. 'So, Huo Yun's cousin is within the Sacred Land.' 'And I've heard Lin Ya Han's master will serve as one of the referees for the disciple selection.' 'That child who slighted her just now, his prospects at the Recruitment Conference might well be doomed...' Bai Yan absorbed the murmurs of the crowd, her willow brows knitting together. Following earlier cheating scandals, she had requested the Grandmaster purify the Sacred Land. Yet, deception seemed to endure? 'Chen'er, our return is most opportune.' A gentle smile flickered across Bai Yan's lips. She was resolved to report the day's events to the Grandmaster, calling for heightened scrutiny during the contest. She would brook no further favoritism or corruption within these sacred confines! With a determination as resolute as her march, Bai Yan, hand in hand with Bai Xiaochen and Xiao Long'er, made her way through the multitude toward the grand gateway of the Sacred Land. Chapter 840: Her Appointment as the Referee (Part Four) Before her return to the Sacred Land, Bai Yan had dispatched a message to the Grandmaster, who had thus instructed the gatekeepers and had provided them with her portrait. When Bai Yan arrived, the gatekeepers, recognizing her, circumvented the standard invitation check and granted her unhindered entry into the Sacred Land. 'This... Why does this lady not have an invitation?' 'Could she have a powerful patron within the Sacred Land?' 'It seems likely; otherwise, where does she get the gall to stand up to Lady Huo Yun?' ...... The crowd's murmurs failed to reach Huo Yun, who had retreated from the throng. After some distance, she paused, her lips pursed, 'Cousin, did you see the woman with two children earlier?' Lin Ya Han was taken aback, 'What about her?' 'That woman's son insulted me with his insolent tongue. When the time comes for the Disciple Recruitment Contest, I hope... she will be outright rejected!' Huo Yun's jaw clenched, her eyes flashing with an icy glint. For her cousin, under the tutelage of an Elder, such a matter was inconsequential... 'Don't worry, cousin. Those who offend you will not be given the chance to progress,' Lin Ya Han reassured her with a laugh. He had prepared for a grave situation, but for him, resolving this minor inconvenience was effortless. ...... Unaware of the conversation between Huo Yun and Lin Ya Han, Bai Yan had crossed through the Holy Gates en route to the Sacred Island. Since her departure from the Sacred Land, she had committed the Sacred Island into the care of the Grandmasters. Consequently, they were certainly awaiting her arrival... From afar, Bai Yan's gaze found three venerable elders deep in a serene tea conversation. Her demeanor softened, and a tender smile adorned her lips. These three masters had been a source of immense warmth and support to her since her arrival on this continent, especially during her most challenging times... 'Disciple?' Ren Yi, spotting Bai Yan, his eyes alight with recognition, stood up promptly, 'You've returned?' His exclamation drew the attention of the Great Elder Zheng Qi and Third Elder Qiu Shurong, who turned their surprised and joyous gazes toward the approaching group—one adult and two children. 'Wait, is this young lady the one you've been looking for?' Qiu Shurong asked with a furrowed brow, 'But why did you leave the Illusionary Abode without informing us? We've been waiting for you... If not for your grandfather's word, we would be oblivious to your departure.' Bai Yan responded with a light chuckle, 'Esteemed masters, how are your alchemical endeavors progressing? Do you remember the procedures I taught you last time?' 'Ahem!' Zheng Qi coughed, casting an apologetic glance at Qiu Shurong before candidly exposing him, 'We have all excelled in our concoctions, except for your Third Master... he has yet to master it.' 'Indeed, your Third Master is astonishingly inept at such fundamental concepts. Disciple, you must correct him sternly!' Qiu Shurong's face turned a shade of crimson with embarrassment as he glared at his two treacherous companions, 'You two old scoundrels, must you betray me so?' As the Third Master prepared for a lighthearted clash with the other elders, Bai Yan interjected with a smile, 'Enough. My visit is not to inspect your alchemical skills. I have a significant matter to discuss.' 'What is it?' The trio of elders focused intently on Bai Yan. 'The Holy Realm, as mentioned by the Holy Master... I desire to make the journey there.' The Holy Realm, a domain notorious for its lethal trials, is said to confront its challengers with an ordeal of nine deaths and one life. However, those who are resolute enough to emerge from the Holy Realm not only gain a promotion in rank but also experience a momentous enhancement of their spiritual state. For Emperor Cang, for the Demon Realm, she was resolved to brave the treacherous dangers that awaited. Chapter 841: Her Role as Referee (Part Five) 'You wish to ascend to the Sacred Realm?' Zheng Qi looked at Bai Yan in surprise. After a moment's contemplation, he said, 'This matter requires a discussion with the Holy Master. Should any misfortune befall you, it would not only spell disaster for us three elders, but would also represent a massive loss for the Sacred Realm.' 'Very well,' Bai Yan responded with a slight nod, 'It has been a long time since I last saw him. I shall join you in this meeting. Additionally, there is another matter I seek to understand.' Bai Yan paused briefly, then inquired, 'Why does the Sacred Realm seek to recruit disciples?' 'The situation is such that...' Qiu Shurong sighed, feeling helpless, 'Recently, the continent has been fraught with unrest, and all three major forces have sensed a looming crisis. They aim to select disciples endowed with extraordinary talents from among the populace, to be sent to the Minor Sacred Realm for cultivation.' The Sacred Realm is divided into two sections: one being the Minor Sacred Realm, which Bai Yan had once visited, and the other, the true Sacred Realm, often referred to as the Mirror of Nine Deaths and One Life. Whether it is the Minor Sacred Realm or the true Sacred Realm, a person may only enter once in their lifetime. Unless there is no other choice, the Sacred Realm would not continue to recruit disciples. 'If the plan is to have her refine her skills in the Minor Sacred Realm, then this trial must be conducted with absolute fairness, without any acts of favoritism or corruption!' Bai Yan stated seriously, her hand thoughtfully stroking her chin. 'Speaking of which, your timing is impeccable; the Holy Master has just decided that you should serve as the referee for this competition.' 'I?' Bai Yan's eyes narrowed slightly, 'I lack the time, as I need to undergo cultivation in the Sacred Realm.' 'My disciple, opening the Sacred Realm is also a time-consuming endeavor. This spare time you have is perfect for taking on the role of referee. Furthermore, you will be the sole arbiter for this contest!' Bai Yan glanced at the group of elders: 'Why do you not serve as referees yourselves?' To serve as a referee? It was an aggravating task, and they would have to be out of their minds to take on such a burden. 'My disciple, we are still perfecting our alchemy and need to dedicate ourselves to it, thus we lack the time for other matters.' Ren Yi subtly grimaced, his eyes shifting as he quickly conjured an excuse. 'What of Chu Yifeng?' 'To appoint the Young Master as referee would be folly; those maidens would be too preoccupied with winning his favor to focus on the competition. They'd probably rather devour the Young Master whole.' 'And Chu Yiyi? If Chu Yifeng is unsuitable, surely she cannot be unfit for the role?' 'Her? Out of the question! With her capricious nature, she'd turn the entire competition upside down. Who knows, she might set the arena ablaze if she's in a foul mood.' In short, the elders were unanimous in their decision: Bai Yan was the only candidate for the role of referee! Bai Yan held her forehead, suddenly feeling as though she had returned at an inopportune time... 'May I decline the role?' Her voice carried a hint of reluctance as she asked. 'No! You cannot decline. It is decided; you shall oversee the competition, with the Little Princess as your deputy. In this Sacred Realm, it seems you are the only one who can handle her.' Ren Yi asserted definitively, leaving no room for Bai Yan to object. 'Mother,' Bai Xiaochen pulled at Bai Yan's sleeve, his eyes shining with eagerness, 'Xiaochen also wishes to serve as a deputy.' Xiao Long'er looked at Bai Yan and then at Bai Xiaochen, her eyes brimming with anticipation. She, too, longed to aid the Queen... 'That issue can wait. First, I must see the Holy Master and Chu Yiyi. By the way, is Chu Yifeng in the Sacred Realm?' Bai Yan contemplated for a moment before posing the question. Upon hearing this, the elders' faces stiffened, and they let out a sigh laden with unspoken complexities. Chapter 842: Appointing Her as Referee (Part Six) The Young Master's unwavering devotion to Bai Yan had always been evident, yet her heart belonged to Emperor Cang. Nursing his broken heart, the Young Master had retreated from the Sacred Land to heal... Bai Yan, upon seeing the elders' expressions, realized the truth and was filled with guilt. She owed Chu Yifeng a debt too vast to repay even in a lifetime. 'Let's go,' Zheng Qi encouraged Bai Yan, patting her shoulder and giving a resigned smile. 'We always harbored hopes that you would reciprocate the Young Master's affection. But we understand that love cannot be forced. He has supported you for years without your reciprocation. Then, in just a brief moment, you devoted yourself to Emperor Cang. This clearly shows that the Young Master was not the one destined for you. Whatever your decisions, we will stand by you.' 'Masters...' Warmth filled Bai Yan's heart, and she smiled appreciatively, 'You will always be my masters, in every life to come.' 'Hahaha!' Zheng Qi's laughter filled the room, 'With your words, what more could I ask for? Come along, the Saint Lord has been eagerly awaiting your return. Let me take you to him without further delay!'... In the room. The table was in complete disarray. Chu Yiyi sat devouring a chicken leg, her face smeared with oil, while beside her, a man held a wine jar, his handsome face flushed with inebriation. 'Father, did you summon Bai Yan?' Chu Yiyi inquired, casually tossing a chicken bone aside and eyeing the wine jar in Chu Ran's grip. Without hesitation, Chu Ran slapped her forehead, 'This fine wine was painstakingly acquired by Zheng Qi. You've had a taste; that should suffice,' he reprimanded, glancing at her sharply. 'Regarding Bai Yan... Zheng Qi informed me she would return in the next few days.' 'Oh!' Chu Yiyi's eyes sparkled, her face lighting up with a delighted smile, 'That's marvelous! I must write to my brother and urge him to return as well.' Even though Bai Yan's heart was with Emperor Cang, Chu Yiyi knew her brother would be overjoyed with just a sight of her. As his sister, she felt obliged to fulfill his wish. Just as Chu Ran was about to speak again, an elder rushed in, bowing deeply, 'Saint Lord, Princess, Zheng Qi has arrived, and... Miss Bai Yan is with him.' Being confidants of the Saint Lord, the elders were aware of Bai Yan's existence. Since the celebration of Bai Changfeng's birthday, it was commonly known that the three elders had taken on a new disciple. Despite this knowledge, none had actually met Bai Yan. Even standing before them, they would not recognize her as the master of the Sacred Isle or as the disciple of the three elders. 'What? She's back so soon?' Chu Ran stood up hastily, eyeing the chaotic table. With a swift wave of his hand, he cleared the table's contents into his Storage Pouch and donned fresh robes. He also took an Elixir to eliminate the alcohol on his breath. Chu Yiyi was stunned, her face still dirty and her gown a mess. 'She abhors untidiness!' Chu Ran whispered a reminder to her, signaling that she should change quickly. Unfortunately, it was too late... As Chu Yiyi rose from her seat, Zheng Qi and Bai Yan had already elegantly entered the room. The first thing Bai Yan noticed was Chu Yiyi's filthy appearance, causing her brows to furrow in disapproval. 'Yiyi, you've turned your own chamber into a mess, and now you dare to defile the Saint Lord's quarters?' Bai Yan's eyes surveyed Chu Yiyi, and upon detecting the scent of alcohol, she inquired with a grave mien, 'Have you been drinking again? Have you forgotten the last incident when you were inebriated and nearly set ablaze my Sacred Isle?' 'It wasn't like that, it was Father...' Chu Yiyi was on the brink of tears. Before she could explain further, Chu Ran quickly interrupted with a cough, stopping the words that were about to slip from her lips. Chapter 843: The Father Who Sets a Trap for His Daughter 'Yiyi, I have always cautioned you that a maiden must comport herself with grace. Yet, you indulge in meat with abandon and imbibe wine in great gulps! How does this befit your station?' Chu Ran admonished with an aura of righteous indignation, delivering his reprimand with piercing words and a visage etched in solemnity. Chu Yiyi was dumbfounded, her reply coming out as a mere whisper, 'But I took just a single sip...' 'What? You dare claim you drained a whole pot?' Chu Ran accused, pointing at Chu Yiyi, his voice cold and sharp with fury, 'To think you'd be so brazen while I was none the wiser! To enter my chambers and drink, leaving the air heavy with the stench of wine! How shall I find solace and slumber this night?' Chu Yiyi's eyes bulged with incredulity, her gaze fixed on the stern countenance of her father Chu Ran, as a sudden urge to weep welled within her. She had merely sipped; why was her father casting such unfounded accusations? 'Bai Yan, what matter of such urgency brings you before me?' Chu Ran's eyes shifted towards Bai Yan, his previously severe expression now touched with a hint of warmth. This maiden had kept her distance since he had once sought to match her with his son. Now, she would not seek him without grave cause; unless it was of great import, she would not approach him! 'Holy Master, you had once spoken of my prospects in the Minor Holy Realm, suggesting that I was fit to enter the true Holy Realm. I was in haste to depart the Sacred Land then, hence I did not seize the chance to ascend to the Holy Realm. Might I still pursue this path?' Bai Yan inquired, her brows slightly furrowed. Truly, she had spent two of her four years within the Sacred Land mastering the intricacies of the Minor Holy Realm. There, she had excelled beyond expectations, earning the privilege to ascend to the true Holy Realm. Yet, her heart had been heavy with concern for Bai Xiaochen, prompting her to leave the Sacred Land and return to the Bai family... If the opportunity still lingered, she would assuredly grasp it to elevate her prowess within the Holy Realm. Chu Ran paused, his brow creasing deeply, 'You desire entry into the Holy Realm?' 'Without a doubt.' Bai Yan's tone was steadfast, her resolve unshaken. Chu Ran exhaled a soft sigh, 'Miss Bai, it is as I affirmed: you may journey to the true Holy Realm, but you have witnessed the perils within the Minor Holy Realm. The hazards that lie in wait in the true Holy Realm are manifold!' 'Yet, it is precisely the threat of these dangers that renders the Holy Realm the crucible for honing one's mettle,' Chu Ran fixed his gaze upon Bai Yan, speaking with gravity, 'Furthermore, within the Holy Realm, the passage of time is greatly decelerated; a year within its bounds equates to but a month in our world.' Bai Yan lapsed into silence, contemplating Chu Ran's elucidation. 'Are you truly prepared to face the Holy Realm, to embrace its perils without trepidation?' Chu Ran's brow unfurled, his tone markedly gentler as he posed the query. 'I am certain.' The unyielding light in Bai Yan's eyes bore no trace of doubt. 'Very well, I honor your choice. Yet, to open the gates to the Holy Realm requires considerable exertion; preparations must be made,' Chu Ran remarked with a light-hearted chuckle, stepping beside Bai Yan and tenderly patting her shoulder, 'It is a pity, truly. I had long envisioned you as my son's betrothed, yet now you are joined with another... Nevertheless, should you not be my daughter-in-law, you remain as dear to me as a daughter!' 'Holy Master...' Bai Yan raised her eyes, meeting the gaze of the man before her. Chu Ran offered a smile, 'Let us dispense with maudlin sentiment. If my own daughter proved as little cause for concern as you, my heart would be at ease.' Chu Yiyi's heart brimmed with a sorrow unspoken. Was she so readily dismissed? It appears that in the eyes of others, their offspring are paragons, whilst she is reduced to a mere footnote of disappointment... Chapter 844: Framing (Part One) "Ahem!" Zheng Qi coughed twice to draw attention, his expression serene yet authoritative. "Holy Master, there is another matter I would like to report." "What is it?" "For the upcoming contest, I suggest nominating Yan'er as the referee. I await your esteemed opinion on this matter, Holy Master." Zheng Qi's suggestion plunged Chu Ran into deep thought. He turned to Bai Yan and inquired, "Miss Bai, what are your thoughts on your master’s proposal? Are you willing to undertake this task?" "How long will it take to open the Holy Realm? And the duration of the contest?" Bai Yan mused, her fingers resting thoughtfully on her chin. "The Holy Realm will take slightly more than a month to open, and the contest shall certainly conclude within that period." "Very well," Bai Yan's eyes gleamed with determination, and her lips curved into a faint smile. "I will assume the role of referee." Chu Ran laughed heartily, giving Bai Yan's shoulder a comforting pat: "Having you as the referee puts my mind at ease. Yiyi, accompany Miss Bai and take this chance to temper yourself. Listen to her advice; do you understand?" Chu Yiyi, still smarting from her father’s earlier scheme, hesitated, but Chu Ran’s admonishing glance swiftly silenced her. The unspoken message was clear: Reveal what I've done, and face the consequences. Perhaps cowed by Chu Ran’s menacing look, Chu Yiyi shuddered and could not bring herself to speak of the earlier incident. "Ahem!" Zheng Qi coughed again, clearing his throat before continuing, "Since we have settled all pertinent issues, I must discuss some further matters with Yan'er. Holy Master, we shall take our leave." He bowed his fists in a sign of respect and guided Bai Yan towards the doorway. They soon disappeared from the room, leaving Chu Ran to quietly sigh with relief, his hand lightly touching his chest as he relaxed. With a wave of his hand, the banquet that had been removed earlier was once more laid out on the table. "Yiyi, let's proceed," he chuckled, returning to his seat. Chu Yiyi's lips twitched in frustration: "I refuse to be your scapegoat. I'm going to find Bai Yan." "Wait," Chu Ran's brows furrowed as Chu Yiyi began to leave, "If even a whisper of what transpired leaves your lips, I'll see you wed before the fortnight is out!" Chu Yiyi's form shook, and she dashed from the room without looking back, her resolve not to betray her father evident in her haste... In the days that followed, the Sacred Land was a hive of activity with the gathering of disciples-to-be. To prevent these hopefuls from interfering with the Sacred Land's disciples, they were confined to a small courtyard in the outer sector, barred from stepping out without express consent from the Sacred Land’s authorities. Within a cottage in the courtyard, a woman clad in a red gown paced with restless anxiety. Her hands twisted together, and her stunning face was marked by a trace of apprehension. Abruptly, the door burst open, and her eyes lit up as a handsome man entered. She rushed to meet him. "Cousin, did your master respond? Will he agree to help us?" Lin Ya Han let out a sigh of resignation, his smile tinged with bitterness: "Cousin, I'm afraid that this time, my master is unable to come to our aid..." Huo Yun, previously elated, now stood petrified. She gazed at the man, her eyes filled with dismay: "Why? With your master's esteemed position in the Sacred Land, why can he not assist us? Is he reluctant to extend his support to me?" Chapter 845: Framing (Part Two) 'Cousin Sister, you've misunderstood; it isn't that my master is unwilling to help, but the Sacred Land has unexpectedly chosen a new referee for the event. This referee is shrouded in secrecy. Despite my considerable efforts, I've been unable to uncover her identity,' Lin Ya Han expressed, his visage marred by the bitterness of unforeseen changes. Upon hearing this, Huo Yun bowed her head, her complexion taking on a ghostly pallor. In fact, her vaunted talent was nothing more than a fabrication touted by the Flame Sect, a mere shadow when compared to the true prodigies of other sects. Her so-called Silver Snake pet wasn't subdued by her own hand, but was gifted by an Elder in her sect, who then deceitfully proclaimed her to be its conqueror. She had further obscured her power level by wearing trinkets that concealed her strength, seldom making public appearances, thereby keeping her true abilities hidden from the world... Her chances of advancing in this contest alone were nearly non-existent. More importantly, she was determined to use the Elder's influence to eliminate that woman! The memory of Bai Xiaochen's insolence ignited a fury within Huo Yun—she was resolute in denying that boy's mother any chance at all! 'Cousin Brother, could you endeavor to uncover the referee's identity? If I know who she is, I'm confident I can sway her to my side,' Huo Yun implored, her fists clenched as she raised her beseeching eyes to Lin Ya Han. Lin Ya Han's heart softened at the sight of his cousin sister's distress, but ultimately, he could only shake his head in gentle refusal. 'The Sacred Land is extremely secretive about the identity of this referee; even my master is in the dark. However, I do know that... The esteemed Little Princess of the Sacred Land will also be present at the Great Contest, serving as the deputy to the referee.' Huo Yun tensed; if the princess of the Sacred Land was merely serving as an assistant, what extraordinary origins might the referee possess? 'But do not fret, Cousin Sister. In addition to the referee and the Little Princess, several disciples from the Sacred Land will be there to aid them. One of these disciples happens to have a connection with me, and I can utilize that to ensure your selection,' Lin Ya Han revealed, a smile of victory playing on his lips. 'With such a vast competition, it would be impossible for the referee to oversee every detail. I will arrange for surreptitious interventions at the crucial moment, thus securing your triumph.' Huo Yun finally exhaled in relief, her fist playfully striking Lin Ya Han's chest, 'Cousin Brother, you've thought of everything for me. Why did you not reveal this sooner and save me from worry? And have you learned anything of that woman's identity?' Her tender punch grazed his chest, and as Lin Ya Han's gaze drifted from her pale neck down to the surging curves of her form, a scorching yearning blazed within him. He swallowed with difficulty, his voice parched, 'I've set people to investigate. Rest at ease, Cousin Sister, you will not be disappointed.' 'I trust you completely, Cousin Brother,' Huo Yun murmured shyly, her head bowed, the red of her attire making her neck appear even more lustrous, her face suffused with modesty, 'But when the time comes, I do hope you can ensure their failure. I cannot endure the thought of those people gracing the same stage.' 'Ha ha ha!' Lin Ya Han laughed heartily, affectionately squeezing Huo Yun's hand: 'Given that all competitors have been invited by the Sacred Land, I cannot simply eliminate that woman outright. But...' Chapter 846: Framing (Part Three) His eyes narrowed slightly, a cold gleam shooting through them as he silently smirked, 'I have a scheme that will lead to her utter disgrace. Once she's fallen from grace, she'll have no choice but to leave the Sacred Land, leaving you unrivaled.' After all, she's merely a woman. As a disciple of the Sacred Land, dealing with her should be a breeze. If it pleases my cousin, what's the harm in bending the rules a bit? The higher-ups are too detached to bother themselves with such trivial matters... Three days whisked by, and the venue was now teeming with contenders from various powers. Amidst the guards, Huo Yun stood out, her earlier shyness around Lin Ya Han replaced by an icy air of nobility. Her expression was frosty as she surveyed the bustling crowd, impatience flickering across her features. Yet, despite her searching gaze, Bai Yan's figure was nowhere to be seen, her brow creasing with a trace of concern. 'Miss!' A cautious voice from her attendant broke the silence, 'She has arrived.' Huo Yun's gaze followed the attendant's direction, and there she was – a trio, one adult and two children, making their way through the crowd. The woman, robed in the hue of the Vermilion Bird, moved with an ethereal grace under the midday sun. Her beauty was so transcendent that the phrase 'surpassing all worldly splendor' seemed an understatement. The boy on her left, as exquisite as carved jade, wore a purple brocade robe that accentuated his youthful sovereignty. It was remarkable that such a young face could exude such a commanding presence. On her right, a little girl with rosy cheeks giggled, her smile sweet and eyes curved like crescent moons, exuding a charm that could soften even the hardest of hearts. 'That woman has finally shown herself!' Huo Yun's eyes darkened with malice, 'Do you remember what I tasked you with?' The attendant nodded earnestly, 'I remember your orders very clearly, Lady Huo Yun.' 'Good,' Huo Yun sneered, 'My cousin is right; this woman... she must face complete ruin!' As Bai Yan led Bai Xiaochen and Xiao Long'er towards the High Platform, a derisive voice cut through the noise, stopping her in her tracks. 'The shamelessness of some knows no bounds, coming here to compete without talent or training! And to think they'd stoop to bribing the referee's aides, as if such underhanded tactics could ensure their selection in the Sacred Land!' Bai Yan's delicate eyebrows furrowed slightly. Releasing the children's hands, she turned, her gaze sliding from Huo Yun's frosty demeanor to the attendant who had spoken with such disdain. 'Were you referring to me just now?' The attendant retorted with a scoff, 'I speak only the truth; my eyes have seen your desperate attempts. I saw you trying to sway a disciple of the Sacred Land with seduction, thinking you could manipulate the selection process. Could the Sacred Land's disciples be so easily swayed by your temptations?' 'Xiao Ling!' Huo Yun cut in before Bai Yan could reply, her brows arching with a hint of interest and reproof. 'What do you mean by these accusations?' The attendant, Xiao Ling, turned to Huo Yun, fists respectfully clenched in salute, 'Lady Huo Yun, it was by sheer coincidence that I stumbled upon this lady... she... she had sought out a disciple of the Sacred Land, intending to use her allure to influence his decision and secure her place in the selection. I couldn't bear the thought of you competing against someone of questionable morals, Miss, so I felt compelled to expose her.' Chapter 847: Framing (Part Four) The words of Huo Yun and Xiao Ling, having been rehearsed numerous times, were etched in their memories. Coupled with Huo Yun's expression of disdain, their performance swayed the crowd to believe in their fabricated truth. 'What?' Huo Yun gasped, her eyes wide with shock as she clutched her reddened lips, her body quivering. Her gaze towards Bai Yan was filled with undisguised loathing. 'You... You have cast shame upon your sect with these deeds!' The crowd stirred with disapproval, their eyes upon Bai Yan now laced with revulsion. Those who had stood by her moments earlier now recoiled, wary of being sullied by her supposed dishonor. Anger colored Xiao Long'er's cheeks a furious red. She was eager to tear into the deceitful woman's facade, but felt the firm grip of a hand restraining her. 'Queen...' She turned, looking imploringly at Bai Yan, eyes brimming with injustice, even as she shot a glare filled with malice towards Huo Yun and her accomplice. Bai Xiaochen, unlike Xiao Long'er, harbored no impulse to act rashly. His lips curled into a cunning smile, and his eyes shone with mischief: 'Xiao Long'er, just wait and watch—the real spectacle is about to unfold.' Did these people truly believe they could entrap their mother? Were they ignorant of her reputation and the inevitable repercussions of their scheme? 'You allege that I bribed a disciple of the Sacred Land? Pray tell, where is this disciple? Can you bring them here to testify?' Bai Yan's lips curled into a knowing smirk as she regarded Huo Yun with a gaze dancing with mirth. At a sign from Huo Yun, her maid stepped forth, cleared her throat with purpose, and called out, 'Young Master Liu, would you please come forward and provide your testimony? The admission of such a woman into the Sacred Land would surely sully its hallowed grounds.' No sooner had the maid finished speaking than a man in a green robe appeared from the vicinity of the high platform. With casual grace and a hand resting behind his back, he made his way toward the gathered crowd, wearing a composed smile. 'Under normal circumstances, Liu Han would refrain from commenting on matters so unseemly,' began Liu Han, his voice exuding a sense of righteousness, 'but as Huo Yun's maid has beckoned, I, Liu Han, find myself obliged to give an account of the truth.' His gaze shifted to Bai Yan, his brow furrowed in an expression of grave concern, 'Miss, I understand your desperation born from inadequate talent, prompting such unsavory actions. Still, Liu Han conducts himself with integrity and could not possibly betray his conscience. I beseech you to withdraw of your own will, lest I be forced to expel you.' Gone was his earlier affability, replaced now with a seriousness that underscored the gravity of his words. 'Uncle Liu,' came a clear, childlike voice, piercing through the tension and drawing Liu Han's attention downward to the small child before him. 'Uncle Liu, didn't your mother ever teach you that children who lie will suffer dire consequences?' Liu Han's expression darkened as he responded icily, 'No wonder the child is so impertinent; the offspring reflects its parentage. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.' Bai Xiaochen's smile remained sweet, yet there was a cold glint in his large, fox-like eyes. 'Uncle Liu, Chen'er merely wishes to remind you of the grim fate that awaits liars. If you have spoken the truth, then my words do not concern you. Could it be that Uncle Liu himself harbors fear?' Bai Xiaochen's youthful face shone brightly, 'Moreover, even after you've besmirched Chen'er's mother, Chen'er still addresses you respectfully as 'uncle.' Who, then, truly lacks decorum?' Chapter 848: Framing (Part Five) Silence enveloped the crowd, a stillness so profound that the drop of a needle would have resounded like thunder. Though the disciples of the Sacred Land were typically beyond suspicion, Bai Xiaochen’s display of impeccable manners had cast doubt on the claims of his incivility. This incongruity swayed the sympathies of those present, particularly those whose hearts were easily warmed by maternal instinct, to the boy’s side. Bai Xiaochen, having delivered his pointed words, retreated to Bai Yan’s comforting presence. His cherubic face was uplifted, eyes bright with an innocent luster. 'Mother, Chen'er has issued a warning, but he seems deaf to my words. You needn't extend any further courtesies to him...,' Bai Yan gently stroked Bai Xiaochen’s head before her eyes, cool and assessing, settled on Liu Han. 'I'll give you another chance. Are you certain your previous statements were truthful?' Liu Han’s expression subtly changed, uncertainty crossing his features. What was this woman implying? Despite the Sacred Land’s troubled times, Liu Han’s voice was resolute. 'I, Liu Han, have never spoken an untruth.' Liu Han was no stranger to bribery; he had narrowly escaped previous purges. As the Sacred Land underwent yet another cleansing, protecting his interests became paramount. His alliance with Lin Ya Han was not born of bribery, but rather a desperate attempt to validate his own integrity. Consider this, he mused: even when faced with a woman of unparalleled beauty, he could remain undeterred, a paragon of virtue. Surely this would earn him the esteem of his fellow Elders and perhaps pave the way to greater achievements... 'Very well, I have given you a chance, yet you persist in your ways, so...,' Bai Yan’s eyes narrowed, her lips curling into a knowing smile, 'whatever consequences ensue, you have only yourself to blame.' Liu Han caught the chill in Bai Yan’s demeanor and an inexplicable unease began to take hold, sending tremors of dread through his heart. 'Liu Han, subordinate to Qinghong, core disciple responsible for overseeing weaponry during the contest...' Bai Yan’s voice contained a wisp of amusement, 'So, I supposedly sought to bribe you for superior weapons while sabotaging the others?' Liu Han, momentarily dazed, affirmed: 'Yes, you requested not only the best weapons for yourself but also tampered with the rest, an act of treachery I could never condone against the Sacred Land!' Upon entering the Sacred Land, bearing arms is forbidden. Even the contest’s weapons are provided by the Sacred Land, upholding fairness. Yet... Bai Yan’s laughter was sudden and derisive, 'You alluded to my lack of prowess, but have you forgotten? Against overwhelming power, even godly weapons are rendered insignificant.' Indeed, divine artifacts wield great power, but to a warrior nascent in their craft against a Venerable Rank adversary, can such an artifact’s potential truly be unleashed? Yes, the caliber of one’s weapon matters, but it pales in comparison to the essence of genuine strength. Liu Han was bewildered; he had overlooked the question of how Bai Yan knew about his weapon oversight duty—a detail privy only to the Sacred Land’s inner circle. The others knew only of his involvement in the contest. 'Has Qinghong failed to show himself? Fetch him at once!' A cold smirk graced Bai Yan’s lips as she issued the command with icy authority. This contest, supplemented by Chu Yiyi’s involvement, had Zheng Qi delegate two core disciples for support—one of whom was Liu Han, Qinghong’s underling. Bai Yan had not anticipated that Liu Han would mistake her for an ordinary contestant and even more, that he would dare to slander her with false accusations. Chapter 849: She Is the Mysterious Referee (Part One) At that moment... From the outskirts of the crowd, a pert voice arose from behind, abruptly quieting the previously bustling throng. 'What's this commotion all about?' From behind the onlookers, a girl clad in a yellow dress furrowed her brows, her tone suffused with impatience. As she made her appearance, the crowd that had been scrambling for a view promptly dispersed to either side. The disciples of the Sacred Land might not have had the fortune to meet Bai Yan, but there was no one who didn't recognize the infamous 'Enchantress,' known as the Demon Princess. With her arrival, Liu Han ceased his standoff with Bai Yan, his handsome features brightening with a congenial smile. 'Demon Princess, Brother Qinghong, Brother Changling, have you all gathered? Then, when shall the contest begin?' 'Now,' Chu Yiyi raised her brows playfully, her eyes alight with mirth as she cast a glance toward Bai Yan. She was about to approach Bai Yan when Liu Han's voice chimed in from the side. 'Demon Princess, shall we not wait for the Referee Master?' Chu Yiyi paused, confusion etching her features as she turned, her frown deepening: 'Has she not already arrived? Whom else are we awaiting?' The crowd's behavior seemed puzzling; Bai Yan was evidently there, yet they seemed to expect another. Liu Han's eyes widened in disbelief. The referee had arrived, yet he had received no notification? Chu Yiyi, seemingly oblivious to Liu Han's shock, spun around and, with a peal of laughter, made her way to Bai Yan, her charming face breaking into a brilliant smile. 'Bai Yan, I'm a tad late. Is it time to commence the contest?' Liu Han, who had been scanning the crowd for the enigmatic referee, stood rooted to the spot as he witnessed Chu Yiyi approach Bai Yan. Hearing her words, he pieced together a startling possibility. This realization left him rigid, his complexion turning ashen as his clenched fists trembled slightly, his eyes wide with disbelief. 'Brother Qinghong, this woman... is she...?' The youth who had arrived with Chu Yiyi glanced at Liu Han, clearly puzzled by Liu Han's intense reaction, yet he nodded subtly, 'Yes, she is the Referee Master. Were you not aware?' His tone, though measured, resonated distinctly in the solemn assembly, impacting the hearts of all present. Huo Yun swayed, requiring the support of her handmaiden to avoid collapsing. Yet... Her fingertips, blanched with tension, gripped her palm tightly, using pain as an anesthetic. Could this woman not be a disciple here for the contest but rather... the mysterious Referee Master summoned by the Sacred Land for this event? Had her cousin not claimed to have encountered all the high-ranking disciples of the Sacred Land, yet this woman remained unknown to him? 'Wait,' As Chu Yiyi was about to lead Bai Yan to the judges' panel, Bai Yan raised her hand, halting her motion, her eyes sweeping towards Liu Han, a frosty sneer curling her lips. 'Did you just suggest that my talent is lacking?' That single question brought Chu Yiyi, previously unaware of the developments, to an abrupt halt. Her eyes, round with astonishment, slowly shifted towards Liu Han. Is Bai Yan's talent in doubt? If so, what does the term 'genius' signify in this world? Bai Yan closed the distance with Liu Han by another two steps: 'Did you insinuate that I would stoop to bribery just to ensure my success in this contest, is that correct?' Chu Yiyi's gaze widened to the size of saucers. She had been merely a bit late, yet in her absence, a significant incident had transpired. Chapter 850: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part Two) "I..." Liu Han staggered back, his forehead slick with a cold sweat and his legs quivering uncontrollably, nearly collapsing in sheer terror. Before Liu Han could fabricate a plausible excuse, Chu Yiyi's voice erupted in righteous fury, sending him sprawling to the ground in utter humiliation, the shameful scent of his fear permeating the venue. "Liu Han, you have some nerve! Bai Yan graciously agreed to serve as referee, and yet you dare to slander her! With Bai Yan's exceptional talent, she could effortlessly defeat you and all your allies combined! And you dare to call her abilities into question? Who gave you such boldness?" Bai... Bai Yan? The name reverberated in Liu Han's mind, a name he had heard spoken with nothing but esteem. As he came to a realization, he shifted his gaze to the child by Bai Yan's side, his eyes bulging with a mix of dread and panic. He had heard rumors of the revered Island Master Bai Yan of the Sacred Land, granddaughter to Bai Changfeng, always accompanied by her endearing son! He had never actually seen her, only knowing of her through hushed tales, which is why he hadn't instantly connected her with the woman before him... If she truly was Bai Yan, then his earlier accusations were laughably absurd! Liu Han shuddered, with Liu Han's forehead pressed to the ground, too petrified to utter another word. The crowd around him fell silent, their prior skepticism towards Bai Yan now reflected back at Liu Han, their eyes filled with disdain and derision. This young lady's status in the Sacred Land was clearly esteemed; otherwise, the Little Princess wouldn't willingly become her deputy. Yet Liu Han, a mere Inner Sect Disciple, dared to insinuate that she would use her beauty as a bribe to gain entry into the Sacred Land? Ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous! "Little Princess, I acknowledge my wrongdoing. I truly do," Liu Han pleaded, his forehead knocking against the ground, tears streaming down his face, "It was Lin Ya Han who orchestrated this plot. I was merely his accomplice; he is the chief culprit." "Lin Ya Han?" Chu Yiyi's brows furrowed, her fingers lightly caressing her chin, "And who might this be?" "He... He is also an Inner Sect Disciple of the Sacred Land, hailing from the same master as I." "Very well. Have him expelled alongside you. Our Sacred Land has no room for such characters." With a wave of her hand, Chu Yiyi sealed the fate of both men. Turning to Bai Yan with a gleeful smile, she blinked playfully: "Referee Bai Yan, do you approve of my judgment?" "Proceed as you deem appropriate." "That won't do," Chu Yiyi objected, her lips pursing into a pout, "My father instructed me to emulate your wisdom and follow your directives. Should he discover that I've acted on my own accord, he would surely reprimand me." Her words carried an implicit warning. If even she, the Sacred Land's Little Princess, was bound by Bai Yan's wisdom, then who were these mere disciples to defy her? Should she report their insolence to her father, their repercussions would be more severe than a simple expulsion. In the crowd, Lin Ya Han, who had been closely monitoring the situation, sensed his plans unraveling and made a break for it. Yet before he could flee, he was surrounded by onlookers. One among them struck his chest with a palm, launching him through the air to land at the feet of Bai Yan and Chu Yiyi. Chapter 851: The Mysterious Referee (Part Three) Chu Yiyi stood with her hands on her hips, looming over Lin Ya Han who lay on the ground, chuckling with a sinister air, 'Bai Yan had Elder Zheng Qi cleanse the Sacred Land before, yet to think such vermin still persist. Our contests in the Sacred Land are held with utmost fairness, and we shall not tolerate any favoritism or deceit!' 'Sister Chu,' Bai Xiaochen stepped forward, his eyes sparkling with mirth, 'this Lin Ya Han is the cousin of that nefarious aunt, and moreover... that very aunt had previously caused a disturbance at the gates of the Sacred Land with Xiaochen. Xiaochen suspects that she is the orchestrator behind everything.' He tilted his head up proudly, pointing towards Huo Yun. His youthful face still bore traces of innocence, yet it was tinged with an emerging air of authority. Huo Yun’s face turned pale as she stepped back, her eyes wide with alarm. She desperately sought Lin Ya Han's gaze, her eyes sparkling with tearful specks. 'No, it has nothing to do with my cousin,' Lin Ya Han gritted his teeth and proclaimed, 'She is innocent; it was all self-initiated - I colluded with her maid! I only wanted to defend my cousin sister's honor, never anticipating such consequences. I pray the Little Princess can grant me another chance.' He was exposed, and the harshest penalty was merely expulsion from the Sacred Land. However, if his cousin were implicated, even if the Sacred Land took no action, upon her return to the Flame Sect, her father would show no mercy! Disgracing the Sacred Land would be the end of the Flame Sect! 噗通! The maid also knelt, her forehead striking the floor forcefully, bruising and bleeding. Blood oozed from her brow, staining the ground. 'All these transgressions were indeed plotted between the Young Master and myself, unrelated to the young lady. I beseech you to release the young lady; she is guiltless...' Tears filled her eyes, her complexion was ghostly, yet she exhibited a resolve to face her own demise. Should she shoulder all the blame, the worst to befall her would be death, but if her mistress met with misfortune, then her brother within the Flame Sect would share a similar fate... Thus, she could not implicate her mistress. As the two took full responsibility upon themselves, Huo Yun quietly breathed a sigh of relief. She moved forward, clenching her teeth, and knelt before Bai Yan, her eyes brimming with tears as she bowed deeply. 'Miss Bai, I understand you harbor deep suspicions towards me. This incident truly arose from my failure to supervise my maid, and my cousin... acted out of devotion for me, committing these deeds out of love. However, I, Huo Yun, have always walked a straight and honorable path. I shall never admit to actions I haven't committed! I entreat Miss Bai not to allow your son to falsely accuse me...' Her words were sincere, her eyes beseeching, as if she were indeed wronged. Chu Yiyi turned her head to Bai Yan, and truthfully, she trusted Bai Xiaochen far more than this woman. 'Do you wish to continue in the contest?' A sly smile played on Bai Yan’s lips as she gazed at the kneeling girl, 'Is that so?' Huo Yun's face turned ashen. With her cousin down, the outcome of the contest was predictable if she remained. Yet under such circumstances, she could not withdraw. 'Yes.' 'Hmm,' Bai Yan nodded slightly, 'Remove the jade pendant around your neck, and I shall allow you to continue in the contest.' What? Huo Yun's eyes widened, her face turning snow-white, her gaze filled with distress. How could she have known? 'Miss Bai, this pendant was bestowed upon me by my late mother,' Huo Yun lowered her head, masking the turmoil in her eyes, and spoke with a trembling voice, 'She instructed me never to remove the pendant, lest I dishonor her memory. Surely, Miss Bai would not... force me?' Chapter 852: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part Four) Within the Sacred Land, disciples might covertly indulge in deceit, but public displays of such acts are strictly forbidden. This emboldened Huo Yun's brazen disregard. However, she failed to recognize that among those present were the esteemed Little Princess Chu Yiyi of the Sacred Land, and another whose edicts even the Little Princess would not dare defy. After Huo Yun's defiant response, Chu Yiyi stepped forward, forcefully removed the jade pendant from Huo Yun's neck, and hurled it to the ground, where it shattered with a resounding crash. 'When Bai Yan instructs you to remove your pendant, you should do so without hesitation. Why do you speak such nonsense?' Chu Yiyi's glare was piercing as her voice cut through the air sharply. All who witnessed were shocked by Chu Yiyi's audacity, and their looks of pity toward Huo Yun were evident. Yet, none dared voice opposition, given Chu Yiyi's exalted status. But... Huo Yun had claimed that the jade pendant was a last memento from her mother, a treasured relic. Yet, the Little Princess of the Sacred Land acted with such dominion, shattering Huo Yun's relic without a second thought. Huo Yun's face paled, not from grief, but from fear. She stared at the fragments of the pendant on the ground, panic flickering in her eyes. Her downfall was now certain... 'Wait, this doesn't add up. It's said that Huo Yun, the heiress of the Flame Sect, had achieved the illustrious King Rank. Among all but the three great powers, she's hailed as the most talented. Why then does she exhibit only the strength of a Mid-Earth Rank practitioner now?' The Earth Rank, while not exceptionally high, is certainly not low. When Nangong Yi, the Crown Prince of the Liuhuo Kingdom, ascended to Earth Rank, he was hailed as a prodigy. But... Nangong Yi is merely a royal descendant with access to limited cultivation resources, unlike those available to a secondary sect. Thus, Huo Yun's supposed prodigious talent now falls short, especially since the Flame Sect had zealously promoted her as a peerless genius. Rising to the King Rank at such a young age would indeed mark one as a genius, but sadly... This 'genius' was an impostor! 'Yiyi,' Bai Yan said with a hint of a smile, 'as I understand it, anyone wishing to enter the Sacred Land's competition must at least possess the strength of a High-Earth Rank practitioner! If she hasn't met this criterion, how did she manage to enter the Sacred Land?' While Zheng Qi had extended invitations to all major sects, admittance to the Sacred Land necessitates a preliminary vetting. Only those meeting the minimum strength requirement are entitled to an invitation. How, then, did someone who failed to meet this fundamental criterion find her way into the Sacred Land? This question surely warrants the contemplation of us all. 'Qinghong, can you explain what's happening here?' Prompted by Bai Yan's inquiry, Chu Yiyi turned the interrogation toward the two men following her. Her eyes blazed with indignation, hands on her hips, as she demanded an explanation with an imposing aura. Qinghong wiped the sweat from his brow, 'The individual tasked with overseeing the selections for the major forces was Master Lin You.' 'Master Lin You? And who might that be?' Chu Yiyi pressed, her tone laced with irritation. 'He is...' Qinghong glanced briefly at Lin Ya Han, who was quivering on the ground, 'he is Lin Ya Han's master.' The crowd buzzed with whispers. The attention that had been on Huo Yun now shifted to Lin Ya Han... Lin Ya Han shook, acutely aware that both he and his master were now ensnared by inevitable retribution! Chapter 853: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part Five) 'Get him over here!' Little Princess Chu Yiyi commanded, her brow furrowed with a trace of displeasure. As her attendant prepared to follow the order, she hastily reconsidered, 'Wait, no, I don't wish to see him. Just take him directly to Elder Zheng Qi and let them handle it.' 'As you command, Little Princess.' The guard complied with the Little Princess’s decree, sealing the fate of Lin Ya Han and his disciples... 'You,' Chu Yiyi pointed to another guard, lifting her snow-white chin, 'take Liu Han and Lin Ya Han down to await their punishment! It's one thing to engage in corruption, but to plot against Bai Yan and think you can get away with it? Dream on.' Lin Ya Han's legs buckled, and he collapsed to the ground. Briefly closing his eyes, he reopened them with a resigned smile, his gaze falling on Huo Yun's pallid face. It seemed he was powerless to help his cousin sister now. 'Your Highness, Mistress Bai Yan,' Liu Han, panicked, approached and knelt before them once again, his forehead thudding against the ground. He was so overwhelmed he didn't even notice his forehead bleeding. 'I acknowledge my wrongdoings, I truly do. Please, have mercy on me this once. I won't dare again,' he pleaded. 'Spare you?' Bai Yan let out a cold laugh, her detached gaze resting on the kneeling young man. 'If I weren't the referee for this contest, would your sinister plan have succeeded?' Liu Han was stunned; indeed, if Bai Yan were merely a regular disciple and not the referee, he might have already succeeded in having her expelled from the Sacred Land, her reputation destroyed... 'So if it had been someone else, you know very well what the outcome would be,' Bai Yan pressed her foot down on Liu Han's head, grinding it into the ground, her voice icy, 'It's precisely because of people like you, with your cheating and favoritism, that the Sacred Land might have already lost countless outstanding disciples. How can we overlook such behavior?' Whether it is the Illusionary Abode, the Medicine Sect, or the Sacred Land, all are her home. She will not allow anyone to bully their way around her domain, nor will she permit the Sacred Land to miss out on its geniuses due to such misconduct. Today, she was determined to set an example—to ensure that the Sacred Land would henceforth be a place of peace and fairness! With a powerful kick, Bai Yan sent Liu Han flying into a nearby column. He spewed out blood, his complexion completely drained of life, devoid of any hint of vitality. His eyes, dilated with terror, watched as the formidable figure in the red garment approached, powerless to resist. Spurt! Bai Yan's fingers gripped Liu Han's arm, twisting with force. A sickening snap of bone echoed, followed by another burst of crimson blood. Then, a scream that ripped through the heavens ensued, sending shivers down the spine. 'Our Sacred Land has always been a paragon of fairness and justice, and will never tolerate any form of corruption or favoritism!' Bai Yan's calm gaze swept over the crowd, her voice unwavering, 'Should I discover such misconduct again, the culprit will suffer the same fate.' Bai Yan retracted her arm, and from within her sleeve shot forth a beam of light that struck Liu Han's dantian. In an instant, his dantian burst, and he crumpled to the ground in disarray. In the past, the three masters had cleansed the Sacred Land, but their admonitions were not severe enough. They only expelled the violators, and so, there were still those who gambled! For mere wealth and treasures, they were prepared to cheat once more.
