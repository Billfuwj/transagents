Chapter 1303 As Long As You "What on earth are you doing?" The patriarch of the East Palace family thumped his cane on the ground, his voice filled with anger. "Our master will be here soon. Please stay calm and patient, Old Master of East Palace. You will figure it out later." The leader of the group replied. The Old Master of the East Palace naturally knew who he was referring to. Feeling somewhat uneasy, he was unclear why Pei Yi would come later. It was not a wise thing to have a conflict with DK. Although everyone in R Nation wanted to chase DK out, they couldn't do it. It was merely wishful thinking. A few minutes later, Pei Yi's car arrived. As he got out of the car, he shifted his gaze to the car nearby. An Xiaonin emerged from her car without removing her mask and wig. Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind. "You're here." An Xiaoning said. Pei Yi sized her up from head to toe and let out a rare laugh. He approached her, and said in a low voice, "Wow, with this disguise, they can't guess that it's you, right?" "Of course, I just didn't want them to know my true identity, so I asked for your assistance. It's not the right time yet." "Why is he with you?" Pei Yi gave Wu Lianzhi a glance. "He is involved in this matter.‚Äù Pei Yi straightened up, turned around, and said to the people of the East Palace family with a faint smile on his face, "I don't know what my little sister did to offend you, making you want to kill her. Did you guys grow incredibly bold?" The people from the East Palace family were taken aback. Pei Yi's little sister? Where did Pei Yi get a little sister? "Mr. Pei's sister? We really don't know anything about her," the old lady from the East Palace family said. "You didn't know? Fine, I am telling you now." "Did you hear it clearly?" Pei Yi said coldly. "Since Mr. Pei said that this is your cousin, then please take your cousin away. As for Donggong Lianzhi, his name is still on our family's genealogy. He has yet to be removed from the list and is still a member of our East Palace family. How we deal with him is our family's business." "Brother, he's my boyfriend. Now that I am pregnant with his child, you can't leave him behind," An Xiaoning said before Pei Yi could respond. Initially, Pei Yi wanted to only take her away, but now the situation was a bit more complicated. However, being arrogant and unreasonable was also his usual style. As long as he wanted to do something, no one could stop him. "Old lady, you heard it too. He is also my brother-in-law. They have a child now. If I hand him over to you, wouldn't the child grow up without a father? Do you think I will agree to that?" The old lady of the East Palace family knew very well that if she let Pei Yi take him away, they wouldn't be able to openly deal with him in the future. Therefore, despite being somewhat wary of DK's influence, she did not give in. "Mr. Pei, I'm afraid you can't do this. Our family has its own rules when it comes to dealing with our own members, and outsiders are not allowed to interfere." "It is well acknowledged that he is the father of the child in my sister's belly. Are you getting hard of hearing in your old age?" Pei Yi turned his gaze to Wu Lianzhi. "Tell me, are you a member of the East Palace family?" "This morning, when my mother served me the poisonous food, I immediately cut off the mother-son relationship with her. Previously, when the East Palace family plotted to kill An Xiaonin and me, I had already made it very clear. Although the name is still on the genealogy of the family and the East Palace family's registry, my surname is Wu now, and Wu Lianzhi is my current name. I am no longer a member of the East Palace family!" His every word was cold, sonorous and forceful. His open declaration in front of so many people showed his determination. "This is not up to you to decide!" The old lady of the East Palace family retorted, "Regardless of life and death, you remain unwaveringly tied to the East Palace family!" "Okay, then old lady from the East Palace, I want to ask you a question. Now that Miss An knows about your plan to harm her, are you in the mood to punish me here? Aren't you worried that the S Nation will propose a serious negotiation?" These words came from Wu Lianzhi, his tone cold and without any fear. "I have dealt with An Xiaoning before." Pei Yi smiled, "She is the type who seeks revenge. If you want to hurt her, do you think she will settle the matter peacefully? Alright, let's cut the crap. My time is precious. I'll take these two with me." Seeing that the people from the East Palace family were about to speak again, he added, "Unless you want to witness a bloody scene right here." In the end, the elders of the family could do nothing but let them off. They were furious but helpless. At last, the old lady of the East Palace family declared, "Forget it, forget it. Remove his name and destroy his household register!" "We have to return to S Nation." Pei Yi glanced at her, "Discarded me after using me? Didn't you say that you would agree to a request of mine? I haven't even said this yet, and you're saying that you're going back?" "I have urgent matters in S nation, but it's true that I promised you a request. Tell me, what is your request?" "Well, my request might put you in a difficult spot." "Then, in that case, do not bring it up. Say something that won't be challenging for me." "You really haven't changed at all. Stay with me for half a month," Pei Yi said as he turned to look at her. "How?" "Just like before." An Xiaoning looked at him and said, "No, you ask too much. First, no limitations to my freedom and no restraints. Second, half a month is too long; two days will suffice." Pei Yi's smile faded slightly. 'You are bargaining too much. Five days. That is my final offer. You said that you will fulfill my offer, so you can't go back on your word. Besides, I won't limit your freedom. "Can you let me return to my country first?" "No." "..." Wu Lianzhi, who was in the car, listened to the conversation between the two and wondered if there was a romantic relationship between the two. Could it be that these two had a complicated relationship? It certainly seemed that way. However, if that was the case, then the two of them would be too indiscreet in front of him. "Then let him go back to S Nation first. I'll be with you alone. Is that okay?" "I won't do anything to you. Let's stay together." His words were unquestionable. An Xiaoning did not say anything else. As they were not far from Qingping Mountain, they arrived quickly.. Coming to this place again brought her mixed feelings. Upon seeing her, Qin Guo was not happy at all. When they entered, she immediately rolled her eyes. She wondered why her master brought this troublesome woman back. Chapter 1304 As Long As You After serving the snacks and tea, Qin Guoduo asked, "Master, who is this?" "What is your name?" Pei Yi asked. "My name is Wu Lianzhi, and I remember I said it before." "I didn't pay attention. "Arrange a room for him," Pei Yi said to Qin Guo in a nonchalant tone. "Okay, but should I arrange it for Miss An?" "There is no need." Wu Lianzhi's suspicions were confirmed. It seemed that he was going to live with An Xiaoning. An Xiaonin noticed his confused gaze toward her and Pei Yi, and she quickly understood his misconception. For some reason, she did not want anyone to misunderstand her relationship with another man. Jin Qingyan was her only man. When it comes to her own man, she really has no way to deal with him. "Lianzhi, come out with me. I need to talk to you." "OK." "Did you misunderstand my relationship with Pei Yi?" she asked in a low voice. "Could it be that you..?" "Of course not. I usually sleep on the sofa. In the past, I had my hands and feet locked by him, so I slept on the sofa every day." "Does he have feelings for you?" "Nonsense." "We'll be back in five days," An Xiaoning said reassuringly, patting him on the shoulder. "All right." - In the past few days, Fang Erlan had been very busy with shooting scenes and promotions. Every day, she was busy from morning till night, leaving her exhausted. Despite Xiao Chenyang's effort to nourish her every day with substantive meals, she still lost a few pounds. "I'm afraid I won't be able to accompany you for the next few days." Xiao Chenyang read the message from An Xiaoning and said to Fang Erlan beside him. "What are you up to?" Xiao Chenyang did not tell her about Jin Qingyan's double personality. He did not want to hide it from her, but he believed that the fewer people who knew, the better. "I will come back as soon as possible. I have some important matters to attend to." "I'll go with you." "Don't you still have to film and promote?" "I can continue after we return." Xiao Chenyang caressed her head. The more nervous she was and the more she relied on him, the happier he was. "I also want you to go with me, because I feel the safest when you are around, but that's not possible this time." "What exactly are you going to do?" "If you don't tell me, I won't let you go," Fang Erlan said. Xiao Chenyang looked at her worried eyes and said, "Then you have to keep it a secret. You must never tell anyone about it." "Of course, I won't tell anyone." "Qingyan has disappeared," Xiao Chenyang said in a low voice. "What does that mean?" "He has a split personality, and his second persona leads to his disappearance. I don't know where he went, and we can't find him in the country now. He might have gone abroad, so I have to get someone to look for him. Besides, An Xiaoning is in DK now. I have to make a trip to R Nation because there is someone like me there. He's from the Wu family." "Who is this Wu family person?" "In the past, the Wu family was once a prominent witchcraft family in our country. They cursed An Xiaonin and Jingqing Yan in the past, but they mysteriously disappeared later on. Now, we found them, but the later generations did not practice their family's witchcraft. Instead, we found someone similar to me. This person must know witchcraft. It would be better if we could capture him. At the very least, we can't let him live if we can't capture him," Xiao Chenyang explained. "Will Xiaoning be alright?" Fang Erlan asked, feeling as if she had heard a fascinating tale. "Yes, she said she was fine. She will be back in a few days." "Go ahead then. I won't be with you anymore so you won't have to worry about me. I will ask Sister Yangyang to bring a few more bodyguards over." "I really don't know when Qingyan will recover." Xiao Chenyang reached out his hand and stroked her hair. "Isn't he your Senior Brother? Why did you call him by his name instead of Senior Brother?" "I prefer it this way. In the past, I rarely called him Senior Brother. Basically, when Master was around, I would address him politely. In private, I only called him by his name.  We grew up together, and we're very close." "I really can't blame you." Xiao Chenyang kissed her and said, "I'll leave when the bodyguards come. In the meantime, call your sister Yangyang, and I'll explain to her." "OK." Fang Erlan took out her phone and called Mei Yangyang. "Sister, Chenyang has something to say to you." "Alright," Mei Yangyang responded. Fang Erlan handed the phone to Xiao Chenyang, who put it next to his ear and said, "I have something important to do these days. I won't be with Erlan. Send eight bodyguards here." When Fang Erlan heard this, she immediately said, "There's no need for that much. Four is enough." "Not enough." "Just come over now," he insisted. "Alright, I'll send someone over now." "Yes." Xiao Chenyang hung up the phone and gave her careful instructions. "During the days when I am not at home, you make sure to have a good meal and rest well. When you are done with the work, take the time to sleep. Don't play with your mobile phone at night. It is not good for your eyes." "Got it." - Upon learning that Xiao Chenyang had come to R Nation, An Xiaoning felt a little relieved, hoping to find Jin Qingyan soon. During her two-day stay at Qingping Mountain, she did not sit there folding paper cranes to pass the time but rather practices Yoga on the cashmere carpet. When Pei Yi was working, he noticed her various yoga poses. From time to time, he would look up at her. Even if there was no communication, he felt that with her in the room, his whole spirit would be much lifted. "Now that DK has lost Marquis Jiaping, who is in charge of the overall situation?" "Because DK was founded by him. Although he is no longer around, there's no one comparable to take up his position." "Will you remarry Jin Qingyan?" he asked while looking at the computer. "Actually, it doesn't matter whether we get married or not," said An Xiaoning as she turned around and sat cross-legged, facing him. She originally wanted to answer him with certainty that she would get married again, but the curse matter made her unsure of what to say. "How can it be the same?" "A marriage contract is a potent weapon to prove the relationship between two people. When you get married, others address you as Mrs. Jing, not Miss An." "Anyway, we will be together." "Do you know why I kept you here?" Pei Yi asked. "Your life is too dull and boring. You need me to lighten it up." "An Xiaoning, can you stop being so smart?" "It can't be helped. I was born this way." "..." "It's not just for that reason." He pursed his lips and smiled. "Is there any other reason?" "If it weren't for you having someone in your heart, I want to be your man." "Don't you want a pure relationship?  Do you really find someone like me attractive?" "When a woman attracts the attention of a man, the other party sees beyond the surface and is drawn to her true nature. It is just like when I look at you, I naturally overlook the surface and perceive the real you beneath it.." Chapter 1305 As Long As You "An Xiaoning, I find myself greatly intrigued by you. I want to have a close friendship with you. Do you agree?" Pei Yi asked, raising his eyes to look at her. An Xiaoning stood up from the blanket and sat on the chair opposite his desk in her socks, casually propping her chin on her hand. "You are the head of the DK branch, and my other identity is the daughter of Madam President of S Nation. In other people's eyes, if we become friends, they will deem that we are an alliance driven by personal gains," she replied. "So, you decline my offer?" "Pei Yi, I appreciate you very much too, and I genuinely mean it. You're indeed very attractive. I'm not praising you because you said those things that I wish to hear. You're very capable, but I have a principle. Do you know?" An Xiaoning asked, peering at him. "What principle?" "I refuse to associate with anyone from the terrorist organization, even if they saved me. This is not a prejudice. Because many so-called righteous people engaged in callous killing, such as the East Palace Family. My wish is world peace. Although I know that this day may never come, and I know that it may take a long time, I do not wish for this world to have a war that claims the life of common people. Moreover, I cannot bear the rumors of colluding with DK. My parents are the president and the first lady of the country. I cannot bring them pressure. If some ill-intentioned people make a big fuss about it, it will have severe consequences." "I know what you said," Pei Yi nodded. "If, hypothetically, you were to leave DK one day, I think we will be very good friends. Now, it is better to keep things as I see fit." I did not expect his ambivalent answer, but his response surprised me. "Who knows?" Pei Yi replied. After lunch, Pei Yi went out on business, leaving her and Wu Lianzhi in the room. There were surveillance cameras everywhere in the room. Although this was Pei Yi's office, the two of them would not move his belongings without his permission. When Qin Guo saw the two playing cards leisurely, and she had to serve them with tea and water, she grew irritated. "Why are you just standing there? Get me some cake. I am in the mood for it." "Excuse me, Miss An, are you treating this place as your own home?" Qin Guo said grumpily. "So, you refuse?" Qin Guo turned away, muttering, "Eat your cake, fatty." Returning with the cake, she could not help but say, "I wonder what our master brought you back for. All you know is to eat, drink, and play." "You should ask your master yourself. How would I know?" "Ms. Qin, if you have nothing to do, come play cards with us," An Xiaoning said smilingly. Qin Guo remained silent. "Why? Not interested?" "If my master knows about this..." "It's fine. I will explain it to him. You have nothing better to do." Reluctantly, Qin Guo agreed, "Alright, since Miss An invited me, I'll play a few rounds." An Xiaoning really held back her urge to respond, "Do I really need to feel grateful for your approval?" But considering the place belonged to Pei Yi, she decided to let it be... While playing the game, Qin Guoduo asked, "Miss An, do you like our master?" "Do you want me to like him or dislike him?" "I'm asking you, do you like him?" "Why should I tell you my true feelings?" "If you don't like our master, don't toy with him. He looks cold and casual, but in fact, he takes personal relationships seriously." "Toy with him? Seriously? Child, you're thinking too much. There is nothing romantic between them." When Qin Guo heard this, she immediately asked, "Really? Is it true?" "Do you like him?" Qin Guo denied, "Of course not. We are not qualified to have feelings for our master." "That's true. You are not his type" Qin Guo, "..." "He finds two types of women attractive." "Can you elaborate?" A guileless and straightforward girl is the first type, and the second type is a strong woman with her ideas and abilities, a woman who can make him admire her. So, which type do you belong to?" "Neither," Qin Guo shook his head. "Then case closed " "Miss Qin, why did you join DK?" "There is no reason. My whole family has joined. Why should I be excluded?" "You really don't have your own opinions. Is it right for all your family members to join? Did you lose your common sense when your mother gave birth to you?" "..." "What's with that expression? Am I wrong?" "Miss An, you are being quite sharp-tongued." During the five days that Pei Yi was with her, An Xiaoning was very calm and relaxed. Although everything around her caused her to feel tense, fortunately, her feelings remained positive. Five days may seem lengthy, but they actually passed in the blink of an eye. To Pei Yi, it was too short. Nevertheless, he would still keep his promise and let An Xiaoning go back. Just as An Xiaoning was about to head back, she received a call from Xiao Chenyang, telling her that he had discovered traces of Henry in R Nation. Thus, the two of them went to meet up with Xiao Chenyang. Xiao Chenyang opened the door and was surprised when he saw Wu Lianzhi. "So, it really is you." "Do we know each other?" Xiao Chenyang suddenly burst into laughter. "What's wrong with him?" Wu Lianzhi asked, looking at An Xiaoning. "I've never seen him like this. He must have gone crazy, right?" An Xiaoning said as she walked in. Wu Lianzhi followed him inside. When Xiao Chenyang closed the door and finished laughing, he unscrewed a bottle of mineral water and took a few sips. "I already had a hunch that it was him. Seeing him in person today, it really feels like seeing something unbelievable.." "Looks like you know who he is. It saves me the time to introduce him in detail." "An Xiaoning, do you really not have any impression of him?" "No." Xiao Chenyang sat on the sofa with his long legs crossed on the coffee table. He smiled and said, "There is only such a talent in the Wu family. I naturally have some memories of him." "Don't keep me in suspense. Just tell me." "I heard that he is a close friend of yours." "I already knew about this. Did you smile for so long because of this? I cannot see what is funny," said An Xiaoning, who was still wondering what it was. "Well..." I laughed because it reminded me of Long Tianze. I could picture his expression in my mind vividly when he found out the truth. "What does it have to do with Long Tianze..." "It seems that when you recalled your past life, you only focused on your relationship with your man. You didn't care about anyone else." Chapter 1306 As Long As You "That seems to be the case. Hurry up and tell me," An Xiaoning said with a nod. "Yu Jiao and Wu Lianzhi were lovers in the previous life." "You are not joking, aren't you?" An Xiaoning asked, widening her eyes. "Why would I joke? Because our Lord Marquis has been jealous of him a few times, and occasionally mentioned that the one he likes is not you, but your maid." "..." Wu Lianzhi seemed to understand what he meant. "Who is Yu Jiao?" "She was my maid in my past life," An Xiaoning said with a forced smile. "What about this life?" "She's already married and has children in this life. Her husband is Long Tianze, the boss of the film and television production of an advertising company back in our hometown." Wu Lianzhi nodded. "Mr. Xiao, is Yu Jiao with me in my previous life?" "It's said that you two are lovers but are destined not to have a future. I know that you died because of the Wu family." "I see. But that was in our past life. Xiaoning, is she doing well now?" "Well, very good. Her husband loves her very much, and she has two kids. She lives very happily." "That's good." Wu Lianzhi took it lightly. "We didn't meet each other early in this life. It means that our karma has ended in our last life. It's enough for her to be happy in this life. But do you have a photo?" "I do." "This is Mei Yangyang," said An Xiaoning as she opened the photo album on her mobile phone and showed him. Wu Lianzhi looked over and gave a knowing smile. "She's quite beautiful." Indeed, and her daughter looks just like her, with an adorable round face. "Xiaoning." "Yes?" "Don't tell her about our relationship in the previous life, and don't tell her husband. It's good just like this. I don't want to disturb their peaceful life because of me." "Since you've said so, then l won't disclose it to them. It's best to leave things as they are. Since the two of you are no longer fated to be together in this life, it is better to focus on living your own lives," An Xiaoning said, not expecting him to be such considerate. That being said, it was time to discuss more pressing matters. "Have you found him?"  "I've already sent people to capture him. Once located, he will be bought back soon." "But did he come here specifically to find you?" Xiao Chenyang returned to his usual demeanor. "I don't think so. I don't know, but have you gone to the East Palace Residence?" "I did and had a confrontation with the elders there. I thought they were very powerful, but I defeated them with just a few moves. I've already taken him back to S country." "Awesome, you're so impressive," said An Xiaoning, giving him a thumbs-up. "Thank you, thank you." Xiao Chenyang took the opportunity to talk about Erlan's situation. "Your studio should train new talents. Erlan will stop filming after this production" "We are already preparing for that. Yangyang and I have already guessed that you would do this. However, when do you plan to get married?" "I haven't decided yet. I can't rush this. The wedding is such a serious matter, so I must prepare well. Originally, I thought it was a matter between the two of us, and we didn't need to share it with others. I can just invite some relatives and close friends. But now I have changed my mind. On the day of the marriage, I want the whole world to know that she is my woman." "Wow." "That is romantic. Did you plan to squander all your assets that day?" An Xiaoning praised. "Do you know how much wealth I have?" "50 billion?" Xiao Chenyang reached out to open the bottle on the table and poured three glasses in a row. "You really underestimate me. I'll drink. Feel free to join." As he spoke, he slowly savored the taste„ÄÇ "Where did you get so much money from?" An Xiaoning asked as she handed Wu Lianzhi a glass of wine. "I stole it." "Who would believe that?" "Then where did I get the money?" An Xiaoning stared at him for a few seconds before taking out her phone. "I believe that Erlan doesn't know about this either. I have to inform her about it. I wonder how she will react when she finds out," she said. "My bad," Xiao Chenyang grabbed her wrist. "Don't play tricks and be more sincere, okay?" "In the past, other than resting, in order to get myself busy, I was involved in several extensive business fields with Erlan. For example, a long time ago, our Xiao family was a big business powerhouse. Besides my three older sisters, I am the youngest and only son in the family, so all the assets were handed to me, and I dabbled in many fields.  Later, they grew larger and larger. In recent decades, I invested in jewelry, gold, and real estate. I made a lot of money and stopped at the right time. I will tell Erlan this when I go back. She is unaware of it now." "When did you stop investing the real estate?" "Two years ago." "You are really a capitalist." "I have indeed underestimated you. However, it's good that you managed to stop investing in time. Some merchants will never withdraw their money," An Xiaoning said bitterly. "How much money is enough? I have started to register in S Nation recently. It is really troublesome to not have a registered residence here." "Where is your current registered residence location?" "'Y Nation. I have to renew my residency and re-register every few decades. Now I'm planning to transfer my residency from abroad back to the country." "Do you have any plans for your future?" An Xiaoning asked, turning to look at Wu Lianzhi. "I don't think too much about it for now." "You can think about it now. Didn't you hear him say that the elder of the East Palace family, Wu Haigang, has already been brought back to S Nation? I believe that the people from your family will soon personally go to the country to find me. They definitely think that I was the one who did it. When that happens, I will also bring up your matter, so you can now plan for your future." "I want to find a woman who likes me and live a peaceful life together." "There will be." . The three of them had been waiting for news from Xiao Chenyang's subordinates. After a continuous two-hour wait, they finally received specific information about his whereabouts. They said that they wanted to capture him back, but because they could not subdue him, they let him run away. At this time, they could only rush over from the hotel. An Xiaoning immediately took off her mask when she saw him. "Henry!" Henry, who was in the distance, was stunned. He turned around and saw her. An Xiaoning ran towards him. He stood still and did not move. "Didn't I tell you not to cause trouble? Why did you always ignore my suggestions?" "I just felt that my home was too stuffy, so I wanted to come out for a walk." "Can't you bring someone with you when you come out? Then you can go wherever you want." An Xiaoning wanted to reach out and grab his arm, but he pulled her away skillfully. "You're trying to catch me. You're making me look like a criminal suspect," said Henry. Chapter 1307 As Long As You "I was just worried that you would get into trouble, so I wanted to find you quickly," An Xiaoning said as she hugged him, afraid that he would escape again. "Why is he here too?" "It's all for you." Heiny said nothing else and walked with her towards Xiao Chenyang. Fan Shixin finally felt relieved knowing that Henry had been found. He rubbed his temples, and his nerves hadn't had a moment of rest since Henry's escape. After resting for a while, he called for Xiaohuang to come over. "Captain, you called for me." "Bring He Yi to the duty room. I'll be right there." "Alright." Fan Shixin took a shower and changed into another set of clothes before leaving. He Yi was locked up in the basement until now. At this time, he was looking quite messy and nothing like when he was first captured. "Not just anyone can hurt our Young Madam. You should consider yourself lucky since you were our young master's high school classmate. This time, our Young Madam has decided to spare you. But this won't happen again, and we won't let you off next time. You can leave now," said Fan Shixin, glaring at him. The person who guarded He Yi immediately released him. He Yi straightened his body and knew that this was not the time for him to act tough, so he did not say anything. "Captain, why did you release him? Aren't the people from the police station going to be sentenced to death? He should be sentenced to a few years at least." "It was young madam's decision, and his situation is different from the ones who were sentenced to death." "At most, he's just a first-time offender who was threatened. He didn't cause any severe consequences either. We just had to teach him a lesson. As for the other seven or eight people, they were sent by the East Palace family to gather intelligence in S Nation. In our country, stealing intelligence is a serious offense. If He Yi was also sent by another nation, I believe our young madam wouldn't let him off either," Fan Shixin said calmly. "Captain, you haven't dried your hair. Did you take a shower?" "Yes, what is it?" "You took a shower and changed into a new set of clothes." "Captain, are you going on a date?" Xiaohuang asked happily, playfully rubbing its chin. "So what? You are jealous?" He chuckled, "I understand. For an old bachelor like you, seeing someone go on a date can be a fatal blow to you." "Captain, stop putting your foot into it." Xiaohuang wailed. "Alright, I'm leaving." Fan Shixin took a look at the time and left. From the time he went to R Nation to the time he came back to find Herny, there were a few times when Wu Pingyang wanted to meet him several times. But he had declined, saying that he was very busy and did not have time to go out with her for a date. So now that he suddenly had some time, he naturally wanted to make it up to her. He planned to pay her a visit now. Because he planned to buy some gifts for her, he did not call her directly. Wu Pingyang worked at City A's The First People's Hospital. Fan Shixin had bought a box of red roses, thinking that girls loved flowers, so he bought them for his girlfriend. After arriving at the second floor, he saw the indication of the oral department and approached with the gift box. At this moment, Wu Pingyang was engrossed in fitting braces for a teenage boy and didn't notice him entering. The other doctors saw it first and greeted him with a smile, "Is it Captain Fan?" "Hello." Hearing his voice, Wu Pingyang raised her head, overjoyed to see him. And she hurriedly said, "I'll be ready soon. Please take a seat first." "Sure." Fan Shixin sat down and noticed that the doctors and assistants around were staring at him, making him feel extremely uncomfortable. This was the first time he had seen his girlfriend at work. Wearing a white coat and a blue mask, she was focused on her tasks, giving off an aura of professionalism. It added a bit of charm to her for no reason. After she was done with her work, she noticed the envy of the female colleagues around her. She felt especially content and pleased. She directly took off her mask and her white coat. "Why are you here?" "I was busy a few days ago, so I came to see you now when I have time. I bought something for you." Wu Pingyang eagerly took the gift box and opened it to see that it was filled with red roses. "It looks really good. Are you available in the afternoon?" She asked happily. "Yes, I should be free." "Alright, I set aside half a day for you. My family wants to see you." "Let's talk outside," Wu Pingyang said as he closed the lid of the gift box. "Okay." "Your family wants to see me?" Fan Shixin asked as the two of them went out together. "Well, they asked when you are free and wanted to have a meal with you at home. I told them that you were busy a few days ago." "Then let's go to your house this afternoon. We'll have dinner at your house in the evening." Hearing his agreement, Wu Pingyang was thrilled. In fact, she was most afraid that he would refuse because she had already firmly stated to her grandfather that he would come. "Alright, I'll call my family right now." OK. Wu Pingyang immediately called her family to inform them of this news. "We're going to my grandfather's place. Have you thought of any gifts?" she asked excitedly after hanging up the phone. "I haven't decided yet." "My grandfather loves to drink the most famous vintage wine in City B. I forgot what it was called. It was an English name. The wine was very fragrant and it is a blue liquid." "Yes, yes, that's the one. My grandfather has been talking about that. When you go, bring this to him. He will be very happy." "That..." Fan Shixin could not help but remind her, "That bottle of wine is worth 200,000 yuan. It looks like it's already out of stock. Now, it's basically a rare collection. I'm afraid that it won't be easy to buy it for 200,000 yuan. Even the manufacturers are not selling it anymore. Do you want to change it to something else?" For his first visit to the woman's family, he understood the importance of bringing gifts. However, buying such expensive gifts directly made him worried that it might create the wrong impression, making the family perceive him as a wealthy individual from an affluent background. In fact, he was not from a wealthy family. Although he had a car and a house with a monthly salary of 200,000 yuan, he was not from the same family background as Long Tianze, Ling Ciye, and Jin Qingyan. His parents were working at the old mansion of the Jin family, and they were exhausted from the daily grind. "What's wrong with spending two hundred thousand on a bottle of wine? My grandfather can savor it for a long time. What's wrong with showing filial piety to him? Besides, we only buy it this time. When we get married in the future, the money we spend will come back to us through the wedding gifts, right?" "There are many ways to show filial piety to the elder, but you don't have to squander money." "I'll take care of the gifts myself; you don't have to worry about that," Fan Shixin rejected immediately. "Then what do you want to buy?" Wu Pingyang asked, feeling a bit choked up by his response. "I'll take a look in the afternoon." Chapter 1308 As Long As You Wu Pingyang did not dare to anger him, so she stopped talking about this matter." The main members of our family might all be here this time, so feel free to be yourself and don't hold back." "I won't be. I have been on various occasions before, so meeting some people is not a big deal. But why don't we go directly to your parent's house?" "It's mainly because my grandfather wants to meet you. My mom suggested arranging the meeting at my grandfather's place." " What if your family brings up the topic of marriage, how are you going to answer them?" asked Wu Pingyang. "After we get to know each other for a long time, it won't be too late to talk about marriage. I don't want to rush anything. After all, marriage is a life-long commitment." "Then where are we going now?" Wu Pingyang nodded in understanding. "Where do you want to go?" "Let's go to Winnie Residence." ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù He took her back to Winnie Residence. Just as he got out of the car, she glanced at the main villa. "Shixin, can you show me around? I really want to know what the house Mr. Jin lives in is like." "Usually, our young master doesn't allow outsiders to go to his house, unless they were permitted by him or were his friends. However, since you're my girlfriend, you can only see the living room. You can't go upstairs," Fan Shixin said hesitantly. In order not to make things difficult for him, she nodded obediently. "Okay." Fan Shixin held her hand and walked to the door. Just she took a look inside, Wu Pingyang exclaimed, "Wow, it's really impressive!" "Come in." He invited and stepped in. Wu Pingyang followed him in and looked around. The last time she came here, she only went to his residence and did not dare to come here. But now, seeing the interior, her heart was filled with excitement. It is too luxurious. "If I am lucky enough to live in such a house in this life, I will have no regrets even if I die!" She envisioned. After the tour, she still wanted to go upstairs to take a look but refrained as she had already promised him. "Shixin, who was that auntie we saw earlier?" Wu Pingyang asked softly, once they left the place. "She is Aunt Chen. She is in charge of the kitchen. Her cooking skills are excellent." "I see." "Do you want to eat here or eat out?" Fan Shixin asked when it was almost noon. "Let's eat here. There's no need to dine out." "Then what do you want to eat?" he asked again. "Anything I want?" "I want to eat something delicious," Wu Pingyang raised his head. "Tell me, I will try my best to arrange it for you." "I'd like to have some red wine and steak." "Alright, I'll inform the kitchen. You can wait for me at the duty room first," Fan Shixin said with a nod. "Sure." She obediently headed towards the duty room while Fan Shixin instructed the kitchen and called An Xiaomin. At this time, it was late at night in Country R, but An Xiaoning was still awake. "Young Madam, did you sleep?" "Not yet, what's the matter, Shixin?" "Today, my girlfriend asked me to have dinner with her family, and I want to know what gifts I should bring?" Fan Shixin asked after some thought. "You have to prepare two sets for her parents." "Not just for her parents." "She told me to go to her grandfather's house, which is the Mu family," Fan Shixin said with a dry cough. "For your first visit, why not meet her parents first? If you need to go to her grandfather's house, the gifts that you prepared are way more complicated. After all, her parents, her uncle, her aunt, and her grandfather will be present. Besides, it's not the right time to discuss marriage, so it's better to avoid meeting her extended relatives right away. If you visit them frequently, you'll go bankrupt." "Today, she said that her grandfather liked to drink Blueocean and asked me to buy him a bottle of this. She said that her grandfather will be very happy." "Why is this girl so unreliable?" You two have just started dating. It's not like you're already married. There's no need for that now. How about this? Go to the wine cellar and bring his grandfather a bottle of wine worth 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Treat her uncle and father the same way, giving each of them cigarettes and bottles of wine. You don't need to go out of your way to buy new ones; just take them from our collection at home. This should be more than enough. In most ordinary families, man usually brings gifts worth a few hundred or a few thousand. "Alright, thank you, Young Madam," said Fan Shixin gratefully. "Remember to wear proper clothes when you go." "Got it." After hanging up the phone, Fan Shixin immediately went to prepare. He specially wrapped them with gift bags. Then he carried it to the duty room. "What is it?" Wu Pingyang asked when he saw the gift bag in his hand. "Wine and cigarettes, prepared for your grandfather, your uncle." "What about my mother and my aunt?" "There's no need to buy gifts for everyone. It's not like we're getting engaged, so bringing these is enough," Fan Shixin replied. "How can you buy gifts for men and not for women? How do you expect my aunt and my mother to think? Besides, this is your first visit, how can you be careless?" "Inconsiderate? These are worth fifty to sixty thousand. Is it considered inconsiderate for me to bring fifty to sixty thousand for the first time? It is already quite expensive." "Could it be that for a first visit, you're expecting me to bring gifts worth over a hundred thousand?" Fan Shixin asked. "You don't care about me at all. I didn't ask you to bring gifts worth of tens of thousands to my mother and aunt, but at the very least, you should buy something to show your sincerity, right?" Wu Pingyang bit his lip and looked at him." "Alright then, I'll go buy some gifts on the way back," said Fan Shixin, suppressing his emotions. Considering Wu Pingyang's usual temperament, she would have already left in a huff. However, she knew that she couldn't afford to mess this up; otherwise, her family would not easily forgive her. "Alright, I'm hungry," she said, restraining her temper. "I'll take you to eat" "Okay" It was Fan Shixin's first time visiting the Mu family. For some reason, he felt nothing good about the Mu family, Wu Pingyang's grandfather, parents, uncle, and aunt. He always felt that they were looking at him with expectant eyes. He could see clearly through what they were thinking. Being an introverted person, Fan Shixin wasn't good at small talk with strangers. He had originally thought that meeting Wu Pingyang's family wouldn't be a big deal since he had experienced various occasions, but being in their presence made him realize that spending an entire afternoon or even an evening with this group of inquisitive people was quite an ordeal. They were so straightforward. They first asked about when they were going to get married, then asked a lot of topics that he could not answer due to business reasons and topics about Jin Qingyan and An Xiaonan. He avoided all of them. It was obvious that they were all very upset and did not receive any particularly useful information from him. Chapter 1309 As Long As You Seeing that her grandfather was a little disappointed, Wu Pingyang felt as if she had lost face. She whispered to Fan Shixin beside her, "Can't you just go along with his wishes when he asks you questions? It's boring when you don't say anything." "They kept asking me questions I can't tell. What can I do? I cannot compromise my principle," said Fan Shixin. "That sucks." Wu Pingyang muttered, feeling that he was completely different from the man she had imagined. "What did you say?" Fan Shixin frowned. At that moment, he caught an impatient expression on her face. "Nothing." Fan Shixin wanted to leave immediately, but since he was already here, he forced himself to endure and stay until night. During the meal, the people at the table kept toasting him. Despite his high alcohol tolerance, he began to feel a bit tipsy after consuming so much alcohol. He repeatedly waved his hand, insisting that he couldn't drink anymore. Besides, he needed to drive, but Wu Pingyang's uncle insisted on having the servant drive him back. He couldn't resist their enthusiastic toasts. He drank one cup after another. In the end, his stomach felt really uncomfortable, and he resolutely refused to drink. As Jin Qingyan's assistant, he had always abided by one of his principles. In a situation like this, he absolutely could not let himself lose control. Otherwise, it would be inviting trouble. His worries were justified when Wu Pingyang's mother told him to sleep in the Mu family's house, he immediately sobered up a little and repeatedly declined. Despite the Mu family's insistence, he firmly refused.. Finally, they have no choice but to send someone to drive him back and ask Wu Pingyang to take care of him. Wu Pingyang followed him into the car and drove back to Winnie residence. Fan Shixin leaned against the back of his chair with his eyes closed, feeling a little drowsy. But he was not completely unconscious. When they reached home, Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai helped him out of the car. Under the influence of alcohol, he managed to open his eyes slightly as he slurred, "You should go back." "You drank too much. I will stay by your side and take care of you." "Sister-in-law, we are here. We will take care of him. You can go back." Xiaobai chuckled. As soon as he said that, Xiaohuang patted him. "What are you talking about?" Wu Pingyang remembered how she always portrayed herself as a pure and innocent girl in front of Fan Shixin, so she nodded and got into the car again. "Give him some hangover soup," she instructed through the window. "Okay, sister-in-law. Take care." Seeing that the car had left, Xiaohuang said, "Why did you let Sister-in-law leave when she wanted to stay? You idiot." "Didn't you see that our captain asked her to go back? It means that our captain doesn't want her to stay here." "Captain, why did you drink so much?" asked Xiao Huang. "I've been drinking all this time. It upsets my stomach... Ugh..." Unable to hold it anymore, he puked it all up. This time, he felt much better, and his senses started to return slowly. Little White called for people to clean up and brought him back to the house. He then went to the kitchen to make the sobering soup and gave him a drink before leaving. Fan Shixin slept for two to three hours. When he woke up, other than the severe headache, his dizziness was significantly reduced, and he didn't feel like sleeping anymore.. He got up and washed up, changed into clean clothes, and went out the door. It was already eleven o'clock at night. It was Xiao Bai's night shift, and when he saw Fan Shixin awake, he yawned, "Captain, why are you up?" "My head hurts. I can't sleep." His voice was hoarse. "If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have asked sister-in-law to go back. If I had asked her to stay with you, you wouldn't have trouble sleeping, and you'd sleep soundly." "Right, Captain?" Xiao Bai winked at him. "Don't call her sister-in-law. We aren't married yet." Fan Shixin said. "It doesn't matter. Our Young Madam hasn't remarried our Young Master, and we still call her Madam. Captain, aren't you feeling embarrassed? Don't be pretentious. She didn't say anything about it." "Didn't you sleep during the day? Why do I feel like you're so listless now? You must be in high spirits," Fan Shixin teased him. "Yes, Captain!" Xiaobai shook his body and opened his eyes wide, trying to raise his spirit. Fan Shixin reached for the mouse and scanned the surveillance of the residential area. When he checked, he actually found that the lights of his house were still on. It was already so late, why wasn't she asleep yet? "How's Miss Mu doing these few days? " "She is doing fine, but Miss Mu won't let us send her food." "Huh?" "Why?" Fan Shixin asked. "Miss Mu said that it's too much trouble for us to bring her three meals a day. She hopes we can bring her groceries once, and she'll cook for herself. It's a way to pass the time. So today, we have already filled up the refrigerator. It is almost enough for Miss Mu to eat for two or three days." Fan Shixin nodded and turned to leave the duty room. It started to drizzle outside. He went out of the gate and went to his house. After entering the password, Fan Shixin slowly walked in, closing the door as quietly as possible. Walking to the door of the second bedroom, he politely knocked on the door. "Who is it?" she asked. "Me." Come in. "Why aren't you resting yet?" Fan Shixin asked as he pushed open the door and saw her sitting on the bed, embroidering a cross tattoo. "I can't sleep." "You drank?" Mu Wansheng smelled the faint scent of alcohol on his body. "I took a shower and brushed my teeth. Can you still smell it?" "It's very faint, but I can still smell it. It seems that you drank a lot." "I went to your family's place this afternoon, and we had dinner there. Your family members kept making me drink." Mu Wansheng put down the cross-stitch in her hand, "Is it because of the engagement?" "No, Ping Yang said that your grandfather wanted to see me, so I went." "You must have spent a lot of money on gifts, right?" Mu Wansheng stared at him and said in a certain tone. "It was Young Madam who asked me to bring a bottle of wine worth 20,000 to 30,000 yuan from the warehouse, as well as a few expensive cigarettes." "Captain Fan, do you like Ping Yang?" Mu Wansheng took a deep breath. "I should like her," said Fan Shixin, staring into her eyes. The words that Mu Wansheng wanted to say were stuck in her throat. She did not want to say too much, but she also didn't want to see someone who had been kind to her getting hurt.  "The marriage between you and Pingyang is something that all the elders in the Mu family, except my mother, want to see happen, especially my grandfather. Ping Yang is not completely sincere with you. She has other motives for you." When she said this, her two hands were holding her quilt, but her tone was very gentle. "Marriage is all based on the conditions." "That's why I don't intend to get married now. I'll make a decision after we get to know each other better," said Fan Shixin, who was already aware of this fact. Chapter 1310 As Long As You "Captain Fan, you're so kind. Pingyang will surely see all the good things about you.." Mu Wansheng smiled. "Do you really think I am good?" "Of course, you are the person who treats me the best in the world." Fan Shixin did not expect her to use the word 'best'. The corners of his lips curled into a smile. "What if I don't want Pingyang anymore and want you instead?" he asked. Mu Wansheng looked at him in shock. "Captain..." "Scared? I was just joking," said Fan Shixin, laughing at her reaction. "It's late. Captain, you should go back and rest early. I'm sleepy." Mu Wansheng lowered her gaze. "Okay, goodnight," Fan Shixin said, holding back his smile. "Good night." Mu Wansheng laid down slowly and reached out to turn off the lights. He then closed the door. She reached out and touched her face. It was boiling hot. Just now, she actually took his joke seriously. She felt a little embarrassed and guilty. How could she have mistaken it for seriousness? Was she too stupid? He was Ping Yang's boyfriend and would be her cousin-in-law in the future. As the thought of "cousin-in-law" crossed Mu Wansheng's mind, her eyes dimmed. She knew that once she recovered from her injuries, she would have to return to the Mu family. After all, she could not hide in a room forever and not go out. She had to earn money to repay her debts in the future. The Mu family would have discovered her sooner or later. As she pondered over these thoughts, one would feel that being able to live here at this moment brought her security and comfort, and there was no need to worry about eating. All those made her cherish the moment even more. What she had always longed for was a warm home. So it didn't matter if her boyfriend wasn't rich. As long as he was good to her, she was willing to work hard together with him to strive for their future. Now, there was nothing left. Her hopes were all extinguished. Mu Wansheng closed his eyes, and tears streamed down from the corner of her eye. By the time An Xiaoning, Henry, Wu Lianzhi, and Xiao Chenyang returned, it was already dawn. When she returned to Winnie residence again, she felt a sense of security. It was as if she had already treated this place as her home. No, this was her home. After arranging a guest room for Wu Lianzhi and Xiao Chenyang, An Xiaoning, and Henry went upstairs together. As soon as she entered the bedroom, she kicked off the slippers on her feet and threw herself onto the big bed. "Ah, it's so comfortable." "Have you had enough sleep?" "No, I need to remove my makeup first, put on a face mask, and lie down to clear my mind. I need to think about how to solve the next problem." Henry went to take a shower. By the time he came out wearing a bathrobe, she was already lying on the bed, crossing her legs and leisurely applying a facial mask. He wiped his hair as he walked to her makeup table and began to use her skin care products. "Your skin is better than mine. Why bother using all these products?" "Do I have to wait until I'm old?" "You won't grow old. You'll live for a long time, so don't worry about that," An Xiaoning reminded. "If I don't grow old, then you'll be in trouble. I'll stay youthful while you turn into an old woman with a face full of wrinkles at seventy or eighty.." "Well, you might be disappointed because I won't age and die like that.." Her eyes shot him a sharp glare, sending shivers down his spine. "This is such a beautiful wish." "I'm serious." "Oh, really?" "It's true!" He rubbed his face and walked over, nodding at her. "It's all true," he said half-heartedly. Seeing that he wanted to sit down, An Xiaoning stretched out her legs and placed them beside the bed. Then unexpectedly, he sat directly on her lap. "What are you doing? The bed is mine, go to your sofa," said An Xiaoning as she turned around and kicked him on the neck with her other foot. "Did you write your name on it?" "If you lie here, I will touch you and kiss you." "Bring it on, as long as you don't want to be thrown onto the wall again." He lifted his legs to the side and lay down. "'Henry, you have getting bold now, don't you?." "When a dog is anxious, it jumps over the wall." An Xiaoning got out of bed and pulled out a thin needle from the drawer. Then, she grabbed his hand and pricked it on his hand before he could react. He wanted to retract his hand, but before he knew it, she had sucked on the spot where she had pricked him. Henry looked at her in a daze. "Why did you stab me?" "Drink your blood." "..." "Psycho." An Xiaoning took his hand out of her mouth and lay back down on the bed, ignoring him. Henry raised his hand and looked at the sparkling saliva with a disgusted expression. He sat up and went to the bathroom to wash his hands before coming out. "So disgusting." "So gross?" "Isn't it that gross? I'll tell you something even more disgusting and you will be silent for a minute," said An Xiaoning as she leaned closer to him. "I won't listen." "Come on, just listen." "I said no." He felt that it was not something good, so he resolutely refused, but his refusal did not have any effect, because the person who wanted to say it would say it. An Xiaoning's lips moved slightly as she spoke. The revelation sent Henry into a complete frenzy, and his face turned as red as a tomato. "You're making that up! I don't believe it." An Xiaoning got out of bed and went out. Ten minutes later, she returned. "You don't believe me, right? We will take a look at the surveillance cameras." Henry was conflicted and curious at this time. Just like that, he grabbed the phone in her hand and ran to the bathroom. "You don't believe me? The evidence is really firm," An Xiaoning mumbled to herself, amused by his actions. Henry had never expected that he would do such a thing. It was simply unbelievable. It left him feeling incredibly exposed in front of An Xiaoning in an instant. He knew that his body must have intimate encounters with An Xiaoning, because the child was the best proof. But he didn't expect that he would personally attend to her and even allowed her to record it! His head was about to explode at this moment. He quickly deleted the video completely and then came out with his eyes wide open. An Xiaonin reached out her hand, and he handed her the phone, not saying a word. Seeing that he had deleted the video, she calmly said, "This video was originally on my computer.  I just made a copy of it." "What if the hacker hack into our computer and broadcast it to the whole world??" He glanced at her, somewhat worried... Chapter 1311 As Long As You "Of course not. This video was taken on a whim when I was in the middle of it. Later, I saved it in a hidden folder on my computer. However, I deleted it when I made the copy just now. Look at how nervous you are." Henry was relieved to hear her explanation. He knew that his body had engaged in intimate activities with her, but he had no impression of it at all. He even did not know what it felt like. "You are bold." "Isn't this normal?" "Do you prefer to continue sleeping or get up?" An Xiaoning asked, propping her head up with one hand. "What about you?" "I can't sleep anymore. I will get up soon." In that case, you get up. I sleep." But his wish betrayed him as he couldn't sleep at all. In the morning, everyone gathered for breakfast. Wu Lianzhi seemed a bit reserved since he was in someone else's home. Just as everyone was enjoying their meal, Long Tianze hummed a tune and walked in. "Hello, my dear friends, I'm here." When Xiao Chenyang saw him, he glanced at An Xiaoning involuntarily. An Xiaoning instantly got his message, and the two of them smiled tacitly. "What's so special about you coming?" Henry asked. "I miss you!" "Get lost." "I haven't eaten yet. Let me join. Auntie Chen, get me a pair of chopsticks," Long Tianze said with a shrug of his shoulders. "Alright." This was Long Tianze, and he always behaved like this in front of his friends. Long Tianze took the chopsticks from Auntie Chen and sat down happily to eat. "Who is this?" He looked up at Wu Lianzhi. "Hello, I am Wu Lianzhi." "Long Tianze." As soon as he said that, Wu Lianzhi was stunned. He remembered the name Long Tianze very well and couldn't help but give him a few more glances. "Why do you keep looking at me? Are you interested in me?" Long Tianze asked, his tone amused. "No, I just think you seem like a good guy," Wu Lianzhi laughed awkwardly. "Of course. I'm the best man in S Nation. Is that so, Qingyan?" Long Tianze asked, his grin unable to be suppressed. Henry said bluntly, "You've blown your trumpet so much that you've forgotten your last name." "Do I need to brag? It's a fact. Sister-in-law, tell me, am I not good to Yangyang? I did everything she asked me." "Yes, I admit that. You have been really good to Yangyang." "Regardless of whether he is the best man in S Nation or not, he is at least a good man to Yangyang," An Xiaoning chimed in. "See, Little Jin?" Henry did not say anything further and continued eating. After breakfast, Xiao Chenyang asked someone to bring Wu Haigang, the elder of the Wu family. Then he turned to An Xiaonin, "He should be more skilled in witchcraft, but he is actually not good at martial arts. However, I think he should be able to lift the curse between you and Qingyan if he is good enough. Do you have any good ways to persuade him willing to help?" he asked. "What people care about is just their lives. However, it depends on whether he still wants to live or not. He knows that even if he helps us lift the curse, he won't live long afterward. After all, to remove the curse, one must not know the exact birthdates of Qingyan and me. If he knows about it, how can we let him live?  So, this approach won't work. We need to try another way to persuade him.." "What's the other plan?" Xiao Chenyang listened attentively. "You and I both know the fundamental reason why his family changed its name and moved to R Nation. For a family, it is extremely difficult to change their original surname. Therefore, the descendants are more important than anything else." Xiao Chenyang agreed with her analysis. "What you said makes sense. Let's stick to this plan. Anyway, his family background is just like that. If the thing that he is good at does not exist, what is the difference between him and ordinary people?" However, why don't you go over and check up on others? " "I was just about to do that. Wait here," An Xiaoning said with a nod. "Sure." When An Xiaoning went to check up on others, Long Tianze and Wu Lianzhi were chatting in the living room, but Mei Yangyang was nowhere to be seen. "Mr. Long, where's Yangyang?" "She went to the studio early in the morning. Didn't she mention that she wanted to talk to the two boys and a girl selected at school?" She nodded, ""I see. What were you two big men talking about?" "Nothing much. Just some men's topics" "I noticed that Brother Wu is quite humorous," Long Tianze said with a grin. "Humorous?" She rolled her eyes. She couldn't see what was humorous about Wu Lianzhi. "Yes, sister-in-law. He is quite humorous." "When will Yangyang come back?" "Soon, she left without eating breakfast. She said she would come back for lunch." "Lianzhi, do you know that Tianze and Yangyang's daughter is engaged to my son?" An Xiaoning asked after taking a look at the time. Wu Lianzhi nodded, "He just told me, but it's a bit traditional to be engaged at such a young age." "I really like our little chubby Xiaoxi. She's so chubby and cute. She looks like Yangyang." "That's right, that's my little sweetheart. You can't like her," Long Tianze said proudly. "Yeah. When it comes to his little sweet, he is so happy." Wu Lianzhi smiled and nodded. "I can see that Brother Long and your family are really happy." "Of course." "I say, can you two call each other that?" An Xiaoning asked in disdain. "Is there a problem?" Of course, there is a problem. When Mr. Long calls you 'Brother Wu,' it sounds like 'No Chest' in Chinese.  And when Lianzhi calls you 'Brother Long,' people might mistake it for 'Chest Enhancement.' You two are really a perfect match! Is today the first time you're meeting and getting to know each other? Is it because neither of you has a chest that you're planning to get chest enhancements together?" Hearing her analysis, the two of them couldn't help but laugh. They really didn't expect this. Half an hour later, Mei Yangyang returned. She wore jeans and a beige sweater, carrying a bag as she entered. "Honey, I'm back." "Dear, a friend has arrived at home." "Who is it?" Mei Yangyang looked at his friend on the sofa as she changed her shoes. After taking a look, she hesitated, "This is..." "It's my friend, Wu Lianzhi. Tianze chatted with him the first time he met him today." "He's outgoing," Mei Yangyang said with a smile as she entered. Chapter 1312 As Long As You Wu Lianzhi looked at her. Although he really couldn't recall any memories related to her, he always felt an explicable familiarity with her. "Hello." Mei Yangyang replied, "Hello." "How do you feel?" An Xiaoning asked when she saw that Wu Lianzhi remained calm and composed. "I feel pretty good. I'm really happy to see her leading a happy and peaceful life." "Don't worry. You'll find happiness too. It's just that you were fated to be together in your previous life, but you won't be able to get a share in this life. Just plan your future and tell me what you want to do. If I can help you arrange it, I'll arrange it for you," said An Xiaoning as she patted his shoulder. Wu Lianzhi entered the door with her. "I can feel that her husband is really a very good person. It is very difficult to live a bad life with such an optimistic man. I am very relieved and very happy. As for my future, I want to live a peaceful life and find a girl who can bring me happiness to live with. But to meet a good girl, I guess I have to go where there are more girls, right?" "That makes sense" An Xiaoning agreed. Not long after he returned, Wu Haigang was brought before them. An Xiaoning looked at the man in front of her. He looked to be in his thirties or forties but did not look old at all. "Hello, Mr. Wu. I believe you are very familiar with this man. He used to be a member of the Wu family like you." "He doesn't deserve to be a member of our Wu family," he said coldly. "Then are you worthy?" "Let me tell you this. Today, you've fallen into our hands. There's no other choice. Your life is no longer worth mentioning. More importantly, do you want the entire Wu family and the descendants of the Wu family to be buried with you?" An Xiaoning asked, glaring at him. "Including him?" He pointed at Wu Lianzhi. "No, although he has changed his surname to Wu, he is no longer a member of your family. So, he is not included. Mr. Wu, you should know what my identity is now. A big family in R nation is actually nothing special. A bomb will probably kill many people, right? R Nation is still in an unstable state, and the situation is turbulent. So, whether you want to remove our curse or protect your people, you can decide for yourself." "You..." He asked, "How can I trust you? Believe that you won't go back on your words and not keep your word?" "You have no choice now." "Do you think I've already forgotten that your family is planning to kill me? A powerful family like yours trying to harm another country's citizens, and me in particular.  Do you think my country wouldn't negotiate with R nation over this? If I want, I have many ways to make your family pay twice the price and wipe you all out. You must want to see it for yourself, right?" An Xiaoning asked. Wu Haigang closed his eyes and had nothing else to say. Indeed, his life was already lost. But if his entire family was wiped out, he would be the guilty one in the eyes of his ancestors. How could he face them after death without feeling remorseful? This time, it was really a complete failure. - "Sister Erlan, I heard that the scene of the well water has been completed. I am leaving today." "Does it matter if his scenes are finished or not?" Fang Er Lan touched her lips lightly with lipstick. "Other than being diligent when he first joined the crew, he hasn't come to the set at all. The director said most of his scenes were completed by a stunt double. If he were in his brother's drama, I doubt this would work." "Of course. Director Jing Tian's demands are quite high. It's impossible for him to use substitutes so frequently." "By the way, Sister Erlan, when will Cousin come back?" Xiaoyue asked. "Soon." "Ah, I crave some good food. When cousin is here, he will think of buying all kinds of delicious food for you. I will also take advantage of it and enjoy it." "Little foodie." "Let's go." Fang Erlan stood up from her chair. "Okay." Xiaoyue carried her bag and followed her out. The bodyguards outside the door watched her come out and followed her one by one. What a scene! After all, Yu Caiwei had only brought three or four bodyguards with her, but she had brought eight bodyguards with her. As soon as they walked over, they formed a long line. At this time, they were still participating in the promotional activities of the TV series. It was a meet-and-greet. Most of the people who came to participate were Yan Ge's female fans. At a glance, she knew that there were not many fans. Although Fang Er Lan had gained some fame, her fans were scarce since her relationship with Yan Ge was only recently made public, and none of their TV dramas had been aired yet. So, how could she have many fans? However, Fang Er Lan didn't know that she actually did have a dozen or so fans present. Only twenty out of a few hundred people attended the event. It was indeed... The event only lasted for half an hour or so. Just as it was about to end, something unexpected happened. When Fang Erlan was about to leave, she was closest to the crowd. At that moment, a man in his fifties lunged at her. It was not normal, so her bodyguards were trying to block him. He managed to slip under their arms and grabbed Fang Er Lan. The scene erupted into chaos. Fang Erlan fell directly onto the body of the bodyguard. The outer bodyguard reacted subconsciously and pulled her away and tossed the man aside at a quick speed. Everyone retreated one after another. The fifty-year-old man fell heavily. Fang Erlan stood up straight and was still in shock, but she remained calm and left quickly. Xiao Yue was so angry that she went back to the car and scolded, "Damn, is that old man tired of living? If cousin is here, it would be strange if he doesn't cut off his arm." Fang Erlan regained her composure and said nothing. Seeing that she did not speak, Xiaoyue thought that she was in a bad mood and quickly comforted her, "Sister Erlan, it's okay. Didn't you see that our bodyguard threw the old man out?" "Xiaoyue, what do you want to do in the future?" "Huh? What do I want to do in the future?" Xiaoyue asked in surprise. "I want to continue working for you in the future." "What if I quit the entertainment industry?" Xiao Yue looked at her, "Then I want to be with you, Sister Erlan." "If I quit the entertainment industry, Xiaoyue, you won't be able to follow me. Xiaoyue, isn't your family background quite ordinary? You once said that your biggest wish now is to have your own house in City A, right?" "Yes, but the house price is so high now. I can't afford it even if I spend a few thousand yuan a month." "How much savings do you have now?" Fang Erlan asked. "More than thirty thousand." "How about I buy you a house with one bedroom and one living room?" Xiao Yue was dumbfounded, "Sis, you can't do that. A house with a room and a living room costs at least two hundred thousand. I've only been with you for a short while, so you can't buy me a house, Sister Erlan." Chapter 1313 As Long As You "You really don't want it?" "No. Sister Erlan, you worked hard to earn money. You just save the money for yourself. I believe that one day I will save enough money for the down payment." Fang Erlan did not say anything more. When she returned to the hotel to rest, she sat on the bed alone and browsed the housing listing online. Xiao Yue had spent a year with her, and almost every day with her. When she withdrew from the entertainment industry in the future, she would not be able to do it with her. She wanted to do something for Xiaoyue. After all, she had always been especially good to her, taking good care of her. When the doorbell rang, she had already found several residential areas. There were bodyguards guarding the door, so she opened the door without looking through the peephole. When she saw the man at the door, Fang Erlan smiled. "You're back?" "Yes." He entered and closed the door behind him. "What are you doing?" He swept her up in his arms and walked inside. "Looking for properties online." "Houses?" Xiao Chenyang put her on the bed and glanced at the notebook on the small table on the bed. "One room and one living room?" Shouldn't we get a bigger place for us," he said, puzzled. "It's not for us. It's for Xiaoyue." Xiao Chenyang took off his shoes. "Does she have money to buy a house?" "I want to buy it for her," said Er Lan. "Not a problem," replied Xiao Chenyang. He sat next to her and reached out to hold her shoulder. "But which one do you fancy?" "Look, this one and that one." She held the mouse and showed it to him one by one. "I think the one in Sanqiao district is a good one. It has good ventilation and natural lighting. By the way, isn't An Xiaoning's house there? Let's take this one." Seeing his approval, Fang Erlan was determined to have this. After noting down the owner's contact information, she asked, "Should we also prepare our house properly? It will take a long time for us to move it after the renovation." "You don't have to go through so much trouble to renovate it. Let's just buy a fully furnished villa. I have asked Captain Fan and there is a well-decorated villa in Winnie Estate for sale, and the price is quite fair. Let's buy it." "Villa?" "Is it similar to Sister Yangyang's family?" Fang Erlan asked. "Almost." "Then Let's buy it." "OK." "Today, when I participated in the event, an old man managed to get close and pounce on me." His eyes flashed with anger and, she added, "Fortunately, our bodyguards are also good. They threw him out in the next second." Fang Erlan took away the computer and the small table, then sat next to him again and gave him a serious look. "To be honest, have you missed me these days?" "I don't miss you. I miss Fang the little dog ." "You are the puppy," she said, feigning anger. He hugged her and lay down. "Alright, alright, I'm like a little dog, and you're the woman who sleeps with a little dog." "Can't you speak properly?" Fang Erlan reached out and pinched him. "Yes, Mrs. Xiao." Fang Erlan asked with satisfaction, "Has everything been settled?" "Almost, but it's quite funny." "Let me talk to you about what happened," he said as he turned around. "Alright, I'm all ears." At the hospital, An Xiaoning and Henry went to the hospital to see Mr. Jin. Fan Shixin told him that Mr. Jin had already woken up and that he was fine. All he needed to do was to recuperate in the hospital. Henry wasn't very keen on coming.  It was An Xiaoning who insisted on him being there. When they entered the ward, Mr. Jin was reading a newspaper. Upon seeing the two of them, he could not help but snort. "It's been so many days. As a son, you came to see me after such a long time. How can that make sense?" "It's already good enough that I come. What else do you want?" Henry replied bluntly. "What do you mean by 'enough'? I am your father!" "You know you are my father?" Henry's attitude was cold, and he didn't want to bother with him, "When will you behave yourself?" Mr. Jin was so angry that he stopped talking and placed the newspaper on the bed. "Mr. Jin, are you feeling better?" An Xiaoning put down the fruit and asked. "Yes, much better." "Qingyan hasn't been feeling well these past few days, so he didn't come to visit you. Actually, he's still worried about you. But Mr. Jin, can you not go to the casino in the future? I remember that you never went to the casino before. If you feel that the days are boring now, you can travel with people around your age or participate in other recreational activities. That would be more practical." "What's the point of interacting with people I don't know?" Mr. Jin snorted. "Not fun at all " "Yes, it's more meaningful than losing money like you do." "Now that you're lying in the hospital, you can't gamble, can you?" Henry said. "You won't be happy if you don't argue with me all day, won't you?" "If you don't have anything else to say, then just leave." Mr. Jin said angrily. Without another word, Henry grabbed An Xiaoning by the arm and turned to leave. When they arrived outside the room, he let go of her arm and said, "I already said that I don't have to see him. You insisted on coming." "Your dad is in the hospital. If you don't come and see him, you will be scolded by others. You have to come to see him." He was very impatient, "Paying him a visit, I might as well go and see the dogs at home." "Alright, we've already seen him. Let's go back," An Xiaoning said speechlessly. No matter what, she had visited Mr. Jin at the hospital. But there was still a place to go. When he noticed that they were not going back to Winnie residence, he asked, "Where are you going?" "To the Devil Training Camp." He did not say anything else and allowed the car to drive to the large courtyard of the Devil Training Camp. Along the way, An Xiaoning bought gifts for the children, including the two children from Long Tianze's family. The children all liked the gifts very much. It had already been an hour since they returned from here. Wu Haigang had already promised to remove the curse for them, but he would have to wait until the day of Jin Qingyan's birthday, which was on October 16th. It was almost there, so there was no need to rush these few days. Therefore, Wu Haigang was temporarily detained. She even specially checked information about Wu Lianzhi overseas. She originally wanted to transfer his household register to S Nation, but unexpectedly, it had already been canceled there. It saved her some trouble. He especially went to the Public Security Bureau to apply for his own household registration. Since An Xiaoning had already informed them, he got it done easily. When he returned, he found that An Xiaoning was waiting for him while drinking her coffee. "I almost forgot something." What? "You still haven't answered my question about why the people from your side are asking for my hair." Speaking of this question, he was a little embarrassed. Chapter 1314 As Long As You "Actually, I don't want to tell you. It's just that after seeing that mural, I had a bold idea in my mind." "What's on your mind?" "I want to have your hair tested to see if you have any blood relation to me." "Haha." An Xiaoning thought about it for a long time, but she never expected that it would be such a reason. "That's why I didn't tell you. I was afraid that you would be offended." "There's nothing to be offended about." As soon as she finished speaking, Xiao Lu's voice came from outside the door, "Young Madam, the people from the East Palace family overseas are here. They are right outside the big door." An Xiaoning had expected their arrival, but she didn't think it would be so soon. "Let them in." "Alright." "Do I need to... avoid it?" he asked. "What do you need to avoid them? Are you afraid of them?" "That's not the case." "Make me another cup of coffee," said An Xiaoning, waving at the servant. "Okay, Young Madam." The people from the East Palace family were the sons of the Old Master, as well as a few grandsons. Without exception, they were men who held important positions within the family. "Please sit." Six or seven people sat down one by one. The first to speak was the eldest son of the Old Master of the East family. "Miss An, the purpose of our visit this time is twofold. First, we'd like to offer our sincere apologies to you, and second, we hope you will release our elder." "I accept your apology, but release the elder? What do you mean? I don't know him at all. Who is he? What does he look like? What is his name?" Wu Lianzhi did not expect her to deny it directly. He seemed to have guessed why she did this, so he did not say anything and just sat there quietly. However, these men from the East Palace family were a little stunned. They did not expect her to deny it directly. "Miss An, let's not beat around the bush. We have learned that our elder is in your possession." "Do you have any proof?" "Well...But we are sure that he is with you," the few of them looked at each other and said. "I'm sorry, but I cannot make any statements without concrete evidence," she asserted firmly. It was out of the question for her to offer them any opening to implicate her. "I will not allow any false accusations." "Miss An, state your conditions. As long as you let him go, we will agree to anything you say," the second son said. "Do you want me to repeat my words again?" "I really didn't take away the so-called elder of your East Palace family," she said calmly. However, they did not believe her words. They knew that she just did not admit it. Seeing that she remained resolute, the few of them did not know how to deal with it. What they didn't know was that An Xiaoning intended to make them come all the way here in vain. She had no intention of letting Wu Haigang live after this. "Miss An." "If you are willing to let our elders go, our East Palace family is willing to serve you. This is what my father said." Wu Lianzhi froze. "Why is your father..." She did not finish her sentence, leaving half a sentence behind. "Our East Palace family has long since lost the art of witchcraft. The elder is the only one who knows about it. If he is not here, then there is no hope of revival." "Revival?" "Do you think I'll let you develop the witchcraft so that you can continue to harm others?" An Xiaoning asked with a smile. "That's not what I meant." "I'm really sorry. I really didn't take your elder away. I don't know who he is either. I'm very sorry. If there's nothing else, please go back. I won't keep you here any longer," said An Xiaoning, not at all moved by his words. She directly asked them to leave. The people of the East Palace family were left with no option but to return. That's it. The matriarch of the East Palace family was helpless and she knelt down. "What are you doing? I really haven't seen an elder of your family. Do you want me to perform a magic trick for you?" "..." In the end, they still left and returned empty-handed. There was no way at all. The living room fell silent. Noticing that Wu Lianzhi was expressionless, An Xiaoning asked, "Do you think I'm heartless too?" "That's not it." "I understand what your considerations are. What you did on your side was right. I have already left the East Palace family, so this is other people's business. I won't express my opinion." "When the curse is lifted, this matter will come to an end completely. To be honest, I am most grateful to you for helping me solve this issue.  If not for you taking the initiative to contact me, I wouldn't have known about your existence. Or rather, even if I knew about your existence, it might take a long time. If not for you, I wouldn't have known about these things in such a short period of time. You know, Xiao Chengyuan had previously tried to find the descendants of the Wu Family but found no trace of them. How could it be so easy to find them after so many years? We originally thought that it was very likely that they were wiped out because of the backlash." "To be able to help you resolve this matter in such a clever way, I am also very happy in my heart. Fate is really too wonderful, allowing us to meet again." When Henry came downstairs, he happened to see An Xiaoning and Wu Lianzhi smiling at each other. He stood at the foot of the stairs and called out to An Xiaoning nonchalantly, "Come up. I have something to tell you," he said. "What is it?" "You will know when you come up." After saying that, she turned around and went upstairs. An Xiaoning really thought that something had happened to him. Only after following him up did she realize that he was completely fine. "Didn't you say there was something? Are you trying to trick me?" "So what if I am fooling you?" "Alright, as long as you're happy. I'm going down now," An Xiaoning said, staring at him speechlessly. "Stop." "What's wrong again?" "When are you going to let that guy leave?" "Stay here for the time being. We'll talk about it later." An Xiaoning thought that she would have to wait until the curse was removed and Wu Lianzhi's household register was approved before she could arrange it for him. "After a while? I'm not happy about having an unfamiliar stranger in the house," Henry said, displeased. "Then Just endure it." "An Xiaoning, this is my territory!" "So, you admit that you're Qingyan?" She walked towards him. "Who said that we are one person? Is it something to argue?" "That's good." She sat down on the bed and placed her hands behind her. "I have a special need now. I hope you can satisfy me." The corners of Henry's mouth twitched. "Here you go again." "What do you mean by saying again? Isn't that normal? Henry, I think it's necessary for us to communicate physically. I hope that you can feel my suggestion with your heart." Chapter 1315 As Long As You "Never mind." "Where are you going?" An Xiaoning asked as she turned around and walked out. "Looking for trouble." By the time An Xiaoning came downstairs, Wu Lianzhi was no longer there. She sat on the sofa and turned on the TV. At this time, the TV was playing an archaeological documentary, featuring an interview with Wang Jinsheng. Watching the TV screen with a relaxed expression, she enjoyed the program before deciding to call Pan Zhenghui. "Director Pan, it's me." "Hi, Xiaoning." "Is Wang Jinsheng still leading the archaeological team?" "Yes, but I was about to contact you to talk about him. Since you said that he was in contact with tomb raiders last time, I secretly investigated him. Now there is a result." "Your work is quite efficient," An Xiaoning said, surprised. "How can I not take what you said to heart?" "That can't be explained in a few words. Xiaoning, why don't you make a trip to the police station?" Pan Zhenghui asked. "Alright, I'll come right away." "Alright." She hung up and turned off the TV. "Here, Xiaoning. I just bought some new tea leaves. Have a taste and have a seat. Let's talk about it," Pan Zhenghui said after sorting through the documents. "What's going on?" An Xiaoning asked, taking a seat across from him. "According to the investigation, he disappointed me a lot. He seems ordinary at first sight, but deep down, he has a lot of hidden secrets. Captain Wang has some brief ties with He Yi, but he has connections with those dealers who sell national relics. We found that he secretly sold the things that should have been handed over to the country and made a large sum of money" "Let's continue investigating then, and handle him justly," An Xiaoning said, not knowing what to say. "Yes, of course." "In addition, He Yi is a veteran in grave robbing. You should also pay attention to him, and monitor his behaviors. If he dares to continue grave robbing in the country, you can do as you see fit." "Alright, I understand." "Haven't you found a replacement for Yuan Mingzhu in the special small group yet?" asked An Xiaoning. "I have been searching, but it is not an easy task. I found one a few days ago, but he's a scammer too. Does he really think of himself as some kind of deity? Xiaoning, just come back. Even if you just spare time to investigate a case, it's fine, alright?" Pan Zhenghui could not help but sigh. There are a few cases that haven't been solved until now. You are no outsiders here. I only want to tell you that if you don't take action, there will be no one who can solve the cases. It's not that the evidence is not sufficient. It's just that our resources are limited and there isn't much we can do. "What does that mean?" "Do you still not understand what I mean?" "The family background of the criminal is too strong, so we can only let it go." Pan Zhenghui suppressed his voice to the minimum. "How about this?" "I'm still the leader of the special team, but I can't come to the police station every day. I have a lot of personal matters to attend to, so I can only take some time out. I might only have a few days in a month, or maybe only a day in a month." said An Xiaoning. Seeing that she had agreed, Pan Zhenghui was so excited that he almost jumped up. It's fine even if it's a month or a day. Xiaoning, our country really needs talented people like you. To level with you, some cases are left unsolved for many years. Other than those with sufficient evidence, most of them were in the past. There were no surveillance cameras or fingerprints, so it was not easy to crack them. Also, just like the one I told you just now, the one who has evidence but can't solve the case. I feel helpless." "Okay. You sort out the information and evidence of this famous pending case for me first and hand it over to the special team. I will go there to take a look." OK. An Xiaoning put down the teacup in her hand and left the director's office. She headed to the special team. The room was quiet, with everyone deep in thought. As she pushed the door open, they noticed her arrival. Zu Dong was the first to notice her and immediately stood up. "Madam An, what brings you here?" "What's with the solemn faces?" She said as she entered. "It's all because of the case. But, Madam, why are you here? Is there something urgent?" "Well, I have something to discuss with the director, but I have news to tell you all." She walked to the table and sat down. "Guess what it is?" They looked at each other, wondering what good news she would tell them. "What good news?" "Guess." "Hmm..." "Don't tell me you want to come back and continue to lead the special team." Ma Jianguo said. "Bingo. Old Ma, how did you become so clever? What have you been eating?" An Xiaoning asked. "I eat everything." Gong Le agreed, "Yes, yes, yes. Old Ma not only eats grass but also sh*t." "You stinking brat, come over here and see if I don't beat you to death!" Ma Jianguo roared. "Old Ma is about to flip out," Gong Le winked at him. "Madam, are you really coming back? You're not lying to us, are you?" Ma Jianguo asked uncertainly. "What's so good about lying to you?" "I just told the director about it, but I can't come here every day. I probably will be here for a few days in a month. But the director said it's fine," An Xiaoning said while holding her chin in her hand. Ma Jianguo tapped his forehead excitedly. "Well, did you see that? Did you all see that? I said that something good was going to happen today. Look, it happens! It doesn't matter if you come for a few days or not. As long as you come, it's great!" "Is that so? Then when the case in your hands is over, we will start a new case. I just came to inform you in advance. Alright, I won't disturb your work. You guys continue, I'm leaving." "The chair you sit in hasn't been warm up yet, and you take your leave. Why in a hurry?" "I don't want to disturb your work. Work hard and we'll meet again another day." She got up and left. On the way back, she parked her car at the entrance of a supermarket because she was thirsty and got off to buy water. Unexpectedly, she bumped into Shi Shaochuan and... Bu Xianxian. She had received news that Shi Shaochuan and Bu Xianxian had long been separated. The world was truly full of surprises. "Bu Xianxian, I wonder how many surprises you still have in store that I am unaware of." An Xiaoning said as she picked up a bottle of mineral water. Chapter 1316 As Long As You "Sorry, what did you say? Why are you so surprised?" Bu Xianxian asked, staring straight at her. "Aren't you two broken up? Why are you together again?" "It is our business. You don't need to worry about it. Don't meddle and go on your way." Bu Xianxian said nervously. "Okay, good luck," An Xiaoning said with a shrug. "Is she annoying now?" Bu Xianxian asked, holding onto Shi Shaochuan's arm as An Xiaoning walked away. "Hasn't she always been annoying?" "Don't bother with her. Have you done shopping?" Shi Shaochuan asked calmly. "Yes, I am almost done." "Then let's head to the cashier and make the payment." When they left the supermarket, he immediately saw An Xiaoning standing in front of the car, drinking water. She turned to look at them. "Shi Shaochuan." "What do you want?" Shi Shaochuan asked, too lazy to respond. "I want to give you a piece of advice. Do you want to hear it?" "Keep your advice to yourself." "Since you said that, I won't say it. But don't you feel very uncomfortable?" An Xiaoning asked, spreading her hands. She circled around the car and was about to get in when Shi Shaochuan called out to her, "Wait a moment." She opened the window and said, "Did you see something unusual?" "An Xiaoning, don't try to play tricks in front of us. We won't fall for your tricks," Bu Xianxian interjected. "Bu Xianxian, you are quite something." An Xiaoning leaned lazily against the back of the chair and stared at the two people outside the car. "If it were any other woman, Shi Shaochuan, I would never have the conscience to say these things to you because, as you said, you're not a good person. But it just so happens to be Bu Xianxian, the woman I hate the most.  Well, after weighing the pros and cons, I really don't want to see Bu Xianxian live so comfortably. Shi Shaochuan, you're carrying someone on your back." "Carrying someone? What?" She grinned at him. "What do you think? Figure it out yourself." Without another word, she closed the window and drove away. "Did she mean you were up to no good?" Shi Shaochuan asked as he stood there, staring at Bu Xianxian. "Shaochuan, please don't believe her nonsense, alright? Of course, it wasn't me. I don't have the ability to do that. Don't wrong me." "It was me who had a grudge against her. Didn't you hear her personally say that she didn't want to see me live a comfortable life? That damned An Xiaoning, she's just spouting nonsense. Don't believe her. Her goal is to make us both unhappy," Bu Xianxian explained anxiously. "Then how did she know that I was not feeling well?" "Your complexion is so bad that even a blind person would be able to tell." "Shaochuan, don't believe her," Bu Xianxian continued. Shi Shaochuan' head started to ache and he did not say anything else. He got into the car and Bu Xianxian sat in the front passenger seat. The car drove in the direction of the Shi family. The two of them did not talk much along the way. Shi Shaochuan reluctantly drove home. When he got home, he immediately fell asleep. Bu Xianxian, who was sitting by the bed, curled her lips into a smile. However, when she thought of An Xiaoning, she could not help but want to smash her to death. However, it was a good thing that Shi Shaochuan did not seem to suspect anything. Along the way, An Xiaoning had been thinking about what she had just seen. Shi Shaochuan was carrying a little ghost on his back. She did not even need to think to know who had done it. She really could not tell that Bu Xianxian had started playing dirty tricks too. However, raising little ghosts to do things for her, if she couldn't serve well, she would suffer a backlash. Was she really clear about the laws here? Such a stupid woman. This was equivalent to handing over her life to the little ghost and letting the other do the work for her. An equivalent exchange. She really didn't know what Bu Xianxian was up to. It was probably that Bu Xiaoxian wanted to take advantage of Shi Shaochuan. No matter what, it had nothing to do with her anyway. Everyone had their own fate In the afternoon, Jin Qingyue, who was pregnant, arrived. It was almost the prenatal period. She had already set up the baby room, but she had not prepared anything for the baby to wear yet. She planned to have An Xiaoning accompany her to choose. Since An Xiaoning had nothing else to do, she agreed. Wu Lianzhi followed suit. He was mainly driving and carrying things. Initially,  An Xiaoning had considered asking Henry, but she thought Henry probably wouldn't want to be the one carrying things. His temper was evident to all, so she didn't ask him.. Little did she know that because she did not ask for his help, he was standing alone by the window and sulking. Jin Qingyue combed her hair a little, let it fall on both sides of her face, partially covering her round face. Because she was pregnant, there were freckles on her face. In addition, for the sake of the baby in her belly, she did not put on makeup. Without the cover of her makeup, her originally beautiful skin began to grow dim. However, that beautiful charm still couldn't be concealed. She slowly went downstairs. She walked very carefully, afraid of falling down. Because her belly was so big now, she could not see the road beneath her feet. An Xiaoning followed behind her and reminded her to be careful, lest anything unexpected happened. Wu Lianzhi drove, and the two of them sat side by side in the back seat. The car stopped steadily in front of the department store. The department store was one of the properties owned by the Jin Corporation. An Xiaoning and Jin Qingyue had only been here a few times. When they got out of the car, they put on their hats and masks. After all, considering that Jin Qingyue had not put on any makeup, if she was photographed by someone, they would cause trouble on the news again. Moreover,. Moreover, Jin Qingyue's shopping purpose was to pay for the items she chose. She didn't want to just put it on the company's account because it was owned by her family. So a simple disguise saved time and effort. The three of them walked through the automatic door of the building, and after looking at the signs, they entered the mother and child specialty section. Because Wu Lianzhi was not wearing a mask, the salesperson could not help but look at him a few more times. "Bring all the best baby boy products and clothes you have here. We will take a look," he said aloud. The salesperson was immediately dumbfounded, "May I ask if it is all?" "All of them, as well as the best. Let us choose." The salesperson hurriedly called for the manager, trembling in fear, and brought over a lot of baby clothes and supplies. "Here they are. Take a look." "Put them here." Wu Lianzhi turned to the two women beside him and said, "You two start picking." Jin Qingyue held up a tiny shirt, her lips curving into a smile.  An Xiaoning was the same. She felt that the motherly love in her heart would overflow whenever she saw these things. "I'm afraid we won't be able to finish this much. Qingyue, we can just pick some comfortable ones. There's no need to take so much.""There's probably too much to wear all of these. Qingyue, let's just pick some comfortable ones; we don't need to take so many," An Xiaoning suggested. Jin Qingyue carefully selected several sets, some smaller and some medium-sized. "Of course, kids grow fast, and they won't be able to wear all of these. It's enough to have a few sets for now. Let's just pick some for the time being." Chapter 1317 As Long As You After a while, Jin Qingyue took out eight sets. An Xiaoning felt that it was not enough, so she picked five more sets. also chose baby products like diapers and bottles, but they decided not to buy formula milk for now and would get it later if needed. After choosing, An Xiaoning said to the salesperson, "Take these away. We only need these items." When the manager heard this, the smile on his face instantly cooled down. He snorted coldly, "Why are you still pretending to be rich when you don't have money? You boldly asked for the most expensive and best items and ended up not buying half of them." "We have already chosen enough sets of clothes. If we need more, we can come back. Besides, we're close to city A. Do you think A City is lacking in goods like this?" An Xiaoning explained. "Manager, we cannot force the customer to buy things that they don't want. Besides, they have already picked enough." the salesperson said. "Did I ask you to teach me? Am I the manager or are you?" "You are, of course." The scared saleswoman was scared. "You see, even the saleswoman understands more than the manager. Maybe you two should switch positions; the manager could become a salesperson, or even resign." Jin Qingyue said. When the manager heard this, he became even more furious. However, no matter what, they are the guests, so he still restrained his temper. "This is our internal matter. Only capable people can be a manager. Those who are incapable can only be a salesperson." "Forget it, I don't want all these. There isn't only one counter here. Sister-in-law, let's go take a look at the other counters," Jin Qingyue said unhappily. Seeing that they did not want any of them, the manager objected, "If you want to go, you should buy all these and then you can leave." "Aren't you forcing us to buy items?" Wu Lianzhi asked coldly. "Since you don't want it, why should you ask us to take out so many items? Are you trying to play with us? I will ask people to package them for you." The manager waved his hand and a few security guards came over. Everyone understood what he meant. However, Jin Qingyue's phone rang at this moment. She was about to take out her phone when the manager thought that she was going to call the police and snatched it from her. "Hurry up and pay up. I'll let you go." "Who gave you the guts to bully a guest? Just put the items back in the bags, and that's it. Give me back my phone." said An Xiaoning, unable to take it anymore. At this point, she was still thinking of playing down the event. It wouldn't be good if she caused any commotion at the Jin Corporation's mall. However, the manager did not understand her intentions and just refused to give her the phone. An Xiaoning had no choice but to take off her hat and mask. Seeing her, the manager and the salesperson were both shocked. She walked in front of the manager, grabbed the phone, and said, "You have some nerve." The manager's face was pale, losing his arrogant face and tone. At this time, he was like a different person, unable to stand up for himself. "Miss An." Miss An, I'm sorry. I was blind and failed to recognize you. I'm really sorry. I apologize to you. "There's no need to apologize. After all, your apology is not sincere. They don't make any difference. Call the head of your department over here." The manager had a bad feeling that this matter was not going to be resolved. He stood there and did not move. "You go and get the head of your department here," An Xiaoning ordered the salesperson. "Yes." A few minutes later, the head of the department jogged over with several people behind him, along with the salesperson who was panting. The person-in-charge had already been briefed by the salesperson on the way. "Young Madam, this is really a rat sh*t that ruined a pot of porridge. Normally, the staff at our store would not dare to treat the guests. It is my fault for not managing them well. Young Madam, don't worry. From now on, I will address the issue promptly and immediately fire this manager." "That's good. I don't want to see something like this happen again, understand?" "Yes, Young Madam. Don't worry. There won't be a second time." "Hurry up and bring over the things that Young Madam has taken a fancy to," the head manager ordered the salesperson. "Qingyue, do you still want these things?" After An Xiaoning called out to her, the head manager finally realized that the woman in front of him was the younger sister of the chairman. He wish he were dead. "Forget it. I've already picked everything. I can't be bothered to look at anything else. I'll pay for it." On the way here, she had already made it clear that she did not want to receive these as gifts, nor did she need An Xiaoning to pay, so An Xiaoning did not stop her from swiping the card. On their way back, just as their car was turning onto the main road, a luxury car sped past them with a man wearing black sunglasses at the wheel, driving recklessly. The three of them were a little stunned by the reckless car. Most importantly, the car was very similar to Jin Qingyan's Mercedes-Benz. Because it was too fast, An Xiaoning could not see it clearly. Wu Lianzhi looked at the car that passed through. He was so shocked that his hand that was holding the steering wheel was shaking. "The person who drives so fast must be insane, and it is like he doesn't value his life. " As he said that, the car continued to move forward, but they noticed that the car in front had stopped. An Xiaonin asked, "Why did they stop?" An Xiaoning narrowed her eyes and looked ahead. When she saw the license plate number at the end of the car, she was a little speechless. "That's your brother's sports car," she said to Jin Qingyue. "Ah? Really?" "Why is my brother driving so fast?" Jin Qingyue asked. "Who knows?" When the car was about to overtake the Mercedes-Benz, the Mercedes-Benz suddenly flew away again. "Lianzhi, follow him." "Alright." Wu Lianzhi narrowed his eyes and stared at the car that was running very fast in front of him. He stepped on the accelerator hard, both fast and steady. Just like that, he followed the car all the way to the entrance of a restaurant. An Xiaoning looked at Henry and Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai who were getting out of the car and instantly understood that Henry did not come out alone. She got out of the car and asked Wu Lianzhi to take Jin Qingyue home. After all, she was pregnant. Then she walked quickly towards the entrance of the restaurant. Henry sat at the dining table by the window, and the two people who followed him did not sit together, but sat at other tables. "What happened to you just now?" "Why are you driving so fast? Are you tired of living?" An Xiaoning asked, sitting across from Henry. "Why didn't the ones who came with you come inside?" Henry rolled his eyes at her. "They went back." He certainly noticed that, but he deliberately asked her about it. Chapter 1318 As Long As You "Then why didn't you go back with them?" "I saw you come in. Do you have a hard time eating at home that you have to dine out?" An Xiaoning asked. "Can't I occasionally come out to dine?" "Of course. But it's only ten o'clock and you're already hungry?" "Do I have to feel hungry at a specific time?" "What do you want to eat? Order your food," An Xiaoning asked, feeling that he was deliberately provoking her. "The person I asked to meet hasn't arrived yet. Let's wait." "You have an appointment?" "Who is it?" An Xiaoning asked. "Does it have anything to do with you?" "..." An Xiaoning could feel the anger coming out of him. How did she provoke him? What a psycho! And then there was silence. An Xiaoning crossed her arms and stared at him. He felt uncomfortable being looked at by her and shifted his gaze to the window. About ten minutes later, Li Baozhen arrived. "Hello, Ms. Li.  Please take a seat," said An Xiaoning when she saw that it was her. Li Baozhen did not expect An Xiaoning to be here as well. She smiled and said, "Thank you. I was really surprised to receive a call from Brother Qingyan to invite me for a meal today. I'm also on leave today," she said. "So that's how it is. Your Brother Qingyan said that he hasn't had the time to see you during this period of time, so he wanted to ask you out for a meal and ask about your situation. After all, you helped him a lot, and he owed you a favor." Li Baozhen smiled. "I'm fine. I go to work in the company every day, have meals, and stay in my accommodation afterward. Occasionally, I take a stroll outside." Henry handed the menu to her, "Order whatever you want." "Alright." Li Baozhen took the menu and ordered a few dishes. Then, she passed the menu to An Xiaoning and asked her to order as well. An Xiaoning was not hungry, so she did not order anything. The atmosphere was a little awkward, probably because they could not find any common topics. An Xiaoning suddenly said to Henry, "I want a second child!" The four people who heard this instantly turned their attention to her. Xiao Bai and Xiao Huang snickered, and Li Baozhen was even more embarrassed. Henry didn't know how to respond. If she was the only one present, he would probably give her a direct answer, "Go get the baby yourself." But now, there were people around. He said reluctantly, "It just so happens that I also have this idea. We have to discuss this matter properly when we get back." Inadvertently, the three single persons were exposed to romantic moments. An Xiaoning actually understood very well that he did not remember her past at all. He did not have any memories of her as Jin Qingyan, nor had he experienced her past. Naturally, he did not know that it was difficult for her to get pregnant. Under the table, she gently extended her foot and hooked it around his foot so casually. Henry's body stiffened, and his dark eyes met hers. He knew the foot under the table belonged to her because Li Baozhen was sitting next to him. When the dishes were served, An Xiaoning only took a few bites. As she wiped her mouth with a tissue, it fell to the ground. Then, she bent down to pick it up and took this opportunity to reach out and touch Henry's leg. Heiny was flustered and exasperated. She was actually secretly teasing him in front of so many people. When she picked up the tissue with a calm expression, she quickly winked at him. And he still had to sit upright, as if he was not affected at all. This meal was not very good, at least it didn't put them in a good mood. So much so that when he finished eating, he said to her, "You and Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai get to the car first. I have something to say to Baozhen alone." "Alright," An Xiaoning agreed readily, giving him enough respect. The three quickly went out. He watched the three of them get into the car together, then turned to Li Baozhen and said, "You work well in the company. When you have time, go home and visit your parents more often. If you need any help in the company, look for Xiaoning or Captain Fan. Do you understand?" "Brother Qingyan, you told me about this when I started the job. Now that you've told me again, are you going on a business trip again?" Henry said to her, "Yes, I often go on business trips, and I don't often stay in City A." "Brother Qingyan." Li Baozhen looked at him. "Why do I feel like you are going to a faraway place and never come back?" "Let's go out. Xiaoning and the rest are waiting for us. I'll send you back to the company," he said. OK. After sending Li Baozhen back to the company, the car returned to Winnie residence. When they reached the garage, the car remained silent. Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai got off the car first, and the two of them followed closely behind. The couple only spoke when they returned to the second floor. "When I was back in the car, what did you say to her?" An Xiaoning asked. "I said something teasing." "..." "Yes?" An Xiaoning said, feeling that he was rather obedient, deviating from the usual behavior. "Nothing." He lifted the quilt and lay down. He closed his eyes, looking like he did not want to talk to her. An Xiaoning leaned over and flung her shoes away. She half-knelt on the bed and looked at him. "'Henry, you promised to have a second child with me when we were eating at the table." "Can't you tell that I don't want to embarrass you?" "You have changed." "You're no longer the Henry who hates me. If you were the same as before, would you care whether I would lose face?" An Xiaoning asked, staring at him. "An Xiaoning, I want you to promise me something," he said, narrowing his eyes at her. "So you want to have a second child with me after I agreed?" "..." "Alright, what do you want to say first?" "In the future, when I'm not around, I want him to meet Baozhen and occasionally visit her parents, maybe even once a year. "What if he doesn't go?" An Xiaoning asked. "No, he will go. He will listen to you." An Xiaoning was about to go crazy. Looking at his charming eyes, she really wanted to devour him alive. "I know that you don't want to be intimate with me at all, but I feel very strange at this time that I really want to touch you. If you let me kiss you, I promise you..." '"..." "Forget about it if you don't wan to ." Just as she was about to leap over his body into the bed, he said, "Just give me a kiss." So, she directly rode on him and lowered her head to kiss him. It was already too late when Henry wanted to go back on his word as she kissed him so hard that he couldn't resist. Her kiss had caused him to feel sexually excited. When she finally let go of him, Henry felt that he was completely under her spell. Chapter 1319 As Long As You "My dear..," An Xiaoning said sweetly as she looked at him in satisfaction. Heiny's heart throbbed, leaving him speechless. "Today, I went to buy baby products with Lianzhi and Qingyue. When I saw those baby products, I really wanted to have another child. That way, we'll have three children at home. How nice would that be?" An Xiaoning said, hugging his neck. His lips moved, wanting to say something, but he couldn't. For a long time, she did not hear his voice. She thought that he was asleep. She looked up and found that he had his eyes open, lost in thought. "Why do I feel like you have something on your mind?" "Nothing." "'Henry, let's go to sleep." "Alright, let's sleep." She repeated it again and emphasized the word "sleep", "OK?" "OK." This time, it was An Xiaoning who was dumbfounded. She sat up and looked at him carefully. "Qingyan?" she asked. "I am Henry." "!" "What's wrong with you? Tell me if there's anything you're unhappy about. Don't keep it to yourself," said An Xiaoning as she leaned forward. "An Xiaoning." "Yes?" "If I never disappear, will you hate me?" "I don't want to answer," she refused. He nodded and seemed to understand something. "Ah! What are you doing?" "'Henry, you're crazy. What's wrong with you?" "Let go of me! I told you to let go! Psycho! Let go!" "..." The sound insulation effect of the room was so good that all the movements in the room could not be heard from the outside. In the afternoon. Aunt Chen knocked on the door again, "Young Madam, Young Master, get up and eat. It's already three o'clock." "Got it, Auntie Chen. I'll go down now," An Xiaoning said softly. Hearing what she said, Auntie Chen went downstairs to prepare. An Xiaoning opened her eyes slightly and stared blankly for a while before turning her gaze to the man beside her. She had never thought that he would be so proactive, especially in such a wild manner. Usually, he didn't want her to touch him at all. Just like the old saying goes," The more unexpected it was, the more unexpected it was." An Xiaoning sat up, only to find a piece of paper on the bedside table. There was a pen next to the note. She saw some words written on it, so she picked it up. There were a few words on it. [I lost the bet between us. I kept my word and disappeared on my own accord. Today is the happiest day of my life. It was given to me by the person I hated the most. Thank you. ] - Henry Upon seeing this, An Xiaoning's hand trembled slightly. Today, he surprised her alot. She had no idea when she had made him fall in love with her. Originally, his disappeance was supposed to be the best thing for her. However, this silent farewell made her feel a little uncomfortable. She sat there in a daze for a while before letting her body lie down again. She hugged the man beside her. "Xiaoning." The man who was being held by her automatically hugged her back and called out softly, "Xiaoning." "Yes." He opened his eyes and looked at her, who was just inches away from him, and then looked at himself. Soon, he realized what had happened. They were naked. Jin Qingyan recalled scenes of intimacy. Soon after, many memories gradually flooded in, making him sit up. "Qingyan, what's wrong?" "Xiaoning," said Jin Qingyan, hugging her tightly. "Yes, what's wrong?" "Why do I suddenly have Henry's memories?" An Xiaoning finally understood what had happened. If their memories originally were separated and blocked, now it was just merged, and the price was that Henry disappeared. "He kept his promise with me and disappeared on his own. In fact, he represents the dark side of your inner self. You are still you. You are one person in the first place, but you have already made a precedent. The double personality is still diagnosed as incurable in the medical field, but you have recovered, haven't you? Unbelievable." "He fell in love with you?" "It's much earlier than I thought. . I thought it would take many more times of you spending time together alone," said Jin Qingyan, still in disbelief. "I also felt that it was a bit sudden." Upon careful consideration, I guess   he probably realized that he was no longer disgusted with me but attracted to me. His behabior today was very unusual. He suddenly became crazy and pressed me on the bed. Hmph. " "So.." Jin Qingyan raised his eyebrows and said meaningfully. "I'm going to get up. It's already three in the afternoon. I have to eat. Since his memories are all in harmony with you, I won't talk to you alone about some things, especially about Li Baozhen. Henry said that we had to visit her parents at least once a year and treat her better. I support that. Li actually saved you. She has done us a favor, so we have to repay him. What do you think?" "Of course, but Iet me say it again." "Say what again?" "Say Oppa, saranghae" "..." An Xiaoning complied with him and called out, "Oppa, saranghae. Big brother, I love you." He was so happy that he drew her into his arms. It was Jin Qingyan's birthday on the 16th of October of the lunar calendar. For him, the best birthday present was the removal of the curse. They were not worried at all that Wu Haigang would deceive them. After all, he knew very well that he would die in their hands, and his descendants, on the other hand, still had to live. At this time, he had no other choices. He undid their curse on the 16th Heaven, but with the release of the curse, he would eventually die as well. The Wu family's witchcraft spell was completely cut off. As for the East Palace family in R Nation, An Xiaoning thought that the consequences of their attempt to execute her would be to have Wu Haigang die in her hands. Everything else was no longer important. After the curse was lifted, Wu Haigang was also secretly executed. The burden in An Xiaoning's heart was finally lifted. This was the most relaxed and content period she had experienced. Wu Lianzhi's household registration application had already been approved. "Since you already have the permanent residence rights here, I have also arranged a job for you as the university's counselor. Although the school prohibits teachers from dating, I think this is the place with the most female students. If you find a mutually affectionate partner here, you can do other jobs or hide the relationships from others. What do you think?" Chapter 1320 As Long As You "That's exactly what I want, but I have one concern." What? "The East Palace family will continue to seek revenge on me." "Do you think they still dare to do this?" "How about this? I'll send them a statement later and tell them that you're my good friend. If they dare to cause you any trouble again, I'll definitely hold them accountable. How does that sound?" An Xiaoning continued. "Xiaoning, you are so considerate. Thank you so much." "Isn't that what I should do? Thanks to you, the curse has been lifted. So I will make sure to protect you.You can lead a stable life now and find the girl you like," An Xiaoning said with a smile. "Okay, I will do my best." . All day, the servants in the manor were preparing for the birthday banquet. Although Jin Qingyan had already received the best birthday present, it did not mean that there was no other celebration. At night, his closest friends were invited to attend a small banquet together. They would celebrate for him together. Shortaly after five in the afternoon, An Xiaoning had just come out of her shower when he caught her and carried her onto the bed. "Sing a birthday song for me first," he said domineeringly. "When the banquet begins, I will sing a good song for you." "I want to hear you sing it first." "Fine, fine. It's your birthday today. As you wish. I'll start singing a song for you now," said An Xiaoning, rolling her eyes. He even applauded, which made An Xiaoning want to laugh. "Happy Birthday to you... Happy Birthday to you..." "It sounds so good." Just as he finished praising her, he pressed her down. He turned over and kissed her while tickling her. The two of them rolled around on the bed. At this moment, An Xiaoning could not stop laughing. If it weren't for the door being knocked, she could've kept laughing for another three minutes. Fan Shixin was the one who delivered the attire for the birthday party. The clothes and shoes specially made for her. An Xiaoning opened it and took a look. She was especially fond of this set of clothes. It was a white evening gown paired with high heels of the same color. This pair of high heels was specially made for An Xiaoning, who did not like to wear high heels. It was high heels, but it was very stable when walking. They perfectly showcased her beautiful feet. After the two of them dressed up, when they went downstairs, there was already a small wave of people coming. Ling Ciye and Jin Qingyue leaned against the sofa. Long Tianze was originally sitting on the other side of Ling Ciye. However, he felt uncomfortable sitting on the sofa and lay down directly on Ling Ciyue's legs. If it weren't for their friendship, Ling Ciyue would've kicked him away already. "Well, well, well!" "Look at how beautiful Sister-in-law is. She's so pretty," Long Tianze exclaimed. "That's right. Sister-in-law, you look stunning in this gown." "Very beautiful," Jin Qingyue concurred. "Money well spent." "Why hasn't Yangyang arrived yet?" An Xiaoning asked with a smile. "She went to pick up the kids. How can she not bring them to such a celebration?" By the time the kids arrived, most of the other guests had gathered. There were no outsiders here, and it was a small-scale celebration. At around six o'clock, the birthday party officially began. Fan Shixin took charge of the opening speech and instructed Jin Qingyan to make a wish to cut the cake. Jin Qingyan walked up to the cake and the birthday song played as he closed his eyes and made a wish before blowing out the candles. The applause thundered. "I just made a wish. Do you want to know what it is?" Jin Qingyan asked. Everyone looked at him in unison. They held breath and focused, wanting to know what his wish was. "My wish." "I can remarry Xiaoning as soon as possible," he said, looking at An Xiaoning below the stage with a gentle gaze. "Alright!" Long Tianze took the lead and clapped excitedly. Others followed, shouting and clapping. Only An Xiaoning stood there and looked at Jin Qingyan quietly with a faint smile on her face. When he was cutting the cake, An Xiaoning cut it with him. Everyone started eating, drinking, and having fun after eating the cake. They danced happily together. The children were even more amused. They secretly gathered in a room and brought wine. As a result, they ended up drinking too much and fell asleep in various positions. An Xiaoning had never expected that Wang Jinsheng would actually come knocking on her door. She met him. But she did not want to see him at all. "Miss An." "If you came this time to ask me to speak up for you, then there's no need to say it." Wang Jinsheng didn't expect her to already know, "Miss An, when did you... find out?" "Although the morning news has already been reported, I already know about it before this." "Didn't you say that I was the one who blew up the lake? Don't tell me that you have a rather frequent relationship with the grave robbers? As an archeologist, you have so many connections with the grave robbers. I really wonder what you're thinking?" An Xiaoning asked with a smile. Moreover, you actually did those illegal things. How dare you come here ? Presumably, the police have already on their way to arrest you? "Ms. An, please help me this time. I promise I won't do it again." "Captain Wang, can't you hear me clearly?" "You'll bear the consequences of your mistakes," said An Xiaoning as she stood up. "Young Madam, the Criminal Police Brigade is here. They said they are here to bring Captain Wang." "Okay, isn't he here?" Fan Shixin made an inviting gesture to the police officers outside the door. "Shixin, I really don't know what Captain Wang is thinking," An Xiaoning asked after a sigh of relief. "I don't know what he is thinking either. He probably doesn't know that you already knew about this, so he came to try his luck." "Possible. He's really hurting himself by bringing this upon himself. What can you do?" ...... After lunch, An Xiaoning received a call from Pan Zhenghui, asking her to come to the police station. An Xiaoning went, and Pan Zhenghui asked her to discuss two main matters. The first was the matter of Wang Xi and He Yi, and the second was the case that would be handed over to her. First, regarding Wang Jinsheng's matter, Pan Zhenghui shook his head repeatedly and said, "What a pity. You see, he's been in the archaeology team for so many years and even became the captain. How could he make such a mistake? He can't be a captain anymore. He's lost his job, not to mention facing imprisonment. Speaking of He Yi, you asked me to monitor him before. He's no good at all. The Y country's police are currently pursuing him, and they asked our police for assistance." Chapter 1321 As Long As You "Did you catch him?" An Xiaoning asked. "You have already told me to keep an eye on him. I sent people to monitor him and it was easy to capture him. He has been taken away by the overseas police. His case is even more severe than Wang Jinsheng's. "How many years he might get sentenced to?" "I can give you a rough estimate of more than ten years. He's busted. He's in big trouble now." After hearing what he said, An Xiaoning did not say anything further After all, everyone had their own lives and should be responsible for themselves. "Tell me about the cases." "Alright." "There are two famous pending cases here. Take a look at which one you want to solve first. They are all cases that have not been solved for many years. However, although there is sufficient evidence, the case still cannot be solved. you can take them back and study them with a few members of the special team." "Okay, I got it," An Xiaoning answered. She opened the file box as she went out. The case files on the inside had already turned yellow. It could be seen that many years had passed since the cases occurred. Pushing open the door to the office, An Xiaoning walked in. The people in the office all looked at her. Ma Jianguo rubbed his hands and chuckled. "Xiaoning, you're finally here. We've been waiting for you. The case on our hands has already ended. The Bureau Chief said that he wants us to start working on a major case with you." An Xiaoning addressed her team with seriousness, "I currently have two famous unsolved cases in my hands. One dates back twenty-two years, and the other occurred fourteen years ago. Considering the time frame, the culprits might not be masterminds with exceptional anti-investigation abilities. Back then, there were no surveillance cameras or fingerprint analysis, making it challenging to crack these cases. Please take a quick look at these files first, and then we'll discuss further." She handed the files to each of them and asked them to read them. After more than ten minutes, everyone roughly looked at the key points and passed the files back to her. "We've all read it. Which case do you think we should start with first?" Ma Jianguo suggested, "I suggest that we start with the case in Widow Village. This case is the oldest, and although there are many discussions online, it is far from the other case with conclusive evidence. I feel that this case with no evidence is very difficult, so we should start with the difficult one first." "I agree with what Old Ma said. Madam, I've actually been reading online discussions about the case in Widow Village. However, I feel that the culprit is still alive and well. It can be said that this is the place where the deceased can't die in peace. It is not easy to crack this case. So, we should start with this one." Gong Le echoed. "Let's start with this then. However, do you think the second case with conclusive evidence will be easily solved? If it's really that easy to solve, why would the investigation be terminated and the case left unsloved?" An Xiaoning agreed with a nod. "Isn't it because the culprit has a powerful family background? Someone is obstructing the investigation. Of course, compared to your status, that person's status is not much. There's always someone higher than you. I doubt that person knows you'll personally handle this case. I wonder if she'll be terrified when she finds out."," Ma Jianguo said softly. "All of you, do not disclose to anyone. We haven't started the second case yet. Otherwise, bear the consequences yourself." "Well, Xiaoning, rest assured. What do we do? We're police officers, okay? You have to trust your subordinates, okay?" I'll bring the second case file back home and discuss it with you guys when it begins. Right now, focus on  on the first case. I want all of you to conduct a discreet investigation and dig deeper. This case has probably become a taboo topic in the village. In addition, I want to make it clear that before this case occurs, the proportion of men and women in the village is normal, right?" "That's right. After this case, the men in the village died one after another. Many men didn't dare to stay at home. Quite a few moved away. Now, those who still lived in the village were elders, middle-aged widows, and children with no economic ability. Most of the elders were widows. At that time, everyone suspected that it was because of the water source. Moreover, all the men and women in the village drank, so why did only men die one after another? It didn't take long for the village to change its name to Widow Village." Ma Jianguo recalled, "Twenty years ago, there were rumors that the deceased, whose case we are investigating, sought revenge on that village. So, now, the victims are essentially connected to this incident." "It appears that in order to truly grasp the situation in Widow Village, I must personally investigate it. Anyway, I originally planned to do this." "Madam, do we go with you or do you have other plans?" Zu Dong asked. "With so many people going together, it will definitely arouse suspicion. I will assign you other missions." "Zu Dong is with me. Gong Le and Ding Liang, the two of you should go to Widow Village for a field visit right away. Don't arouse the suspicion of the surrounding villagers. As for Ma Jianguo, he is the oldest, so stay at the station and wait for orders." "Xiaoning, you're discriminating against me for being old." "I don't want to stay in the police station. I'll go with them. I'm an experienced police officer. I know more than them," Ma Jianguo protested strongly. "Alright, that's it. I'll take the case file back and take a closer look. The three of you go to the inspection first. Zu Dong and I will go back to Winnie residence first." "Alright." An Xiaoning drove Zu Dong homeward and found that Jin Qingyan was still at home, so he did not go to the office. "Why haven't you gone to work?" "Just a minute." "Did you really take the case?" asked Jin Qingyan when he saw Zu Dong walking in with her. "Yes, I took the case. I would go to Widow Village with Zu Dong this afternoon and won't be back for a while." Jin Qingyan hated hearing such things the most. If she did not come back, it meant that he was going to sleep alone at night and would not see her in the short term. "Then do you plan to live there?" "Yes, of course." "Zu Dong and I will pretend to be couples to rent a house," An Xiaoning added after some thought. Anyway, it was better to tell him as soon as possible so that he would not be jealous again one day. "Let Shixin go with you," Jin Qingyan objected. Chapter 1322 As Long As You "Why? Shixin is your assistant. I'm going to solve the case. Isn't it more appropriate for me to work with the police officers in our group?" "Didn't I pretend to be a a couple with Shixin when I went to the V country? Don't be too possessive," said An Xiaoning, who had noticed something. "I'm not being possessive. I don't feel at ease with you going alone. So, I feel more at ease with Shixin accompanying you." "..." It was obvious that he was unwilling to let other people pretend to be a couple with her, so that was the reason. "Have you ever thought about how his girlfriend feels when you order Shixin around like this?" An Xiaoning gestured for Zu Dong to wait outside. Zu Dong was a little embarrassed and immediately went out. "Either you don't go, or you take him there. You choose for yourself." "Jin Qingyan." "I didn't hear you." "Brother." "Calling me 'grandpa' won't work either." "You're already thirty-four years old, not three or four years old. I'm going to do serious work with the police, not anything else. Do you really have to do that?" An Xiaoning asked as she approached him and sat down beside him. "I just want my people to go with you. If I can go with you, I will go on my own. But I have to take care of the company, so I let Shixin go with you. I can rest assured that he will pretend to be a couple with you.  You've pretended to be a couple before, so you have experience."..." "Did you hear what I said?" "Alright, let Shixin come along. I think you can rest assured about your people." "Are you satisfied now?" An Xiaoning asked, glaring at him. "Yes, I'm satisfied." He dialed Fan Shixin's number, and then hung up quickly. Soon, Fan Shixin arrived. "Young Master." "Go to the countryside with your young mistress." Fan Shixin was dumbfounded. Usually, when they went on trips, Jin Qingyan would accompany An Xiaoning. However, this time, it was different. "Young Master, I don't get what you said." "Well, since you have been working hard in the company recently, I specially rewarded you with a trip." "Even though Young Master says so, I still feel that there is a trap." "Don't listen to your young master's nonsense. Where are you going to travel? There's nothing much to do. It's just that I have to go to the countryside to investigate a case. I was originally going to pretend to be a couple with my male police officer." Before she finished speaking, her mouth was forcefully covered by him. "The police officer at the door, right? My Young Master didn't want you guys to pretend to be a couple, so he sent me here. To be precise, my Young Master doesn't like you pretending to a couple with someone he doesn't trust. Even if he knows that it's fake, even if he knows that nothing will happen, he's just possessive and unwilling," Fan Shixin added. "Yes, you are right!" "Did you hear that? Shixin's words are so accurate. Jin Qingyan, you're really pathetic," An Xiaoning said as she pushed Jin Qingyan's hand away. "I don't mind it. I like to do this. If you are not willing, don't go." "Alright, alright, I'll do as you say. I'll go with Shixin," said An Xiaoning, poking his forehead with her index finger. Because she had changed her mind at the last minute, Zu Dong could only go and meet up with Ma Jianguo and the others. Meanwhile, she and Fan Shixin packed up their luggage and placed them in the car. The car set off from the city at 1:30 p.m. and arrived at 5:30 in the afternoon. The journey took a full of four hours. When they arrived at the town near the Widow Village, the sky was gloomy, and looked like it was about to rain. An Xiaoning instructed Fan Shixin to park the car in a parking lot before putting on a mask. They took a tricycle to the destination, carring their luggage. The tricycle driver was a man. He was very surprised when he heard that the two of them were going there. "Did you two go back to see your parents?" he asked. "No, we are visiting relatives." "Then don't stay there for too long. This village is very strange. The only people left in the village are women. It is very difficult to see men, so usually no men go there. You and your man should not stay there for too long. Hurry up and come back. It is going to be dark soon." "Brother, is it really that scary? I'm a little scared," An Xiaoning suddenly asked. "It's really that strange. In the past, the men in their village had all died in a short period of time. Everyone here knows about this. I heard that you guys have never been here before, right?" "Yes, this is my first time here." An Xiaoning replied. "Trust me, I am saying the truth." "Okay, thank you, big brother." After seven or eight minutes, the tricycle arrived at the entrance of Widow Village. The tricycle stopped here. The driver was afraid of bad luck and did not go forward. "Here is the entrance." An Xiaoning paid the fare and walked over with Fan Shixin. "Shixin, do you still remember to go to the V country with Xiao Bai? At that time, we pretended to be husband and wife, and now it's still the same. My name is Mu Ning." "Okay, I understand. Don't worry, my acting skills are also very good." "Yes, I agree. Your Young Master worries too much," An Xiaoning said with a smile. "It is because he cares too much about you." "There's someone at the village entrance. Let's go up and ask." "Hello, may I ask if there are any rental houses in the village? We're doing some small business in town, but the houses in town are too expensive. It's very close to the town, so we wanted to rent a house nearby. We asked the other villages nearby, but they didn't find any." "Yes, yes." A middle-aged woman stood up enthusiastically. "Two of my rooms are empty. However..." "If you don't mind the bad reputation of our village, we can rent it to you," she said hesitantly. "It doesn't matter. My husband plans to sleep in the shop. He doesn't stay here much. He'll mainly come here to cook, and I'll be living here When the middle-aged woman heard what she said, she immediately said, "That's great. I'll just rent it to you guys." "Alright, Big Sister, take us to see the house. If there are no problems, we'll stay here," An Xiaoning said smilingly. "Alright, sister. Come with me." The two followed the middle-aged woman into the village. Standing in front of an iron door, she took out keys and opened the door. "My surname is Wang. The children went to school and worked outside the country. They haven't come back for several years. I am the only one left in the house. I am alone at home. I don't even have anyone to talk to at home. The lower house was originally where my daughter lived. It was quite clean, but she only came back during the winter vacation every year. It was empty." "Big Sister Wang, are there many villagers?"
