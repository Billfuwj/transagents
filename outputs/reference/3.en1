Chapter 189 Things Between the Governor and the Empress Dowager (64) Xiao Mo had a moment when her heart and mind were both stirred, and she became deeply sorrowful. The Governor is... afraid to move, isn't he? Once his body moved, his mind would start to move as well. For someone as smart as he was, how could he not know that Bai Weiwei was dead?! He didn't want to admit it or dare to think too deeply about it. He could only force himself to sit like this and convince himself that Bai Weiwei was only asleep. She would eventually wake up. Xiao Mo had a feeling that only when Bai Weiwei's body began to rot would the Governor truly regain his senses and know that the person he held his hand had already been dead for a long time. But strangely, Bai Weiwei's body didn't change at all. Even her pale complexion was looking much better now. Despite her icy body, it looked as though she was only in deep slumber. She had none of the characteristics of a corpse at all. Mu Yanjun kept vigil over her, his eyes becoming brighter and brighter. The old doctor was finally detained. As he ate the Heart Protecting Pill, he said, "I reckon I've lost half of my life." Mu Yanjun hadn't slept for five days, and anyone could see how exhausted he was. But he remained exceptionally awake, terrifyingly and abnormally so. "After I let her take the medicine, she fell asleep like this. I thought I should have you come and see when she will wake up." The old man sighed and walked to the bedside to take Bai Weiwei's pulse. "Actually, this phenomenon is extremely rare. There is no need for treatment, but there is still a very important thing to do..." Mu Yanjun listened attentively, like a good student, his eyes burning ablaze. The old man lowered his voice. "It's time for me to treat another person..." Mu Yanjun leaned forward, unwilling to miss anything the old man said. Lo and behold, the old man stuck a needle in his neck at breakneck speed. Mu Yanjun's eyes suddenly widened, and he reflexively slapped the top of the old man's head. Xiao Mo reached her hand out and caught Mu Yanjun's attack. Very quickly, Mu Yanjun could no longer hold on and passed out. The old man touched his head, "Man, I nearly died, but I guess I won't live for long either. It's good enough if he doesn't go crazy after waking up." Bai Weiwei couldn't be saved. And Mu Yanjun's condition was simply heartbreaking; all his organs were failing. He was just like a living corpse—not eating, not sleeping, not thinking, not moving. If he kept this up for two more days, he would probably go with Bai Weiwei. Xiao Mo looked at the old man, "You are responsible for protecting my lord. If you fail again this time, I'll kill you with my own hands." After that, she turned and went to face her punishment silently. The old man sighed, "No wonder my master said he would rather sell sweet potatoes than become a miracle doctor. Everyone treats me like a god, but even a god can't save someone who wants to die." Mu Yanjun only slept for four hours before his eyes opened. He was startled, and a rare panic appeared in his eyes, but he found that he could not move. Seeing that he had awoken, the old man said, "I'm giving you a needle. Your mind is weak, but I'll treat you. Actually, you should go see the King of Hell." Mu Yanjun's eyes darkened. His face was pale and haggard but full of animosity, making people shudder. The old man gave him another needle. "I didn't want to save you. After all, you're extremely vicious. If I save you, the world will be in chaos." Mu Yanjun's voice was soft and strange. "Let go of me." The old man shook his head. "This won't do. I can't save your beloved, but I can make it up by saving you." Mu Yanjun suddenly laughed bitterly, "You can't make it up. How can you possibly? You can't even make up a strand of her hair even if you save everyone in the world." Chapter 190 Things Between the Governor and the Empress Dowager (End) The old man said, "Looks like you're still sane and know she's dead." Mu Yanjun trembled violently, and the needles in his vital points could no longer restrain him. The old man looked and had no choice but to insert a few more needles. "Her condition is rather special. You can't make it in time, and the medicine can't take effect before she dies. So the medicine preserved her physical body entirely, allowing her corpse to remain uncorrupted for years. Unless you burn her, she will stay in perpetual slumber, indistinguishable from an ordinary person apart from being icy." At that, the old man sighed. "So the little Emperor immediately had someone take her body away and burn it." Instantly, Mu Yanjun knew what the little Emperor had in mind. "Good, very good." He sneered, "Anyone who takes her away will face death!" With that, the needles all over his body burst out, and blood gushed from the wounds. When the old man saw this, he knew there was no turning back anymore. Since ancient times, of all the things that hurt people, love was the most penetrating. Mu Yanjun freed himself from the shackles of the doctor's needles and rushed out. The old man thought he was done for, but Mu Yanjun disappeared from the spot without even having the chance to kill him. The old man took out the Heart Protecting Pill and ate with trembling hands. "I won't live much longer either. Mu Yanjun is indeed extremely ruthless. He probably intends to torment me slowly if he doesn't kill me in one go." A massive pile of wood had been set up in front of the palace. Bai Weiwei lay amid the firewood, quiet and soft as if in deep slumber. Xiao Pang, with red eyes, was seething with so much hatred that he bit his lip until it bled. He cried hoarsely and said, "Send my mother on her way." Everyone in the palace, except for Mu Yanjun, had tacitly sent Bai Weiwei on her way. Mu Yanjun's people feared their master had become madly infatuated and, therefore, approved of using the little emperor's hands to burn Bai Weiwei. The fire ignited immediately. Xiao Pang couldn't stand it any longer and fell to his knees, crying. But before the fire could reach Bai Weiwei's body, a figure plunged into it without regard for its own life and carried Bai Weiwei's body out of the fire. Xiao Pang saw the person clearly and shouted with boundless resentment, "Mu Yanjun, you b*stard! You killed my mother, and now you even want to defile her body! You're a monster!" Mu Yanjun held Bai Weiwei in his arms, the flames had burned his hair and clothes, but Bai Weiwei remained unscathed. He did not answer, but said plainly, "Seems like everyone dares to step on my head. it is time to clear the palace." From that moment, Mu Yanjun reverted to his sinister and cruel self, the great governor who held all power in his hands. The Emperor was under house arrest. People in the palace were killed, and the place was 'cleansed.' Especially those who had consented to burning Bai Weiwei's body. Regardless of whether they were Mu Yanjun's confidants, they were killed without exception. Mu Yanjun refused to change anymore; he treated the emperor as a puppet and the world as a slaughterhouse. Killing became his only hobby. Mu Yanjun gazed lazily at the bloody scene outside the door. He gently caressed Bai Weiwei, who was resting in his arms, and said, "Weiwei, look, I killed someone again today. If you beg me, I might spare some lives." Bai Weiwei was extremely quiet. Mu Yanjun chuckled, "Since you won't speak, I shall continue to kill." He once said that if she dared to die, he would drag everyone in this world down to hell to accompany her. Holding her icy cold body, Mu Yanjun tempted her, "I'm truly a terrible person. If you'd teach me, maybe I could change for the better." As he spoke, Mu Yanjun suddenly couldn't take it anymore and rested his head on her cold neck, silently shedding tears. "Why won't you give me a chance to change?" Chapter 191 Reality (1) When Ye Yuxuan struggled to get up from the bed, his whole body was drenched in sweat. He was trembling all over, and his face was deathly pale. Suddenly, he couldn't take it anymore and hugged himself. He gritted his teeth seemingly trying to call out someone's name. He murmured silently many times. And yet he couldn't utter the name of the woman from his dream. His heart was pounding rapidly, and whenever he closed his eyes, he could see the sea of flames spreading from his dream, ready to devour him at any time. He looked down at his hands which were seemingly still holding her. The mix of joy, sorrow, and anger slowly faded away, but the deep love from the man named Mu Yanjun seemed to have infected him. Ye Yuxuan knew that something had been off with him recently. And this strangeness had caused fluctuations in his emotions. For example, now, he actually felt... sad? Was it sadness? He felt as though someone had pierced his chest, and he had undergone every medical examination possible, but there was nothing physically wrong with him. Ye Yuxuan pondered for a while, feeling somewhat lost, before finally getting out of bed. Just as he got out of bed, a servant came over and whispered, "Doctor Qin is here." Ye Yuxuan nodded lightly and asked the servant to pour him a glass of water before heading downstairs with the water in hand. Lo and behold, the front door of his house was open, and Qin Qiu was directing a group of medical staff to bring medical equipment inside. Ye Yuxuan watched quietly, looking unfazed. Qin Qiu looked up and saw Ye Yuxuan. He was already used to his lifeless expression and quickly approached, saying, "My room here is still available, right?" Ye Yuxuan nodded, "Do you not remember your guest room is reserved for a lifetime?" His house had plenty of rooms, and because Qin Qiu often visited, he had a room specifically reserved for the doctor. Qin Qiu, "Of course I do, and I will be using it for the time being." Ye Yuxuan said nothing. As expected, Qin Qiu continued without needing him to ask, "You're wrong if you think I'm going to stay here permanently. I have so many things to deal with in the hospital that there is no way I can stay here long term." Ye Yuxuan couldn't even be bothered to respond with a hum. Qin Qiu continued spontaneously, "So I gave my room to your fiancee." Ye Yuxuan thought for a moment and said calmly, "Bai Weiwei?" "Yeah," Qin Qiu replied. "I've already settled her into the room. Old Master Bai suspects that there are many problems within his family, especially after Bai Weiwei was kidnapped in the hospital two days ago. He feels that he can't trust anyone around him, so he entrusted Bai Weiwei to you since you're her fiance." Ye Yuxuan thought for a while. "I don't have time to take care of a patient." "That is your fiancee," Qin Qiu argued. Ye Yuxuan nodded. "I don't want a fiancee, then." Qin Qiu was shocked. "What?" "You can move her in," Ye Yuxuan said, "but you take care of her." Qin Qiu roared, "She is not my fiancee." "I'll give her to you then," Ye Yuxuan said nonchalantly. Qin Qiu was exasperated, defeated by Ye Yuxuan's response. Ye Yuxuan should never have a fiancee. He should live with robots. Qin Qiu decided not to talk to this emotionally challenged child. He needed to be chill. No, he needed to decorate the room for Bai Weiwei. After all, her health was poor, and she was in a constant deep slumber. She needed special care and medical equipment to sustain her life. Qin Qiu was efficient in setting up the equipment. Once Bai Weiwei's condition stabilized, he instructed the nurses to keep vigil through the night. As he left the room, he saw Ye Yuxuan still sitting on the living room sofa, holding a cup of water. He seemed to be deep in thought. Chapter 192 Reality (2) Qin Qiu was also thirsty and had a servant bring him some water. After taking a big sip, he asked, "Are you having trouble sleeping?" Ye Yuxuan nodded lightly. "I think there is something I need to think about for a while." Qin Qiu sat on the opposite sofa and asked while drinking water, "What issue do you need to contemplate?" Can it be that his company is going bankrupt? Ye Yuxuan replied monotonously, "I'm thinking if I'm a necrophiliac." Qin Qiu spat out the water in his mouth. "A necrophiliac?!" "I had a dream about a man having a constant desire to commit necrophilia," Ye Yuxuan said composedly. "Stop!" Qin Qiu interjected. "What crazy dreams do you have this time?" Ye Yuxuan's expression seemed unusually distant as he said, "I dreamt of her death, but her body looked cute, like she was just sleeping." "Cute?" Qin Qiu used a strange tone. He couldn't believe Ye Yuxuan would describe someone as cute. Hell, the world was ending! "Yes, cute," Ye Yuxuan reiterated, enunciating. Then, he continued, "And in the dream, that man couldn't resist the urge to commit necrophilia several times." ... The follow-up of the Governor and the Empress Dowager: Amidst the misty, steamy hot spring, a petite, charming figure lay quietly by the hot spring, her black, long hair cascading into the water, swaying like seaweed. Mu Yanjun's face flushed, his gaze terrifyingly intense. He endured and struggled for a long time before gently letting go of her body, refraining from doing the most beastly thing. When did it all start? Was it the countless days of watching her lifeless body without getting any response? Or was it when he began descending into madness, obsession, and even distortion? He had tried everything to stop himself, but in the end, he still couldn't resist taking off her clothes. Only when he pressed against her cold skin that he feel alive. Killing was no longer able to evoke any response from him. She was dead. He knew it. He always did. He even knew how grim and terrifying he was for refusing to bury her. When the little Emperor was six, he would rather burn her body than leave her to him. Perhaps he knew from the beginning that he would commit such a sacrilegious act against her. Many times he was on the verge of doing it, but when it came to the final moment, he looked at her serene face and couldn't go through with it. He was afraid that she would be angry and ignore him in the afterlife. Although they were already married and were just one step away from completion, he still dared not take the risk. Mu Yanjun endured for a long time before suppressing the burning desire in his body, refraining from genuinely crossing the line and entering her. He meticulously washed her body and dressed her in comfortable, luxurious clothes before carrying her out. Servants fled in all directions in the empty palace. When he learned that the little Emperor was building his own power, contacting various military forces, and planning to assert his independence, he did not stop him. He even helped him from time to time. The little Emperor had also grown up. Mu Yanjun calculated that he was now sixteen years old. A decade had passed since then, and he had been guarding Bai Weiwei's cold body for a decade. Time flew yet dragged simultaneously. Mu Yanjun held Bai Weiwei and slowly walked to the palace entrance, where he saw a slender figure, dressed in armor, and wielding a long sword. This young man led the Imperial Guards in a formation, surrounding the palace. The youth had a handsome and cold demeanor. He pointed his sword at Mu Yanjun and ruthlessly said, "Thief Mu, return my mother, and I might leave your dead body whole." Chapter 193 Reality (3) The little Emperor had grown up quickly, living a life of humiliation and endurance under Mu Yanjun's feet. Under such humiliation, he gradually stepped on a path to seize power and authority, and now he finally wielded a sword to seek revenge. Mu Yanjun's face was calm. He gently brushed a strand of Bai Weiwei's hair tousled by the wind behind her ear. His expression was indescribably tender. Then, he raised his eyes to look at the little Emperor. "Back at it again, are we? She was mine from the beginning. What do you mean by "return her?!" The little Emperor's eyes turned red with anger, and he said each word forcefully, "My mother is already dead. The deceased deserves respect. How can you hold onto her body and refuse to let go? Are you trying to disturb her peace even in the afterlife?" Everyone in the palace knew Mu Yanjun cohabited, lived, and slept with his mother. Having witnessed many shady schemes, how could he not know about Mu Yanjun's despicable intentions toward his mother?! "You keep saying you love my mother, but your actions have only degraded her. How dare you claim to love her?!" The little Emperor almost choked on his words. He hated himself for not having the power to protect Bai Weiwei. He also loathed his slow growth, as it prevented Bai Weiwei from receiving a grand burial even in death. Mu Yanjun looked at the little Emperor gloomily and suddenly smiled. "I did it on purpose. I've heard that if you keep someone's body from being buried, their soul will be trapped by the corpse." The little Emperor suddenly remembered that Mu Yanjun once invited a high-ranking monk to the palace. As if confirming the young emperor's thoughts, Mu Yanjun continued with a smile, "I invited the monk to cast a soul-locking talisman. If there truly are souls after death, she won't be able to escape from me. She can only remain by my side day and night." The little Emperor trembled all over, his eyes bloodshot with anger. He shouted, "Is this how you love someone, Mu Yanjun? You're nothing but a madman!" Mu Yanjun's smile widened, turning into a crazed distortion. "I've always been a madman. Even in death, she won't be able to escape me. I want her to be entangled with me for eternity." The little Emperor waved his hand. "Seize him! Capture him!" He wouldn't feel satisfied until Mu Yanjun was mutilated. However, before anyone could act, flames suddenly surged up. The palace had been soaked with oil, and with a single spark and the wind's help, the fire raged wildly. To avoid the fire, everyone had to retreat. The little Emperor couldn't resist rushing toward the flames in a moment of impulse when he saw Mu Yanjun standing in the fire, holding Bai Weiwei. The people behind him immediately held him back. "You can't go in there, Your Majesty! This fire is unstoppable. You won't survive if you go in!" The little Emperor did not care and screamed at Mu Yanjun, "Mu Yanjun, let go of her! Release her!" The fire raged on, and it wouldn't be extinguished until everything was burnt to ashes. Mu Yanjun held Bai Weiwei tightly. They would be inseparable by the end of the fire. Hearing the little Emperor's words, Mu Yanjun smiled and, in the light of the fire, that smile expressed a sense of relief and relaxation that couldn't be put into words. Even the freckles under his eyes seemed to shine more brightly. Then he held Bai Weiwei and turned around, strolling into the burning palace. While they couldn't be together in life, they would become one in death, burning into ashes together. For the past decade, he had yearned to merge with her, but he hesitated whenever he approached the final step. Because he knew that even if he obtained her body, it would be lifeless. If there were truly a next life, and she discovered how vile he was, she might not want him anymore. But now, it was different. In death, they could be burned together, inseparable. Chapter 194 Reality (4) Mu Yanjun could not help but hold her tighter as the flames began to devour their bodies. He lowered his gaze to look at her. Then, he rested his head on her neck and whispered, "I miss you so much, Weiwei." ... Qin Qiu covered his head, feeling a headache coming on. What the hell is this? Ye Yuxuan continued, "In the end, the little Emperor had no choice but to indignantly put them together in the same urn for burial as he really couldn't separate their ashes." Qin Qiu waved his hand. "Something must be wrong with you lately." "I know." Ye Yuxuan nodded in agreement. "I bet you must've been so pent up that you've started becoming twisted, even in your dreams," Qin Qiu speculated. "What's more, you've been dreaming about love every day lately. Don't deny it; you must be going crazy about wanting to fall in love." Ye Yuxuan looked at him in silence. Qin Qiu clapped his hands. "What are you looking at me for? Why else do you think you have such dreams? Forget about women. I bet you've barely even used your hand, haven't you?! What normal man would behave so celibately like you?!" Ye Yuxuan said calmly, "But it feels more like reality than a dream." "Good Lord!" Qin Qiu exclaimed. "Your delusions have gotten so severe that you're mistaking dreams for reality?!" Couldn't be bothered to convince his friend, Ye Yuxuan stood up and announced, "I'm going to the company." Qin Qiu grabbed him at once. "What are you doing, going to the company at 4 AM?! Let me tell you, you should be dating, breaking the dry spell. I've seen so many guys like you, old virgins going crazy from wanting women." Ye Yuxuan tried to pull his hand away but found it held tightly. Qin Qiu continued, "What you should be doing now is to see your fiancee and go on a date with her. When the time's right, you can do some intimate things. That way, you won't keep having these unsatisfied dreams." However, Ye Yuxuan only demanded, "Let go." "Young man, don't be shy," Qin Qiu said. "Let me tell you, as someone with experience, I understand the pain of never having been in love—" "Let go, you old virgin," Ye Yuxuan reiterated. Qin Qiu stood there as if struck by lightning, frozen in place. Ye Yuxuan, who easily defeated his enemy, turned around expressionlessly and went to work at 4 AM. Qin Qiu held his chest. "I really shouldn't have saved your future wife, Ye Yuxuan. I should've let you have a taste of being alone." After Ye Yuxuan left, Qin Qiu sighed, feeling like he had aged several years. He remembered that he should check on Bai Weiwei. After all, she was still asleep. However, just as he opened the door, he heard the nurse's voice, "Miss Bai, wait, you can't remove that needle like this." Bai Weiwei couldn't care less about anything else right then. Right now, she just wanted to strangle the system. She couldn't believe the d*mn system traded her life for life-extending pills, exchanging her entire month of life. Adding to that, the life insurance she obtained from the previous plane deducted five days of her life value. Her heart almost gave out from shock when she woke up and heard that she owed the system five days of life. To prevent her from dying, the system directly used life-extending pills, giving her ten more days of life, which was reduced to five days after some deductions. After another deduction, there was only one hour left. Five days, one hundred and twenty hours, and she was left with only one hour. She genuinely wanted to mangle the system. Only an idiot would believe the system hadn't manipulated it. "Calm down, Host," the system tried to comfort her. "Calm down my a*s!" Bai Weiwei snapped. "Stay open-minded," the system continued to comfort her. "It's just a little life value. Don't take it to heart." "Open-minded, my foot!" Bai Weiwei retorted. "You better shut up, or I'll stuff you into a beer bottle and smash it with a hammer!" Chapter 195 Reality (5) The system immediately shut up. She didn't have the time right then to ask the system what deductions led to her having only one hour of life left; she had more important things to do. Bai Weiwei got out of bed and rushed to the door. She saw Qin Qiu opening it and looking at her with shock. Bai Weiwei had met him a few times before. He was the hospital dean after all. "Hello, Doctor. Where am I?" she asked rapidly. She woke up to find herself in a different setting. Is this the hospital's super VIP ward? she wondered. Qin Qiu immediately explained, "This is your fiance's home. Here's the thing. Your father wants you to deepen your relationship with—woah, what the f*ck are you doing?!" He couldn't believe Bai Weiwei pounced on him like a ravenous wolf and felt his torso. Of course, she had no time to listen to what he was saying. She fished out a phone from his pocket and called her father at once. As soon as the call connected, she immediately said, "Dad, that wicked b*tch, Bai Yaoyao, tried to kill me. My heart condition flared up, and she stole my medicine, wanting to take my fiancé and my company's position, taking everything from me. Fortunately, I didn't die. Last time, she even ordered An Le to kidnap me, planning to drown me. You better have someone control her and wait for me to come back." She paused for a moment before speaking slowly and firmly, "When I go back, I'll give her a good beating to wake her up. A pauper will never become a princess. Even if she does, I will throw her back into the slums!" Silence filled the call for a long time. It seemed that the callee was digesting her words. Then, a soft chuckle played through the phone's speaker. "What are you talking about, Sister? You haven't gone mad from being sick for too long, have you?" Bai Weiwei's heart skipped a beat. Bai Yaoyao? "Where's Dad?" "Our father?" Bai Yaoyao asked. "He's asleep. It's already pretty late. Don't disturb him." Bai Weiwei smiled coldly. "What do you want?" Bai Yaoyao sneered, "What do I want? I want you to die. Will you?" Bai Weiwei took a deep breath and said, "He's also your father. Don't hurt him." "Is he?!" Bai Yaoyao gritted her teeth. "Ask yourself that; is he really my father?! You're all he cares about. You're his precious baby girl while I'm nothing but a f*cking rag doll! He freaks out even over the most insignificant thing about you, but I bet he wouldn't even bat an eyelid if I die!" Bai Weiwei quickly rushed out of the room only to find a completely unfamiliar environment—a massive living room with a dazzling, expensive crystal chandelier hanging above. The butler was on duty late at night, and the servants moved quietly without making a sound. The front door seemed to be specially designed, impossible to open without permission. Is this Ye Yuxuan's house? Only now did Bai Weiwei have the time to think about her strange and useless fiance, who also happened to be the wealthiest and most powerful man in the country. "What do you want? I'll give you whatever you want if you don't harm Dad." Bai Weiwei's weakness was Bai Changyan. Although Bai Changyan was deceived when he was young, leading to the existence of Bai Yaoyao as his illegitimate daughter. But toward Bai Weiwei, Bai Changyan had genuinely given her all his love. Bai Yaoyao smiled delightedly. "Oh, my always high and mighty queen-like sister, to think you'll grovel like this to me. I am at home now, and Dad is by my side." Bai Weiwei had already reached the front door. On the other end of the line, the woman's voice was still arrogant. "I've strapped Dad to a bomb. You have two choices now: exchange your life for his or let him die." Chapter 196 Reality (6) Bai Weiwei closed her eyes to calm herself down. Then she reopened her eyes, her gaze fiercely determined. "I choose to exchange my life." Qin Qiu had just come over when he heard Bai Weiwei's words. "What happened?" he asked, looking puzzled. Bai Weiwei turned back. "Open the door and lend me your car." Quickly realizing something wasn't right with Bai Weiwei, Qin Qiu immediately had a servant unlock the door and fetch his car. Bai Weiwei quickly caught up, and as soon as the car door opened, she pushed Qin Qiu aside, sat in the driver's seat, closed the door, and started the car, all in one terrifyingly swift move. By the time Qin Qiu came around, the car had already disappeared into the distance. Qin Qiu was flabbergasted. He suddenly broke into a run to chase his car. "Bai Weiwei, give me back my phone!" How could he play Arena Of Valor without his phone?! ... Ye Yuxuan's house was about an hour's journey from hers. Bai Weiwei rushed over at breakneck speed, and the moment she arrived home, the system reminded her, "You only have ten minutes left." Can't I live a little longer?! What did this d*mn system do with my life value?! I swear I've never made it through one whole day! After unlocking the main door using her fingerprint, Bai Weiwei entered the house to find it empty, not a soul in sight. The dozens of servants who were usually around were now gone. She wondered if Bai Yaoyao had dismissed all of them. Bai Weiwei's heart was racing. If it weren't for the life value given by the system that greatly improved her physical condition, she believed she would have another heart attack. Suddenly, Bai Yaoyao appeared at the top of the stairs. "Sister, you are here." Bai Weiwei looked at her coldly. "Where is Dad?" Bai Yaoyao looked at her tenderly. "Dad took a sleeping pill. He sure is vigilant. It took me a long time to find a chance to make him sleep." "How do you plan on taking my life?" Bai Weiwei asked, approaching her half-sister step by step. "Do you want me to jump off the building myself, or do you want to disfigure my face with a blade before stabbing me dozens of times to vent your anger?" Bai Yaoyao suddenly said, "Stay right there, Sister. I'm afraid of your special ability." Poisoned but still alive, a car flying in the sky. She thought it was absurd, but she had to be on guard. "Only three steps left, Weiwei. Hurry, run up to her!" said the system chillingly when Bai Weiwei was about to stop. Bai Weiwei was surprised by the system's sudden reminder. What does it mean by three steps left? Almost instantaneously, she chose to trust the system. Bai Yaoyao's face changed. "Stop right there." Just a few more steps and Bai Weiwei would be within reach of her. While she charged toward Bai Yaoyao, the system spoke up simultaneously, "Ding, 'Loving You' has been activated. The effect lasts for three minutes. Please enjoy." Bai Yaoyao was just about to scream and have An Le kill Bai Changyan when she suddenly felt a jolt in her head. Her pupils dilated for a few moments, and when she regained consciousness, she looked at Bai Weiwei with sparkling eyes. "Sister, I love you, I love you, I love you!" Bai Weiwei was stunned. What the hell? Bai Yaoyao suddenly rushed over, wanting to hug her with excitement. Bai Weiwei was startled and kicked her away. Despite being booted to the floor, Bai Yaoyao looked up happily and said, "Tough love is still love. Kick me a few more times, Sister. Go ahead, kick me." Bai Weiwei thought her heart condition would flare up, having been made revolted. Meanwhile, the system recited affectionately, "Darling, as a sad, lonely bachelor, do you envy the lovebirds flying together? Do you silently cry alone while watching couples head home with held hands? Don't be envious anymore and rise. The 'Loving You' package can be yours for just 119 hours o your life. From now on, someone in your life will love, hug, kiss, and have sex with you!" Bai Weiwei stumbled back a few steps. She couldn't believe her 119 hours of life had been exchanged for this piece of junk! On the other hand, Bai Yaoyao took the chance to cling to her leg, looking delighted as she said, "I love you so much,  Sister. Kick me to death!" As Bai Yaoyao wished, Bai Weiwei kicked her away. "Get lost, you lunatic!" Chapter 197 Reality (7) When An Le came out, he saw Bai Weiwei kicking Bai Yaoyao away. He immediately took out the remote control for the bomb. Then he rushed to Bai Yaoyao's side, embraced her, and said to Bai Weiwei, "I advise you not to act rashly. Once I press this button..." Bai Weiwei gritted her teeth and said, "An Le, you ungrateful bastard. I'm sure you're well aware of how my father treats you, yet you stooped so low for this wench!" An Le took a deep breath, about to say something, when Bai Yaoyao suddenly jumped up in agitation and slapped An Le's left cheek hard. "How dare you upset my sister! I'm going to make a heart shape using my 'Love You' slap!" An Le fell silent. And so did Bai Weiwei. Bai Yaoyao looked affectionately at Bai Weiwei and suddenly slapped An Le's right cheek. "Look, Sister, the mark I make slapping someone is even in the shape of loving you." Bai Weiwei almost coughed up blood. Good Lord, where's my medication? She thought her heart condition would definitely act up if she didn't take her medication. Meanwhile, An Le touched his face bewilderedly. The system casually added, "Actually, as soon as I returned, I saw these two b*stards strapping a bomb onto your father. The Life Extension Pill only provides ten days of life, and after deducting five days, you are left with 120 hours. I was worried that when you woke up, the wench would threaten you, putting your life in danger. I had no choice but to use your life to purchase the 'Love You' package." Bai Weiwei held her chest. "Are you intentionally disgusting me? Why couldn't you have just sent Bai Yaoyao to heaven instead of bothering yourself with this stupid package?" The system sighed. "There is law in our system world. We can't directly take someone's life. Besides, you're too poor to afford anything with offensive capabilities. The 119 hours coincided with the discount on the 'Love You' package, and that's how you managed to grab those three minutes. In those three minutes, Bai Yaoyao's love for you is as vast as the universe. She will do anything you tell her to." The system paused for a moment and said worriedly, "You only have a few minutes left. , and the bomb still needs to be disarmed. After getting through this, we'll move on to the next mission to save your life." Bai Weiwei knew this was not the time to dwell on this issue. She was racing against time. At that, she immediately said to Bai Yaoyao, "Disarm the bomb on Dad." Before she could take the wench's life, she had to make sure the bomb was deactivated. An Le, recalling the strange events he had just experienced and witnessing Bai Yaoyao's sudden change in personality, immediately realized that Bai Weiwei must have done something to her. He quickly restrained Bai Yaoyao with both hands. "What have you done to Yaoyao, Miss Weiwei?" Bai Weiwei's face turned cold. "I said, disarm the bomb on my dad." Her words were like a burst of love fireworks, hitting Bai Yaoyao's heart. She erupted with tremendous strength, flipping An Le over wholly. "Yes, Elder Sister. Even disarming the bomb is in the shape of loving you." Bai Yaoyao wore a blissful smile as she extended her hand, forming a big heart shape with her fingers. Then, she turned around and menacingly grabbed An Le by his collar. "Are you deaf? Did you not hear what Elder Sister said?! Disarm the bomb on Dad's body!" "Yaoyao, are you poisoned?" An Le asked with worry. "Wake up! If we disarm the bomb, you won't be able to establish yourself in the Bai family." Having come to this point, they could never return, having put everything on the line. With Bai Changyan dead and Bai Weiwei being a sickly person, Bai Yaoyao definitely had a chance to take control of the Bai family. A thought suddenly hit Bai Yaoyao, and she suddenly reached into An Le's clothes to pull out the gun he used for self-defense. She pressed in on his jaw and demanded, "Disarm it, you idiot! How dare you defy Elder Sister?! If you don't disarm it, I'll die in front of you!" Chapter 198 Reality (8) An Le was shocked. Bai Weiwei added, "If he doesn't disarm the bomb, kill him, and then kill yourself." Bai Yaoyao's eyes were filled with love. "Yes, Elder Sister. I will definitely shoot heart-shaped bullets. I'll kill him and myself in the shape of love for you." Bai Weiwei felt exhausted: She had no desire to talk to this love-struck imbecile. She felt like her own intelligence had been lowered to the Earth's core. An Le, despite his reluctance, couldn't allow the bewitched Bai Yaoyao to commit suicide. He had done so much, all for Bai Yaoyao. Bai Changyan was in a deep slumber due to the sleeping pills he had taken. Tears welled up in Bai Weiwei's eyes as she saw her father lying there, looking exhausted. Although An Le disarmed the bomb slowly, it only took a few steps, so it was still successfully disarmed no matter how slow he was. Bai Yaoyao's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Elder Sister, the bomb has been disarmed." Bai Weiwei nodded. "You did well. Take him with you to your maker. Bye." Tears of excitement flowed from Bai Yaoyao's eyes. "Even your intention to kill me is so beautiful. I, who love you, wish to turn into fireworks, bursting with love for you to the heavens." Bai Weiwei really wanted to cover her ears. Love your a*s! she cursed inwardly. Bai Yaoyao smiled contentedly and lewdly as she pointed the gun at An Le. "Elder sister said it's time for us to die. Bye-bye." She picked up the gun and fired at An Le. But at the crucial moment, An Le rolled under a hairbreadth, dodging the bullet with agility, and quickly rushed to Bai Yaoyao, grabbing the gun from her hand. His skills were much better than Bai Yaoyao's. If a serious fight, ten Bai Yaoyaos wouldn't even be his match. Bai Weiwei's expression changed. She knew that if An Le knocked Bai Yaoyao unconscious, she and Bai Changyan would not be able to escape his deadly grasp. And she heard the familiar voice of the system. [Countdown: 10 seconds... 9... ] There was no time left. Bai Weiwei's eyes turned ruthless as she shouted to Bai Yaoyao, "Go jump off the building now!" An Le had become like this all because he liked Bai Yaoyao. If Bai Yaoyao jumped off the building, An Le could only chase after her. Sure enough, Bai Yaoyao rushed out without hesitation. "I'll even jump off the building in a way that shows my love for you." "What happened to you, Yaoyao?!" An Le roared. "Wake up!" He couldn't care less about anything else at this point and could only desperately chase after her. Seeing that Bai Yaoyao was really going to jump off the building, Bai Weiwei immediately called a trusted person from the company to come and protect Bai Changyan. For a moment, she forgot that it wasn't her phone and pressed the familiar position without realizing that the dialed number was wrong. When the call connected, she immediately said, "Come here quickly. My dad is in danger. Bai Yaoyao is the culprit, and she's planning to murder him with An Le." Before she could finish her words, a cold and calm voice sounded from the other side. "Who are you?" Bai Weiwei was stunned and quickly checked the phone to find that she had called the wrong person with the unfamiliar phone. Having no time to chit-chat, she immediately hung up and called the right person, but the time was already up. 【A new gift package for newbies from the system. Ding! Unlocked. The host has gained three days of vegetative life. Please quickly complete the next task to stay alive. 】 Bai Weiwei finally couldn't help but roar, "Can't you give me anything other than a newbie gift package?!" Is this system so poor that it's left with only newbie gift packages?! Chapter 19 Reality (9) Ye Yuxuan looked at his phone and suddenly felt that the voice was very familiar. But in a trance, he could not remember who this voice belonged to. He continued to work for a while before remembering the phone number just now was Qin Qiu's. Ye Yuxuan redialed the number, and when the call connected, Qin Qiu's angry roar came through, "Ye Yuxuan, let me tell you, your fiancee's sister actually wants to kill her, steal her fiance, her position in the company, and her everything! She even tried to drown her, and now, she's trying to kill. Bai Changyan. I'm at the hospital now; Bai Yaoyao went and jumped off the building, Bawi Weiwei fainted, Bai Changyan had woken up—" Ye Yuxuan calmly hung up the phone. Can I really not distinguish between reality and dream anymore? He actually felt that the voice just now was especially similar to the woman's voice in his dream. But... He looked down at his phone. It wasn't a dream; Qin Qiu's phone had been dialed twice, including the call from just now. He suddenly stood up, grabbed his suit jacket on the chair, and walked out. ... When Qin Qiu arrived at the Bai family's residence, he saw Bai Yaoyao rushing up the stairs very cheerfully. "Sister, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you even if I jump off the building." An Le chased after her from behind. "Yaoyao, wake up. You are just poisoned or deeply hypnotized, or down with whatever f*ck! Don't jump off the building." What the hell? Flabbergast enveloped Qin Qiu as he watched them run to the highest floor. Then he immediately went to find Bai Weiwei. Seeing Bai Weiwei lying pale by the bed, he freaked out, rushing over to pick her up. He felt that something would happen, so he had already called an ambulance and a police car in advance. After calling Ye Yuxuan, the ambulance arrived and quickly moved everyone into the ambulance. When Bai Yaoyao jumped off the building, she was stopped by a canopy on the ground floor, but she was severely injured and was directly taken into the operating room. Bai Weiwei was in a stable condition with stable vital signs. However, she remained unconscious. After Bai Changyan woke up, he looked exhaustedly at his daughter. The surveillance cameras at home had been destroyed when Bai Yaoyao fell. So he had no idea what had happened. That said, he could infer that all these recent events were definitely related to his second daughter. He had already locked An Le up, and the young man was undergoing severe interrogation. When Ye Yuxuan arrived at the hospital, he saw Qin Qiu sitting at the door of Bai Weiwei's ward, silently crying. He paused his steps and walked up behind Qin Qiu, asking nonchalantly, "What happened?" Qin Qiu turned around, holding his phone. "I lost the ranking match again." Ye Yuxuan ignored him. "Who did you lend your phone to just now?" "Bai Weiwei," Qin Qiu answered. Ye Yuxuan immediately pushed open the door of the ward and saw a woman lying on the hospital bed. She was sleeping quietly, her delicate face looking somewhat exhausted due to her long illness. Her lips were pale, and her face was not good. Even her long black hair had lost some luster. Not even Ye Yuxuan knew what was running through his mind. He had seen her before; after all, she was his fiancee. However, he had no impression of her whatsoever. Qin Qiu finally realized that something was wrong and followed inside. "What are you looking at?" Ye Yuxian's stare at Bai Weiwei was absolutely terrifying. Ye Yuxuan was silent for a moment, then said softly, "When she wakes up, I want to hear her voice." Her voice, for a brief moment, actually stirred something in his otherwise calm emotions, causing a slight tremor in his usually rock-solid heart. Chapter 200 The Zombie King's Enchanting Girlfriend (1) Bai Weiwei woke up to the system's voice. [The goal of this mission is to win Song Yunhuan's heart. Mission target: Song Yunhuan. Completion: zero. Time: Four months.] She had no time to contemplate anything for she saw a pair of incredulous and hateful eyes as soon as she opened her eyes. And amidst her stupefaction, she found her hands ruthlessly pushing someone away. That person was very young. Slivers of halo got caught between their black hair as it lifted in the sunlight, and beneath that scattered hair was a very handsome face. And that face, filled with hatred for Bai Weiwei, fell out of the car just like that. Bai Weiwei instinctively reached out to grab his hand but only managed to grab his sleeve. The sleeve tore apart due to the combined force of speed and gravity, and the young man continued to fall, instantly getting engulfed by a horde of... rotten zombies? Bai Weiwei gasped in shock when she finally realized what she was seeing. She was standing at the outermost edge of the rear compartment of a truck with its doors wide open. The vehicle was filled with people, and outside the car, a large group of rotting zombies was relentlessly chasing after it. Every time a human fell from the car, they would rush forward to feast. The man she pushed out just now had already disappeared within the zombie horde, likely devoured entirely. And the familiar voice of the system also rang out. [Ding, the male lead's favorability is at -35. The male lead has endless hatred for you, and he wants to kill you, baby girl.] Goosebumps covered Bai Weiwei's body. What's wrong with the system?! Has it been possessed by the 'Loving You' package? Why is the notification style like this?! Suddenly, she remembered something very important. She looked at the torn fabric hanging from her finger and asked somewhat dazedly, "The man I pushed out earlier with this body is..." The system cheerfully reminded, "Yes, that was the male lead." Bai Weiwei felt like the world was spinning, her sinful hands stained with blood and negative favorability. I actually pushed the male lead out to feed the zombies! Whose heart am I supposed to win now when the zombies have eaten the male lead?! Could this plane be... Bai Weiwei asked with a trembling voice, "Ah Ling, this plane is not a horror movie, right?" "Look at the zombies chasing your car," the system said. "Anyone with the right mind would know it's a doomsday zombie plane." Bai Weiwei staggered. "But my target has already been eaten by zombies." The system replied, "This is something you must work hard to resolve, so do your best. Love you." Bai Weiwei's face twisted in disgust. What's wrong with you, System? Have you been possessed by Bai Yaoyao's vengeful spirit of love? The system reminded her again, [Ding! Host, please start accepting the memories of this body.] That familiar headache hit her again, and Bai Weiwei's face paled. After receiving the memories, she remained silent for a long time. Song Yunhan, this time's target, and Bai Weiwei, the owner of this body, were collegemates. Bai Weiwei was beautiful and sweet-voiced, making her popular among men. On the other hand, Song Yunhuan was a typical otaku who spent his days coding in the dormitory. Though he had a decent appearance, his introverted and gloomy personality didn't attract girls. Originally, these two individuals had nothing to do with each other. However, the previous Bai Weiwei was a manipulative bi*ch, seemingly pure on the surface but actually enjoying the vanity of gaining men's favor with her innocent appearance. Chapter 201 The Zombie King's Enchanting Girlfriend (2) Song Yunhuan caught her attention because of his solitude and the fact that no woman could get close to him. She found men like him, who paid no attention to women, very challenging. So she made a bet with her roommate that she could conquer Song Yunhuan, the unapproachable rock, within a month. Because Song Yunhuan had never been in a relationship, he was deceived by Bai Weiwei's pure appearance and agreed to become her boyfriend. However, after just three days of becoming a couple and barely progressing to the movie-watching stage, Song Yunhuan saw through Bai Weiwei's true nature. He even learned about the bet she made with her roommate. Feeling deceived, Song Yunhuanexposed her deceptive behavior towards men on the internet. He even asked for a breakup. Bai Weiwei felt thoroughly humiliated and was about to retaliate against Song Yunhuan when the doomsday virus broke out, and zombies flooded the city. As two recent ex-lovers, they were forced to escape together. Due to the overwhelming number of people trying to flee and the limited space on the truck, Bai Weiwei couldn't get on board. Song Yunhuan, out of kindness, pulled her up onto the truck, but Bai Weiwei couldn't forget his humiliation. Overwhelmed by a desire for revenge, she pushed him off the truck to feed the zombies. Just as she finished pushing him, Bai Weiwei was transported over. Bai Weiwei looked at her hands, regretting why she couldn't react quickly enough to hold onto Song Yunhuan. Now Song Yunhuan had been eaten by zombies. Whose heart was she supposed to win over now? A zombie's?! Now the important question was how to survive. Due to the truck being overweight, she stood near the door, easily at risk of being pushed off. Someone had already started to push her out. If she fell, she would likely meet the same fate of being fed to the zombies. The system reminded again, "Side mission reward is issued. Please accept it." "Accept," Bai Weiwei replied. She hoped for a powerful post-apocalyptic survival skill that could allow her to travel the space. Or at least a space for her to hide in. The system said, "Ding, The Irresistible Charm trait has been granted." Irresistible Charm trait? Bai Weiwei thought. What use do I have for this?! Sure, it's helpful in the entertainment industry, but what can I do with it in this apocalyptic situation?! I'd be happier if I were given the ability to survive without eating. Suddenly, someone at the front of the truck shouted, "This won't work, the truck can't accelerate. If we continue like this, the zombies will catch up to us." Too many people were on the truck, causing it to be excessively overloaded. If the car broke down, everyone on board would become zombie food. "How about... we have some people get off the truck?" No one knew who suggested this. But it was the unanimous thought of nearly everyone in the truck. However, no one wanted to be the one to get off. Once they got off, they would be devoured by zombies. Bai Weiwei stood by the rear door of the truck, just a step away from the outside. If some people were to be eliminated, she would be the first to be pushed out. Sure enough, someone subtly began trying to push her off the truck. Bai Weiwei's expression changed, and she turned around only to find a senior from her school. He was usually gentle and polite, but now, his thoughts were wicked and selfish. Just as she was about to say something, a gust of wind suddenly blew over, and the system's notification sounded in her ear, "Ding! Irresistible Charm activated." In front of her, subtitles floated with pink heart bubbles. [Her slightly curled chestnut-colored hair fluttered in the wind, and her clear and bright starry eyes shone with a captivating light, making her look as pure and innocent as Bambi...] What the hell? Bai Weiwei thought. The senior, however, stared dumbfoundedly at her and blushed suddenly. Bai Weiwei frowned, about to say something. Then, another set of pink subtitles appeared. [Her delicate eyebrows furrowed, and her exquisitely beautiful face displayed a touch of pitiful sorrow.] Bai Weiwei was rendered speechless. Chapter 202 The Zombie King's Enchanting Girlfriend (3) The senior's heart seemed to be captured by her sorrow, and he immediately held her hand. "You shouldn't stand here. It's easy to fall off. Let's move further inside." Wasn't he going to push me off just now? His attitude changed very quickly. The senior pushed the others away and led Bai Weiwei toward the center of the truck. Bai Weiwei found that this senior had a lot of power, and many people feared him. In fact, many obeyed his commands. If it were someone else, daring to squeeze into the center of the truck during this apocalyptic time, they would probably be pushed out in public anger. They arrived at the center of the truck. A small group had formed, and the senior was one of them. The senior shoved her into the innermost seat. "Weiwei, sit here. My uncle will pick me up once the truck leaves the city." Then he sat beside Bai Weiwei, blushing as he looked shyly at her. Bai Weiwei pursed her lips and did not speak. She listened to them discuss getting some people out of the car. After listening to it, she found that this senior, Lin Xiao, came from a powerful family. Especially one of his uncles held a high military position. Everyone in this small group was from the same class of wealthy and powerful families. This also let Bai Weiwei understand why this group could get such generous treatment. Because the truck would eventually run out of fuel, but as long as they had these powerful and influential second-generation elites on board, someone would come to rescue them. Bai Weiwei heard someone screaming in agony. She frowned and was about to say something. But Lin Xiao said, "Don't be afraid. Some people will accidentally fall off, but you'll be fine." Bai Weiwei looked at him in surprise. Was she close with him? In the memories of the original Bai Weiwei, this senior was low-key and gentle, but he never hung out with people like them. Could it be that Lin Xiao had a crush on the original Bai Weiwei? As the thought crossed her mind, the pink bubble subtitles appeared again. [Her lovely lowered gaze was as gentle as the clouds in the sky and as soft as the mist by the sea. She seemed so fragile that one couldn't help but feel pity and an urge to protect her....] Lin Xiao also became excited. "Don't worry, I'll protect you. I won't let you face any storms." Bai Weiwei was speechless for a moment and tapped the system. "What's with those pink subtitles?" Only she could see it, and she felt beyond awkward. The system explained, "It's the effect of the Irresistible Charm. To others, you are incredibly adorable and exceptionally beautiful." Mentally exhausted, Bai Weiwei asked, "Can I block them?" Those subtitles were practically suicide-inducing, absolutely unbearable. The system replied, "Okay, I've blocked them, but the effect is still there. I think the subtitle effect is fantastic, very girlish." More like idiotic, Bai Weiwei thought. Just as Lin Xiao was excitedly protecting her, the system's reminder suddenly sounded. [Ding! The male lead's favorability is at -40.] Bai Weiwei was stunned. Is Song Yunhuan still alive?! In the pile of zombies that had devoured Song Yunhuan, the unconscious zombies suddenly emitted terrifying hoarse sounds. It sounded like fear and also a warning. All the zombies contorted and their decaying bodies were twisted into pieces by a tremendous spatial force. Amidst the heap of rotten flesh and limbs, a pale, colorless hand appeared, covered in blood. It slowly flexed. Then he slowly stood up, his face handsome yet eerie. In the center of his black eyes, there was a crimson-red blush. He suddenly smiled. The laughter was hoarse and eerie. "Bai Weiwei, I'm going to eat you." Chapter 203 The Zombie King's Enchanting Girlfriend (4) As the chaos erupted in the truck, Bai Weiwei had already mentally prepared herself. With too many people and the slow speed of the vehicle, even someone like Lin Xiao, the descendant of a powerful family, was not of much help during a massive disaster. No descendant of anything was of good use. Especially when a zombie unexpectedly jumped onto the truck's roof and several people standing near the rear door were dragged down by them, many in the truck started to panic. They cursed and cried, desperately pushing each other, and several people fell off the truck that way. Moreover, some people noticed that the number of zombies seemed to be increasing. Despite the fact that people were also fleeing elsewhere, this group of zombies were inexplicably chasing their truck at high speed. Eventually, a terrifying zombie tide formed, relentlessly following them. The horrifying scene was enough to frighten even the bravest. Bai Weiwei asked the system, "Is there anything that can drive away zombies?" The system immediately nodded excitedly, "Yes, yes, yes. Mighty Zombie-Killing Agent, your best companion during the apocalypse, easily kills zombies for you. Your reliable choice is the Mighty Zombie-Killing Agent." Bai Weiwei replied, "Give me a bottle." She couldn't spare a thought for anything else now, for all her plans for the male lead would be ruined if she got bitten by a zombie. The system responded, "This thing is expensive. You can't afford it on credit." Hopelessness immediately overcame Bai Weiwei, and she complained, "I have done so many tasks. Why can't I accumulate any live values?! Tell me, did you steal my life values? Did you make me have nothing?!" The system became serious. "How can you say you have nothing?!" Bai Weiwei thought, What else do I have? Why can't I see it? The system's tone became cheerful and cute. "You still have me." "Can you drive zombies away?" Bai Weiwei asked. The system blew her a kiss. "Of course not, but I will cheer you on. Go on, you can do it! Love you!" Bai Weiwei thought she would cough up blood. This d*mn system. Must it disgust me like this?! Bloody system. I'd be better off without it! And is the system infected with the 'Loving You' virus? Why is it talking like a brainless idiot?! Lin Xiao suddenly grabbed Bai Weiwei's hand and said solemnly, "Weiwei, don't be afraid. I won't let anything happen to you." Bai Weiwei had no idea what strange illusion the Irresistible Charm gave Lin Xiao again. Lin Xiao suddenly turned bashful. "Weiwei, let's get married once we're safe, okay?" Bai Weiwei was rendered speechless. Lin Xiao continued, "I've even thought of our children's names. It'd be great if we could have two, a boy who looks like me and a girl who looks like you... Hehe. Then we can still be together when we are old and gray, enjoying the beautiful sunset." Bai Weiwei felt a pain in her chest. Even without heart disease, she felt like this situation would give her one. Suddenly, a loud bang came from the roof of the truck, as if something had jumped onto it. The truck suddenly slipped following the violent tremble, and Bai Weiwei fell forward as she felt the vehicle losing balance. Lin Xiao grabbed her, and they almost rolled into a heap together. The truck seemed to hit something and shook violently. Many people inside the truck were thrown out as a result. The zombies swarmed in, and they started to tear into the humans. The scene was cruel and horrifying, and the thick smell of blood filled the air. The truck also began to slow down. Suddenly, the car made a desperate groaning sound before abruptly coming to a stop. Everyone screamed in terror, for they knew the truck stopping meant that they would all die. Lin Xiao's reaction, however, was terrifyingly swift. He immediately grabbed Bai Weiwei's hand, kicked away a few people, squeezed out of the truck, jumped out, then ran forward with all his might. Chapter 204 The Zombie King's Enchanting Girlfriend (5) For those who couldn't get off the truck in time, the approaching zombies swarmed over them. Bai Weiwei didn't look back but could hear the howls of the zombies behind her. And the agonizing screams of the people. It was simply a living hell on Earth. Lin Xiao hurriedly ran forward, and a deserted commercial area on the outskirts of the city appeared. He said, "We can make it to the outskirts through here. My uncle is waiting outside the city." However, Bai Weiwei suddenly shook off Lin Xiao's hand and said calmly, "You go ahead. I can't keep up with you." She wasn't lying; she indeed couldn't match his pace. Lin Xiao seemed like someone who had trained and, being a big man, his physical condition was much better than hers. It was already her limit to follow him to this extent. Her feet felt heavy, and her heart was pounding so fast that it made her chest ache. She knew very well where her physical limits were, and she had reached them. Whether it was because of the Irresistible Charm, Lin Xiao's personality was relatively acceptable. However, it was better if one could survive than for both of them to die. Lin Xiao looked back and was touched. "You are so kind. You possess the most captivating eyes in the world and the most beautiful soul." Bai Weiwei couldn't take it anymore, but Lin Xiao kept going, "How are you so cute, so beautiful, so..." Smack! Bai Weiwei slapped him. Lin Xiao was instantly rendered at a loss for words. Bai Weiwei sighed. Finally, peace and quiet. After dodging several attacks from the zombies, Lin Xiao also realized that he could not run out of the city with a burden like Bai Weiwei. Even if she was the best burden in the world. But his life was still the most important. Lin Xiao bid farewell with tears in his eyes. "Weiwei, wait for me to come back and find you. Goodbye." After that, he ran off. Never again, Bai Weiwei thought. Suddenly, the system said, "Quick, quick, I see a place to hide ahead!" Bai Weiwei listened to the system and rushed forward with all her might. Several zombies lunged at her, and the foul stench of rotting flesh almost made Bai Weiwei sick. She wasn't sure if it was just her, but these zombies seemed to be toying with her. Whenever she thought they were about to catch up, they would slow down. Upon seeing the warehouse the system mentioned, she rushed inside, closed the door, and pushed whatever heavy objects to the door. The pursuing zombies outside the door were roaring, banging against the door, and howling. Bai Weiwei was scared spitless. The mere thought of being bitten by those creatures made her want to commit suicide. Turning into a zombie was just too ugly. She refused. Fortunately, the warehouse door was particularly sturdy, and the zombies couldn't get in for the time being. Bai Weiwei sat on the ground weakly and complained to the system, "I think one of those zombies outside might be Song Yunhuan." Song Yunhuan couldn't possibly survive falling into a pile of zombies. If he was still alive, he must have turned into a zombie. "Maybe," the system replied. Bai Weiwei became miserable. "My target isn't some rotting corpse with bulging eyes, oozing pus from all his facial orifices, and sparse-haired, is it?" That was how all the zombies outside looked like. "Well, he's still the male lead no matter what," the system comforted her. "As ugly as he is, it'll be over before you know it." "I suddenly thought of a problem," Bai Weiwei pointed out. The system asked, "What problem?" "His favorability is only at -40," said Bai Weiwei. "-40 is already terrifyingly low," the system replied, "and you f*cking tell me it's 'only' at -40?!" Chapter 205 The Zombie King's Enchanting Girlfriend (6) Bai Weiwei: "My mission in the last plane was -50 right from the get-go. I personally pushed Song Yunhuan into a pile of zombies, and yet it was only -40. Sure enough, chopping off a man's manhood was true enmity for men." "Host, don't you think you're missing the point?" the system asked. Bai Weiwei brought the topic up with the system merely to divert attention. After all, nothing but zombies surrounded the place. Any sane human would be fearful. Looking at the door, she said, "Fortunately, this door is sturdy or I'd have been zombie food by now." Just as she finished speaking, the door suddenly shook, and the screws holding it in place burst one by one. Both Bai Weiwei and the system were at a loss for words. The door was kicked open with a boom, shattering into pieces. Bai Weiwei sat on the ground, watching as the sunlight poured in from outside. A slender figure appeared at the door, backlit by the light, and his black hair emanated a strange halo. His exceptionally handsome face carried a hint of a twisted and eerie smile. "I found you, Bai Weiwei." His voice was a little hoarse, with a strange sensuality. Bai Weiwei was taken aback, and her mind raced through countless thoughts, calculating the appropriate reaction in a split second. Then, she feigned fear and her voice trembled. "Song Yunhuan?" Song Yunhuan's eyes were gloomy, and a red glint in his eyes became more apparent. He smiled. "Yes, didn't expect me to come back, did you?" Tears suddenly streamed down Bai Weiwei's eyes, and after a few sobs, she suddenly got up from the ground, rushed to him, and forcefully hugged him. She wailed, "You're alive, Song Yunhuan. Thank the Lord you're still alive!" Her crying was filled with relief, guilt, and a sense of liberation. Song Yunhuan's body was stiff, exuding a coldness like a corpse. He looked at Bai Weiwei with a deeper smile. "I thought you wanted me to die." Bai Weiwei clenched her fist and punched his chest. "I did want you to die. How can you hurt me like that? I never liked someone so much. How can you treat me like that?" Her tone was coquettish. Song Yunhuan seemed confused by her attitude. "Do you like me?" Bai Weiwei looked up, tears glistening in her eyes. "What do you mean? I've always liked you. It took me so much courage to become your girlfriend; you not only despised me but even posted malicious things about me online. I turned love to hate; do you know what that means?! I really wanted you dead." The red glint in Song Yunhuan's eyes intensified, and his smile became even more eerie. "Love, you say?" Bai Weiwei bit her lip, her face full of willfulness and naivety. "Of course. Did you think I wanted to like you? Do you know how embarrassing it is to like you? Your family is poor, your personality is introverted, and my friends all say you're not likable at all. And I've always aimed to marry into a wealthy family. How can I like a poor boy like you?" How unashamedly shameless, the system mused. Bai Weiwei pouted as tears hung from the corner of her eyes. "But I... I fell for you the moment I laid eyes on you. I kept telling myself that you have no future and couldn't give me the life I want. But I still liked you, yet I couldn't bring myself to pursue you. Coincidentally, my roommate made a bet with me. Having a way out, I went and confessed to you." Song Yunhuan fell silent. Bai Weiwei became shy again. "You actually agreed to be friends with me." Song Yunhuan was deep in thought. Bai Weiwei was sad again. "You don't even like me. I almost killed you accidentally... Fortunately, you didn't die." Suddenly, Song Yunhuan laughed. "Do you really like me that much?" Bai Weiwei blushed, feeling embarrassed. "You shameless idiot. How can you keep having a girl confess to you?" Song Yunhuan reached out and lifted her up, his smile even more brilliant. "In that case, I shall confess too. I particularly like the way you'd look eaten by zombies." With that, he threw Bai Weiwei out the door. Zombies surrounded the warehouse. Chapter 206 The Zombie King's Enchanting Girlfriend (7) Bai Weiwei: "Why didn't the Irresistible Charm work?" She thought her performance, along with the Irresistible Charm, would soften Song Yunhuan's heart a little. Only then did the system have a chance to remind her, "The Irresistible Charm only works on people with zero or above favorability." Song Yunhuan's favorability was at -40. She would never say it was 'only' -40 again. -40 was a lot worse. Bai Weiwei fell to the ground, using her hands to reduce the impact as she scraped across the ground. Her skin was torn, and blood immediately flowed out. The zombies outside seemed to have smelled fresh meat and excitedly howled as they gathered around. Bai Weiwei's pupils contracted. "Hey, system, does the Irresistible Charm work on these things at all?" "It's the Irresistible Charm, not the Irrezomtible Charm. It's completely useless against these consciousness creatures." Zombies wouldn't have consciousness if they did not advance. The apocalypse had just begun. The only advanced zombie was Song Yunhuan. "So this side quest reward is basically useless except for confusing random passersby?" Bai Weiwei exasperated. The system encouraged, "The charm will be useful once the target's favorability toward you raises above zero." "Do you think I can wait until that time?!" Bai Weiwei snapped. "I'm already zombie food here!" The next second, several zombies lunged at her. Frightened, Bai Weiwei rolled to the ground, narrowly avoiding the zombies' attack. She looked at Song Yunhuan, her eyes filled with helpless despair. Song Yunhuan was still smiling, standing in the sunlight, but his gaze was sinister and eerie. The zombies seemed to have received some command, and their attacks on Bai Weiwei intensified. They opened their mouths, revealing their putrid teeth, and ran towards her at high speed, intending to catch her. Bai Weiwei had nowhere to hide as zombies surrounded the entire warehouse outside. Inside the warehouse, except for Song Yunhuan, no zombies dared to approach. Bai Weiwei couldn't care less about anything else at this point. She'd rather be torn to pieces by Song Yunhuan than become food for these zombies. In her desperate situation, she tried to find a silver lining: at least Song Yunhuan was handsome. However, just as she ran into the warehouse, something caught her foot, causing her to fall heavily to the ground. A zombie grabbed her calf firmly and dragged her out of the warehouse. Bai Weiwei's clung tightly to the ground, her fingertips bleeding. She felt the sharp nails of the zombie pierce into her flesh, and blood began to gush out. Bai Weiwei trembled all over as she suddenly felt a shadow looming over her. Upon looking up, she found Song Yunhuan walking toward her. He slowly squatted down, and an eerie smile still hung on his handsome face. There was even a hint of malicious satisfaction in his smile. "Did you know, Bai Weiwei? I was just like you when you pushed me off the truck—desperate and without a way out, only to be eaten alive by zombies." Bai Weiwei looked at him, her eyes turning red, and she trembled while saying, "I'm sorry, Song Yunhuan." Song Yunhuan's smile twisted. "Sorry? What is there to apologize for? Shouldn't a woman like you be selfish and self-centered? How could you apologize to me?" Bai Weiwei was gradually dragged out by the zombies, and she desperately clung to the ground with her fingers, her eyes fixed on Song Yunhuan. "I'm sorry, Song Yunhuan. I know I'm no good person. I'm selfish and vain, narrow-minded, and enjoy comforts, but I really didn't mean it. I didn't want you to die; I just wanted to scare you. I didn't think I'd fail to catch you in the end." Bai Weiwei sobbed. She used the last of her strength to reach out and grab his hand. His sleeve tore a little. Chapter 207 The Zombie King's Enchanting Girlfriend (8) It was where Bai Weiwei accidentally ripped when she tried to pull him up. Bai Weiwei held his hand with all her strength. "I'm sorry." She said, guilt-ridden. Song Yunhuan didn't struggle but allowed her to cling to his hand tightly. Bai Weiwei was running out of strength; the zombies' power was overwhelming, something a human couldn't contend with. She was already at her limit. Suddenly, Song Yunhuan's fingers tightened, and he grasped her hand back. A glimmer of hope and joy appeared in Bai Weiwei's eyes. Song Yunhuan's voice was faint, almost gentle. "I believe you didn't do it on purpose, but..." His thin lips curled up, and the darkness in his eyes was chilling. "But, so what?" With that, he released his grip, finger by finger, letting the glimmer in Bai Weiwei's eyes dim. Because he let go, Bai Weiwei was dragged out by the zombies again. The zombie's finger had already sunk deep into her calf. It hurt so much that Bai Weiwei's scalp tingled. She was pulled out of the warehouse in one swift go, and the sunlight poured onto her recklessly. The zombies pounced on her one by one, slamming into each other as they lunged at her. Bai Weiwei felt her legs, hands, and back scratched and bitten by the zombies. "Ding! The host is facing a major danger, mandatory issuance of life insurance," the system announced. Life insurance activated. The pain in Bai Weiwei's body disappeared instantly, but the passage of life didn't slow down because of it. She raised her head, and her eyes were filled with desperate struggles and self-blame. But there was no hatred. Before being overwhelmed by the zombies, Song Yunhuan saw her utter a few words silently. "Song Yunhuan, I'm sorry." It was like she really wanted to scare him for a moment but ended up losing her grip on him. Song Yunhuan suddenly walked out of the warehouse. The zombies panicked and fled in all directions, each one avoiding Song Yunhuan. Song Yunhuan woke up to find himself covered in decay, but his flesh and blood were continuously regenerating for some reason. In the end, he didn't turn into an ugly zombie. Instead, he looked exactly the same as before. The only difference was that he had endless energy and powerful strength. Well, also a corpse-like body. He didn't have a heartbeat either. He hated Bai Weiwei, hated her for turning him into this state. This hatred made him want Bai Weiwei to experience everything he had been through. Though Bai Weiwei couldn't feel the pain, she could still sense the injuries all over her body. Not a single spot on her was unscathed. Bai Weiwei's consciousness became hazy, and just as she thought she was undoubtedly going to die, the zombies suddenly scattered. Her face was deathly pale, and her body was covered in zombie wounds. It was a truly gruesome sight. When Song Yunhuan approached her, she suddenly looked up at him. Her face had not suffered any attacks. She was still delicate and pretty. She gazed at him bewilderedly, emanating a sense of pitiful charm. Song Yunhuan asked softly, "Does it hurt?" Bai Weiwei only looked at him, seeming to be in a state where pain had affected her sanity. Suddenly she reached her hand out, her fingers stained with blood from clawing at the ground. "Song Yunhuan..." Bai Weiwei struggled to get closer to him. Song Yunhuan stood there, bending down with a seemingly indifferent "Hmm." It was like he was treating a pitiful prey that he didn't care about. Bai Weiwei struggled to sit up; this was already her physical limit. She couldn't stand. Her hand just touched his face. Chapter 208 The Zombie King's Enchanting Girlfriend (9) The dirt and blood on his fingers smeared his face. Song Yunhuan remained unmoved as if he was waiting for her hateful curses. But Bai Weiwei breathed a sigh of relief and chuckled softly. "I'm going to die, aren't I, Song Yunhuan?" "Yes," Song Yunhuan replied plainly. Bai Weiwei finally felt relieved. "In that case, can I say something to you before I die?" Song Yunhuan did not respond and looked at her indifferently. Bai Weiwei suddenly grabbed his clothes, pulling his head down. With her last bit of strength, she leaned up and kissed his lips. Song Yunhuan's body froze, and the red in his eyes deepened. The kiss was brief. Bai Weiwei smiled and said, "I've lied to you many times, pretending to be innocent, naive, and pitiful. But, the one thing I haven't lied about is that I really like you." She smiled while tears filled her eyes. "I'm sorry for failing to catch you and causing you to fall off the truck." Her voice gradually weakened. "I didn't do it on purpose..." Her fingers lost strength and slowly let go of his clothes. "Song Yunhuan, I like you..." She fell back to the ground, her eyes losing their brightness, and a lifeless look took over. Finally, darkness enveloped her, and she completely lost consciousness. Stupefaction overcame Song Yunhuan momentarily before he finally felt his lips. That was his first kiss, and the blood from Bai Weiwei's fingers still lingered on his lips. He stuck out his tongue and licked it, surprised to find the blood was sweet. As a zombie, humans were certainly excellent delicacies to him. Song Yunhuan, I like you... Does she really like me? [Ding! The male lead's favorability is at -35.] ... Bai Weiwei believed her death this time was inevitable. She was scratched and bitten by the zombies. The virus would definitely invade her body. The life insurance guarantee could only sustain her life for one day, and after that, she would experience unbearable pain. Burning, freezing, intense pain, and various discomforts would all come crashing down on her. In a daze, she communicated with the system, "System, how am I to win Song Yunhuan's heart if I become a zombie? He definitely won't like me once I go bald, my teeth are crooked, my face is full of rotten flesh, and my intestines hang out, sway everywhere." The system consoled her gently, "It's okay. We'll wash away the rotten flesh, put your intestines back in, stitch them up, and wear a wig. You'll look good as new." Bai Weiwei, sick and groggy, was touched. "System, do I really look good?" "Of course you do," said the system. "Even if you become a zombie, you are still the most good-looking zombie." Bai Weiwei felt a surge of strength to fight back. She didn't know how long she struggled, but finally, she opened her eyes. The sight before her left her puzzled. It was a room in an old house It was a little shabby but immaculate and had the warmth of a home. It was evident to her someone had lived here for many years. She was lying on the bed, and the light green curtains swayed gently in the breeze. Bai Weiwei sat up and found that she had not turned into a zombie. Her wounds had all turned into white scars. Her heartbeat and body also retained all the characteristics of a human. She couldn't believe she remained a human despite being mangled by zombies. Bai Weiwei breathed a sigh of relief. She got out of bed and walked out of the room barefoot. Then, she found Song Yunhuan sitting on the sofa, reading a book attentively. When Song Yunhuan noticed her walking out, he hummed gently, "Awake?" Bai Weiwei was a little confused. "I'm not dead?" Song Yunhuan shook his head. "You have a special constitution, immune to zombie virus." Bai Weiwei was stunned at first. When she came back to her senses, she smiled sweetly. "Is that so? I'm so lucky." Song Yunhuan smiled as well when he saw her smiling happily. "Did you mean it when you said you like me?" Taken aback by his question, Bai Weiwei lowered her head bashfully and fell silent for a moment before finally gathering all her courage to look up. Her eyes twinkled brightly, filled with smiles. "Yeah, I like you." Song Yunhuan put his fingers on the book and, for some reason, exerted some strength. He suppressed the restlessness within him, walked to her, and gently caressed her face. Then, with a gentle smile, he said, "If you really like me so much, can you die for me?" Bai Weiwei fell silent.
