Chapter 834Return to the Sacred Land (2) "Zhuque." Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan was watching Bai Xiaochen and Xiaolong'er playing around. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise coming from outside. She frowned, "What happened outside? Why are there noises? Go out and take a look." "Got it." Zhuque cupped her fists, accepted the order, and left. After a while, she pushed open the door of the bamboo house and walked in. She said hesitantly, "Your Majesty, there are two people outside who are looking for you." "Looking for me?" "Then I'll go out and take a look?" Bai Yan raised her eyebrows. With that, she slowly stood up from her chair and walked out the door. Outside the house, under the blood-colored sky, two people were trembling as they crawled towards her. Perhaps it was because they had crawled too many roads, a trail of blood had formed under their bodies. To Bai Yan, this sight was exceptionally glaring. "What are you doing?" Bai Yan asked with a frown. The Second Elder's face was pale, and his body lay on the ground, trembling as he said, "Your Majesty, I am here to ask for your forgiveness. That day, it was I who believed in the fake, which made you misunderstand the Emperor. Everything is my fault. I am willing to be beaten and scolded, and I ask you to punish me." "No, Your Majesty, it's my fault. I didn't bring the king's order to you. In fact, when the king left the palace to remove the seal of the demon world, he asked me to come back and inform you. I was unable to do it, which gave the traitor an opportunity." Huo Yu knelt on the ground, his face full of tears. "It's all my fault. If Your Majesty wants to beat and scold me, I won't say anything." Taking the bamboo stick from his back, he placed it in front of Bai Yan, cupping it with both palms. He lowered his head, looking as if he was ready to face death with equanimity. Bai Yan's hand slowly grasped the bamboo strip in front of her. Her expression was indifferent and her eyes shone with a light that no one could understand.  As if sensing that the bamboo strip had left his hand, Huo Yu's body froze. He clenched his teeth tightly, bracing for the impending blow. However... For a long time, there was no pain. Huo Yu looked up in shock, only to see the bamboo stick in Bai Yan's hand suddenly burst into flames, instantly turning into ashes. "You have suffered a lot on your way here, haven't you?"  "Your..." "Your Majesty?" Huo Yu looked at Bai Yan in confusion, not quite understanding what she meant. "Since that's the case, then your crimes have been repaid. Get up." Bai Yan had always kept a clear boundary between different matters. What she was targeting was only those who had delusions of harming her. Back then, she had been deceived, let alone the Great Elder and Huo Yu. Thus, she had never blamed them. Huo Yu's body was as stiff as iron, not daring to believe that Bai Yan would let them off so easily. Before coming, they were already prepared to be covered in wounds! Now, she didn't even give them a slap before she eliminated their sins. Seeing the two of them still kneeling on the ground without moving, Bai Yan's face sank: "What? Are you waiting for me to help you up?" The woman's sharp voice fell into Huo Yu's ears. Huo Yu immediately got up from the ground in shock. His pants were covered in blood, and he could not even stand still. Even so, he still stood on the ground. Despite his trembling legs, he did not continue to kneel.  Looking at the two of them, Bai Yan couldn't resist gesturing towards the stone seat on the ground: "Have a seat. You can go down the mountain after resting for a while." Chapter 835 Return to the Sacred Land (3) Huo Yu was moved to tears. He wiped the tears seeping out of the corners of his eyes, his pale face full of gratitude. "I will never forget your great kindness to Huo Yu in this life." Had the Queen not forgiven him, he would have had no chance to remain in the demon world. So, it was her generosity that helped him. "I don't blame you for this. I have been deceived. What right do I have to blame you?" "What's more, I know how loyal you are to the demon world. As long as you are loyal to Emperor Cang in the future, that's enough." The Second Elder slowly walked to the stone seat and sat down. His gaze was filled with remorse, "The queen does not want to blame us. That is the queen's generosity, but I will not forgive my own actions. In the future, I will offer all my loyalty to the Emperor and the Queen." With a light sign, Bai Yan said, "Here are two healing pills. After you take them, your injuries will recover. Zhuque does not like to be disturbed. You should go down the mountain earlier." After handing the pills to the two of them, she turned around and walked into the bamboo house. But Zhuque did not enter the room with her. After she saw the Second Elder take the pill, she raised her leg and kicked him hard.  This kick sent the Second Elder tumbling to the ground. Fortunately, he had already consumed the medicinal pill, so he didn't suffer much damage. "Lord Zhuque." The Second Elder was at a loss and looked pitifully at her. His eager appearance was somewhat pitiful. "Back then, when such an incident occurred, why didn't you come and ask me?" Zhuque gnashed her teeth and shouted angrily. The Second Elder trembled and timidly replied, "It's the Emperor.." "Oh, that's not right. It was that imposter who didn't let me tell anyone, including the Great Elder and Lord Zhuque. He was afraid that it would reach the Queen's ears." "Idiot!" Zhuque glared at the Second Elder furiously, "If not for the fact that the Queen had already forgiven you, I wouldn't have been willing to go against the Queen's wishes. It would not have been just that kick you got earlier! Now that your injuries have mostly recovered, hurry up and get out of here!"  As soon as these words were spoken, the two of them seemed to have been granted amnesty, swiftly running towards the bottom of the Sacred Mountain, disappearing without a trace. After they disappeared, Zhuque pushed open the door and entered the room. Looking at the smiling Bai Yan, her red eyes were filled with grievance: "Your Majesty, I just don't like his stupid behavior. Are you blaming me?" Shaking her head helplessly, Bai Yan chuckled: "You are just angry. Now you have let off some steam, Are you feeling better?" Zhuque immediately nodded. Her gaze became cautious. "Your Majesty, after you return to the Demon Realm this time, will you leave again?" Hearing this, Bai Yan's lips curved into a smile: "Unfortunately, I need to leave the Demon Realm, but I will be back soon." Zhuque, who had been feeling down, instantly lit up with happiness upon hearing Bai Yan's words. Her eyes were extremely beautiful, and the clothes formed from flames enhanced her stunning appearance. "Your Majesty, I can't leave Sacred Mountain now. When you find Xuanwu, remember to bring them back to me. At that time, I will be able to leave this place." Just like a thousand years ago, I will accompany you on the battlefield! As if recalling the previous scene, a hint of yearning appeared in Zhuque's eyes. It was as if she could see the glory and hot-bloodedness of the past through this blood-colored sky. Chapter 836 Return to the Sacred Land (4) She believed that one day, she would be able to reunite with her brothers. The former queen would also return with great momentum! "Bai Xiaochen, Long'er, let's go." Bai Yan smiled sweetly as she held Bai Xiaochen in one hand and the little hand of Long'er in the other. "Mum, where are we going?" Blinking his bright eyes, Bai Xiachen curiously tilted his head to look at Bai Yan. "We are going to find your Daddy." Bai Yan paused for a moment, "Now that the crisis in the Demon Realm has been resolved, I want to make a trip back to the Sacred Land." "Return to the Sacred Land?" "Then does that mean I can see my godfather again? I miss my godfather and sister Chu so much." Bai Yan tapped Bai Xiaochen's forehead with her finger, and her tone was full of adoration: "I have told you many times. That's your godfather's sister. If you call her sister, doesn't that mean she's one generation younger than us?" Bai Xiaochen's small hand touched his head, his little face looking pitiful. "But..." "Sister Chu won't let me call her aunt, or else she won't bring me to play with fire..." After saying this, Bai Xiachen suddenly came to his senses and frantically explained, "Mum, you heard wrongly just now. I didn't want to play with fire..." ’I just...” "There's no need to explain!" Bai Yan sneered, "I always thought Chu Yiyi was the one who ruined you. I didn't expect you to like to set fire to your bones! Very well, I will tell your master about this. That day when your master's treasury was burned, you also had a part of the responsibility!" "Mum..." "I know I was wrong. Can you please not tell Master?" Bai Xiachen pitifully cried out, tugging at Bai Yan's sleeve. "Well, it depends on my mood." Bai Yan gently stroked her chin. When she finished speaking, she held the hands of the two lovely little children and walked out of the bamboo house with a light smile.  Even though the seal had been removed, the sky of the Demon Realm was still a blood-red color. It was as if she was in a sea of blood. The blood covered the entire world. In the main hall, Emperor Cang's head was propped up in his palm as he looked down at the person who was reporting. His domineering aura enveloped the entire main hall, so much so that the person who reported it had already started to sweat profusely. His body trembled slightly. Suddenly, a red robe appeared in Emperor Cang's eyes. His domineering and cold gaze softened, and his robe fluttered. He had already arrived beside the woman and pulled her into his embrace. "Why are you here? Didn't I tell you to rest at Sacred Mountain?" His voice was unprecedentedly gentle as if the entire world was inferior to her in his arms. "I have something to tell you. I need to go back to the Sacred Land."  "Okay, I will accompany you back later." Emperor Cang frowned and muttered to himself for a long time before he relaxed. His red lips curled up into a faint smile. "There is no need." Bai Yan shook her head: "I'll be back soon. You should still have a lot of things to deal with. You don't need to go back with me deliberately." In that instant, Bai Yan recalled what the Holy Lord had told her before. Now... The difference in strength between her and Emperor Cang was too great. She had to increase her strength as soon as possible in order to be able to fight alongside him. And now, the only way to increase her strength was to return to the Sacred Land! "Are you afraid that I will fight Chu Yifeng?" Emperor Cang's voice was sour. In Bai Yan's heart, Chu Yifeng also held an extraordinary position. That was when she needed help the most, to have the most people by her side now- just this was enough to stir jealousy within him. Chapter 837Let Her Be the Judge (1) As soon as Emperor Cang finished speaking, the woman in front of him had already tiptoed and delivered her red lips to his lips, her two arms hooked around his neck. Her kiss was passinate and gentle, as if there was endless affection.  After a while, Bai Yan release her arm and gently stroked his head: "Be good. Wait for me here. I will be back soon." Her tone was as if she was comforting a small animal, but this kind of feeling was making his heart go numb. So, he couldn't bear to refuse again and softly replied, "Okay, after I deal with the matters of the Demon Realm, I will go and find you." Bai Yan nods her head, "Chen'er, Long'er, let's return to the Sacred Land." "Daddy," "Don't forget what you promised me. I'll return to the Demon Realm after I go back to see my godfather and master." Bai Xiaochen glanced at Bai Yan and then turned his gaze to Emperor Cang. His large eyes blinked brightly like stars "When the time comes, you will let Chen'er go to the Secret Realm to cultivate." Emperor Cang laughed, "When have I not kept my promise to you? When you come back, I will personally send you to the Secret Realm to cultivate." "Deal." Bai Xiachen smiled. His smile was innocent and the sunlight was even more romantic. "I will work hard to improve my strength and become my mother's wings. I will shelter you from the wind and rain." His small face was filled with determination, his big eyes full of resolve. As long as he could protect his mother, he wasn't afraid of any danger in the secret realm! Bai Yan wanted to open her mouth to stop Bai Xiachen, but when she saw the little guy's excited face, she couldn't bring herself to say anything. Emperor Cang seemed to sense Bai Yan's concern. He reached out and embraced her shoulder. "You don't have to worry, I won't let my son be in danger. Moreover, he is the Crown Prince of the Demon Realm. His responsibility is to protect his mother and sister!" This was something he could not avoid. Bai Yan glared at Emperor Cang: "Where is his sister?" Emperor Cang's lips curved into a smile as his red lips moved closer to Bai Yan's ear. "If you want it, you can have it at any time."  “The most beautiful words of love in the world are when I mentioned having children, and you said, 'If you want, you can have them anytime."' At that moment, Bai Yan's ears were a little hot. She coughed lightly and turned her head away, not looking directly into Emperor Cang's eyes that were filled with desire.  "It's getting late. I should go." She suddenly thought of something and looked up at Emperor Cang. "In addition, I have already forgiven the Second Elder and Huo Yu. You don't have to trouble them anymore." Emperor Cang frowned. To be honest, if not for these two idiots, Yan'er wouldn't have run away from home. However... Since Bai Yan decided to forgive these two people, then he respected her decision! "Daddy, goodbye." Bai Xiaochen waved goodbye to Emperor Cang, then followed Bai Yan out the door. "Wait." Suddenly, a voice came from behind. Bai Yan stopped in her tracks and turned to look at the silver-haired man chasing after her. "Emperor Cang, is there anything else?" I'll send you off. There was a hint of a smile in Emperor Cang's eyes as he walked over to Bai Yan and firmly held her hand. "OK." This time, Bai Yan didn't refuse Emperor Cang. "It's not like I won't come back. Why are you so nervous?" "I just want to cherish every minute and second I spend with you." She did not allow him to follow her. He respected her choice. However, he just wanted to stay by her side for a while longer. Chapter 838 Let Her Be the Judge (2) Bai Xiachen silently walked behind the two of them, pouting his lips in dissatisfaction. His face was full of frustration. "Why do I feel that after mother accepted daddy, I became an extra person?" Little Long'er blinked her big eyes and curiously looked at delicate Bai Xiaochen beside her. "Why?" Because usually, Mom would hug me. Since we have daddy, whenever Mom hugs me, Dad throws me away..." "That's why I feel like I'm not the biological son of him." Bai Xiaochen pursed his lips. Mother was Father's true love, and he... He was probably adpoted? The Sacred Land was shrouded in a cloud of mist, like a fairyland. The current Sacred Land was bursting with noice. As soon as Bai Yan walked out of the Sacred Land, she saw the crowd surrounding the entrance. Her eyes flashed with confusion as she muttered to herself. "What happened here?" It had only been a while since she had returned, so why were there so many people coming to the Sacred Land? "Miss, aren't you here for the selection of disciples at the Sacred Land? How come you don't know what's going on?" A young man, noticing Bai Yan's dazed expression, kindly explained. "The Sacred Land wants to recruit disciples again?" A trace of astonishment appeared on Bai Yan's beautiful face. Didn't the Sacred Land just send people to recruit disciples? Why is it starting now? Could it be that something really happened in the Sacred Land? "Mum, I want to see my godfather and master. Can we go in first?" Bai Xiachen yawned. "Alright." Holding Bai Xiaochen in one hand and Little Long'er in the other, Bai Yan made her way to the entrance of the Sacred Land. But there were too many people in front of her, so she needed to pass through the crowd before she could go to the Sacred Land. "Get out of the way!" Suddenly, a hand reached out from the side, wanting to push Bai Yan.  Bai Yan narrowed her eyes and pulled Bai Xiachen to the side to avoid the hand.   Seeing this, the owner of the hand didn't forget to turn around and glare at Bai Yan, "Didn't you see the young mistress of the Fiery Blaze Sect coming? People like you should quickly retreat!" The Fiery Blaze Sect was a second-rate sect, second only to the Demon Beast Sect. It also had an important position on this continent. Therefore, when they heard that the young lady of the Fiery Blaze Sect had come, the people who had been crowding around her quickly left, moving to either side to make way for her. Under everyone's gaze, a woman dressed in red walked over from behind. A long silver snake was wrapped around her wrist. She had a sweet smile on her lips as she slowly walked forward.  "Fiery Blaze Sect's eldest daughter, Huo Yun, is said to be a Beast Tamer Master. Do you see the silver snake in her hand? This silver snake was personally tamed by her." "Well, based on her talent, even the Demon Beast Sect would be forced to accept her as a disciple. Unfortunately, Huo Yun is the daughter of the Fiery Blaze Sect, so it is impossible for her to become a disciple of the Demon Beast Sect." Everyone sighed. The young ladies of the Fiery Blaze Sect had come to participate in the recruitment of the Sacred Land, so they probably wouldn't have many chances. "Mum, that woman is really ugly. She still has the nerve to wear red clothes. Only mother can match such a beautiful color." In the silent crowd, a young and tender voice suddenly sounded, attracting everyone's attention in an instant. Chapter 839 Let Her Be the Judge (3) Bai Xiachen's chubby face was filled with displeasure. His eyes were fixed on the silver snake on Huo Yun's wrist. At such a young age, his pair of fox eyes were already filled with dominance. It was no wonder he didn't have a good impression of this Huo Yun. First, the guards of the Fiery Fire Sect were too arrogant. And now, Huo Yun was actually in cahoots with the snake clan! Because of Qing Luan and Qing Xue, Bai Xiachen didn't have a good impression of anyone from the snake clan! If not for that damn snake clan, mother wouldn't have suffered so much damage.  Feeling the pressure from the baby boy, the silver snake shrank back and didn't dare to spit out its tongue again. Its small eyes were filled with fear.  "How dare you!" The guards of the Fiery Blaze Sect were furious. In this continent, there were not many people who dared to be so arrogant to their young miss! However, just as the guard of the Fiery Blaz Sect was about to flip out, Huo Yun frowned and stopped him. "This is the Sacred Land! Without my order, no one is allowed to cause trouble!" It wasn't that Huo Yun couldn't tell. No matter how arrogant she was, she wouldn't dare to cause trouble at the entrance of the Sacred Land. As for this child's mother... She must have come to participate in the enrollment, and by then, it would be enough for her to settle accounts with her on the field! "Let's go. Cousin should be here to pick us up." Huo Yun slowly turned her head. At this moment, she didn't notice that Bai Yan had already put away her murderous aura. If she didn't stop the guard, the guard would have already been killed on the spot. "Mother." "Can I go cause trouble for her?" Blinking his eyes, Bai Xiachen then turned to look at Bai Yan. Bai Yan lightly smiled: "I don't offend others, and I expect the same. But if someone provokes you, there's no need to hold back." In other words, if these people were to offend Bai Xiachen, she wouldn't ask about his course of action. At this time, Huo Yun had already walked to the door. Soon, everyone witnessed a man emerging from the doorway to greet her. With great joy, he approached Huo Yun. "Cousin, you are finally here."  Huo Yun shifted from her previous arrogance as she shyly cast her gaze downward. "Cousin, my father have informed you that I am here to participate in the discple selection as well. I am hoping Cousin Ya Han can lend me some assistance.  "Haha," Lin Yahan laughed out loud, "Don't worry. With your relationship with me, you will definitely be able to successfully enter the Sacred Land. By then, we will be martial siblings." Seeing Huo Yun enter the Sacred Land with Lin Ya Han, envy appeared in everyone's eyes. "So, Miss Huo Yun's cousin is in the Sacred Land."   "Moreover, I also heard that Lin Yahan's master will be one of the referees for this selection."  "This lady's son offended her just now. I'm afraid that they won't be able to smoothly pass the selection of disciples this time." Bai Yan didn't say anything, only quietly listening to the conversation between these people. Her brows couldn't help but furrow. Previously, because of the cheating incident, she had asked the master to clean up the Sacred Land. She did not expect that there would still be cheating things happening. "Chen'er, looks like we came back at the right time." Bai Yan's lips curved up. No matter what, she had to inform the Master of what had happened here and have him pay more attention to the competition. She didn't want any more incidents of favoritism and cheating to happen within the sacred ground! After saying this, Bai Yan held the hand of Bai Xiachen and Little Long'er and walked through the crowd to the entrance of the Sacred Land. Chapter 840 Let Her Be the Judge (4) Before her return, Bai Yan had sent a letter to her master, so he had already instructed the gatekeepers and provided them with her portrait. When the two gatekeepers saw Bai Yan, they didn't bother to check her invitation letter and directly let her into the sacred ground.  "How..." "How come this young lady doesn't have an invitation letter?" "Could it be that she also connections in the Sacred Land?" "I think so. Otherwise, how could she have the courage to confront Miss Huo Yun?" . The voices of the crowd did not reach the ears of Huo Yun, who had already gone far away. After leaving the crowd, Huo Yun stopped and bit her lips, "Cousin, did you see the woman with the two children just now?" Lin Yahan was surprised and asked, "What's wrong?" "That woman's son offended me with his cheap mouth. When the time comes for the disciple selection competition, I hope..." She could directly fail! Huo Yun gritted her teeth as a cold light flashed in her eyes. This small matter was not difficult for a cousin who had an elder as his master. "Cousin, don't worry. Those who offend you won't have a chance to advance." Lin Yahan burst into laughter. He had thought that something big would happen. To him, this small matter was a piece of cake. Bai Yan, who had just entered the doorway, didn't hear the conversation between Huo Yun and Lin Yahan. She was also heading in a different direction from them, making her way toward the Sacred Island. Ever since she left the Sacred Land, she had entrusted the Sacred Island to the few Masters to take care of it. Hence, at this time, the Master must be waiting for him at the Sacred Island. From a distance, Bai Yan could see three old men drinking tea and chatting. Her face warmed up, and her lips curled into a smile. After coming to this continent, these three masters gave her too much warmth, and it was also them who extended a helping hand to her at her most difficult time. "Bai Yan, you're back?" Ren Yi was the first to see Bai Yan. His eyes lit up and he instantly stood up, "You're back?". His words caused Great Master Zheng Qi and Third Master Qiu Shurong to come back to their senses. They stared in surprise at the big and small pair who were walking towards them. "By the way, is this young lady the person you were looking for?" Qiu Shurong pursed his lips, "However, why didn't you tell us when you left the Illusion Palace? We were still waiting for you." If your grandfather hadn't told us, we wouldn't have known that you had left. Bai Yan couldn't help but laugh: "Masters, how is your concoction technique going? Did you remember what I taught you last time?" Zheng Qi coughed twice and looked at Qiu Shurong apologetically. Then, he confessed, "We have already successfully refined it. It's just your third master... still doesn't understand." "That's right. Your third master is too stupid. He doesn't even get such a simple question. Disciple, you should teach him a lesson!"  Qiu Shurong's face flushed red as he looked angrily at his two bad friends. "You two old bastards, you can't keep a secret, can you?" Seeing that the third master was about to start a fight with the other two old masters, Bai Yan smiled: "Alright, I didn't come back to check on your alchemists. I have something to tell you." “What is it?” For a moment, all three old men turned to look at Bai Yan. "The Sacred Realm that the Holy Lord told me before. I want to go there." It was said that those who entered the Sacred Realm would have a slim chance of survival, but if they came out of the Sacred Realm, not only would their levels increase greatly, but even their mental state would be a qualitative improvement. This time, for Emperor Cang, and for the Demon Realm, she was willing to take the risk! Chapter 841 Let Her Be the Judge (5) "You want to go to the Sacred Realm?" Zheng Qi looked at Bai Yan in surprise. After pondering for a while, he said, "I have to discuss this matter with the Holy Lord. After all, if something happens to you, not only will the three of us die, even the Sacred Land will suffer great losses." "Alright. I haven't seen him in a long time either. I will go with you to meet him. Also, there's something else I want to know." Bai Yan paused for a moment before asking: "Why would the Sacred Land conduct a disciple selection?" "Well..." Qiu Shurong sighed helplessly, "The continent is not peaceful recently. The three major powers have sensed the danger and are planning to select a talented cultivator from the world and send them to the Minor Sacred Realm to cultivate."  The Sacred Realm is divided into two parts. One is the Minor Sacred Realm. Bai Yan has also been there once in the past. The other is the real Sacred Realm. It is commonly known as the Realm of Life and Death. No matter which realm it was, a person could only enter once in their entire life. If not for the fact that they had no other choice, the Sacred Land wouldn't continue to recruit disciples. "Since it's planned to have a talented person undergo cultivation in the Minor Sacred Realm, the competition this time must be fair. There must be no more favoritism!" Bai Yan stroked her chin and solemnly said. "Speaking of this matter, I really want to say you come back at a right time. The Holy Lord just said that he wanted you to be the judge this time." "Me?" "I don't have time. I need to enter the Sacred Realm to cultivate." "Disciple, it will take some time to open the Sacred Realm. You will be the referee for the rest of the time. Moreover, you will be the only referee for this competition!" Bai Yan glances at the old men: "Why don't you serve as judges?" “Serve as the juedge? " It was a troublesome task, and only someone out of their minds would take it on.  "Disciple, we still have some areas that we aren't familiar with when it comes to alchemy. We need to carefully study it, so we do not have time." The corners of Ren Yi's mouth twitched, and he had already thought of an excuse. "What about Chu Yifeng?" "Letting the young master be the judge? Do you think those young ladies would still have the mood to compete? They'd probably all want to devour the young master." "What about Chu Yiyi?" If Chu Yifeng couldn't do it, could she be suitable? "She? Of course not! With this girl's crazy personality, the whole competition will be messed up by her. Maybe if she is in a bad mood, she will set a torch on the arena and burn it." In short, these old men all believed that only Bai Yan is suitable. Bai Yan facepalmed. She suddenly felt that she had come back at the wrong time. "Can I refuse?" Her tone weakened a bit as she asked. "No! You can't refuse. It's settled then. You must be the referee for this competition. The young princess will be your assistant! In this Sacred Land, only you can control her." Ren Yi had a firm expression on his face, not allowing Bai Yan to continue to refuse. "Mother," "I also want to be the assistant." Pulling on Bai Yan's sleeve, Bai Xiachen's big eyes lit up. Little Long'er looked at Bai Yan and then back at Bai Xiachen with anticipation in her eyes. She also wanted to help her mother. "Let's talk about this later. I'll go see the Holy Lord and Chu Yiyi first. By the way, is Chu Yifeng in the Holy Land?" Bai Yan pondered for a moment before asking. The faces of the several old men all froze, and they let out a soft sign. Chapter 842 Let Her Be the Judge (6) The young lord has always been infatuated with Bai Yan, but Bai Yan has already chosen Emperor Cang. Therefore, not long ago, he had already left the Sacred Land to heal himself. Seeing the expressions on the three elders' faces, Bai Yan already knew the answer. She felt a little guilty in her heart. In the end, she owed Chu Yifeng too many favors. Even in her entire life, she would never be able to repay them! "Let's go." Zheng Qi patted Bai Yan's shoulder and smiled wryly, "Although we have always been eager for you to accept the young lord, we also understand that feelings can not be forced. The young lord has accompanied you for many years, but you have not accepted him. In just a short period of time after Emperor Cang appeared, you have already given your heart to him. This can prove that the young lord is not the person you are destined to be. No matter what decision you make, we will support you." "Master." A warm feeling flowed through Bai Yan's heart, and a smile appeared on her lips, "You will always be my masters, in this life and the next." "Hahaha!" Zheng Qi laughed. "If you put it that way, what regrets could I have? Come on, let's not waste any time time. The Holy Lord has been waiting for you. He's been mentioning how he wants you back. Let me take you to see him right away!" . Inside the room. The table was a mess, and Chu Yiyi was eating a chicken leg, her mouth smeared with traces of oil. Beside her, a man held a wine jar, his handsome face adorned with a rosy flush from alcohol. "Father, did you ask Bai Yan to come back?" Chu Yiyi threw the chicken bone in her hand to the ground and stared at the wine jar in Chu Ran's hand. Chu Ran raised his hand and slapped Chu Yiyi on the forehead. "This is the wine that Zheng Qi spent a lot of effort to get. I have already given you a mouthful, so don't think about it anymore," Chu Ran glared at her, "As for Bai Yan, Zheng Qi told me that she will be back in a few days." "Got it." Chu Yiyi's eyes lit up and a smile appeared on her pretty face. "That's great. I have to write a letter to my brother and ask him to come back." Although Bai Yan had already accepted Emperor Cang, Chu Yiyi knew her brother very well. Just a single glance from him would satisfy him greatly. As his sister, she wanted to fulfill his wishes. Just as Chu Ran was about to speak, an old man hurried in from outside the door. He cupped his fists respectfully and said, "Holy Lord, Little Princess, Zheng Qi has arrived. Moreover, Miss Bai Yan is also here." This elder was a member of the Holy Lord's entourage and naturally knew about Bai Yan's existence. However, ever since Bai Changfeng's birthday, everyone knew that the three elders had accepted a disciple. However, even if they knew, they had never seen Bai Yan before. Even if Bai Yan was standing right in front of them, they wouldn't recognize her as the master of the Holy Island, the disciple of the three elders. "What? She's back? So fast?" Chu Ran stood up in a panic. He looked at the mess on the table and quickly waved his hand. He put all the food and wine on the table into his storage bag. Then, he took out a clean robe and draped it over his body. Moreover, he did not forget to take a pill to remove the smell of alcohol in his mouth. Chu Yiyi was dumbfounded. Her face was still covered with dirt and she had not swallowed the food in her mouth. Her dress was even more dirty. "She is a neat freak!" Seeing Chu Yiyi in a daze, Chu Ran reminded her in a low voice, meaning that he wanted her to quickly change her clothes. Unfortunately, it was too late. Just as Chu Yiyi was about to stand up from the table, Zheng Qi had already brought Bai Yan in. At the first glance, what caught Bai Yan's eyes was Chu Yiyi's dirty little face. Immediately, she frowned. "Yi Yi, your room has been messed up by you. Now you want to mess up the Holy Lord's room?" "Did you drink? Did you forget about the last time when you were drunk and almost set the Sacred Island on fire?" Bai Yan asked. "No, it's not like that. It's my father." Chu Yiyi wanted to cry but had no tears.  But before she could finish speaking, Chu Ran, who was at the side, hastily coughed twice and interrupted what she almost blurted out next.  Chapter 843 The Father Who Tricks His Daughter "Yiyi, I have warned you before that a girl should be dignified. Not only do you eat meat in large mouthfuls, you even gulp down wine! What kind of conduct is this?" Chu Ran had a righteous look on his face as he scolded with a serious expression. Chu Yiyi was dumbfounded. She said weakly, "I only drank one..." "What? You actually drank a whole jug?" Chu Ran angrily pointed at Chu Yiyi and said in a cold voice, "You dare to mention that you drank a pot of wine?" It turns out that you were so impudent when I wasn't paying attention! Especially considering you had the nerve to come into my room for a drink. Now, my room reeks of alcohol! How can I manage to have a sound sleep tonight? Chu Yiyi widened her eyes and looked at the stern Chu Ran in disbelief. Suddenly, she had the urge to cry. She had only taken a sip, why did her father frame her? "Bai Yan, what brings you here?" Chu Ran turned to look at Bai Yan, his stern expression softened a little. Ever since he had started planning to play matchmaker for his son, this girl had consistently been avoiding him. Her presence here now surely had a purpose. If she did not have something significant to discuss, she would not have sought him out like this！ "Hold Lord, you said that with my achievements in the Minor Sacred Realm, I can enter the true Sacred Realm. However, I was in a hurry to leave the Sacred Land back then, so I didn't choose to enter the Sacred Realm. I wonder if I can continue to enter now?" Bai Yan frowned. In fact, in the four years she had been in the Sacred Land, she had spent two years in the Minor Sacred Realm, and her experience in the Minor Sacred Realm had exceeded the limit, obtaining the qualifications to enter the True Sacred Realm. However, she couldn't be at ease with Bai Xiao, so she left the Sacred Land and headed to the Bai Family. If she had the chance, she would definitely go to the Sacred Realm to increase her strength. Chu Ran was surprised and frowned. "You want to enter the Sacred Realm?" "Yes." Bai Yan's tone was firm, and her expression didn't change. Chu Ran sighed. "Bai Yan, I have said that you can advance to the true Sacred Realm. However, you have experienced the dangers of the Minor Sacred Realm. The dangers within the true Sacred Realm are hundreds of times greater!" "However, because the Sacred Realm is dangerous, it is the best way for you to improve your strength." Chu Ran looked up at Bai Yan and solemnly said, "In addition, the time in the Sacred Land is extremely slow. In other words, you have to spend a year in the Sacred Land. It is only a month in the outside world!"  After a moment of silence, Bai Yan continued to listen to Chu Ran's explanation. "Now I want to know if you really want to enter the Sacred Realm and if you're not afraid of the danger?" Chu Ran relaxed his brows, his tone and expression gentle as he continued. "Yes!" Bai Yan's black eyes were filled with determination, leaving no room for doubt. "Alright, I respect your choice, but it will take a lot of time to open the Sacred Realm. I have to get someone to make preparations," Chu Ran chuckled and slowly walked over to Bai Yan's side. Gently patting her shoulder, he said in a regretful tone, "What a pity. Before, I had always treated you as my daughter-in-law. Now, you are married to someone else. However, you are not my daughter-in-law. You are also my daughter!" "Holy Lord." Bai Yan raised her eyes and stared at the man standing in front of her.  Chu Ran chuckled, "You don't have to say too much. If my daughter is half as good as you, I will be satisfied." Chu Yiyi wanted to cry but had no tears. Was she being disliked just like that? Sure enough, children were always good to other people. She was just an existence that was belittled. Chapter 844 False Accusation (1) Zheng Qi coughed twice and smiled calmly. "Holy Lord, come here. I have something to report to you" "What is it?" "I would like to recommend Bai Yan as the referee for this competition. What do you think, Your Majesty?" The suggestion made Chu Ran ponder for a moment before he turned to Bai Yan and asked, "What do you think of your master's suggestion?" "How long will it take to open the Sacred Realm? How many days will the competition last?" Touching her chin, Bai Yan pondered deeply for a moment. "It will take more than a month. The competition will definitely end within this month." "Alright." Bai Yan's eyes flashed a few times before her lips curled into a smile, "Then I will take on the task of being the referee." "Haha." Chu Ran burst into laughter and patted Bai Yan's shoulder again. "With you as the referee, I can rest assured. Yiyi, you should train with Bai Yan and listen to her suggestions. Do you understand?" Chu Yiyi felt very wronged. She seemed to still remember the matter of being framed by her father. Just as she was about to something, Chu Ran's warning gaze swept over. It means that if you dare to reveal the plot, you will be finished! Perhaps Chu Ran's gaze was terrifying that Chu Yiyi's entire body trembled and she didn't dare to speak of what had just happened. Zheng Qi coughed twice, cleared his throat, and continued, "Since we have finished what we should say, I still have something to discuss with Bai Yan. Your Majesty, we will take our leave." He joined his fists and led Bai Yan out of the door. After a while, he had already disappeared from the room. As he watched the two leave, Chu Ran quietly let out a sigh of relief. He raised his hand and slowly stroked his chest, his expression easing.  Then, he waved his hand, and the dishes that he had just removed were once again presented to the table. "Yiyi, let's continue." He laughed twice and waved his sleeves to take his seat. Chu Yiyi curled her lips. "Forget it, I won't take the blame for you. I'm going to explain to Bai Yan." "Wait," Seeing that Chu Yiyi was about to leave, Chu Ran frowned, "If you dare to tell anyone about what happened just now, your father will marry you off in the next few days!"  Chu Yiyi shivered and rushed out of the house without looking back. Of course, she did not have the courage to betray her father.  In the last few days, there had been disturbances within the Sacred Land as the selected disciples caused trouble. To prevent them from interfering with the proper functioning of the Sacred Land and its disciples, these selected individuals were confined to a small courtyard in the outer sect. They were strictly forbidden from venturing beyond the designated area without the permission of the Sacred Land's authorities. At this time, in a small room in the courtyard, a woman in a red dress was pacing back and forth anxiously. Her palm was gently rubbed, and there was a trace of anxiety on her beautiful face. Suddenly, the door was pushed open. When she turned, she saw a handsome man walking in from outside the door. Her eyes lit up and she quickly greeted him. "Cousin, what did your master say? Did he agree to help us?" Lin Yahan sighed helplessly and smiled bitterly. "Cousin, I'm afraid my master won't be able to help you this time." Huo Yun's ecstatic expression froze. She stared blankly at the handsome face of the man in front of her. Why? Cousin, your master is in a high position in the Sacred Land. Why can't he help us? Is it because he doesn't want to help me? Chapter 845 False Accusation (2) "Sister, you misunderstood. It's not that my master doesn't want to help you, it's that this incident happened so suddenly that the Sacred Land chose another referee," This referee is rather mysterious. I spent half a day trying to find out who she is, but I failed. A hint of bitterness appeared on Lin Yahan's face. She had originally thought that it was all set, but who knew that such a change would suddenly occur. Hearing this, Huo Yun lowered her head, her face slightly pale.   In fact, only she knew that her talent had been bragged about by the Fiery Blaze Sect and was incomparable to the genius disciples of other sects! Even her Silver Snake pet was not subdued by her, but was tamed by an elder in the sect and handed over to her. Moreover, it was publically announced that she was the one who personally subdued it. And because she was wearing the accessories to hide her true strength, she rarely showed up outside. Therefore, those people did not know her true strength. If there was no one to help her, she would have very few chances to pass this competition! More importantly, she still wanted to use that elder's hand to knock out that woman! The thought of Bai Xiaocheng going against her made Huo Yun grit her teeth in hatred, so she couldn't give that kid's mother a chance!  "Cousin, can you help me find out who the referee is? As long as I know who she is, I am sure I can get her to help me." Huo Yun clenched her fists tightly, raised her head, and looked at Lin Yahan with a pleading gaze. Looking at his cousin's pitiful appearance, Lin Yahan's heart softened, but in the end, he shook his head helplessly. "The Sacred Land is extremely secretive about that referee. Even my master does not know who came. All I know is..." The little Princess of the Sacred Land will also attend this competition and be the referee's assistant. Her body stiffened. Even the princess of the Sacred Land was only fit to be his assistant. What was the background of the referee? "However, cousin, you don't have to worry. This time, other than the referee and the little Princess, there are also some disciples from the Sacred Land who came to assist them. Coincidentally, I have a friendly connection with one of the disciples. I can make you safely selected through her." Lin Yahan raised the corner of his lips and revealed a determined smile. "After all, as the referee of such a huge competition, I can't take care of the overall situation. At that time, I will ask someone to secretly play some tricks to help you win." Huo Yun finally breathed a sigh of relief. She raised her fist and shyly punched Lin Yahan in the chest. "Cousin, you have thought about everything for me. Why didn't you tell me earlier? You made me so worried?" "By the way, have you investigated the identity of that woman?" The young girl's fist landed softly on his chest. When he saw his snow-white neck, his gaze gradually lowered. When he noticed her curvaceous form, a strange heat surged in Lin Yahan's heart. He swallowed with difficulty and said with a dry mouth, "I've already sent someone to investigate. Cousin, just wait for the news with peace of mind. I won't disappoint you."   "I can rest assured about my cousin," Huo Yu murmured, her gaze averted in shyness. The neckline of her attire dropped seductively, and a faint blush adorned her fair neck. An air of embarrassment clung to her as she continued, "But I do wish my cousin could ensure their absence from the selection. I have no desire to encounter those individuals again." "Hahaha!" Lin Yahan laughed and pinched Huo Yu's palm. "Cousin, because the people who came to the competition this time were all invited by the Sacred Land, I was unable to directly eliminate that woman." Chapter 846 False Accusation (3) He narrowed his eyes and a cold light flashed in his eyes. He laughed silently, "I have a way to ruin her reputation. Once her reputation is ruined, she will definitely stay away from the Sacred Land and will never be able to compete with you again!" She was just a woman. As a disciple of the Sacred Land, wouldn't it be easy for him to deal with her? As long as he could make his cousin happy, what's wrong with abusing his authority? In any case, there would be no one in the higher-ups who would care about such small matters. Three days passed in a flash, and the people who came to participate in the competition also came from various factions. Now, they all gathered in the venue for competition. Huo Yun stood among the group of guards. She was no longer as shy as she was when she was facing Lin Yahan. She gave off an arrogant and noble air. Her face was as cold as ice as she stared coldly at the noisy crowd in front of her. A hint of impatience gradually appeared between her brows. However, when she scanned the surroundings, she still couldn't see Bai Yan. Her brows involuntarily knitted together. "Miss!" Suddenly, the maid at her side carefully said, "That woman is here." Huo Yun swept her eyes and followed the maid's gaze. Immediately, she saw three people, one big and two small, slowly walking over from behind the crowd. In the afternoon sunlight, the woman in the red outfit appeared as if she were dancing on a gentle breeze. Her movements were delicate and elegant, and her beauty was truly exceptional. One could even say she looked as if she could rule the world – it was a perfect match. The lady held a young boy by her side, his attire adorned in a regal shade of purple. His commanding and dignified presence was unmistakable, a surprising contrast to his youthful appearance. On her right hand was a tender and cute little girl. She had a delicate and sweet smile on her little face. Her eyes were curved like crescent moons. Anyone who saw such a sweet and lovely little girl could not help but feel soft in their hearts. "This woman is finally here!" Huo Yun's eyes darkened a few times, "Do you still remember what I told you before?" The maid hurriedly nodded, "I naturally remember Miss' instructions very clearly." "Alright!" Huo Yun sneered, "Cousin is right. We should let this woman lose her reputation!" Just as Bai Yan was leading the two little ones to the high platform, a mocking voice suddenly sounded, causing her to stop in her tracks. "People these days are really shameless. They dare to participate in the competition without real talent and knowledge! They also want to bribe the people under the referee. Do you think that you can make yourself safely selected just because you bribe others?" With a furrowed brow, Bai Yan let go of Little Long'er and Bai Xiachen's hands. She tilted her head slightly, her gaze sweeping across Huo Yun's face before settling on the maid who had recently ridiculed her. "You were talking about me just now?" The maid sneered. "I didn't wrong you. I personally saw those things. I saw that you wanted to bribe the disciples of the Sacred Land, but what kind of place do you think the Sacred Land is? As a disciple of the Sacred Land, how can he be tempted by you?" Without waiting for Bai Yan to speak, Huo Yun's eyebrows furrowed, and she asked in a faint tone. "Xiaoling!" "What do you mean?" The maid called Xiao Ling turned her head and cupped her fists respectfully at Huo Yun. "Miss, I accidentally met this girl before. She met a disciple from a Sacred Land and wanted to seduce him with her own body. Her goal was to be selected successfully. I really did not want Miss to compete with this kind of person, so I dared to expose her." Chapter 847 False Accusation (4) Huo Yun and Xiao Ling had already rehearsed several times. Naturally, they remembered everything that should be said. Coupled with her disgusted expression, everyone believed her words. "What?" Huo Yun's eyes widened in shock as she covered her red lips in disbelief. Her body trembled as she looked at Bai Yan with undisguised disgust, "You.." "You actually did such a thing. The sect you belong to must be humiliated by you!" The crowd was in an uproar, everyone looked at Bai Yan with disgust, and even more so, the person who was standing next to her just a moment ago stepped away in fear of being tainted by this woman. Little Long'er was so angry that her face turned red. She wanted to step forward and tear off this woman's repulsive face, but a hand stretched out from her side and tightly held her. "Queen..." She turned around and looked at Bai Yan with a wronged expression. Her small eyes also shot a fierce glare at Huo Yun and her maid. This time, Bai Xiachen didn't have the urge to act like Little Long'er. His little mouth curved into a sinister smile and his big eyes flickered: "Little Long'er, just wait and see." This group of people wanted to frame mother? Then before they did all this, did they find out who their mother was? "You just said that I bribed a disciple of a Sacred Land? I wonder where that disciple is. Can you call him out?" The corner of Bai Yan's lips curved into a smile as she looked at Huo Yun. Huo Yun gave the maid beside her a look. The maid immediately stood up and cleared her throat. She said, "Young Master Liu, can you come out and testify? If such a woman enters the Sacred Land, she will definitely tarnish this Sacred Land." As her voice trailed off, a man dressed in a green robe emerged leisurely from the high platform nearby. With one hand casually placing behind his back, he strolled toward the gathering, a gentle smile displaying on his face. "Originally, I, Liu Han, was not willing to say much about this matter. After all, this matter is too disgraceful." With a smile on his face, Liu Han said righteously, "But, since Miss Huo Yun's maid has spoken, then I will definitely come out to testify!" Liu Han's eyes slowly turned towards Bai Yan. Frowning, he sincerely and earnestly said, "Miss, I know your talent is not good, so you are in a hurry to secure a place in this competition with unjust actions. But I am a just person. It is impossible for me to betray my conscience just because of this!" "Please leave on your own so that I won't chase you away!" The smile on his face disappeared just now. His face was serious, and even his expression was extremely solemn. "Uncle." Suddenly, a childish voice rang out, causing Liu Han's brows to furrow even tighter as he lowered his gaze to stare at the little boy who was walking in front of him. "Uncle, did your mother teach you that lying is bad and the liar will end up in a miserable situation!" Liu Han's expression changed, and he said coldly, "No wonder your mother is like that. This child is really too rude. As expected, what kind of person would bring up such rude child?" Bai Xiachen was beaming with smiles, but his big fox eyes were cold. "Uncle, I am only telling you that bad children who lie will end up in a miserable state. If uncle is not lying, then my words are not directed at you, or are you afraid?" "In addition, you slandered my mother. I even politely called you uncle. Who is it that lacks manners. Chapter 848 False Accusation (5) At this moment, the crowd was extremely quiet, so quiet that even a falling needle could be heard. These people will never doubt the disciples of the Sacred Land, but this child has always been very polite, yet the disciples claims that he has no manners! This makes people who have sympathy stand on Bai Xiaochen's side. Leaving these words behind, Bai Xiachen turns around and walks over to Bai Yan's side. Raising his pink little face, his big eyes shone with a bright light. "Mother, I have already warned him, but he doesn't seem to listen to me. Mother, you don't have to be polite with him." Stroking the little boy's head, Bai Yan turned her gaze to Liu Han: "I will give you another chance. Are you sure what you just said is true?" Liu Han's expression changed slightly. What did this woman mean? However, thinking about how the Sacred Land had been extremely chaotic recently, Liu Han gritted his teeth. "I never lie!" All these years, Liu Han had received many bribes. Previously, he was lucky enough to escape the puishment. Now that the Sacred Land had started to clean again, he had to make plans for himself. The reason why he agreed to Lin Yahan was not because he had accepted Lin Yahan's bribe, but because he wanted to use this matter to prove his innocence. Look, a really beautiful woman was offered to him, and he could say no confidently. Because he values himself, he wouldn't agree to take other bribes. He thought the other respected members would notice and praise him. Maybe this could help him move forward... "Good, very good. I have already given you a chance. Since you are still like this, then..." "No matter what the consequences are, you are the one who brought it upon yourself!" Seeing Bai Yan's cold expression, Liu Han was stunned. For some reason, he felt a sense of unease. This feeling made his heart beat uncontrollably. Liu Han is a subordinate of the core disciple, Zi Qinghong. In this competition, he is in charge of the weapons needed in the competition. "Then when I wanted to bribe you, did I ask you to give me the best weapon?" Bai Yan smiled. Liu Han nodded blankly. "That's right. Not only did you ask me to distribute excellent weapons to you, you even asked me to tamper with other weapons. I would never do such a thing to betray the Sacred Land!" No one was allowed to carry weapons when they entered the holy land. Even the weapons needed for the competition were distributed by the Sacred Land to ensure fairness. However... Bai Yan suddenly chuckled: "You just said that my strength is weak. Did you forget one thing? In the face of absolute strength, even a divine weapon is nothing." The Divine Weapon was indeed very powerful, but for example, a novice warrior engaging in combat with a high-ranking expert would find it challenging to harness the full potential of the weapon, even if she possesses one. Therefore, although weapons were important, real strength was more important! Liu Han was stunned. He even forgot to ask Bai Yan why she knew he was assigned to be in charge of the weapon. After all, only the core members of the Sacred Land knew about this. The others only knew that he was also involved in this competition. "Qing Hong hasn't come yet? Go and get him to see me immediately!" The corners of Bai Yan's mouth curled up in a cold sneer. In this competition, other than Chu Yiyi, Zheng Qi also sent two core disciples to assist. And this Liu Han is one of Qinghong's subordinates! Furthermore, she had never expected that Liu Han would treat her as a participating disciple, and even frame her. Chapter 849 She Is the Mysterious Judge (1) Right at this moment, a sweet voice came from the back of the crowd, causing the noisy crowd to suddenly return to silence. "What are you all doing here?" Behind the crowd, a young girl dressed in a yellow dress furrowed her brow and addressed the whole situation impatiently. Upon seeing her, the gathered individuals dispersed. The disciples in the Sacred Land had never seen Bai Yan before, yet not a single people was unaware of the "witch" who bore the title of the little Princess. Therefore, upon seeing her arrival, Liu Han no longer confronted Bai Yan. A smile appeared on his handsome face. "Little Princess, Senior Brother Qinghong, Senior Brother Changling, you've all arrived? When does the competition begin?" "Now." Chu Yiyi playfully raised her eyebrow and turned her smiling eyes towards Bai Yan. Just as she was about to walk over to Bai Yan, Liu Han's voice sounded from the side. "Little Princess, are we not waiting for the referee?" Chu Yiyi came to a sudden stop, turning her head with a confused look as she furrowed her brow. "Isn't she already here? Who else are you waiting for?" These people are really strange. Bai Yan is clearly already here. Who else are they waiting for? Liu Han widened his eyes. The referee had already arrived. Why hadn't he received the news? As if she didn't see the shocked expression in Liu Han, Chu Yiyi once again turned around and walked towards Bai Yan with a big smile on her face. "Bai Yan, I'm late. Can the competition begin?" Liu Han, who was still searching for the mysterious referee in the crowd, suddenly saw Chu Yiyi walk in front of Bai Yan. Hearing her words, he instantly thought of a possibility. This possibility caused his body to freeze, and his face instantly turned pale. His tightly clenched fist trembled slightly, and his eyes widened in disbelief. "Senior Brother Qing Hong, this woman is..." The young man who followed Chu Yiyi stood up and glanced at Liu Han. He obviously did not know why Liu Han's reaction was so intense, but he still nodded. "She is the referee. You don't know?" His voice was neither light nor soft, but in the quiet gathering, it hit him like a sudden heavy blow, shaking his hearts. Huo Yun's body shook a few times, and she needed the support of the servant girl beside her to avoid falling to the ground. However... Her pale fingertips tightly gripped her palms, using pain to numb herself. This woman was not a disciple who had come to participate in the competition, but the mysterious referee that the Sacred Land had found this time?  Didn't cousin say that he had seen all the high-ranking disciples in the sacred land? Why didn't he see this woman?  "Wait." Seeing that Chu Yiyi was about to pull Bai Yan into the judge's seat, she raised her hand to stop her actions. Her eyes swept over to Liu Han and a cold smile appeared on her lips. "You just said that my talent is low?" This sentence stunned the confused Chu Yiyi. Her bright eyes widened in surprise and her gaze slowly turned towards Liu Han. If Bai Yan's talent is low, then there isn't a genius in this world? Bai Yan continued to take two steps closer to Liu Han: "You said that I did not hesitate to bribe you in order to be selected in this competition, right?" Chu Yiyi's eyes widened in surprise. She had only arrived a moment late, how could such a big thing happen? Chapter 850 She Was the Mysterious Judge (2) "I..." Liu Han was forced to take two steps back, his forehead now covered in layers of cold sweat. His legs trembled uncontrollably, and he came close to collapsing to his knees in sheer fear. Before Liu Han could find a suitable excuse, Chu Yiyi's furious voice rang out. This time, it directly scared Liu Han to the point of kneeling on the ground. A smell of urine spread throughout the entire venue. Liu Han, how dare you! It wasn't easy for Bai Yan to agree to be the judge this time, but you actually dare to frame her! Moreover, with Bai Yan's talent, none of you combined can match her! How dare you criticize her for having low talent?" Who gave you the courage? "Bai... "Bai Yan?" Just now, Liu Han gave it much thought. But, upon hearing Yiyi's words, he suddenly felt a sense of familiarity with that name, as if he had heard it somewhere before. Soon after, his eyes slowly fell on the little boy next to Bai Yan. His eyes were wide open with fear and panic. Not long ago, he heard rumors that the Lord of Sacred Island is the granddaughter of the head of Medicine Sect. She also has an extremely cute son by her side! It was just that he had only heard of her existence and had never really seen her in person before, so for a moment, he would not think of this woman's true identity. If she really is Bai Yan, then what he said just now was actually so ridiculous!  Liu Han trembled all over and buried his head in the ground, not daring to say a word.  Everyone was silent as well, but the gazes they directed at Bai Yan just now were all directed at Liu Han, their eyes full of disdain and mockery.  This woman's status in the Sacred land was obviously extremely high. Otherwise, the little Princess would not be willing to be her assistant. However, Liu Han was just an inner sect disciple. He was not even a core disciple. How could he dare to claim that she bribed him with beauty in order to be selected to the Sacred Land? Ridiculous, too ridiculous! "Little Princess, I know I was wrong. I really know I was wrong," "It was Lin Yahan who asked me to do this. I am just a helper. The real culprit is him." "Lin Yahan?" "Who is this Lin Yahan?" Chu Yiyi frowned as she stroked her chin. "He..." He is also an inner disciple of the Sacred Land, and he is from the same sect as me. "Oh, then cripple him and drive him out of the Sacred land. Our Sacred land does not need this kind of person." Chu Yiyi waved her hand and decided the fate of these two. After leaving these words behind, she turned to Bai Yan with a smile and gently blinked her eyes: "Bai Yan, is this punishment satisfactory?"  "Just do as you see fit." "No," Chu Yiyi pursed her lips, "My father told me to learn from you and listen to you.  If my father knew that I made the decision on my own, he would definitely beat me up." In fact, the meaning behind Chu Yiyi's words was very obvious. She, the little Princess of the Sacred Land, needed to listen to Bai Yan's words. A mere disciple like you dares to find trouble with her? Do you believe that if she tells her father, then it won't be as simple as just crippling your strength and kicking you out of the Sacred Land. Among the crowd, Lin Yahan, who had been observing the situation the entire time, turned around and wanted to escape. However, before he could escape, he was blocked by a group of people. One of them struck him in the chest, sending him right in front of Bai Yan and Chu Yiyi. Chapter 851 She Is the Mysterious Judge (3) Chu Yiyi placed her hands on her hips and arrogantly looked down at Lin Yahan who was lying on the ground. She smiled sinisterly, "Before this, Bai Yan had Elder Zheng Qi clean up the Sacred Land once. I didn't expect there to be such a dishonest individual. The competition in our Sacred Land is extremely fair. We will never allow any favoritism or cheating!" "Sister Chu," Bai Xiachen took a few steps forward with a bright smile in his eyes, "Lin Yahan is the cousin of that bad auntie. Moreover, that bad auntie and I had a dispute outside the sacred land. I suspect that everything was directed by her." He raised his chin and pointed at Huo Yun. His delicate little face was still young, but it had already revealed a domineering expression. Huo Yun took two steps back with a pale face. Her eyes were filled with fear. She hurriedly looked at Lin Yahan with a pleading gaze. Her eyes were filled with tears. "No, this has nothing to do with my cousin," Lin Yahan gritted his teeth and said, "My cousin is innocent. I acted on my own. I colluded with her maid! I just wanted to vent my anger for my cousin. I hope that the little Princess can give me a chance." If his scheme was exposed, the biggest punishment would be leaving the Sacred Land. However, if his cousin was exposed, even if the Sacred Land did not do anything to her, after returning to the Fiery Blaze Sect , his cousin's father would not let her off easily! Offending the Sacred Land, the Fiery Blaze Sect would be finished for the rest of their lives! "Plop!" The maid also knelt down and kowtowed hard. There were dark blue marks on her forehead. Fresh blood oozed out from her forehead and flowed to the ground. "All of this was conspired by me and Young Master Lin Yahan. It has nothing to do with the young miss. I beg you to let the young miss go. She is innocent." Her eyes were filled with tears and her face was pale, but she seemed to face death with determination. If she took on all the blame, at most, she would die. If something happened to the young miss, then her younger brother in the Fiery Blaze Sect would also not be able to escape death. Therefore, she must not implicate young lady. Seeing the two of them putting all the blame on themselves, Huo Yun quietly breathed a sigh of relief. She gritted her teeth and stepped forward to kneel down in front of Bai Yan. With tears in her eyes, she kowtowed to her. "Miss, I know that you have a deep misunderstanding about me. This time, it was indeed me who failed to discipline the maid properly. My cousin..." It was his intense love for me that drove him to do such a thing. But I have always maintained my integrity. I won't confess to something I haven't done! I plead with Miss Bai not to let your son frame me again. Her words were earnest and pleading, as if she had really been wronged. Chu Yiyi turned her head to look at Bai Yan. To be honest, compared to this woman, she trusted Bai Xiachen more. "You want to stay and continue the competition?" "Is that right?" Bai Yan's lips curved into a smile as she stared at the girl kneeling in front of her. Huo Yun's face turned pale. Her cousin had already been defeated. If she continued to participate in this competition, she will be doomed to lose. But now that things had come to this, she could not back down.  "Yes." "Alright. Take off the jade pendant on your neck and I will allow you to continue the competition." "What?" Huo Yun's eyes widened, her face turned pale like snow, and she looked really scared. "How did she know?" "Miss Bai, this is what my mother left for me before she died," Huo Yun lowered her head and hid the panic in her eyes. She bit her lips and said, "She once told me not to take off the jade pendant. Otherwise, it would be disrespectful to her. Would Miss Bai want to force me?" Chapter 852 She Is the Mysterious Judge (4) Despite any secret favoritism and cheat among the disciples of Sacred Land, they wouldn't dare to act openly. In addition, they were in public, so it was even more impossible for this woman to force her to take off the jade pendant. Therefore, this was the reason why Fire Cloud dared to ignore the situation. Unfortunately, she had forgotten that the person in front of her was one of the Sacred Land's little Princess, and the other was someone that even the little Princess had to obey. Therefore, when Huo Yun finished speaking, Chu Yiyi stepped forward and raised her hand to tear off the jade pendant on her neck. With a loud bang, she smashed it to the ground. "If Bai Yan asked you to take off the jade pendant, then you should take it off. Why are you talking so much nonsense?" She glared fiercely at Huo Yun, her tone void of any sympathy. Everyone was taken aback by Chu Yiyi's behavior and looked at Huo Yun with sympathy. However, due to Chu Yiyi's identity, no one dared to voice dissent. However... Huo Yun had already said that this jade pendant was a relic left behind by her mother. To her, it was something that could remind her of her mother.  However, the little Princess of the Sacred Land was so overbearing that she directly smashed her jade pendant.  Huo Yun's once normal complexion was replaced by a  deathly pale, and it was obvious that she was extremely sad.  In fact, Huo Yun's pale face was not due to her sadness, but because she was scared. She stared blankly at the jade pendant that had been smashed on the ground, and a hint of panic appeared in her eyes. It was over. This time, she was done for. "Eh, that's not right. Something did not add up. I heard that Fire Flame Sect's eldest sister, Huo Yun, has already reached the regal level. Other than the three major forces, she is the most talented person in the world. Why is her strength showing that she is an Earth Level Mid Rank?" The talent of the earth rank was not high, but it was not low either. Back then, when the Crown Prince of Liuhuo Kingdom, Nangong Yi, broke through to the earth rank, he could already be considered a genius.  Nangong Yibi was the Crown Prince of Liuhuo Kingdom. He was just a member of the royal family. His cultivation talent could not be compared to a second-rate sect. Therefore, with Huo Yun's talent, he could not be considered a genius. Moreover, in order to promote Huo Yun's talent, the Huoyan Sect had put in a lot of effort. They even called her a top genius. To be able to break through to the regal level at such a young age, she is indeed a genius. But now this seem not to be the case....   This genius was actually fake!  "Yiyi," "As far as I know, those who enter the Sacr3d Land must be at least a high-level earth-step cultivator! If she can't even reach this threshold, how can she enter the Sacred Land?" Bai Yan lightly curled her lips. Although Zheng Qi had sent the invitations to the various sects, if one wanted to successfully enter the Sacred Land, one still had to pass certain selection. Only when one's strength reached the lowest level would one be qualified to enter the Sacred Land with an invitation. How did a person who hadn't even achieved the lowest goal enter the Sacred Land? This question was probably worth pondering over. "Qinghong, I need an explanation. " As Bai Yan directed her question, Chu Yiyi once again threw the question to the two people following closely behind her. Her eyes were wide open, her hands on her hips as she aggressively asked. Qing Hong touched the cold sweat on his forehead, "The person who went to the various sects to select was Elder Lin You." "Lin You? Who is he?" Chu Yiyi asked angrily. "He is.." Qing Hong glanced at Lin Yahan who was kneeling on the ground, "It's Lin Yahan's master." The crowd was in an uproar. The gazes that had gathered on Huo Yun earlier had once again landed on Lin Yahan.  Lin Yahan trembled all over. He understood that this time, he and his master were doomed! Chapter 853 She Is the Mysterious Judge (5) "Tell him to come see me!" Chu Yiyi furrowed her brows, looking a bit annoyed. Just as the guard beside her accepted the order and left, she hurriedly added, "Wait, don't bring him here. I don't want to see him. Just send him to Elder Zheng Qi and the others and let them deal with him." "Yes, little Princess." The guard accepted the order and left. Her words basically confirmed the fate of Lin Yahan and his disciple. "You," Chu Yiyi pointed at another guard beside her and raised her chin, "Drag Liu Han and Lin Yahan down to face the punishment! It's fine if you guys play favoritism, but you dare to scheme against Bai Yan. Want me to let you off? Dream on."  Lin Yahan collapsed to the ground. He closed his eyes slightly and then slowly opened them. He looked at Huo Yun's pale face and smiled bitterly. This time, he would not be able to help his cousin. "Little Princess, Miss Bai Yan." Liu Han stepped forward in panic, kneeling down in front of them once again, and hitting his head hard on the floor. He didn't even know that he got cuts on his head. "I know I was wrong. I really know I messed up. Please spare me this time. I won't dare to do it again in the future." "Spare you?" Bai Yan sneered, her indifferent gaze fixed on the young man kneeling on the ground, "If I weren't the referee for this competition, then wouldn't your scheme have succeeded?" Liu Han was stunned for a moment. Indeed, if Bai Yan wasn't the referee and was just an ordinary disciple, perhaps she would have been chased out of the Sacred Land by him and her reputation would have been ruined. "So, if it was another person, you would know what the outcome would be." Bai Yan ruthlessly stepped on Liu Han's head, her voice cold and harsh, "And it's precisely because of your favoritism that the Sacred Land lost so many outstanding disciples. How can you get away with it?" Whether it was the Illusion Sect, the Medicine Sect, or this Sacred Land, they were all her home. She would not allow anyone to bully others in her place, and even more so, she would not allow the Sacred Land to miss out on geniuses because of these people's actions. Today, she would make an example of Liu Han and bring peace and just to Sacred Land. Bang! Bai Yan kicked Liu Han in the head. In an instant, Liu Han's body was sent flying and crashed into a nearby pillar. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his face was deathly pale. There was no color on his face at all.  His eyes widened in fear as he watched a figure in red approach him, but he was powerless to resist. Thunk! Bai Yan hooked her finger around Liu Han's arm and squeezed it hard. A sickening sound was heard, followed by a spurt of fresh blood. Immediately after, a heart-wrenching scream resounded through the sky, sending shivers down everyone's spine. "Our Sacred Land has always been fair and just. We will never allow anything like this to happen!" "If I ever find out about this again, he will be your fate." Bai Yan's indifferent gaze swept across the crowd. Bai Yan retrieved her sleeve and shot out a ray of the sword toward Liu Han's Dantian (located in the abdomen, the key centers for the cultivation of energy within the body). In an instant, his Dantian exploded and his body collapsed to the ground in a messy state. Previously, even though the three masters had cleaned up the Sacred Land, it was a pity that the warnings were not enough. They only expelled the rebels. Hence, there were still people who were willing to take the risk! For some treasures, they did not hesitate to commit acts of favoritism again.
