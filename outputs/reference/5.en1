Chapter Four Hundred and Thirty-Seven Hit an Iron Plate At this moment, the moment the blue-silver golden light circle came, the light of the fire dimmed for a moment before it was sucked downwards. However, the flame gourd was clearly not that easy to deal with. It fiercely sucked upwards, actually taking away a portion of the flames. Then, with a whoosh, it shot to the side, rushing out of the coverage of the blue-silver golden light circle. These changes were extremely fast, making one feel overwhelmed. This person is not easy to deal with! We have to take him down as soon as possible, or the law-enforcement officers will come.  The fire gourd spurted fire downwards. The woman appeared again with a murderous look in her eyes. "What are you doing?" Just as she was speaking, a golden light flashed under her feet, and a beautiful light pattern quietly appeared. The woman's body suddenly stiffened. Tang Wulin wrapped his Blue-silver Grass around her. Ye Xinglan pointed her Star God Sword at her opponent's chest. Xie Xie was already behind her, his Light Dragon Dagger aiming for her neck. Everything was a trap! Was there anything better than Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Chain against a single opponent? The Starlight Chain was a heaven-defying existence! Just as everyone heaved a sigh of relief and thought that they had taken down their opponent, a sudden change occurred! The Star God Sword had already arrived in front of them, and the Light Dragon Dagger on her back had already reached her neck. When her life was threatened, the woman's eyes suddenly lit up. A resonant phoenix cry sounded from her body. Immediately after, an incomparably powerful soul force instantly burst out from her body. It was as if she had been stimulated by something. Under her clothes, circles of fiery red light flashed. Those were rings of light, but they looked like they were in her clothes. They were on her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, knees, and so on. The moment these fiery red lights appeared, an incomparably powerful soul force suddenly erupted from the woman's body. It was unknown how many times more powerful than before. The soul force rose and turned into a huge ring of fire that surged out. A layer of fine golden lines appeared on the flame gourd in the air. The flame gourd that was originally only one foot tall directly rose to two feet, becoming several times larger. Powerful fire essence fluctuations erupted, sending Tang Wulin and the others flying. Moreover, the flames burned their soul power like maggots in their bones. The phoenix cry became louder, and the woman released a dignified aura. Then, dark red armor quickly appeared and covered her entire body. On her head was a phoenix helmet that covered her head. The dark red armor extended to both sides. The beautiful flowing line extended downwards, outlining the characteristics of a woman. Soft lines covered her shoulders, covering her entire arm. Dark red flame patterns covered the armor. On the breastplate was a golden-red phoenix pattern. The armor was not particularly beautiful, but under the cover of this armor, the woman's aura had risen several levels. "Battle armor!" Tang Wulin blurted out, a bitter smile on his face. Battle armor! Yes! This is a battle armor! Judging from its complexity and aura fluctuations, it should be a one-word battle armor. The rings of light around the woman are tools to store battle armor. A one-word battle armor can't be fused into a battle armor master. Even so, this was a complete set of one-word battle armor! This meant that a woman with a five-ring cultivation base had been directly promoted to a seven-ring master. Yan Feng was furious. She had been in a good mood today. She had gone to the Spirit Pagoda to register herself as a one-word battle armor master. A battle armor master was a top existence that any organization was willing to provide for. When she first signed the contract, the Spirit Pagoda had promised her a series of benefits. She was only twenty-seven years old this year and was one of the youngest battle armor masters in Spirit Heaven City. Her future was limitless. The Spirit Pagoda had promised that it would provide her with a large amount of resources in the future to help her become a two-word battle armor master. Once she became a two-word battle armor master, she would become a true battle armor master, and she would have a place in the entire continent. But who would have thought that just as she left the Spirit Pagoda in high spirits, she would be surrounded and attacked by a group of young fellows. Moreover, their abilities weren't weak. If she didn't use her battle armor, she would have really fallen for it. She didn't know that Tang Wulin and the others had no ill intentions, but the Star God Sword and Light Dragon Dagger made her feel threatened by death. At this moment, Wu Zhangkong's voice rang in the ears of Tang Wulin and the others. "As long as you defeat her, you will pass this city." The corner of Tang Wulin's mouth twitched. Teacher Wu, oh Teacher Wu, you have a black-bellied side to you! This is a complete one-word battle armor master, equivalent to a seven-ringed Soul Sage. Can we win against her? Before he could think further, Yan Feng had already made her move. Her powerful soul power surged and she pointed at Tang Wulin with her right hand. The fire gourd above her head immediately spat out a line of fire and instantly appeared in front of Tang Wulin. At this point, he could only give it a try. Explaining was undoubtedly useless. Looking at the other party's eyes, he knew that the other party was already enraged. They didn't have the right to talk about this! They had to fight her first. Tang Wulin took a deep breath. The three purple soul rings on his body suddenly disappeared, and a golden halo appeared. The halo bloomed, and his right arm swelled. Golden dragon scales spread out, and at the same time, dazzling stars condensed in his right hand. The hand guard of battle armor appeared. How could he not go all out against a true battle armor master? "Battle armor?" Yan Feng was also shocked when she saw the battle armor on Tang Wulin's right hand. The word 'impossible' instantly appeared in her mind! How old was he? Moreover, she clearly saw that Tang Wulin's battle armor had emerged from his body. Could it be that this was a two-word battle armor? Although it was only a piece of battle armor, it was simply unimaginable for someone at his age to possess battle armor. When she first had her first piece of battle armor, she was already twenty-one years old. How could she be called a genius? After all these years of hard work, she had finally become a true one-word battle armor master. But how old were these little fellows? As Tang Wulin activated it, the others also quickly moved. Xu Lizhi had already retreated far away. One bun after another flew out of his hands. Light steamed bun, Blood Devouring Bean, each hand with one. Tang Wulin had his left hand behind his back. He took the two buns and stuffed them into his mouth without any hesitation. He had to finish the battle quickly. Even if it was just one-word battle armor, it would help a soul master recover their soul power quickly after they had gathered all of them. They didn't stand a chance against her in a prolonged battle. He stomped his left foot on the ground, causing a loud boom to ring out. Tang Wulin shot forward like a copper arrow, his right arm blocking in front of him. The blood in his body surged, and the Golden Dragon King's aura surged out. His eyes turned completely golden, and the blood and qi fluctuations in his body were extremely fierce. His right golden dragon claw blocked in front of him, forcefully resisting the opponent's flames as he charged forward. As the captain and the war soul master of the Attack Department, he couldn't retreat even half a step. Only by blocking the front would his companions have a chance. Under the stimulation of the Blood Devouring Bean, his soul power and blood energy instantly erupted to the peak. Light golden scales appeared on his skin. His right hand, right arm, and right chest were exceptionally beautiful. He has a twin martial spirit? Yan Feng was stunned. "Humph!" She didn't dodge at all. The flame gourd above her head suddenly spun, turning into a stream of flames that shot over Tang Wulin's head, covering his companions and blocking the others. She wanted to isolate Tang Wulin and deal with this little fellow who was obviously the leader of the other party first. The golden dragon claw flashed like lightning in front of the other party. Yan Feng raised her right hand and formed a fist, facing it head-on. Seeing that the two sides were about to collide, the dragon roar inside Tang Wulin suddenly became excited. A huge golden dragon head over two feet in diameter appeared without warning, directly devouring Yan Feng's right arm. Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens! Although Tang Wulin hadn't been able to break through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King after eating the red jade shrimp that day, he had improved greatly, allowing him to become even more proficient in controlling the Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens. Yan Feng was also shocked. She felt a powerful force coming from the front, and then she punched out. The flames seemed to have been devoured, and the golden dragon claw grabbed her right hand like a large pincer. The golden dragon claw exerted force, and Yan Feng's one-word battle armor lit up. The flame patterns on her armor seemed to come alive, especially the fire phoenix on her chest. It actually moved, turning into a phoenix and charging at Tang Wulin. This was. Chapter Four Hundred and Thirty-Eight Sister, I Think This Is a Misunderstanding The flame gourd above her head got itself free at the moment. Yan Feng's soul ring flashed, and a ball of golden red flames like a substantive fireball shot out, heading directly for Tang Wulin's chest. This was battle armor! A battle armor that could attack and defend! Tang Wulin could clearly feel the strength and abilities of his golden dragon claw were instantly distributed to every corner of the battle armor of his opponent and neutralized after injecting into it. Even the shattering ability couldn't be stimulated. Then there came the powerful counterattack from the opponent. Tang Wulin, with the aid of his Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens and hand guard battle armor, was at most equivalent to a four-ringed Soul Sect master, while the opponent before him was a genuine one-word battle armor master!      He exerted force in his right arm  in an attempt to send his opponent flying. In terms of strength, Tang Wulin was very confident in himself. At the same time, a strand of Blue Silver Grass drilled out from beneath him. It propped itself up on the ground and changed his direction by force, attempting to dodge the phoenix and fireball. However, these two attacks were actually able to change directions and followed suit to catch up with him. At this moment, an ice spear silently arrived and stabbed into the fire phoenix. The fire phoenix instantly exploded, and the powerful explosion pushed Tang Wulin to fly backwards. His soul power wasn't on the same level as his opponent! Even with the support of the Blood Devouring Bean, Tang Wulin felt as if his internal organs were set on fire. Sword threads crossed to form a net, blocking the golden-red fireball that was chasing him. The fireball exploded too, and Ye Xinglan let out a muffled groan. In terms of combat experience and combat skills, Tang Wulin and the others weren't any weaker than Yan Feng, but the problem was that the difference in soul power was significant. Yan Feng possessed the one-word battle armor, so it was difficult for Tang Wulin and the others to break through her defense. Xie Xie silently appeared behind Yan Feng, his Light Dragon Dagger and Shadow Dragon Dagger stabbed into Yan Feng's shoulders. However, the battle armor, which defended the whole body of Yan Feng, only flashed, and in the next moment, a layer of fiery red light exploded, sending him flying. If they couldn't break her defense, how could they continue to fight? Yan Feng quickly took control of the situation. At this moment, she suddenly felt a sense of threat. Without warning, a ball of light appeared in her line of sight. The ball of light was dazzling and was presented in four colors blue, red, yellow, and green. The four colors of light circulated. The ball of light was only the size of a fist, and it was about to reach her in a moment. Yan Feng didn't dare to be careless. Her fourth soul ring lit up, and the flame gourd on her head suddenly expanded to a still larger size. A series of golden-red fireballs shot out. These golden-red fireballs were like a barrage of bullets, instantly blocking the path of the four-colored ball of light. A violent explosion followed, and for a moment, the air was filled with blazing elemental storms. Tang Wulin had already landed on the ground. He made the Mysterious Heaven Method work to calm the heat in his body. His body was strong and he wasn't injured, but there was no way he could continue to fight this battle! Now he could only count on Gu Yue. It proved true that a one-word battle armor could withstand a test. The elemental storm raged for five to six seconds before it finally stopped. Yan Feng stood there, unmoving. Golden red flame light circled the battle armor, even without any trace of weakening, and the flame gourd above her head was once again aimed at Tang Wulin. "Sister, I think this is a misunderstanding." Tang Wulin said with a forced smile. At this moment, an ear-piercing alarm sounded. Not far away, three figures were flying towards them. Surprisingly, they were three mechas. However, unlike when they were in Heaven Dou City, these three mechas were all yellow. There were no purple mechas. "Stop!" An electronic voice shouted. Yan Feng, who was about to attack, had no choice but to stop. The mouth of the flame gourd rose up. She snorted coldly and glared at Tang Wulin. Then, she was surprised to find that the boy who had taken the initiative to attack her earlier had a look of grief and indignation on his face. The three mechas descended from the sky. The yellow standard mechas, with a ten-meter-tall body, immediately separated the two sides. "Waah!" Xu Xiaoyan hugged Ye Xinglan and burst into tears. Xie Xie lowered his head, with a lonely expression on his face. Ye Xinglan was a little dazed. Xu Lizhi crouched on the ground while Gu Yue was expressionless, only a hint of a smile flickered in her eyes. Tang Wulin puffed out his chest and pulled Gu Yue behind him, the grief and indignation on his face deepening. "Law-enforcement officer, you came at the right time. Please save us. If you were one step late, we would have been burned to death by her." "What?" Yan Feng didn't even have time to react. They were the ones who attacked first! An electronic voice came from inside one mecha, "What exactly is going on?" Why did you, a one-word battle armor master, attack these youths? Because Yan Feng had just registered as a one-word battle armor master at the Spirit Pagoda, the enforcers didn't know her. However, when it spoke the words "one-word battle armor master", it was clearly full of vigilance. Although they had three mechas, they were yellow. mechas With their cultivation, they were no match for a one-word battle armor master. "Don't listen to their complaints. They were clearly the ones who attacked me first." Yan Feng said angrily. Tang Wulin blinked his beautiful eyes. He said with an expression of terror, "W-what did you say? We attacked you? You're a one-word battle armor master! We're just a few insignificant soul masters, Uncle, I'm fourteen years old this year, and the youngest among my friends is only thirteen. Do you think we dare to fight a one-word battle armor master? Yan Feng got furious. Her body trembled as she said, "You're slandering me. You were the one who attacked me first. At that time, you didn't know that I was a one-word battle armor master. We don't even know each other." "If we don't know each other, why would we attack you?" Tang Wulin asked without hesitation. I clearly heard you say that you've just become a one-word battle armor master and want to test your strength. Then when you saw us, you suddenly slapped me. That was why we had no choice but to defend ourselves. My teacher taught us that with greater ability comes greater responsibility. But as a one-word battle armor master, you bully the weak. Bullying us children, how could you still have the nerve to invert black and white? Xu Xiaoyan cried even louder, her entire body hanging over Ye Xinglan. Ye Xinglan turned away. Xie Xie sighed. After being together with Tang Wulin for a long time, he improved significantly in his acting skills. The law-enforcement officers were stunned by the two sides' words, but there was no doubt that the three law-enforcement officers subconsciously tended to believe Tang Wulin and his group. This was the advantage of being young. No matter how one looked at it, it didn't seem like they would take the initiative to provoke a one-word battle armor master. "All of you, follow us back to the Spirit Pagoda. We will retrieve the surveillance footage, and then determine who's right and who's wrong." The leader of the law-enforcement officers said in a deep voice. "Alright!" Tang Wulin answered without hesitation. Yan Feng gritted her teeth. "Little bastard, when the evidence is placed in front of you, you will no longer be able to call a stag a horse." She was really angry! "Let's go." The three mechas turned around and surrounded Yan Feng. "Please put away your battle armor first." This clearly aimed at preventing her from sudden escape! Yan Feng was furious. "Are you blind? Can't you tell right from wrong? What if I don't accept it?" Lights on the three mechas flashed at the same time, and the three soul guide cannons were already aimed at her. "Uncle, did you see that? She was just this arrogant and domineering." As Tang Wulin spoke, he retreated as if he was afraid of being caught by the fallout. Yan Feng couldn't hold it in any longer. "I'll burn you to death!" She roared, shaking her body as she charged toward Tang Wulin. The three mechas weren't to be trifled with. Without the slightest hesitation, they fired three Soul Guide Cannons. The three Soul Guide shells exploded. Chapter Four Hundred and Thirty-Nine So Handsome That Her Heart Raced The Spirit Pagoda enforcers had been training for a long time. They used the safest method to deal with competent opponents. The three shells weren't aimed at Yan Feng. Instead, they shot into the air. The three shells collided with each other and immediately burst out with a strong energy storm. Even though Yan Feng was equipped with the battle armor, her body was wobbly being impacted by the intense energy. The three mechas rose into the air at the same time. The three Soul Guide Cannons fired at her at a crazy speed, not caring about the energy consumption. Holding back against one-word battle armor masters meant disaster! Moreover, the leading law-enforcement officer had already called for reinforcements. They only needed to hold on for a while. Only now did Tang Wulin and the others see how powerful these law-enforcement officers were. When they were in Heaven Dou City before, if they hadn't lured the law-enforcement officers away from the start, and prevented them from cooperating with each other, their journey there would not be that easy. The three mechas worked closely with each other. They fired the Soul Guide Cannons desperately to create a barrage, leaving the opponent with no place to dodge. Even though Yan Feng possessed powerful fighting strength, that strength mainly counted on Flame Gourd, the Martial Soul. She had just mastered the one-word battle armor, and still needed to improve in the combination of her martial soul and battle armor. So she was actually suppressed for a moment. Tang Wulin surely would not let go of such a good opportunity. This was his style. He turned around and ran with his fellows, shouting, "Be careful, everyone. Don't get hurt by the shells. Let's stay away. Uncle, do your best!" Xie Xie ran faster than any of them. Like a wisp of smoke, he leapt onto the Soul Guide Car that was parked not too far away. The others quickly got into the car, and even Xu Lizhi became more nimble. Xie Xie floored the gas pedal, and the Soul Guide Car let out an ear-piercing roar, instantly sped up and went away. At this moment, the three law-enforcement officers were all focused on Yan Feng. The sound of the Soul Guiding Cannons was far louder than the sound of a car being fired. They didn't even notice that Tang Wulin and the others had already run away. Yan Feng's eyes were affected by light from the energy, so she didn't notice that either. Before Tang Wulin urged him, Xie Xie had already driven the car through streets, and sped up. "We picked the wrong opponent. How unlucky we are. "Didn't you say that battle armor masters are extremely rare? Why did we encounter one so easily?" No trace of tears was seen on Xu Xiaoyan's face. Tang Wulin smiled bitterly. "Looks like we have to change our method. It brought in many uncertainties, and will give offense. This isn't a good idea! If this goes on, we'll probably be listed as the most unwelcome persons in the Spirit Pagoda. Gu Yue said, "That won't happen. You got me." Xie Xie sighed. "Boss, you are really getting more amazing. Your acting skills are awesome!" Tang Wulin said snappily, "Do you think I want it? That battle armor master possesses strength, so powerful that even the mechas can't defeat her." If I hadn't spoken that way at the time, we might have gotten caught and locked in Spirit Pagoda. In that case, even if we finally managed to find a way to escape, we would waste a lot of time. I will find a way to apologize to her in the future." The Spirit Pagoda. "[Sound of slapping]" Yan Feng slapped the metal table in front of her, and sparks flashed. "Now you all understand, right? Those little bastards are liars. Did they attack me first? Looking at the image displayed on the screen, the three law-enforcement officers were speechless. A moment ago, Yan Feng finally managed to escape from the encirclement of the three mechas. She saw that Tang Wulin and the others had already disappeared. She was angry and wanted to chase after them. Then, the law-enforcement officers' reinforcements arrived. It was three purple mechas, and they immediately surrounded her. One-word battle armor masters were powerful. But Yan Feng was unable to fight six mechas alone. She was able to break out of the encirclement. But in that case, she would be regarded as the offender bullying the youths! So, she directly chose to surrender and was brought back to watch the video footage. "Sorry, Miss Yan Feng. We have also confirmed your identity. We are really sorry about what happened to you before. We didn't expect these children to be so cunning at such a young age." Yan Feng said angrily, "Then what are you waiting for? Hurry up and catch them." A middle-aged man, who led the law-enforcement officers said awkwardly. "I'm afraid that we are unable to do that. Although the Spirit Pagoda has a high status, it is not an alliance law enforcement organization. If we send people to hunt them down, we will likely touch the bottom line of the federal government. This will bring in trouble for us. We have already reported this incident to the government and can only count on them to chase after the youths. Moreover, frankly speaking, we don't have sufficient evidence of this. Most importantly, you have not suffered any damage either. Even if they are caught, there is no way to give them any punishment. Even in the extreme case, they will just be charged for disorderly behavior and will be locked up in the law enforcement office for a few days." Then Yan Feng calmed down somewhat. That's right! She hadn't suffered any injuries, and convicting them for this reason was not easy. They may tell the truth when they said they were 13 or 14 years old. Those under the age of 18 would be protected by the law of minors. In this case, even arresting them was probably difficult. In the end, their parents might be informed, and they came to pay a fine and took the youths home to discipline them strictly. Those little things are too hateful! "Miss Yan Feng, please calm down. We apologize to you about this first." All law-enforcement officers stood up at the same time and bowed slightly to her. When Yan Feng saw them like this, her anger dissipated. She waved her hand and said, "Forget it. I would let them pay a price if I met them again one day. "If there's nothing else, I'm leaving." The law-enforcement officers walked her out of the Spirit Pagoda. She was a battle armor master and a battle armor master who had joined the Spirit Pagoda. The law-enforcement officers respected her very much. Perhaps one day, she would become their immediate superior! After leaving the Spirit Pagoda, Yan Feng looked around, trying to find Tang Wulin and the others. But they had run away long! At this moment, she suddenly fixed her gaze in one direction and looked. She saw a man who looked about the same age as her. He was tall and slender and dressed in white. His clothes were somewhat retro. He wore a long white robe and had long hair hanging down behind his head. His entire body exuded a cold aura. Yan Feng's martial soul was a type of fire. Her temper became what it now was partly because of this. But, when she saw this man, she suddenly felt that the anger in her heart had inexplicably decreased. He was so handsome! She subconsciously gulped. There was no girl who didn't like handsome guys, especially this kind of figure and appearance. In addition, with just a glance, Yan Feng was surprised to find that she couldn't see through this person's cultivation, but she was sure that he was a Soul Master. A Soul Master who is stronger than me? It seemed he was a type of ice. She was a soul master with a type of fire, so was most sensitive to the type of ice. Is he walking up to me? Yan Feng's heart began to race. At first, she was still a little uncertain, but soon she found that the man was walking straight in her direction. The speed was not fast, but it was very stable. Then he also looked at her. His eyes are clear! He is so handsome! Staring at the man's eyes, Yan Feng soon saw her reflection in them, but she immediately realized that her looks didn't seem decent. His clothes and hair became a little messy after the fight. She tidied herself up in a panic. Although she tried to do it as naturally as possible, she still felt a little awkward. "Hello." A cold voice rang out. Yan Feng's heart skipped a beat. His voice was so pleasant to hear. Although it was a bit cold, it was impressive! "He, hello!" Yan Feng looked at the handsome man in front of her, her voice trembling. "My name is Wu Zhangkong." The man in white nodded at her. "Oh, my name is Yan Feng." She subconsciously reported her name. "I'm really sorry. Those children today are my disciples. They were currently undergoing a test, and it was the final exam of the academy. That was why they would go around looking for people to spar with. They had no ill intentions. I apologize to you on their behalf." Wu Zhangkong bowed slightly to Yan Feng. "Oh, oh, it doesn't matter." Yan Feng's heart raced. But in the next moment, she felt her heart suddenly paused once. Her pupils constricted, and her voice rose sharply. "What did you say? Those, those, they are your disciples?" Wu Zhangkong answered, "Yes." Yan Feng's breathing quickened. "You are also the one who taught them to attack me for no reason?" "Although it is not me, I'm their teacher. It's fine if you think I must take the blame." Wu Zhangkong was still as cold as ever. "You..." Yan Feng suddenly felt that she didn't want to say something of anger. Wu Zhangkong nodded at her. "I apologize again. Goodbye." As he spoke, he turned around and left. "Hey!" Yan Feng shouted "Is there anything else?" Wu Zhangkong asked as he stopped and turned around. Yan Feng said, "Do you think this is enough?" Wu Zhangkong said, "Then what else do you want?" Chapter Four Hundred and Forty Treat Me to Dinner Yan Feng said, "Apologizing should be sincere. You should at least treat me to a meal." When she said this, she blushed at her request.  However, she was already in her twenties this year and had been working hard on her cultivation. She had never had a boyfriend until now. In the past, she always thought that love at first sight was something that only existed in novels. But today, she felt that she could no long agree with that idea she had held before. Although it was only the first time they met, she immediately fell in love with this cold looking guy. He was so handsome! Regardless of anything else, being handsome was enough! "OK." Wu Zhangkong nodded. "What do you want to eat?" Yan Feng said directly. "Up to you." Wu Zhangkong's eyes flashed with a thoughtful light. A moment later, he said, "Come with me." Then, he turned around and walked down the stage. He is handsome even seen from behind! Yan Feng patted her chest and chased after him with a blushed face. She suddenly felt that those little guys from before were not so hateful. That is because they have such a handsome teacher. I will forgive them! This is fate! Wu Zhangkong walked leisurely before her, and Yan Feng silently followed behind him. She didn't say anything else because she felt that walking behind him and looking at his back from behind was like admiring some beautiful scenery. His figure also became even clearer in her heart.  He was indeed eye-catching. Almost all women who passed by him, regardless of their age, would subconsciously look at him. Yan Feng was a fifth-ring soul king, her hearing was excellent. She had heard a lot of love-struck voices like "so handsome". Of course, that was what she said most in her heart. Because she had been following him and watching him all this time! After turning into a small alley, Wu Zhangkong stopped in front of a small restaurant. The restaurant's front door was less than four meters wide. From the window, one could see the inside. There were only four tables there. It was already close to noon, and the aroma of stir-fried dishes wafted out from inside. Wu Zhangkong stood quietly in front of the restaurant. His eyes were filled with thoughts and confusion. From the side, Yan Feng could clearly see that his cold eyes seemed to have softened a bit.  "Ah, Changkong, you are here! Come in quickly." A fat man with short hair who looked to be in his fifties walked out from inside. He clearly knew Wu Zhangkong and was very familiar with him. He wrapped his arm around Wu Zhangkong's shoulder and walked into the restaurant with him. If Tang Wulin and the others saw this, they would be shocked. Wu Zhangkong was a neat freak, but he didn't get angry at the other party's hand this time. Instead, he nodded gently at the man and walked in. Yan Feng followed him into the restaurant. The restaurant was small, and its sanitary conditions were not too bad. It was a typical fly restaurant. If it was another man who brought her to such a place, she would definitely give the other party a poor comment in an instant. They could not be that stingy. However, if it was Wu Zhangkong, then she would say that he had a unique style on this! Yes, this world was unfair! "Changkong, I haven't seen you for a long time. Are you doing alright recently?" The fat boss led him to sit down at a table beside the bed. "I'm fine," Wu Zhangkong said as he easily sat down on the inner side of the room. "Is this your friend?" Only then did the fat boss notice Yan Feng. Yan Feng couldn't be considered beautiful, but she also had some charm to her. She was a woman's most beautiful youth, full of vitality. "Hello." Yan Feng smiled at the fat boss and sat down across from Wu Zhangkong. The fat boss moved his mouth, obviously he was surprised.  "Same dishes as before." Wu Zhangkong nodded at him. Then the fat boss got what he said and said with a smile, "Okay, okay, same as before. I'll get it ready for you." "That's great, Zhangkong. It's great that you're as same as before." As he spoke, he immediately ran back to do his work. After the fat boss left, Wu Zhangkong's expression became cold again. Yan Feng sat across from him. Now, she could see him closely face to face. He has long eyelashes! His eyes are also beautiful. His nose is quite straight, and his lips are neither too thin nor too thick. If he kisses me, I don't know. Ah, what am I thinking? For no reason, Yan Feng blushed again. "Do you often come here?" Yan Feng asked. "I used to," Wu Zhangkong said, his cold eyes focused on her. Yan Feng said, "No wonder the boss knows you." "Yes." Yan Feng said, "Do you usually live in Spirit City?" Wu Zhangkong shook his head. Yan Feng said, "Then where do you live?" "Shrek." Wu Zhangkong replied. Yan Feng asked, "How old are you this year?" Wu Zhangkong was stunned for a moment. He shook his head and did not say anything.  Yan Feng said, "Then let me guess, twenty-seven?" Wu Zhangkong remained silent. "No? Then twenty-six? It can't be twenty-eight, right?" Wu Zhangkong frowned. "Thirty-three." "Thirty-three?" Yan Feng looked at him in surprise. "Then you really look younger. Your skin is well maintained. If not for your mature temperament, I would have thought you were in your early twenties. I'll be twenty-seven soon. You're six years older than me." "Yes." Yan Feng said, "Are you usually like this? Always brief and simple with words?" "Yes." Yan Feng said, "What happened to your disciples? What examination are they taking?"  Wu Zhangkong said, "Final exam." Yan Feng snorted. "The little fellow in the lead is evil. He attacked me first, then accused me of bullying. His acting skills are really good. Did you teach him that?" Wu Zhangkong said helplessly, "I did not." Yan Feng said, "Who taught him that?" The corners of Wu Zhangkong's mouth twitched. Yan Feng's heart skipped a beat. This was the first time she had seen Wu Zhangkong's normal expression. "His talent is exceptional." Wu Zhangkong said helplessly. Yan Feng said, "You have to be careful when choosing a disciple. It is just like growing a small tree. As a teacher, you have to ensure that he grows up straight like the tree. Don't let him go the wrong way." Wu Zhangkong said, "No, he has a good nature." "I don't think so." Yan Feng pursed her lips. "Alright, let's not talk about him. Let's talk about you. Are you a teacher at a school? Which school? At this moment, the fat boss appeared again. The dishes were ready. It was several dishes of ordinary food, with sufficient portions. They were candied sweet eggs, shredded pork, Kung Pao chicken, and a bowl of earthenware tofu soup. Three dishes, one soup, and two bowls of rice. Yan Feng was a little hungry. Because of her excitement, she hadn't even eaten breakfast yet.  Although it was a small restaurant, these dishes were good in appearance, flavor, and taste, and she drooled. "Enjoy it, don't stand on ceremony." She picked up her bowl and began to eat. She took a portion of shredded pork into her mouth. Soon, her eyes widened. "It's delicious." She didn't expect that such a small restaurant could serve such delicious dishes, much better than famous hotels. Not bad." Wu Zhangkong also picked up his bowl. He ate rather slowly. He lowered his head and looked at the four dishes in front of him. His eyes began to wander again. He picked up a piece of candied sweet eggs and took it into his mouth. He seemed to be tasting something, but also seemed to be feeling something. Yan Feng asked as she ate. "You haven't told me which school you are from." "Shrek." Wu Zhangkong indifferently said. "Shrek School! Ah?" Yan Feng was surprised. She stared at Wu Zhangkong with wide eyes and raised her voice. "Y-you're a teacher at Shrek School?" "What's wrong?" Wu Zhangkong glanced at her. Yan Feng's expression changed. "N-nothing." She thought he was perfect! Chapter Four Hundred and Forty-One Yan Feng and Heaven Ice He's so handsome, and he's even a teacher at Shrek School. He's perfect without fault to pick! "Shrek School is really a good place to look forward to! I had applied to that school before, but failed.  It is such a pity. Otherwise, I might be able to learn from you." "No," Wu Zhangkong said indifferently. "When you were in school, I was also a student. You can't be my student at your age." "You don't know how to talk, do you? How could you treat a girl like me like this?" Yan Feng was furious. Wu Zhangkong remained silent as he silently ate. "You are a teacher at Shrek School, then you must be a battle armor master, right? one-word or two-word?" Yan Feng pouted. A short while later, she could not help but ask. "Two-word," Wu Zhangkong said. Yan Feng's eyes widened again. He is a two-word battle armor master in his thirty-three. It is amazing! No wonder I can't see through his cultivation.  "I just became a one-word battle armor master. I gave my battle armor a name called Phoenix. A one-word battle armor master could only use one word to name their battle armor. What about yours? How did you name your two-word battle armor? Speaking of which, I feel upset. My martial soul is a fire gourd. Normally, battle armor masters will use the name of their martial soul or spirit soul to name their battle armor. How should I name this? I can't use the name of Gourd, so I used my name. What is the name of your battle armor?" "Heaven Ice," Wu Zhangkong said. "Sounds good," Yan Feng said. "Why did you use this name? Your martial spirit is a type of ice, right? That's why it was named this way." Wu Zhangkong raised his head to look at her. "Heaven is a part of my martial soul's name. Ice is my wife's name. "Confucius says one shall not speak when eating foods and going to bed. Finish your meal." His wife's name? His wife's name! Yan Feng was stunned. She should have thought of it earlier. He is so outstanding, how could he not have a wife? She felt a huge sense of loss, and lost her appetite. Then, the two didn't speak anything else. They silently ate. Wu Zhangkong didn't eat much. His mind was wandering in the world of the past. "Wow, Changkong, I love to eat the candied sweet eggs the most here. It's hard to imagine that eggs can be made so delicious. In the future, I will learn how to make it, then you can enjoy it at home, okay?" Hey, leave some tofu for me! It seems that eating more tofu is good for the skin. Although my skin is a little better than yours, I still have to work hard." "The shredded pork is so delicious that I want to take more, okay? Will I gain weight?" Look at you, you are so clumsy. There are rice grains on your face. I hate this. I won't do it. Ah, don't come over!" They went out of  the restaurant, and it was already noon. Yan Feng smiled at Wu Zhangkong. "Thank you for lunch." "I'm leaving," Wu Zhangkong shook his head. "Can you leave a Soul Guide communication number? I'll go to the Spirit Pagoda later and ask them to cancel the report they submitted to the government on your disciples today. I'll inform you of this when the procedures are done. Wu Zhangkong hesitated for a moment before speaking a string of numbers. "If I go to Shrek School one day, can I have dinner with you?" Yan Feng smiled. "I'm leaving. Goodbye," Wu Zhangkong cast a glance at her and said. With that, he turned around and left. Yan Feng watched him disappear into the distance, then looked away and sighed. "All good guys are already in a relationship. Hopeless. When will I ever find such a good man? Looks like Heaven Spirit City is still so isolated. I'm going to Shrek City too. I'm a one-word battle armor master now. There will always be a chance to go there and seek greater development. I will ask the Spirit Pagoda to send me there. The Soul Guide Car sped on the highway, heading straight for the next city. Their test in Heaven Spirit City was probably a failure. They had no choice but to change their route and go to another city. They thought for a long time, but failed to find a quicker way. They still had to provoke soul masters in the Spirit Pagoda, fighting them and then finding trouble with the law-enforcement officers. Therefore, they had to follow the previous method. It was true that luck would not always be bad, and there would always be ups and downs. In the next few cities, they did not encounter the wrong opponent and completed the examination missions very smoothly. They succeeded in pretending to be Supervisors. After passing through several cities, they soon completed more than half of their missions. "This is the fourth day.  We still need to move more quickly. We will finish two today and another two tomorrow. The day after tomorrow, we will arrive at Ming Du. In Ming Du, we even don't need to look for the Spirit Pagoda, and powerful Soul Masters will be more easy to find. After all, that is where the Alliance Headquarters is located. When the time comes, we should restrain ourselves a bit." Tang Wulin said as he looked at the map. When the missions began, they felt nervous at the start. But now they grew and became confident. Knowledge comes from books and from experience of the world. It was indeed meaningful. In the process of completing the examination missions, they also encountered trouble. But they had all been solved one by one. The most troublesome thing was when they faced Yan Feng, but after that battle, they saw how powerful battle armor masters were. As students of Shrek School, the six had the chance to defeat a six-ringed Soul Emperor, let alone a five-ringed Soul King. However, when they encountered a one-word battle armor master,  they were hopeless, and had no way to break through her defense. "Wulin, in Ming Du, I know a place that is suitable for us to complete the final exam." Ye Xinglan suddenly said. "Oh? Where?" Tang Wulin asked curiously. Ye Xinglan said, "Ming Du once had a school that was an important competitor for Shrek School ten thousand years ago. Even now, they are still one of the top schools in the continent. Although they are inferior to Shrek School, they are still a school second to none in the Alliance. Why don't we go there and cause some trouble? Hearing this, Gu Yue immediately got her meaning. "You're talking about the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Teacher School, right? This is also a school that has been established for over ten thousand years." "Yes." Ye Xinglan's eyes shone with excitement. "I've long heard about the enmity between our school and that school. I think that if we can complete the final round of the semester examination there, then our strength will be fully proven." Tang Wulin's eyes lit up. "That makes sense. I think it's feasible." "Then it's settled." Ye Xinglan clenched her fists. "Don't talk about that for now. Let's solve the problem in front of us first." Xie Xie said in an unsteady voice. Everyone looked through the windshield and was stunned. In the distance, more than twenty mechas were lined up. Five of them were purple and fifteen were yellow, blocking the highway horizontally. There were no Soul Guide Cars that were stopped on the road. Obviously, they had just landed. The mark on the chests of these mechas suggested that they were from the Spirit Pagoda. After completing five rounds of tests, they were finally found by the Spirit Pagoda. "Wulin, what should we do?" Xie Xie asked Tang Wulin as he stepped on the brakes. Tang Wulin narrowed his eyes. Anyone familiar with him understood that every time he had this expression, they knew that he was about to explode! "Stop!" Tang Wulin shouted as he punched out with his left elbow. With a bang, the entire car door flew out. He seized the opportunity to grab the roof of the car, and he was already out. His actions had already told his companions what to do, and he would never allow himself to be captured without putting up a fight. Even if they were arrested, there would be no serious consequences. In the worst case, they would just have to compensate and apologize. However, it was also possible that they would be sent back to Shrek School! If that happened, it would be extremely humiliating. Moreover, it would be difficult for them to complete the final exam. In the history of Shrek School, no class president had been eliminated. Tang Wulin didn't want to be the first, and he didn't want his companions to be eliminated with him. Xie Xie stamped his foot on the brake and fiercely turned the steering wheel at the same time. The Soul Guide Car immediately crashed toward the isolation zone beside him. They were all powerful Soul Masters, and even Xu Lizhi had the Tang Sect's secret art to protect him. The moment the car crashed into the isolation zone, they scattered in all directions and came out of the car. Gu Yue hugged Xu Xiaoyan and shouted, "Blizzard!" Xu Xiaoyan had already stimulated her martial soul when she rushed out of the car. At this moment, her third soul ring lit up. With the support of Gu Yue's Elemental Tide, the blizzard instantly spread out from her body. On both sides of the highway were trees and fields. Tang Wulin shouted, "Go to the forest, quick!" He shouted at his companions, but he did not leave. On the other side, after discovering that they suddenly changed directions, the Soul Guide mechas had already soared into the air. They aimed the soul guide cannons at them, flying over quickly. Chapter 442 All-round Gu Yue While the mecha's flight needed a moment to rev up, it was still lightning quick - far faster than what they could manage now. Plunging into the forest was their only hope of survival. Moreover, Tang Wulin had one more thing to rely on, which was that these mechas belonged to the Spirit Pagoda, not the officials. The Spirit Pagoda's mechas would never dare to casually kill people, because the Federation's order could not be disrupted. Thus, Tang Wulin was certain that these mechas wanted to capture them and not slay them. It is precisely this judgment that allowed Tang Wulin to feel a little more confident in leading his companions in escape. Just as expected, the mechas that flew into the air all took the soul-guided cannons back in their hands and flew towards them with bare hands. The ones that flew in the forefront were the five purple mechas, which flew towards them as if they were speeding through the wind and lightning. Tang Wulin pointed his toes to the ground and fiercely leaped into the air. His Golden Dragon body erupted with power, expanding in size as scales emerged on his skin. His right arm suddenly swelled, and his gauntlet of fighting armor appeared around his forearm. In an instant, he elevated himself to his strongest fighting form. The sound of the dragon roaring within his body. Tang Wulin took a deep breath, his hands circled in front of his body, his left hand gripping on top of the fighting armor at the forearm, and fiercely shouting, he swung a claw out. The qi and blood worked in reverse, that's the Golden Dragon Shock, then the Golden Dragon Dreadclaw! He injected all of his soul power through his hands into the Golden Dragon Claw in his right hand, using the Golden Dragon Shock to catalyze his Golden Dragon Dreadclaw. Before this final exam, he didn't dare do this as the Golden Dragon Claw in his right hand was unbearable. But along with the continuous enhancement of his qi and blood after coming out this time, even though he hadn't been able to break through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King,  his body's endurance had clearly improved. Five brilliant claw shadows swept out in the air. Those chilling claw silhouettes emanated dark golden radiance along their blades, while the backs of the blades shone with brilliant gold, faintly revealing a dragon scale pattern. When these five claw silhouettes were first unleashed, they were only about five feet long. But they rapidly expanded in the face of the wind. In an instant, they transformed into gigantic claw shadows dozens of meters long. Although they became more illusory as they enlarged, they perfectly obstructed the path of the five purple mechas. Seeing this, the five purple mechas were shocked. The range of a Soul Master's attack was directly proportional to their own power. They naturally assumed the golden rings around Tang Wulin as his soul rings. But since when were soul rings golden? Plus, the massive range of these claw silhouettes was astounding. Their first reaction was to activate their mechas' protective barriers to the maximum for defense.   "Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!" Five explosions rang out in the air, and the five mechas were blasted. The mecha's shield, which had withstood the core power of the Golden Dragon's Dread Claw, was already full of cracks, and was nearly shattered! Viewed from afar, it was absolutely shocking. Facing twenty mechas, that small figure rose into the air. With a swipe of the claw, five purple mechas swept away. How domineering it was! Although the other fifteen yellow mechas chased after them, when they saw the five purple mechas being sent flying by Tang Wulin, they were stunned and didn't dare to charge forward. Since he had the power to blast away purple mechas, it was highly likely their mechas could also be torn to shreds! Tang Wulin landed with a thud. With his toes pointing at the ground, he was sent flying backward. In a flash, he dodged into the already-formed blizzard behind him. A soft little hand quickly grabbed his hand and ran at full speed. The raging blizzard unleashed by Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan's combined efforts far surpassed ordinary thousand-year soul skills. Especially since they only sought to obscure vision and detection rather than attack, in just this short time, it already spanned hundreds of square meters. The storm rampaged through the air, giving rise to a twister that swirled snowflakes about, greatly obstructing the mecha operators' sight. Tang Wulin's attack had not only blocked their pursuit, but it had also intimidated them. Those purple mecha operators didn’t stand a chance in a one-on-one either. Therefore, they did not dare to spread out to investigate. They could only gather together and search through the radar attached to the mechas. However, Shrek Academy had already explained how to deal with mecha radar since the start of the semester. The energy fluctuations in the blizzard were chaotic, and it was almost impossible for the radar to play a role in it. Tang Wulin was pulled along in escape when suddenly, the ground vanished beneath his feet. His body plunged downward and before he could even react in shock, his feet found solid purchase once more. Then darkness engulfed his vision entirely as the light abruptly disappeared. Then, a golden glow lit up. Only then did he see the situation clearly. This was a small space, surrounded by dirt. His companions were all there, and the one holding his hand was Gu Yue. The golden light was shining in her hand. She let go of Tang Wulin's hand. She didn't say anything, the light in her eyes lit up, and the two major soul skills, Elemental Tide and Elemental Mastery were released at the same time. At once, Tang Wulin felt that the ground underneath his feet was slowly sinking, and what was even more bizarre was that the dirt above him was actually closing on its own as if it were constantly swallowing them downwards. Other companions now gazed at Gu Yue in awe, stunned by her power. Even the tsundere Ye Xinglan was glowing. Elemental control of earth was divine at this moment! Underground soil undoubtedly contained the richest elemental energy. Leveraging her cultivation, Gu Yue controlled the earth to lead them deeper, using the soil to block most scanning. The farther from the surface they went, the harder they'd be to detect. They were safe now. It was said that there was no path to heaven or earth, and Gu Yue had opened the door for them. The Spirit Pagoda's mecha operators had never dreamed that they would be able to escape underground. Moreover, there was no way to find them unless they used the Soul Cannon to launch a carpet-style bombardment right the first time. However, these mecha operators belonged to the Spirit Pagoda, and Tang Wulin and the others were not evil. At most, they were just making trouble. How could they make such a mess?  Only after a full dozen minutes did Gu Yue finally stop controlling the earth element. "Everyone, control your breathing. The underground air is thin." Tang Wulin said. The goal was avoiding capture, not suffocated down there. "It's okay." Gu Yue said. She swung her left hand and a ball of water floated in the air. Her right hand gently rubbed the ball of water. Immediately, the ball of water became smaller and the air in the underground became much more comfortable. "Teacher taught me how to separate the water element. It can create the oxygen we need. There won't be any problems in a short period of time." "Sister Yue, you are omnipotent!" Xu Xiaoyan praised. "I'll take that compliment. They probably won't be able to find us." Gu Yue smiled. "We can go out later. However, what should we do next? When the Spirit Pagoda comes to search for us, it's likely that the Spirit Pagodas in all the cities has already received the news and will be on high alert. Our previous method of doing so will not work." Tang Wulin narrowed his eyes. "The cities we're going to are all big cities. There must be a Soul Master Academy, where there is no lack of Soul Masters whose cultivation levels are higher than ours. We can do like this."  His thought emerged because of the Imperial Sun Moon Academy. Since their idea was not workable now, they could choose this way. After an entire hour, Gu Yue controlled the soil to push them back to the ground. Sure enough, the mechas were gone. But what made them depressed was that the car was also smashed and could not be driven. Tang Wulin had already seen the map. There were less than two hundred kilometers between them and the next city. There was no other way. They could only run there. Besides, they had Gu Yue's wind elemental mastery and Xu Lizhi's Agility Steamed Buns. Tang Wulin helped Xu Lizhi and Ye Xinglan helped Xu Xiaoyan. The six of them could only rely on their own legs to travel down the road near the highway toward the next city. Chapter 443 Make trouble! For someone as physically powerful as Tang Wulin, 200 kilometers was nothing. But it was grueling for Xu Lizhi, even with the Recovery Pork Bun and Agility Steamed Bun. After the long trek, he felt like he'd gotten thinner. "Spirit Pagoda!" Xu Lizhi waved his fist fiercely. "What do you want?" Gu Yue asked. "I will never sell steamed buns to them! Never!" Xu Lizhi glanced at her. Ye Xinglan snapped, "Look at you." Tang Wulin muttered, "Today's plan was two cities. It seems like we can only reach one." Everyone rests for a while. We'll go to the Academy in the afternoon." They found a small hotel to stay in. Everyone was the Soul Master, so they recovered quickly. Tang Wulin asked around and found out where the Academy was. The city they were in now was called Destiny City. It was still about two thousand kilometers away from Ming Du, with several other cities in between. Without the car and funds to buy another, they would complete the mission and then continue westward via soul-guiding train. As expected, Destiny City did have a Soul Academy. Tang Wulin learned it was quite renowned - called the Destiny Star Academy. This was a unique academy, only recruiting soul masters with flying martial souls.   At the same time, there were also high-level academies where high-level soul masters, mecha operators, and fighting armor masters were nurtured. Everyone knew that there was no need to be so serious about training fighting armor masters.  The typical graduation age for advanced academies was 22-25 years old. Even in Shrek Academy, students who could complete a one-word fighting armor before that age were extremely rare, let alone in other academies. "That's it!" Tang Wulin decided. While his companions were resting, he wasn't tired at all. In the hotel, he picked up a soul-guiding communication device and dialed a number. "Martial Uncle." Tang Wulin respectfully called out. "Wulin, how was the final exam? Did it go well?" Zhenhua's gentle voice sounded. "Not good, I have a little bit of trouble." Tang Wulin said. "I need to make more money so that I can continue the exam later." I'm in Destiny City at the moment.  They won't give me any forging work without a blacksmith's badge. I think you could chat with the local Blacksmith's Association so I can take on a forging or spirit-refining mission and lend me a set of hammers. After completing the mission, I can get the road fee. Zhenhua was a little speechless, "You are really miserable." You can go there directly. There is no need to forge anything. With your forging level and age, it is easy to cause some unnecessary trouble. I'll tell the Association to give you some money first." "Thank you, Martial Uncle." Look at how generous the Divine Blacksmith Martial Uncle was! Tang Wulin secretly gave a thumbs up. It was good to have such a martial uncle! Zhenhua chuckled. "Don't mention it, drop by the headquarter next time you're free." "I will." Tang Wulin replied without hesitation. Let alone the immense help their guidance could provide for improving his forging skills, the delicious food there was irresistible! After a trip to the Blacksmith's Association, by the time his companions had rested that afternoon, Tang Wulin was already back from the association and had brought back 1 million federal coins. "Let's buy another car." Xie Xie encouraged. "What do you think?" Tang Wulin looked at his companions. Ye Xinglan said, "It is indeed more convenient to have a car. Although it is not as fast as the soul-guiding train, at least it is much more convenient for us inside the city. With the help of the navigation system, it can save us a lot of time." "Then buy it!"  After spending about the same amount of money as last time, he bought another car of about the same size. According to the address Tang Wulin had found, the group headed straight for the Destiny Star Academy. Destiny Star Academy was located in the southwest corner of Destiny City. Established nearly 2,000 years ago, the academy had a long history, though far short of the ancient origins of Shrek Academy dating back to primordial times. Nevertheless, it could still be considered historically significant. Destiny Star Academy had once nurtured many talents and worked closely with the military. In the early years, when the military recruited soul masters, the ones they liked the most were soul masters who had the ability to fly. Although soul masters could fly with the help of soul devices, they could fly by themselves. Their control over air battles was much stronger than that of ordinary soul masters. Even if one's martial soul wasn't very strong, their combat strength could be increased through soul devices. In the past, the appearance of soul devices had greatly shortened the gap between ordinary soul masters and genius soul masters. With the emergence of mechas, a soul master's individual strength could no longer determine whether to win or lose a battle for a long time. It wasn't until the appearance of the fighting armor that the powerful soul masters regained their advantage. Destiny Star Academy  was an academy that focused on nurturing flying soul masters. Therefore, the mecha operators they trained were very famous in the Federation and were also rare talents in various military regions. With the support of the military, the Destiny Star Academy  developed very quickly. In addition to those top academies with a long history, it was among the top in the second-tier academies. An ordinary soul car stopped in a small alley not far from the Destiny Star Academy. Six people got out of the car, all wearing green sportswear. The green color had always been a very eye-catching color. At the forefront was Tang Wulin, wearing brand new sportswear in Shrek Academy's signature green color.  The main gate of the Destiny Star Academy was very majestic, made of metal, made of metal, towering 20 meters high and 40 meters wide, spacious enough for even mecha to easily pass through. The academy walls were tall and grand. It covered a vast area, which was quite sizable. A large area of the southwest of Destiny City belonged to them. Tang Wulin led his companions to the front door and tipped Xie Xie a wink. Xie Xie forced a smile and took out an object - a banner held up by two long bamboo poles. When the banner was unfolded, it was ten meters wide and had a white background. On it were over a dozen large green characters, shoddily written but still legible. He and Xu Lizhi, one on each side, pulled up banners and stuck bamboo poles on the ground The entrance of the Destiny Star Academy  was bustling with activity. As soon as they hoisted the banner, it immediately attracted the attention of many passersby.  A passer-by subconsciously said, "We're from Shrek Academy. We challenge the strongest team under the age of twenty."  So they've come to make trouble? Yes, this was the method Tang Wulin had come up with. It was simple, crude, direct, and time-saving. There were guards at the entrance of the Destiny Star Academy. At this early hour, students had just begun entering. Many people subconsciously stopped to watch. Some were surprised, some frowned, some were angry, and some were curious. Soon, a crowd gathered in front of the academy entrance. Shrek Academy? Undoubtedly, the most eye-catching part was the word Shrek. For any student, this word carried profound meaning, the legendary Shrek Academy! Could students from there truly be coming here to challenge them deliberately? What was going on? Challenging the strongest team under the age of twenty? Looking at their age, they should at most be around fifteen years old. Tang Wulin stood at the front with an expressionless face, he believed that this kind of simple and direct challenge was something that the Destiny Star Academy couldn't refuse. If they did, the academy's reputation would surely be in tatters, and it would be a big blow to the students. "Are you really from Shrek Academy?" A seventeen-year-old youth walked up to Tang Wulin and asked in a low voice. Tang Wulin nodded. "Hello. We are from Shrek Academy and hope to have a match with you in the spirit of exchange."  The youth said, "How do you prove that you're from Shrek?" Tang Wulin smiled. A golden light flashed in his eyes, and a golden ring rose from beneath his feet. As the golden light swirled around, it immediately caused a wave of exclamations.  Golden? Really? Even the most powerful souls were only orange in the legends, right? Did golden soul rings really exist? It seemed like the soul rings of the gods in the legends were golden! What they didn't know was that it wasn't an ordinary soul ring at all, but a qi and blood soul ring. Tang Wulin had a bitter feeling. What could he use to prove his identity? There was no way to prove it, okay? Everything that could prove his identity had been taken away by the academy. The reason why he didn't release the three purple soul rings was because the golden soul rings would give people a more shocking feeling.   The young man was also shocked and subconsciously took two steps back. Chapter 444 Destiny Star Academy At this moment, the gate of the Destiny Star Academy  opened and a few people walked out. They all looked to be over forty years old. The person in the lead was tall and burly, with some white hair standing on end. He looked very energetic. Tang Wulin hadn't retracted his qi and blood soul ring. He naturally saw it as soon as he came out, and with a flash of surprise in his eyes, he took a few steps forward and stopped. "Shrek Academy? Are you from the outer court or the inner court?" The middle-aged man asked.  Tang Wulin said, "The class monitor of the outer court's first-grade class, Tang Wulin." It was different to take on a formal challenge compared to finding loopholes in the Spirit Pagoda. "Class monitor?" This time, the middle-aged man was even more surprised than when he saw the golden soul ring on his body. "Put away your banners, please come in." As he spoke, the middle-aged man stepped aside. Tang Wulin waved his hand, and Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi immediately put the banner away. This was the threshold of access, and once they got it, that's all. They couldn't fight outside the door anyway. They needed to show their respect. "Everyone, go to the classroom. Don't be surrounded here." That middle-aged man waved his big hand, he was obviously very prestigious in the academy, and the crowd immediately dispersed, each heading toward the academy. Tang Wulin's group of six followed them into the academy. This academy truly lives up to its long history, as it not only occupied a large area but also had an elegant interior. There were many sculptures along the roadsides.  "I am Li Zhilong, the director of the Discipline Department of the Destiny Star Academy," the middle-aged man said. Our academy has a long history and is one of the most advanced soul master academies in Destiny City. We mainly teach flying soul masters, soul masters, and mecha operators. We also have a special graduate school for the training of fighting armor masters. Are you here to represent Shrek Academy?" When he heard the words Shrek Academy, Tang Wulin suddenly had a flutter in his heart and honestly said, ''We're not here on behalf of the academy, and frankly, Director Li, we're here on behalf of ourselves." This is a training experience asked by the academy. They require us to find opponents whose strength exceeds ours in all the major cities to fight. And all our identification and equipment have been confiscated. We had no choice but to come here to make this move, so please forgive us. "However, we chose here because we know that Destiny Star Academy is the best academy in Destiny City and even the best in the entire northwest."  Gu Yue, Ye Xinglan, and the others looked at Tang Wulin with gazes that showed some strangeness, when did he become so truthful? What happened? But what surprised them even more came next. After hearing Tang Wulin's words, Director Li Zhilong let out a hearty laugh. "As expected, bold as a newborn calf unafraid of tigers! Worthy of the little monsters nurtured by our esteemed Shrek Academy." "You've already shown us respect by not just barging in and demanding a match." I remember a senior from our class who fought his way up to the military garrison alone for the sake of the academy's mission, and made a big mess." "A senior from your class?" Everyone was stunned by these words. Tang Wulin was also shocked. "You studied at Shrek Academy in the past as well?" Li Zhilong laughed, "Yeah! I'm probably fifteen years older than you guys. Unfortunately, I barely graduated from the outer court." Although he used the word "barely", the look on his face was more like pride. Being able to graduate from Shrek Academy was the proudest thing in his life. "Then we should call you senior." Tang Wulin smiled. "Hello, senior. I'm really sorry this time, if it's inconvenient then we can just go and figure out another way to finish the final." Li Zhilong waved his hand," You're here now after coming all this way. And after what you did in front of the academy, I can't explain to the students if I don't get some results. I will find the opponents for you. According to what you said, the strongest team which under the age of twenty. I also want to see how big the gap between our students and you can be. Now that I think about it, it's been so long since I've been back to Shrek. I do miss Spirit Ice Plaza! My greatest aspiration was to study by the Sea God Lake one day and enter the inner court. Regrettably, I was never able to achieve that in the end.” His eyes were filled with disappointment and sorrow as if they were filled with memories. Tang Wulin was also smiling from ear to ear. The reason why he was telling the truth was because he was observant. From the moment Tang Wulin first saw Director Li Zhilong, although the man exuded authority, his gaze towards them held was fondness. Along with the shifts in Li's eyes and the expression he made when speaking of Shrek during their conversation, Tang Wulin guessed the truth. Thus he spoke frankly, and as expected, his words resonated with the director. The main teaching building of the Destiny Star Academy  was spectacular. It was nearly a hundred meters tall. From the outside, one couldn't tell how many floors it was divided into. It was a giant dome-shaped building. It was a magnificent building that wasn't much inferior to the main teaching building of Shrek Academy. It was just smaller. Li Zhilong first led them to a lounge and then asked, "This is just an exchange of soul master skills, correct? Will you be using mecha?" Tang Wulin hastily shook his head. "No, look at us, can the academy allow us to bring mechas out?" "Alright, you guys take a rest first and drink some water. I'll make the arrangements. We'll talk later." "When did you become so honest?" As soon as Li Zhilong left, Xie Xie couldn't help but ask curiously. "He must have noticed some clues. This Director Li is related to our academy. That's why he told the truth. Right?" Gu Yue didn't understand at first, but after listening to their words, she gradually figured it out. Tang Wulin smiled and pointed at his own head. "Tsk." Ye Xinglan hummed disdainfully. "Let's get ready, everyone. I don't think the exchange matches will be easy." Tang Wulin said. "Although Director Li is our senior and supports our final exams, he is now representing the Destiny Star Academy  and will definitely choose the best students to compete with us. The soul masters here are all good at flying. It will be more troublesome. Everything will go according to the plan we have discussed." Everyone nodded. Tang Wulin closed his eyes to rest. Not long after, Li Zhilong returned. "Do you need a tune-up?" he asked as soon as he entered the door. "Senior, there's no need." Tang Wulin stood up. We still have to go to the next city after this. We need to finish the battle quickly so that we can continue with the exam. Li Zhilong smiled. "As the class monitor, are you afraid of being eliminated?" Tang Wulin shook his head. "I'm not afraid, but I hope to obtain more points and then distribute them to my classmates." I hope that every student in our class will be able to stay in the end." His words touched Li Zhilong. "Well done! You're a qualified class monitor. So, come with me." What surprised Tang Wulin and the others was that there were no elevators in such a tall building. Instead, it was a spiral staircase. Li Zhilong explained that this was to train the physical fitness of the students all the time. They walked up the stairs until they reached the top floor. The top floor was the highest, with a floor height of over thirty meters. It was a huge dome building. Passing through a corridor, they walked into a hall. The hall was huge, and what was even more surprising was that it was an open-air hall without a dome, facing the sky. "This is the academy's Star Observation Platform, and it is also an important combat training ground. It has a diameter of three hundred meters. Because our academy mainly focuses on flight type soul masters, there is no limit to its height here. Tang Wulin prasied, "It is really magnificent. To be able to look up at the starry sky at night, it must be very beautiful." Chapter 445 Star Observation Platform Li Zhilong smiled and said, "It is not difficult to see the starry sky. You will see it in a moment. Our Star Observation Platform still has some strange aspects. Whether it's day or night, once it's activated, it can close the distance between us and space, being able to directly see the stars at a closer distance. The Platform's grand soul guidance array draws in star power from space, providing the purest energy to aid our students in cultivation. Only the most exceptional disciples are permitted to cultivate here during designated times. "Most of the students in the graduate class are here to temper their bodies and fighting armors through star energy." This time, the astonishment in Tang Wulin's eyes was absolutely genuine. He never imagined the Destiny Star Academy would have such an extraordinary location. It seemed that today's match was not very easy! Wait, star energy? Starlight? He subconsciously turned to look at Xu Xiaoyan, who was standing not too far away from him, only to see her eyes filled with confusion. "Please wait here for a moment, and also feel the environment. Our students will be here soon." Surrounding the Star Observation Platform was a wall reaching 30 meters tall. Looking closely, one could see many textures and patterns forged from rare metals adorning the wall. Based on Director Li's earlier introduction, their own observations, and the ambient sensation, it was possible to realize that there was a huge potential energy contained within this Star Observation Platform. Soul-guiding arrays were already applied for public use many years ago, but over thousands of years, humanity never ceased developing them. Increasingly large and complex soul arrays have been designed and built. They had different functions. Among them, the military had the largest number of large-scale soul-guiding arrays, which were used in national defense facilities. The soul-guiding array in front of him was the most complex and massive one Tang Wulin had ever seen. He wondered if Shrek Academy had it or not. It must have. After all, Shrek Academy was the number one academy on the continent! Feeling everything around them, a line of people soon appeared in front of them. The school uniform of the Destiny Star Academy was black, and there were stars embroidered on the chest. The silver stars represent cultivation, and each additional one is one more level of soul power. And at the graduate level, the silver stars would turn into gold stars. Therefore, judging the strength of the students here, one could understand by looking at the number of stars on their clothes. The six students who entered all wore uniforms adorned with silver stars, their silvery glow shimmering. Four males and two females, they looked to be between eighteen and twenty years old. Upon entering, their gazes first fell curiously on Tang Wulin's group of six. Tang Wulin could tell their cultivation levels with a single glance. The strongest one had forty-six silver stars on him. The other five also had more than forty, which just fit the criteria for their confrontation. As students from Shrek Academy, they didn't care much about opponents that were a level higher than them. However, what Tang Wulin cared about was the Star Observation Platform. There was no doubt that Li Zhilong had asked them to compete here without intent。 Li Zhilong smiled and said, "Let me introduce you to each other first." These six were students from Shrek Academy. And the six of us here are also the most outstanding students below the postgraduate level. How about this, you guys introduce yourselves." Tang Wulin nodded at the six people in front of him. "I'm the captain, Tang Wulin. I'm an assault-control-type soul master." "Nice to meet you all. Welcome to the Destiny Star Academy. I am Xiao Tiantian, captain." Coincidentally, I am also an assault-control-type soul master like you." Their eyes clashed, both smiling but scrutinizing each other. Due to his age, Xiao Tiantian was clearly taller than Tang Wulin, but he couldn't see any emotion in Tang Wulin's eyes. "Gu Yue, an assault-type soul master," Gu Yue said. A simple introduction. The opponent who stood in the second position was a thin male student, everything looked ordinary, but the number of silver stars on his clothes was second only to Gu Tianming, level 44. "Ye Zishu, an agility-type soul master." "Xie Xie, agility-type soul master." The third person on the other side was tall and burly, and he seemed to be the strongest of the six. "Gu Tianming, agility-type soul master."  He was an agility-type? Not an assault-type? Look at him. "Ye Xinglan, assault-type soul master." The fourth person from the Destiny Star Academy was a medium-sized but very handsome young man. With a slight smile, his voice instantly left a deep impression on Tang Wulin and the others, melodic and pleasant. "Zhang Xining, control-type soul master," he said. "Xu Xiaoyan, control-type soul master." Xu Xiaoyan said subconsciously at this moment with a look of confusion still showing in her eyes. The fifth person in Destiny Star Academy was a girl. She was very beautiful and looked petite. She giggled and said, "I am Li Yaoyao, an assault-type soul master." "Xu Lizhi, food-type soul master." A fat guy. The last one from Destiny Star Academy was also female, with good looks and figures, and looked delicate. "My name is Han Yuchang, a control-type soul master." Another control-type? After listening to the other party's self-introduction, Tang Wulin couldn't help but be vigilant. Captain Xiao Tiantian was an assault-type soul master, and then there were two more control-type soul masters, purely control-type. After all, there were only six of them! Half of them were control-type, what was going on? Moreover, according to the characteristics of the Destiny Star Academy, these six were all flying soul masters at their own specific venues. Besides, they were all above level 40. This battle will definitely not be easy. Tang Wulin glanced at Gu Yue beside him. Gu Yue sensed his gaze and turned to look at him. The two of them looked at each other and nodded imperceptibly. "Alright, the teacher in charge of controlling the Star Observation Platform has also arrived. He will open the Star Observation Platform barrier in a moment." "This is a friendly exchange, be careful not to go too far," said Li Zhilong with a smile. He had always been proud of himself as a Shrek Academy graduate, but he hoped that the students he trained would be able to defeat the students of Shrek Academy! Although Tang Wulin and the others were young, Tang Wulin's identity as the class monitor could already represent Shrek in a sense. To be able to win this match, even though there was a bit of a mismatch in terms of age, it was pride for the Destiny Star Academy. Which academy had succeeded in defeating the the lower age groups from Shrek Academy? The two sides retreated and widened the distance, which was the rule of the competition. Before the battle, they were at least a hundred meters apart. As he retreated, Tang Wulin's eyes gradually brightened. People who were familiar with him knew that he was the kind of person who thrived under pressure. The more pressure he faced, the stronger his fighting spirit became and the more potential he was able to unleash. The six opponents were powerful. But were they strong enough to surpass the former Five Great Youth Genius Rankings? Tang Wulin had defeated opponents even with the fusion technique of the martial souls. He had the confidence that even in specific locations, they could still crush their opponents. This was the belief of Shrek Academy. Not only did they represent themselves, but they also represented the glory of Shrek Academy! In the triangular formation, Tang Wulin led the way, Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan followed behind, followed by Gu Yue, Xu Xiaoyan, and Xu Lizhi in last. The other six did not have any intention of setting up their formation, and they still stood in a line. Six against six, the group battle tested individual strength, and more importantly, the cooperation with each other. "Ready!" Li Zhilong acted as the referee for this match.  "Buzz-" The sound of buzzing rang out, and the walls surrounding the Star Observation Platform lit up. The intricate patterns on them came to life in the halo. The halo surged into the air, transforming into beams of light that converged at a single point. Hundreds of beams of light gathered in the sky, forming a massive column of light that shot up into space. What a wonderful Star Observation Platform. Tang Wulin's heart was feeling the energy fluctuations within the platform. The sky suddenly turned dark in the next moment, and all the golden light disappeared in a short time. The surrounding walls remained magnificent, but the daylight had transformed into a vast starry sky, with twinkling stars seemingly near at hand. Strange and pure energy descended from the sky, bathing the entire Star Observation Platform. Tang Wulin clearly saw a faint golden halo appear on the six people, and their aura obviously improved. Although it wasn't obvious, undoubtedly, fighting in this environment, they took advantage. "Hmm?" A soft snort came from behind. Tang Wulin turned back to look and instantly saw a surprised scene. A dazzling golden light emanated from behind him, taking the form of a mist. The golden mist rose and obscured her appearance, making it impossible for those even in close proximity to see her face. "Xiaoyan!" Tang Wulin exclaimed. Chapter 446 I'm Fine. It's Marvelous. "I'm fine. "I am feeling good, this sensation is so marvelous!" The voice of Xu Xiaoyan trembled a bit, but it was clearly a trembling filled with excitement. Li Zhilong, who was the referee for this match, was also a bit surprised. He was the most familiar with the Star Observation Platform, where the students were able to absorb the star power to quench their bodies, but it was only effective for soul masters who had flying-type martial souls. It could be said that the Star Observation Platform was the foundation of the Destiny Star Academy. Fighting here, one's own soul power would have a bonus, and at the same time, the recovery speed would be much stronger than in the outside world. But what about that girl from Shrek Academy? Was that martial soul? Different students had varying levels of perception and absorption of star power. The more compatible they are with star power, the stronger the fluctuations of star power would appear on the Star Observation Platform. This was why Tang Wulin saw a faint golden halo before. Even among the students in the Destiny Star Academy, only a very small number of them could manifest star power in a tangible form. Most students cannot visualize the star power in this way, and the faint golden mist was the manifestation of the visualization. The golden light mist that appeared on Xu Xiaoyan's body was already nearly materialized, so even Li Zhilong, who was very familiar with it, didn't understand what was going on with the changes that appeared on her body. "Go!" With a loud shout from Li Zhilong, this match between the six of Shrek Academy's first-year class versus the strongest team under the age of twenty from the Heavenly Destiny Star Academy began.    On the side of Shrek Academy, three figures shot out at lightning speed. Tang Wulin was the one with the greatest momentum. His left foot stomped on the ground, and he scurried out like a cannonball, the speed was breathtakingly fast. At the moment he rushed out, his martial soul was also released, the three circles of purple soul rings were resplendent with color, and a single root of Bluesilver  Grass swarmed out. However, it was already difficult for anyone to tell that this was Bluesilver Grass. The sparkling and translucent blue vine had golden patterns hidden within it. If one looked closely, one would be able to see the faint scales on the surface of the Bluesilver Grass. The ones who rushed out with him were naturally Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan. Xie Xie's figure was light and not as violent as Tang Wulin's, but his speed wasn't slow at all. Ye Xinglan was fast, so fast that it was hard to see. All three of them had three soul rings flashing with light, like three sharp arrows, heading straight for their opponents. The six students from the Destiny Star Academy reacted in unison, leaping into the air at the same time. Xiao Tiantian slightly bent forward, and his body suddenly erupted a layer of dark red light, even his eyes turned dark red, a pair of large wings like bat wings behind his back opened up, and with a forceful beat, he had risen up into the sky. The four soul rings on his body were all purple, the light flashed, and his aura was astonishing. When he released his martial soul, his originally slender figure began to expand and become stalwart. What martial soul was this? Tang Wulin didn't recognize it at first glance. Next to Xiao Tiantian, Ye Zishu was the most bizarre. He closed his hands in front of his body, and a yellow light lit up, it was actually a long bamboo, followed by the light of the second soul ring flashing, the bamboo gently shook, and countless bamboo leaves flew up and coalesced behind his back into two wings. With the bamboo pole in his hand propped up on the ground, he bounced up and flew as well. His flight appeared light and airy, and his entire body had a strange sense of lightness. It was like a willow flying up, not like pure flight. An eagle's cry rang out from Gu Tianming's mouth, a pair of feathered wings opened up, and there were obviously more feathers in his hair as well. With a beat of his wings, he brazenly rushed into the sky. Martial soul, the Soaring Eagle! Zhang Xining also had a pair of feathered wings, but compared to Gu Tianming, his wings were much smaller and much more dexterous. His feathered wings were white, and with a gentle flap, he floated and flew up, hiding behind Gu Tianming like a frightened bird. What stunned Tang Wulin the most was Li Yaoyao. At the moment when the petite and delicate beauty soared into the air, a strong burst of flames suddenly emerged from her body. Immediately after, her skin turned dark, resembling the texture of stones.  The flames jetted out, taking her person upon impact. The six of them flew up together, but her speed was the fastest. What kind of martial soul was this? The flying martial soul academy truly lived up to its reputation. It was a real eye-opener. In the end, Han Yuchang was relatively normal. A pair of colorful butterfly wings spread out from her back. The butterfly wings flapped lightly then she floated into the air. As expected, all six of them were flying! A distance of a hundred meters was only a few breaths of time for a third-ringed soul master to reach. When Tang Wulin rushed out fifty meters, all of a sudden, he jumped up violently, then landed on both feet. With the help of the momentum of the rush, he threw up a Bluesilver Grass that was dragging behind him directly. A silhouette, under the pull of the Bluesilver Grass, rose up like a cannonball, heading straight for the six people from the Destiny Star Academy who had already flown at least thirty meters into the air. Not only did he stop. Ye Xinglan and Xie Xie also stopped at the same time and leaped up, jumping over in Tang Wulin's direction. Tang Wulin's arms spread out, each wrapping around their waists as his body dripped and spun in place. Spinning at high speed for three weeks and then flinging them out violently, Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan both rose into the air.  They didn't have a flying-type soul master among them, so they couldn't stop the other party from flying a hundred meters away. All they could do was block them in the air before they flew to a height that was completely out of reach. The first one to be thrown into the air by Tang Wulin was precisely Xu Lizhi. He had a fat figure, and at this time, his body was curled up into a ball, just like a meatball, and his target was exactly the direction of the other party, Gu Tianming, and the protected Zhang Xining. A control-type soul master would always be more troublesome than an assault-type soul master. This was something Tang Wulin believed without a doubt. Thus, the first thing he had to deal with was the other party's control-type soul master. Xie Xie was thrown up, and the target flew towards the Butterfly Wings Han Yuchang. Ye Xinglan's direction, on the other hand, was aimed straight at their captain, the strongest Xiao Tiantian. The three of them flew in three different directions. Just this alone showed how powerful Tang Wulin was and how powerful his control was. A closer look would reveal that although the three of them were flying, each of them had a Blue Silver Grass wrapped around their waist. Tang Wulin was at the center of the Star Observation Platform. Numerous fireballs soared into the sky, each with a diameter of over one foot, accompanied by dazzling tails of flames, suppressing Ye Zishu and Li Yaoyao. Tang Wulin's plan was quite straightforward. He aimed to intercept his opponents at once, while Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan, who were capable of long-range attacks, provided remote support from the ground. Tang Wulin would coordinate their movements from the center and be prepared to launch an attack at any moment. He did not expect to be able to completely deal with the other party right the first time, but at least a portion had to be dealt with. Then, it was a battle of attrition. Although flying-type soul masters had a certain advantage over ordinary soul masters, the soul power consumption of flying in the air was far greater than that of a soul master standing still on the ground. Thus, Tang Wulin wasn't afraid that these people wouldn't descend from the sky. The first one to engage was Xu Lizhi. He was the first to be thrown out by Tang Wulin, and with the help of impulse and Tang Wulin's strong arm strength, it was definitely much faster than flight with wings. Gu Tianming had just flown to the designated height when a huge meatball was already charging at him. Behind him, Zhang Xining's first soul ring flashed. A loud and clear scream rang out. His voice was truly melodious, twirling and lingering around the beams. His martial soul was a lark. Although he was a flying-type soul master, he relied on his voice to control his enemies. His first soul skill was to slow down and weaken his opponent. However, his speed reduction ability had no direct effect on Xu Lizhi. After all, Xu Lizhi hadn't relied on his own strength to fly over but had been flung over by Tang Wulin. At this moment, Gu Tianming was still pondering in his heart. Wasn't this fatty a food-type soul master? Was he thrown out as cannon fodder? As an outstanding student of the Destiny Star Academy, his reaction was also quick. The first soul ring on his body lit up, his wings flapped forward violently, and dozens of eagle feathers transformed into sharp arrows, shooting toward Xu Lizhi. In aerial combat, having the ability to engage in long-range attacks was crucial in an aerial battle, as it allows both sides to easily create distance between each other. The eagle feathers broke through the air, making a series of sounds. Unfortunately, what Gu Tianming didn't know was that the one he was facing came from the Tang Sect. What was the foundation of the Tang Sect back then? Hidden Weapons! In mid-air, Xu Lizhi, who was originally curled up, suddenly stretched his body. His hands circled in front of his body with a silly smile on his face. His pair of plump palms flashed with a jade-like luster. Those eagle feathers were like entering a vortex, closing inward, directly into his hands. Chapter 447 The Gap Xu Lizhi thrust both hands forward, transforming Capturing Dragon to Controlling Crane as dozens of tough, sharp eagle feathers shot out. Bolstered by his rich soul power and the amplification from the Tang Sect skill "Scatter the Petals of the Heavenly Maiden", they flew even faster than before straight at the lark soul master Zhang Xining. Meanwhile, he himself had arrived in front of Gu Tianming. Seeing the enormous body right before him, Gu Tianming no longer had time to care about Zhang Xining. His second soul ring shone as his eagle wings suddenly doubled in size, trying to block the eagle feathers while folding inwards. Eagle's Wings! His second soul skill. But to his surprise, the fat man smiled and waved his hand at him, and the body that was about to crash up suddenly stopped in the air. Right after, bursts of cold light shot out from his hands, blossoming like a peacock spreading its tail. They bypassed Gu Tianming and headed straight for Zhang Xining behind. This was his killing move. Eagle Feather in front of him was just a pleasant surprise. Before the wings hit his body, the fatty suddenly shot backward. His smile did not change as he continued to wave at Gu Tianming. Oops! When Gu Tianming wanted to save Zhang Xining, it was already too late. Most of those eagle feathers were blocked by him, but some of them still flew in front of Zhang Xining. Zhang Xining was a pure control-type soul master, specifically utilizing sound control. His frontal combat ability was infinitely close to zero, but his control ability was the strongest of all people. Faced with the eagle feathers, he was caught off guard, and he could only frantically flap his wings to evade. Still, several grazed him, leaving behind gashes. Just when he thought he had dodged them, copious cold rays materialized before him. Over a hundred steely needles by appearance alone covered every evasion route, each imbued with robust soul power.  It was unavoidable! Ah... A sigh rang in his ears, followed by a series of clatter, Li Zhilong had already descended from the sky. "Zhang Xining, out." Li Zhilong's voice was full of helplessness, but he could not just stand by! With the other side lacking flying-type martial soul, one of their vital control-type soul masters was already out after a single round. Shrek Academy deserved to be called the Academy of Monsters. Zhang Xining's face was red, and his heart was filled with displeasure, but this was a competition, and just like a battlefield. It was not possible to change the result just because he was not convinced. As the fatty descended from above, right as he was about to crash into Tang Wulin, Tang Wulin circled his hands, utilizing Controlling Crane and Capturing Dragon to gently diffuse the impact and set him down nearby. As soon as the fatty raised his hand, a large Recovery Pork Bun had been handed to him, Tang Wulin opened his mouth and bit down, swallowing it. At the same time, Xie Xie was already within the range of Han Yuchang. Agility-type restrained control-type, and once they got close, there was almost no possibility for the control-type of turning the tables. Yet Han Yuchang remained remarkably composed. Her second soul ring flashed but no transformation occurred. She simply waved her hands as if grasping something, then gently flapped the wings on her back. The current sensation of Xie Xie was very different. It felt like the world in front of him suddenly turned black and white. Then it seemed like something broke. Han Yuchang seemed to be right in front of him. His shining dragon dagger swung out but only met air. The scene dissolved into an illusion. A slight pain pierced his shoulder as his body began plummeting through the void. What the others saw was Xie Xie launching the attack suddenly an empty space before Han Yuchang fluttered her butterfly wings, tapping his shoulder and flying off. This was... Tang Wulin's heart skipped a beat. That was spirit-control-type! It was impossible for Xie Xie's attack to go so far astray. The only explanation was that he was controlled by Han Yuchang. Not only did Han Yuchang have a flying-type martial soul, but a spirit-control-type! Xie Xie fell from the sky. At this moment, a ball of blinding fire suddenly erupted. It wasn't Gu Yue's fireball, but Li Yaoyao, who had flown the fastest. It was impossible to see which soul ring was flickering on her, and all that could be seen was that her entire body curled up in the air for a moment before she descended from the sky as a meteorite, aiming for none other than Xie Xie, at an incredibly fast speed with a strong aura. What kind of martial soul was this? Meteorite?  Although Xie Xie was an agility-type soul master, he couldn't avoid her when falling from the sky. The agility-type was accompanied by a weaker defense. As soon as he fell, Li Yaoyao shattered a fireball from Gu Yue and shot toward him. Clearly, she and Han Yuchang had cooperated extensively before. As his waist tightened, Xie Xie's body flew horizontally as Tang Wulin's Bluesilver Grass pulled him up horizontally to avoid Li Yaoyao's impact. However, Li Yaoyao didn't stop her charge. Instead, she charged forward like a shooting star, aiming for Tang Wulin. They could tell that Tang Wulin was the core of the group. An assault-control-type soul master. Tang Wulin acted as if he hadn't seen Li Yaoyao. He pulled the Bluesilver Grass around Xie Xie's waist and shook it. Xie Xie's falling momentum came to a sudden halt. When he rose again, he was sent into the air again. His target was still the butterfly soul master, Han Yuchang. Ye Xinglan and Xiao Tiantian also met in the air. Ye Xinglan's body and sword united, transforming into a bit of a cold star and charging straight at Xiao Tiantian. Xiao Tiantian's body shone with starlight as he spread his wings to the maximum. At the same time, he thrust his hands at Ye Xinglan, and a dark red ball of light appeared in the air, blocking Ye Xinglan's path. The Sword God Star blossomed and transformed into rays of golden light, like countless stars blooming in an instant. A layer of light golden halo then surfaced on Ye Xinglan's body, and the sky seemed to brighten up in that instant. The dark red ball of light shattered, and the sword tip instantly arrived in front of Xiao Tiantian. Xiao Tiantian was greatly astonished that Ye Xinglan could also harness starlight to attack - with a much deeper harmony than he could ever achieve. The third soul ring on his body flickered with light, a pair of horns suddenly sprouted from the top of his head, and a layer of dark red grids erupted outwards with his body as the center. It was as if the entire person had transformed into a giant ball in an instant. "Ding!" The Star God Sword was bounced off, and Ye Xinglan had nowhere to rely on, looking as if she was about to descend. But at this moment, she raised the Star God Sword in her hand, and her third soul ring flashed. A strong light rose suddenly, and her body counteracted the force of gravity in an instant, violently transforming into a star rushing into the sky. Huh? Li Zhilong also looked a little dumbfounded. He could tell that Ye Xinglan's martial soul should also be star-related, otherwise, it would be impossible for her to draw on star power so smoothly. A bad premonition appeared. As Tang Wulin drove his Bluesilver Grass to lift Xie Xie, Li Yaoyao in meteor form arrived. Her solid exterior and fiery aura bespoke an explosive striking force. Facing such a meteor, Tang Wulin raised his right hand, golden scales surging as the Golden Dragon Claw appeared. Clenching his claws into fists, the power of qi and blood in his body surged against the flow. In an instant, a layer of golden aura rose up on his body as well. This was not borrowing the power of the starlight, but the manifestation of his body's qi and blood swelling to the extreme. "Boom-" Tang Wulin stood where he was, motionless. The meteor Li Yaoyao had transformed into suddenly stopped in front of his fist. At this moment, time seemed to have stopped on the Star Observation Platform. Such a violent rumble almost attracted everyone's attention. Chapter 448 Starlight! Li Yaoyao's attacks were known for being strong, and her martial soul was the odd meteorite. In fact, she couldn't fly, but she could use the tail flame jet ability of her martial soul to rise high into the sky and then fall to smash people. All of the soul skills she had were enhanced when she used this type of attack. With her current strength of the four rings, the impact power of her full strength was able to reach over three thousand kilograms. Moreover, even if she did not defeat her opponent in one strike, she could still immediately rise into the air and attack again. This was the most terrifying part. She had the defensive power of the Meteorite Layer, so her defense power was quite strong. She was the ace in the hole of their team, ubiquitous on the battlefield. She could even alter trajectory during impact. Her ability to change directions didn't work on Tang Wulin, because he didn't dodge at all. Such a violent collision caused both of them to freeze in place. What was going on?  Li Zhilong moved his body and was already nearby. No matter which side had problems, he could still save them in time. And in the next moment, his pupils contracted violently. On the meteorite that Li Yaoyao had transformed into, some fine cracks appeared with Tang Wulin's Golden Dragon Claw as the center, and immediately after, these cracks spread rapidly, spreading to every corner of the meteorite in the blink of an eye. In the next instant, the meteorite collapsed with a bang. Li Yaoyao let out a delicate cry, and her body had already collapsed from the meteorite. A strand of Bluesilver Grass wrapped around her tightly. Li Yaoyao's face was pale at this moment, her whole body was in indescribable pain because of the previous violent shock, but the shock in her heart was far more than the shock that her body had endured. How was this possible? He only used one hand to block her full-strength attack! Tang Wulin swung his arm, and his entire right arm was a little sore and numb. The force of that impact was really hard! Well, that was all. The second person from the Destiny Star Academy was out. Tang Wulin gazed upward as Ye Xinglan's third soul skill, Falling Star Sword, descended from the heavens. Bathed in starlight within the platform, it truly resembled shooting stars chasing the moon - undoubtedly the strongest Falling Star Sword Ye Xinglan had ever unleashed since he'd met her. Star power was quite useful after all, at least when aiding allies. As the fourth soul ring rose, Xiao Tiantian suddenly became completely silent. His face could no longer be seen clearly, only a pair of blood-colored eyes could be seen. The black flames surged around him, and he swiftly waved his hands in the air, causing a layer of black energy to burst out and transform into a vortex. The Sword Starfall collided with the vortex, causing it to violently tremble for a moment, and in the next moment, Xiao Tiantian disappeared. Ye Xinglan also vanished simultaneously.  What happened? Spatial ability? Impossible. There were no spatial elemental fluctuations. In the next moment, with a flash of dark red light, Xiao Tiantian reappeared in midair, but Ye Xinglan did not appear with him. What soul skill was this? Xiao Tiantian spread his wings and descended from the sky. His wings spread open, and his body changed shape in the air as he charged at Gu Yue. At the same time, his hands slapped out in the air, and a dark red glow suddenly appeared in front of Tang Wulin, like a black hole that was going to swallow him up. Countless green lights descended from the sky. They were bamboo leaves, transforming and flipping in the air like arrows, covering the entire field and also obscuring the figure of Ye Zishu. Hidden among the large bamboo leaves, there were seven golden bamboo leaves, absorbing the starlight in the air. His martial soul was called the Seven Star Bamboo, and with each additional soul ring, there would be another variation. The flight was one of them. The Seven Star bamboo leaf in front of him was his strongest attack, his fourth soul skill. It had only been a short while since the start of the battle, but two of them were out. Although the six members of Shrek Academy were not as powerful as them, each of them had a strong foundation and extraordinary combat abilities. If they didn't unleash their full potential soon, they wouldn't have any chance at all. So, as Xiao Tiantian exploded, so did he. On the other hand, the Soaring Eagle Gu Tianming also spread his eagle wings and swooped straight at Xie Xie in the air. He blocked in front of Butterfly soul master Han Yuchang.  Han Yuchang's fourth soul ring lit up, and her butterfly wings doubled in size. She then fiercely slapped in the direction of Tang Wulin in the air. Butterfly Wings was her fourth soul skill. Tang Wulin only felt as if a sea of spirits had appeared in front of him, crazily pounding into his brain. How was this called control? It was clearly an intense mental attack. He instantly determined that Han Yuchang's spiritual power had already reached the Spiritual Sea Realm, in the same realm as Gu Yue. Tang Wulin's own spiritual power hadn't improved since he had cultivated to the edge of the Spiritual Sea Realm. It was a huge threshold at the spiritual level, and he had been working hard to cultivate his Purple Demon Eyes, waiting for the time to make a breakthrough. In his opinion, he would definitely be able to break through to the Spiritual Sea Realm by the time he broke through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King. At that moment, the powerful mental fluctuations that were like waves crashing in caused the headache, and Xiao Tiantian's attack appeared in front of him. A golden halo appeared on Tang Wulin's body. He released his dragon body. His entire body was encased in a layer of golden light, and golden scales surfaced on a large scale, covering him. His entire body was shrouded in golden lines as his qi and blood flourished. On the other hand, he suddenly crouched down and hugged his knees with both hands, curling up together. Xie Xie's figure in the air suddenly became illusory, the Light Dragon Dagger of the right hand suddenly flung out, carrying a dazzling blade that flew straight toward Gu Tianming. Meanwhile, his own body kept changing in the void, giving a sense of soaring in the air. Gu Tianming felt as if his opponent in front of him suddenly turned into countless individuals, making it impossible to aim at. His wings trembled, and a large number of eagle feathers flew out. However, whenever the feathers seemed to hit the opponent, they always slipped through the gaps. In the blink of an eye, Xie Xie appeared in front of him. The Light Dragon Blade was blocked by Gu Tianming's eagle wings. At the next moment, Xie Xie had already arrived in front of him. A golden light suddenly shot out from his armpit. Gu Tianming felt his body tighten, then he was tied up. Xie Xie's Light Dragon Dagger slashed out with his backhand, blocking his Eagle Wing attack, and with the force of this strike, he rose up into the air and stood upside down in the air, his Light Dragon Dagger outlining rays of light as his body flashed continuously in the void. The golden light enveloping Gu Tianming quickly spread upwards, leaving him to fail to respond to Xie Xie's lightning attacks. Xie Xie's attacks were too fast and elusive, always appearing in the most difficult places for Gu Tianming to defend against. It made him feel like he couldn't catch his breath. Finally, the golden light wrapped around one of his wings, and Xie Xie's body spun in the air, the Light Dragon Storm pressing down on Gu Tianming.  After Fan Yuchang flapped her butterfly Wings at Tang Wulin, she turned around and tried to come to Gu Tianming's aid, but he had already been suppressed by Xie Xie, so she was about to launch a spiritual attack on him as well. All of a sudden, a strong sense of crisis appeared in her mind, and her body suddenly sank down. An invisible sharpness swept past her. Han Yuchang was shocked. "Don't move!" A large hand had already wrapped around her waist from behind with a chilling breath against her neck. "Your psychic power is strong, and I'm not sure if I can withstand a psychic attack from you. But what I can be certain of is that even if I can't stand it, I will definitely leave some marks on your neck or accidentally on your face. So, just fall down to the ground." Han Yuchang had never been approached so closely before. Her face was already red, how could she still send out a spiritual attack? Under the combination of anger and rage, she could only flap her wings and slowly descend.  Xie Xie himself defeated the two of them. On the other side, Tang Wulin's body curled up as he endured the attack. As the bamboo leaves fell from the sky, they covered Tang Wulin, Gu Yue, Xu Lizhi, and a figure in the distance who had not moved but was surrounded by a strong golden light - Xu Xiaoyan. The seven golden bamboo leaves hidden among the many bamboo leaves each had their own targets. Gu Yue's expression did not change. With her body as the center, a strong wind blew, and all the nearby bamboo leaves were unable to get close to her. In the next instant, she dodged Xiao Tiantian's attack and appeared next to Xu Xiaoyan. As for Xu Lizhi, he was by Tang Wulin's side and didn't need her to take care of him. Just as Gu Yue was about to release skills to protect Xu Xiaoyan. Suddenly, she felt a fluctuation of energy, and when she looked back in surprise, she heard Xu Xiaoyan's gentle voice. "Starlight!" Chapter 449 Mutated Star She raised the Starwheel Ice Staff, which was glittering with eye-catching luster, above her head, and in the next instant, thousands of streaks of starlight suddenly burst out. That intense starlight, mirroring the stars of the sky, instantly filled the entire Star Observation Platform. All the bamboo leaves instantly disappeared without a trace under the illumination of the bright starlight, leaving only seven golden bamboo leaves frozen in mid-air unable to move. Not only the bamboo leaves, but also Xiao Tiantian, who had missed his target, Ye Zishu, who was still in the air, Ye Tianshu, who had been suppressed to the ground by Xie Xie, Gu Tianming, who had lost his ability to fight under the golden twine, and Han Yushang, the butterfly soul master, who had been suppressed by Xie Xie's shadow and who was now falling to the ground, were all transformed into a golden-colored body under the light of the star. The ones in the air, in the next instant, fall down to the ground. Those already on the ground were completely unable to move. At this moment, the entire world seemed to turn golden. Xu Xiaoyan was surrounded by stars as if a goddess had descended. The golden starlight on her body woven a dazzling brilliance. There was a pattern on her forehead, which matched exactly with the starwheel on the top of her Starwheel Ice Staff. With the release of her stellar light, it was as if the rays were softened as if they had found their master. The patterns of the entire Star Observation Platform all lit up, and the stars in the sky became bright again, as thousands of starlight frantically converged towards her body. Xu Xiaoyan's body floated lightly, and bits of starlight flew toward her body at a rapid pace. Tang Wulin got up and watched in wide-eyed amazement. Still, he remembered to stride forward and pin down the now golden Xiao Tiantian. At the same time, he lashed out a Bluesilver Grass to cradle Ye Zishu as he descended from above, preventing any injury. Xie Xie's shadow clone tumbled from above with Han YuShan, dissipating force to land steadily. He likewise looked up at the strange sight that appeared in the air. Each of them could feel that Xu Xiaoyan's aura was transforming. It was an essential transformation. Her martial soul was mutating! Indeed, only martial soul mutation could produce such intense energy fluctuations and strange visions. Moreover, judging by her current state, this was undoubtedly a positive change - an extremely favorable one. Li Zhilong was stunned speechless. He could never have imagined this match evolving into such a spectacle. In truth, even without Xu Xiaoyan's eruption, the outcome of this match was already predetermined. Neither Xiao Tiantian's assault nor Han Yuchang's mental impact managed to inflict serious injury upon Tang Wulin. In terms of resistance ability, Tang Wulin was definitely second to none among everyone present. When he faced such a powerful attack from Yuanen Yehui, he survived, let alone the skirmish. Although these outstanding students of the Destiny Star Academy were powerful, all of them were at the fourth-ring level. But compared to Yuanen Yehui, there was a big gap in strength. If Yuanen had been here, he would have been able to defeat the entire team by himself. The only thing Tang Wulin was originally afraid of was the Star Observation Platform. He hadn't expected that the platform brought Xu Xiaoyan an opportunity. With a flash of light in the air, Ye Xinglan reappeared in midair. Bathed in starlight, a golden halo also flowed over her body, and a brilliant light was released from the Star God Sword. She was actually absorbing star power as well. However, compared to Xu Xiaoyan, what she absorbed was only a very small portion, and she then slowly descended from the sky. Sitting directly on the ground with her knees crossed, she began to meditate. It's now or never. The students of Shrek Academy all knew it. The golden color on people from Destiny Star Academy  gradually faded away, regaining their ability to move. Seeing this scene in front of them, how could they not be shocked? There was no longer a need for this match to continue, as the outcome had already been determined. Tang Wulin looked toward the dumbfounded Li Zhilong, walked over quickly, and whispered, "Senior, so..." Li Zhilong finally came to his senses and instinctively asked, "Her martial soul is related to star power, right?" Tang Wulin nodded. Li Zhilong sucked in a breath of cool air, ''I've never seen a soul master with such an affinity with star power. This is really..." He was tempted to say that it would be nice if she was from his academy. He had been at the Destiny Star Academy for many years and had a deep understanding of the platform. At this moment, this Star Power Baptism, no matter what kind of mutation it caused, was surely something that would bring Xu Xiaoyan great benefits. She must be a talent! If such a one could be cultivated by them, then it would be an unparalleled boost for the entire Destiny Star Academy. But that was clearly impossible, as she was from Shrek. "Senior, could you please not interrupt the platform? Xiaoyan's current state..." Tang Wulin asked.  "Of course!" Li Zhilong interjected, stating in a low voice, "Although not our student, this serendipity for her and chance for us must be documented. It will be tremendously valuable for comprehending star power. Don't worry. The star power is infinite, just let her absorb it." Turning to his six students then, he instructed, "You all should closely perceive the star power fluctuations, and see if you can glean any information." "Yes, sir!" The six people led by Xiao Tiantian respectfully replied. It was just that all six of them were now listless. As the best of the younger generation of the Destiny Star Academy, they had always thought highly of themselves. Reaching six rings before twenty - among them, three excelled in control. In Destiny City and some nearby city competitions, they had always been invincible. Especially Xiao Tiantian's Dark Lord martial soul, which was extremely powerful. However, they had been defeated by those from Shrek Academy, which had a cultivation base lower than theirs and was much younger than their peers. This was a gap in the origin of strength. They felt ever depressed. Xu Xiaoyan's absorption of star power persisted for over an hour before her body finally descended to the ground. Many specks of light appeared on her body. Tang Wulin circulated his spiritual power and counted. There were three hundred and sixty-five dots of light. Sitting cross-legged, Xu Xiaoyan cultivated the Profound Heaven Technique as the gold flecks flickered over her. Her Starwheel Ice Staff stood upright nearby, now turned completely golden, especially the inner part of the top starwheel seemed to have become deflated, it was as if the stars were branded in it, and when you looked at it with a fixed eye, you had the feeling of looking up at the starry sky. Her martial soul had undoubtedly evolved, or at least her starwheel. Her soul power hadn't strengthened dramatically, yet felt more refined. The starlight had purified her wholly, ineffably sublime. Xu Xiaoyan had always been the weakest in the team, only providing some value with her Starwheel Ice Staff for nighttime control and later her first soul ring, Starwheel Chains, for daytime immobilization. But this time, she seemed to have truly improved. As the stars returned to normal, the light from the Star Observation Platform gradually faded away, and the starlight on Xu Xiaoyan's body seemed to be absorbed by her body quietly. An additional lustrous glow now graced her already exquisite features, subtly scintillating. Taking a deep breath, Xu Xiaoyan slowly opened her eyes. When she saw that everyone was looking at her, she couldn't help but blush. Chapter 450 Imperial Sun Moon Academy "How do you feel?" Tang Wulin asked. "It's amazing. I can't explain it clearly," Xu Xiaoyan said, frowning. Looking into her eyes, Tang Wulin understood that it wasn't that she couldn't explain it clearly, but that she didn't want to talk about it here. "Senior, I am very sorry to disturb you today." Tang Wulin said to Li Zhilong, "Xiaoyan has already recovered. we'll take our leave." Li Zhilong looked to Xu Xiaoyan, "Your experience was truly extraordinary. We documented the entire process. And we will study it later. Could you leave a contact, so we may correspond more in the future?" "Of course." Having benefited so greatly, Xu Xiaoyan naturally wouldn't refuse this small request. She left her soul-guiding communication number. Of course, this would only be useful after she went back and took the soul-guiding communication device. Now the devices had been taken away by the academy. He quietly left the Destiny Star Academy and got into the car. Xie Xie followed the map and drove to the next city. "This method of sparring with other academies is quite beneficial." Tang Wulin remarked. "It's helpful. "When we reach the next city, we should find a more tactful way." Gu Yue said, "Will we be so fortunate in the next city? This time we just happened to encounter a Shrek graduate senior." Tang Wulin chuckled as he took out a piece of paper. "Before we left, I asked Senior Li - our academy was full of talents. Which institute wouldn't want to hire Shrek graduates as teachers? He gave me a list of alumni in the cities we'll visit next, along with their contact info." With this, we can contact them in advance and then find someone to battle." "Wow..." Gu Yue stared at him, dumbstruck. Xu Xiaoyan added, "Captain, did you think of doing this before? It is good. That's what we should do before." Tang Wulin asked, "Xiaoyan, your martial soul just now should have mutated, how does it feel?"  Xu Xiaoyan had a strange expression on her face. "It's a mutation. I really didn't expect there to be such a large amount of star power there." "At first I didn't know what was happening either. But later I realized the massive star power entering me rapidly fused with my martial soul, spurring it into swift growth - or rather, awakening." If my feeling is correct, my original martial soul should be immature, or flawed. That was why there were different situations during the day and at night. This flaw, although it will gradually be remedied as my cultivation improves, will always be there and will have a greater impact afterward. But this time, when I absorbed the star power, it helped me bridge these defects, and at the same time, it also washed away the impurities in my martial soul. And made it even purer. Tang Wulin asked, "Then why do I feel like your soul power hasn't increased much after absorbing so much star power?" Xu Xiaoyan revealed an odd expression on her face as she said, "Win a few, lose a few. My martial soul was completed, but something in it was lost. My Starwheel Ice Staff should be called the Star Staff now. My ice attribute was washed away by the star power, leaving behind only a pure Starwheel. Tang Wulin was surprised, "Really? That means that several of your original ice attribute soul skills are gone?" Xu Xiaoyan nodded. Gu Yue asked, "Then after your Star Staff changed, did your soul skill change?" "Of course." Xu Xiaoyan smiled. "Otherwise, the gains would not make up for the losses. My martial soul evolved, and my soul skills naturally evolved as well. My three soul skills have changed quite a bit. I'll let you see the next match. In the future, I will be the same as the captain. I will be an assault-type. Tang Wulin gave her a thumbs-up. He could tell that Xu Xiaoyan was much more confident after her martial soul had evolved.  "Xinglan, what about you? You seemed to have absorbed some star power just now. How do you feel?" Ye Xinglan smiled faintly, ''My martial soul is also in harmony with the star power, yet it is relatively stable. Therefore, the only thing that evolved was soul power. I'm already level 40. Level 40! When she said this, even Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi couldn't help but turn their heads. Xu Lizhi was overjoyed. "Xinglan, congratulations! You have finally reached level 40." Ye Xinglan nodded with a smile. As for Ye Xinglan, she only needed to fuse with a new spirit soul and possess her fourth soul ring to enter the Soul Sect realm. She was also the first of the six in the team to reach level 40. With Ye Xinglan's talent and the Stargod Sword's strength, once she reached level 40, her overall strength wouldn't be any weaker than Yuanen Yehui. Tang Wulin turned to Xie Xie. "Don't rush to the highway. Find a place that sells the soul-guiding communication device. Let's buy one." There was only one purpose for purchasing a communication device.   "Hello, are you Senior Zhang from Shrek Academy? We are from Shrek Academy." Just as Tang Wulin had said, Shrek Academy was full of disciples who took good care of their fellow students. Not to mention, it was a good thing that Shrek Academy's outstanding students had come to exchange ideas. In the next few days, they had a smooth journey and had two exchanges every day. They had finally successfully completed the ninth test. They only needed one last time to pass the final exam and return to the academy. "Why doesn't Imperial Sun Moon Academy have senior students like the other academies? After all, they are one of the top-ranked academies on the continent. Why is that?" Curiously asked Xu Xiaoyan. Tang Wulin said, "I heard from the seniors of the last academy that Imperial Sun Moon Academy was once destroyed, and this matter of being destroyed was directly related to our academy. They have been hostile to our academy all the time. Therefore, the Imperial Sun Moon Academy is the only academy that is unwilling to recruit Shrek Academy trainees as teachers. Of course, none of our seniors are willing to come here to teach as well. Although it can't compare to our academy, Imperial Sun Moon Academy's hostility towards us has never diminished. Xie Xie asked, "Then do we still have to choose this place? I've heard of the Imperial Sun Moon Academy, and it is said that the elites trained by them are also very formidable. Many top executives in the Federation come from there. How about another one?" Tang Wulin smiled lightly. "What's our goal for this final exam? The academy took everything from us and sent us out alone for this test - it's meant to temper us. Not only must we complete the exam, but gain something from it. No confidence?"  Xie Xie gave Tang Wulin a thumbs up.  Xu Xiaoyan eagerly responded, "I haven't even unleashed all my power in the earlier matches!" Ye Xinglan calmly added, "That's right, we didn't do our best." Gu Yue glanced at Tang Wulin. "This is the last one, right?" Meeting her eyes, Tang Wulin's face lit up with a smile. Since they were old enemies, they could only win. "Winning earns extra credit." Just then, an icy voice echoed within the car, giving them a fright. "Teacher Wu!" Tang Wulin exclaimed in surprise. Outside he saw Wu Changkong standing outside the window. Wu Zhangkong seemed like strolling upon empty air, effortlessly keeping pace with their speeding vehicle. The voice came from him. "Teacher Wu, can you hear us?" Tang Wulin's lips twitched. Through the window, Wu Changkong gave him a look and nodded. "You represent the honor of Shrek Academy. Since you chose the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy, failure is unacceptable. I will accompany you as the leading teacher." An exchange with a teacher leading would be more formal. Tang Wulin asked tentatively, "So how much extra credit could we have?" Wu Zhangkong replied, "Victory earns full marks for all six of you, plus ten additional points. That means that each of you gets an extra fifty cents to share with the others." "Deal!" Tang Wulin agreed without hesitation. With so many points, his goal would be met.  The extra three hundred points from them were enough to help many students.  Wu Changkong calmly added, "Lose, then all your prior efforts will be wasted. Everyone fails." "Uh...Really?" Tang Wulin gawked. "The two academies' enmity is far deeper than you know," Wu Changkong stated. "So if you lose, I will resign in disgrace." Chapter 451 Ruthless Teacher Wu  He wasn't just being harsh on us but on himself! Tang Wulin was starting to regret selecting the Imperial Sun Moon Academy - the pressure was truly immense!    Bright City! The most modernized city on the Douluo Continent, situated in the west as the core of the entire region. As soon as they entered Bright City, Tang Wulin and the others saw a scene that was rarely seen in other cities. "Are those flying cars in the sky?" Xu Xiaoyan exclaimed while pointing at some aerial object. Xie Xie explained, "They should be. High-altitude flying cars are still in the trial stages. As the federation's foremost tech center, seems the experiments have succeeded!" The traffic ahead gradually became slow, and from the distance, it was possible to see that at the exit of the highway, there were dozens of mechas hovering and patrolling there, not knowing what they were doing. Xie Xie suddenly remarked, "Are they checking the identity?" The moment he said this, everyone became extremely nervous. Everyone had identity certificates - metallic cards with personal information. They all had them until confiscated by the academy before departure! Tang Wulin realized, "The academy wanted our last stop to be Bright City, and that's what they wanted. Enh? Tests are everywhere! No wonder they took our identity certificates." Xu Lizhi glanced back at him anxiously. "What should we do?" Lacking certificates would surely bring interrogation, but Tang Wulin didn't know the consequences. None had faced this before. Tang Wulin glanced at the distance to the highway exit ahead and immediately said to Xie Xie. "Xie Xie, try your best to move the car to the side." Xie Xie had been driving the whole time. With much driving practice, Xie Xie skillfully moved toward the roadside.    "Abandon the car?" He asked. "Is there any chance that Teacher Wu could help us with identification? He followed us all the way just now." As he spoke, he also looked out the window, but soon realized that he was naive. Wu Changkong disappeared. "Nevermind, forget it." Tang Wulin said to Gu Yue, "Later, you should..." The exit loomed closer. As expected, personnel were checking all passengers' identity certificates. Gu Yue vanished within the car in a flash of silver light. The next moment, she materialized dozens of meters overhead, circling her hands. A tremendous fireball erupted forth, rocketing into the sky.  Over three meters in diameter, with scorching momentum, it resembled the rising sun. As it flew, its size continued to grow, pulling out a dazzling flame. Still expanding during flight, it streamed brilliant flames. Gu Yue disappeared. With her disappearance, both patrolling mechas and passing vehicles were captivated by the aerial fireball. Several mechas hurriedly took off to search for Gu Yue, though attention remained fixed on the fireball. The car quietly slowed near the roadside. The fireball above detonated thunderously, scattering innumerable sparks like dazzling fireworks. Disregarding attack power, Gu Yue simply maximized the spectacle. The car door opened, and six people quietly got out. They didn't leave the first time, in fact, at this time, there had also been quite a few soul-guiding cars that had all stopped, and the people inside got out of the cars to watch the fireball in the air. Scanning quickly, Tang Wulin hissed, "Go!" The six of them easily flipped through the railings and quickly ran into the distance. With the cover of the buildings, they quickly rushed into a pile of buildings beside the highway. Alerts finally sounded from the highway. Tang Wulin pulled Xu Lizhi along, Ye Xinglan brought Xu Xiaoyan. With the help of Agility Steamed Bun and wind element from Gu Yue amplified their speed in escape. After running for a few kilometers and getting on a bus heading into central Bright City, the six of them calmed down. In their young teens, they attracted little attention. After purchasing tickets and distributing them, Tang Wulin noticed a familiar face. Wu Changkong sat farther back, gazing out the window pensively. Tang Wulin walked to his side and sat down. "Can we just go directly to the Imperial Sun Moon Academy now? Just take us there, please." "You have a quick mind," Wu Changkong shot him a glance. Tang Wulin chuckled. But Wu Changkong's next words froze the smile on his face. "I know you are quite stingy. Yet you've lost two cars already. You don't care?" Three black lines slid down Tang Wulin's forehead. Of course, he begrudge the money! But what could he do? Damn, this final exam! Wu Zhangkong ignored him and closed his eyes to rest. Tang Wulin couldn't help but curse in his heart. The academy's comprehensive cultivation was truly ruthless! With Wu Changkong around, Tang Wulin was no longer in a hurry. They could get off whenever Teacher Wu got off.  Anyway, Wu Changkong had said that as long as they were able to defeat their opponents in the exchange match with the Imperial Sun Moon Academy, they would be able to obtain a perfect score on the final exam, as well as extra points.  Bright City's architecture vastly differed from Shrek City's - more humanistic and fusing classical with modern elements, unlike the pure high-tech steel forest here. Tall buildings came one after another, each building had its own characteristics, many of which looked strange and eye-catching. It was immense and crowded with traffic. After over an hour by bus, they felt engulfed by the steel forest, unsure of their exact location.  Wu Changkong stood up and got out of the car. The six of them quickly followed. The pedestrians passing by all seemed to be in a hurry as if time was running out. Wu Changkong headed in a different direction and switched to another bus at a station. Everyone quickly followed him. After changing three buses in a row, Tang Wulin still felt like he was in a steel forest. In terms of size, Bright City might not be as big as Shrek City, but in terms of density and population, it was definitely much larger than Shrek City. "I don't like this place. It's too rushed and too depressing." Xu Xiaoyan pouted. Xie Xie said, "I don't like here either. It looks so busy." While they were talking, a building in front of them attracted their attention. At the top of the building were a few huge words, Imperial Sun Moon Academy. This looked like a metal building, connecting three other structures, forming a sprawling campus. This was an academy? Was the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy actually like this?   What a local feature! Tang Wulin glanced at Wu Changkong, about to ask whether they would head directly there or if he would arrange an exchange through Shrek's authorities. But Wu Changkong was already striding forth. Wu Changkong walked to the front of the building. A light flashed in his hand and an item appeared.  At the mouth of the horn, there was a metal box behind it.  Huh? Before they could react, Wu Changkong pressed a button on it and shouted toward the building, "Students of the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy, listen! We six from Shrek Academy at an average age of fourteen, challenging your best students under twenty. Our purpose here is to demonstrate the gap between you and the continent's paramount academy!" Chapter 452 Don't Be So Ruthless Wu Changkong's cold voice was like thunder, so loud that the surrounding streets could hear it clearly. The soul-guiding megaphone was in his hand! After that, he pressed a button and stuffed the megaphone into Tang Wulin's hands. "Teacher Wu, why are you so ruthless?" Tang Wulin said helplessly. Wu Zhangkong indifferently replied, "The full mark is not easy." Just as Tang Wulin was about to say something else, the soul-guiding megaphone sounded once more. "Students of the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy, listen! We six from Shrek Academy at an average age of fourteen, challenging your best students under twenty. Our purpose here is to demonstrate the gap between you and the continent's paramount academy!"  D*mn, it even had a recording function... Then, Wu Changkong disappeared.  A desolate breeze blew past. Teacher Wu, you said  you will lead us! You've betrayed our trust! "I think we were duped," Xie Xie said as he looked at Tang Wulin. Xu Xiaoyan swallowed. "The full mark is indeed not easy to get!" Ye Xinglan squeezed her fingers. "Let's fight then. I'd have shouted the same." "Agreed!" Xu Lizhi raised his chubby hand. "I don't think it said anything wrong." Gu Yue walked over to Tang Wulin and took the soul-guiding megaphone. Tang Wulin sighed, "Can I nickname Teacher Wu the Cheating King? Does that sound good?" He finally found the off switch, silencing the now quadruply repeated megaphone. And in just a few minutes, they had already been surrounded. Students and staff emerging from the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy, as well as passersby. A stern-faced middle-aged blond man strode out from the edifice. As Tang Wulin shut off the megaphone, his complexion darkened severely. "Shrek Academy?" The middle-aged man walked up to Tang Wulin and the others, his face grim as he asked. Tang Wulin put the megaphone into the ring his senior uncle had given him and said, "We're from Shrek Academy's outer court, first-year class." "A challenge then? Excellent. Follow me." Abruptly, a formidable aura erupted from the man, sharp as a blade piercing the sky. The onlookers felt as if their bodies were about to be cut apart. For a moment, everyone was shocked. "Disperse. Those wanting to view the outcome, it will be broadcast onscreen shortly." After saying this, the middle-aged man suddenly withdrew his aura and turned around to walk inside. So easy? Tang Wulin looked at his companions, his heart trembling. It wasn't hard to tell from the aura emitted by the other party that the other party possessed strength that they couldn't contend against. It was very likely that he was an existence on the same level as Teacher Wu. The renowned Imperial Sun Moon Academy was second only to Shrek. Just as Teacher Wu said, a perfect score wouldn't come easy! Yet they now had no path of retreat, only to bravely forge ahead. The pressure multiplied - they represented not just themselves, but Shrek Academy. At the corner of the street, Wu Zhangkong stood there quietly, watching as Tang Wulin's group of six followed the staff member of the Imperial Sun Moon Academy. His expression was still cold, but the corners of his lips curled up. This match was real training for them. As soon as he entered the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy, Tang Wulin felt as if he had entered a large, modern factory. Everything seemed metallic, with a massive revolving metal sphere levitating in the lobby, which obviously contained surging soul  energy, and there was a core spell formation inside. It emitted a faint light, making the light in the entire hall bright and soft. The futuristic reception desk resembled a corporate lobby more than an academy. Faintly undulating cloud patterns adorned the pristine surface - some rare alloy? So extravagant. Unfortunately no forging hammers on hand, else Tang Wulin would've been tempted to refine it. The middle-aged man didn't say anything. He just walked in front, leading Tang Wulin and the others forward. Two beautiful receptionists rose respectfully as they passed the counter. There were quite a few people in the hall, all of them of different ages. Many of them wore the same white uniform. These were obviously students from the Imperial Sun Moon Academy. Most of them looked at Tang Wulin and the other two with curiosity, as well as rejection and malice. The normally beloved Shrek Academy seemed to be archenemies here. Had they brainwashed the students? Tang Wulin grumbled internally as he silently observed his surroundings. He could only hope now that the upcoming match would be impartial, otherwise, if the hosts deliberately schemed against them, this prestigious institute would have no trouble doing so. The spacious elevator was also pristine white metal - white apparently the noble color here. The elevator went up, fast and steady, without too much of a sense of impact. The middle-aged man didn't say anything. Tang Wulin and the others only exchanged glances. They all looked calm. The elevator stopped on the sixteenth floor. The middle-aged man walked out first, with Tang Wulin's group following after. He led them to a conference room-like area. "Sit," he said, not even with a word "please." Tang Wulin was already mentally prepared for this. After all, they were here to cause trouble, so they had to be treated like this. How could they be polite? Teacher Wu, you do cheat us! "You challenge us, right?" The middle-aged man said to Tang Wulin as if he wanted to confirm again. "Just exchange ideas," Tang Wulin nodded. "Okay," the middle-aged man said. "We will give you space and choose opponents for you. We Imperial Sun Moon Academy won't take advantage of your age. Tell me your age."   Tang Wulin felt relaxed. Same-age? They feared none. "On average, we are fourteen." Tang Wulin said. The middle-aged man narrowed his eyes. "Good. The students we send will not be more than fifteen years old. They are basically the same age as you. But there are two things I need to inform you in advance. First, this match will be watched together by our entire academy. Secondly, this match will be broadcast live on all the big screens within Bright City." Tang Wulin felt a cold shiver of fear. "It's just a private competition though, no need for such scale..." he tentatively probed.  The middle-aged man said indifferently, "Of course, we need to do this. If you win, it will be a spur to our entire academy cadets, and if you lose, we'll be able to smack Shrek hard in the face, so it's needed." The feud between both academies was clearly far more bitter than they imagined. Now Tang Wulin truly understood why Teacher Wu had them issue the challenge this way. But now that things had come to this, they had no way out, and this would be a match that was not allowed to fail. "Ok!" Tang Wulin only replied with one word. "You guys wait here." The middle-aged man stood up and left, leaving Tang Wulin and the other two in the conference room. Gu Yue had just opened her mouth to speak when Tang Wulin halted her with a raised hand. "Let's adjust our conditions and prepare for the upcoming match." They were on foreign territory - who knew if it was bugged. Chattering risked issues.  Better to remain silent and leave after defeating them.  Gu Yue understood his intent immediately. The six sat cross-legged on the chairs, meditating and regulating themselves. Unbeknownst to them, their arrival had mobilized the entire Imperial Sun Moon Academy. In under an hour, propaganda about the impending match pervaded all of Bright City, even the entire Federation. The national Star Moon TV station, which spanned all the cities of the Federation, announced that it would be broadcasting the match live just half an hour after Tang Wulin's group arrived. Moreover, this match was named the Decisive Battle of Prodigious Youths in the Soul Master Realm. On the streets, Wu Changkong eyed the giant display screens atop buildings, hearing the same sounds echoing down each road. His eyes narrowed slightly. At this moment, his soul-guiding communication sounded. "What's going on?" Shen Yi's surprised voice sounded. Wu Changkong calmly explained, "Nothing at all. Those brats challenged the Imperial Sun Moon Academy. I merely fanned the flames a bit." Chapter 453 Demonstration "This is a big deal!" Shen Yi exclaimed. "Senior brother, why didn't you inform us earlier? The academy will be very passive now. The Imperial Sun Moon Academy's propaganda is immense - all of Bright City and nearby cities know already, as does the entire Federation who've received messages. If we lose this time, it will be a tremendous blow to the academy's reputation. Did you consider that?" "I understand my disciples," Wu Changkong said. "That's why I made this decision. The greater the pressure, the better it will be to stimulate their potential. If they lose, I will resign. But if they win, I believe that in the future, they will have the qualifications to be the Shrek Seven Monsters. I believe that they will use everything they have to protect the reputation of our academy. I also have confidence in my students." Shen Yi was silent for a moment. "Alright, I'll ask about the attitude of the academy first. I'll reply to you later."  Five minutes later, the soul-guiding communication rang again. "Elder Cai said, just do it. Win or lose doesn't matter - regardless of the outcome, you must bring those kids back safely. They are our future. Moreover, Elder Cai said..." "What?" Wu Changkong asked in surprise. Shen Yi responded, "Elder Cai said she would rather see Tang Wulin's group lose this match. Sometimes, failure isn't necessarily a bad thing." "Indeed, failure is the mother of success. However, it is only through continuously achieving victories and steadily building up one's momentum that one can truly reach the pinnacle of success." Wu Changkong resolutely stated. I believe that they will win." Shen Yi said, "Alright, the academy will make arrangements as well. Just watch over them carefully." In the meeting room of the Imperial Sun Moon Academy. Tang Wulin opened his eyes and glanced at the wall clock, frowning slightly. Two hours had already passed without anyone from the Imperial Sun Moon Academy coming to notify them about the match. Were they deliberately leaving them in limbo? Through meditation, his condition had already elevated to peak levels. Just as Wu Changkong had said, Tang Wulin was currently in the best state of mind due to the pressure he felt. He had a feeling of inexhaustible strength. The others also ended their meditation one after another. "No message? Should we go and take a look?" Xie Xie asked Tang Wulin. "Just wait," Tang Wulin said. Since they brought us here, I think they wouldn't just leave us here. Maybe they need time to prepare or select opponents. Just wait and see." As he spoke, the door of the conference room opened and the middle-aged man entered again. "The match has been arranged, it will take place in our academy's Grand Soul Arena. Do you need any further preparation?" Do you still need to prepare?" Tang Wulin said, "We are also ready." "Then come with me." The middle-aged man had no intention of introducing himself, nor did he ask Tang Wulin and the others for their names. He turned around and left. Following him, they once again entered the elevator, which went directly to the thirty-sixth floor. They then switched to another elevator that seemed to be moving horizontally before descending. They sat in the elevator for two minutes before it finally stopped. The elevator door opened, and the original metallic texture suddenly disappeared, and what came into their eyes was a stone space, everything around them was made of stones, looking quite ancient. However, these ancient stones seemed to contain a strange energy fluctuation. When entering, Tang Wulin felt his soul power boil. The others also felt the same. It was as if there was something here that could make them use their soul power more. The middle-aged man did not say anything and just walked in front. This stone space was very wide. Soon, they came to a hall that was about five hundred square meters. It was surrounded by stones and the top was adorned with magnificent murals.  Tang Wulin looked up, the mural seemed to be a story of a teenager sitting in a square, surrounded by people. the people around him were wearing the uniforms of the Imperial Sun Moon Academy, except that there was some difference compared to the current uniforms, which were a bit more ancient. While the teenager sitting in the center was clearly wearing the Shrek Academy's school uniform. Who was he? For some reason, Tang Wulin felt a sense of familiarity when he saw the figure of the Shrek Academy student in the painting. On one side of this stone hall, there was a huge archway consisting of two large doors that were fifteen meters high and thirty meters wide. It would be easy for a mecha to pass. "This is the waiting area of the Grand Soul Arena. I will inform you to enter the arena to participate in the competition later." The middle-aged man pointed to the stone benches on one side, signaling that they could wait here first. The waiting hall alone was this massive? Tang Wulin had assumed this would be their competition venue. He vaguely heard the faint clamor from outside that, while indistinct, was clearly existing. This match made him feel more and more oppressed. The Imperial Sun Moon Academy had doubtless made ample preparations in the previous two hours. As the middle-aged man walked towards a side door, suddenly the previously faint commotion erupted. The wave of sound startled Tang Wulin and the others. An impassioned voice echoed, "Shrek Academy comes here and we can't ignore such provocation, can we? Students of the Imperial Sun Moon Academy, let's unite as one and cheer for our team! We'll send those Shrek brats home! We'll proclaim to the continent that we are the supreme academy!" Was this the sound from the competition venue? With these provocative words, the surging waves of voices sounded crazy. Shouts of support and curses rose and fell one after another. "Are they demonstrating against us?" Gu Yue squinted her eyes. Tang Wulin said, "They want to put pressure on us. Everyone, relax." Xie Xie rolled his eyes. "What is pressure? I don't care." Xu Xiaoyan looked excited, "It seems like there are so many people! I can show off my evolved martial soul in front of so many people, you guys, do you think I can enter the Inner Academy as well?" Ye Xinglan said indifferently, "My Star God Sword is already hungry and thirsty!" "Aww!" Xie Xie chuckled. "I don't think girls should use such words." "Do you want to die?" The two voices said at the same time. One was Ye Xinglan, the other from Xu Lizhi, who stuffed a Pork Bun in Xie Xie's mouth before he could retort. Xie Xie flashed away, cowering behind Tang Wulin. "Captain, I'm so scared." Tang Wulin rolled his eyes, "Your acting is too clumsy. Xinglan, who is he? Feel free to pummel him. I can help you hold him down." Ye Xinglan grunted, "l remember it, we'll talk about it when we get back. Wulin, arrange the battle tactics." Tang Wulin's eyes shimmered with determination as he nodded. Gu Yue raised her hands and a circle of ice-blue halo appeared under her feet, gradually forming an ice shield that enveloped the six of them. It could isolate everything from the outside and also block out sound It was a completely enclosed space. Ten minutes later, the icy voice called out, "The match will soon start, please prepare to enter." The ice dome didn't shatter but gradually melted from the top, the condensed water instantly evaporating. The man's gaze shifted slightly at this display of control. Impressive! The colossal gates slowly opened, the already deafening clamor intensifying into an electric atmosphere bursting forth. Blinding brightness shone through the gateway. The world outside the arches was very bright, and somewhat impossible to see. The middle-aged man was the first to walk towards the door. Chapter 454 Admission Tang Wulin strode forward with his head held high, followed by Gu Yue, Ye Xinglan, Xie Xie, Xu Xiaoyan, and Xu Lizhi. They all puffed out their chests. From this moment, they represented not just themselves or their exam, but fought for Shrek Academy's glory! Only by walking out of the waiting area and truly entering this large Grand Soul Arena would one be able to sense just how vast its scale was. Even in Shrek Academy, there were no buildings of this scale. Modeled after ancient coliseums, the enormous arena exceeded 1,500 meters in diameter. Surrounding stands could seat over 150,000 spectators. Tang Wulin dared to say that this was the largest stadium on the continent. It probably occupied the central region within the Imperial Sun Moon Academy. The stands were at least sixty-seventy percent filled presently. Not all could be the Imperial Sun Moon Academy's students - 10,000 would already be impressive for one academy. He wondered where they came from. At the central viewing platform, Tang Wulin vaguely sensed several mountainous auras focused intently on his group as they entered. The moment they stepped into the Grand Soul Arena, the noisy stands abruptly silenced, over 100,000 eyes falling upon the six youths. Even if they had an extremely good mindset, the pressure on their hearts in the face of so many spectators for a moment was enormous. Xu Xiaoyan and Xu Lizhi were in the worst condition, their faces pale. Almost all of the spectators present were hostile towards them. When these auras were concentrated and exerted on them, they constituted a considerable degree of influence on their spiritual power, their mentality, and so on. It was even more difficult than the previous scene of judgment. Taking a deep breath, Tang Wulin resolutely stamped forward as golden rings rose from his feet, their brilliant radiance erupting with an abundant aura that expanded to envelop his companions. His whole body suddenly rose a bit higher, and that thick Qi and blood fluctuation instantly blossomed outward. Sensing the rolling vitality Tang Wulin exuded, the five felt the pressure alleviate. The outside noises seemed to fade as their previously suppressed morale swelled within the fiery aura's protection. In the viewing platform's center, an elder's eyebrows furrowed. "Gold soul rings?" "It's rare. A million-year one? Impossible! Even the Spirit Pagoda lacks million-year beasts. In the history records, they only appeared once or twice." The middle-aged man beside the elder frowned deeply. "But those two times were all related to Shrek Academy." "Watch closely." The old man said in a deep voice. "Yes sir!" Seeing the golden soul ring released from his body, as well as his body that was suddenly a few degrees taller, the intimidation coming from the audience lowered by a few points, but soon, the curses that had previously stopped rose in a geometrically multiplied state. Ignoring the crowds, Tang Wulin marched proudly toward the Arena's center. At this time, he had already seen that there were already six people standing in the middle of the Grand Soul Arena. There, six youths in the academy's white uniforms awaited, appearing around their age. In addition to the six, there was also a middle-aged person suspended in the air. He appeared to be in his forties and was wearing armor that covered his entire body. It was a three-word fighting armor, judging from the exquisite level of it. The referee? Or just for pressure? The first time he faced a scene of such a grand scale, it was common to be nervous. But for Tang Wulin, the greater the pressure, the more drastic his own potential stimulated. As his companions often said, he was like a spring - the harder pressed, the fiercer the rebound. With their heads held high, they walked in front of their opponents, and the six of them lined up in the same manner. What they wore was not Shrek Academy's uniforms, which were all put away. But it was dark green sportswear, representing the dark green color of Shrek Academy that was full of vitality. "The rules will now be announced," the referee declared from above. "Huh?" Tang Wulin gestured that he couldn't hear. "I said, the rules will now be announced!" Soul power reinforced the man's voice. "What are you saying? I can't hear you clearly! It's too noisy here!" Tang Wulin shouted back innocently. The middle-aged man's face sank. "Are you here for the competition?" "Still can't hear you! There are so many flies here. Could we get some insecticide first to quiet them down?" Although Tang Wulin said that he couldn't hear, his voice was so loud that with the infusion of soul power, maybe it didn't spread throughout the entire arena, but at least the broadcasting equipment in the arena had been able to record and broadcast his voice. "Raise the barrier." The middle-aged man's face sank as he instructed in a deep voice. A layer of white transparent shields slowly rose from all around, and the shields looked as if they were substantial. After rising, they kept coalescing together in the air at a height of a hundred meters. The barrier was soundproof at the same time, and suddenly, the world fell silent. "Can you hear now?" The middle-aged man glared at Tang Wulin. Tang Wulin nodded. He tilted his head and pulled out a paper ball from his ear. "The world is quiet." Not only he, Gu Yue, Ye Xinglan, and the others also took out paper balls from their ears. The middle-aged man's facial muscles visibly twitched. If not for the crowds, he'd have charged down and beaten them. This match was not only being seen by so many people in the room but it was also being broadcast to as many soul-guiding TV stations as possible across the continent. The purpose was to embellish the competition.  All the preparations they had made earlier were to put pressure on these Shrek students. After all, their average age was only fourteen years old, even if they were strong, their juvenile mentality couldn't be changed. As long as they were intimidated, the possibility of their side winning would increase by a few points.  Yet they faced this shameless oddball Tang Wulin! Just plucking out earplugs stirred the crowds to clamor and curse. Unfortunately, muted by the barrier, Tang Wulin and the others couldn't hear it from the inside. But spectators without bias, or favoring Shrek, couldn't help but laugh. What quirky kids Shrek nurtured! "The rules will now be announced," the man declared deeply. "Alright, go ahead," Tang Wulin complied meekly this time. "This is primarily an exchange, but to enable both sides to demonstrate their full capacities, I as the referee will only end matches when the risk of critical injury, disability, or death occurs. Or if individuals get eliminated. Victory goes to the team with the remaining members after completely defeating the enemy. Clear?" Tang Wulin said, "That is to say, apart from being unable to kill them, anything else is fine. There are no restrictions, right?" As soon as he said this, the six people opposite him glared at him. However, due to the majesty of this person in the air, they did not dare to make a sound. "You can understand it that way." The middle-aged man said indifferently, his eyes flashing with cold light. Chapter 455 Just Kidding Tang Wulin said, "Then can I say a few words before?" "Go ahead," said the middle-aged man. It would be impolite to not let Tang Wulin speak in front of so many spectators. "Firstly, although we're from Shrek, we came here to challenge because we've long admired the strength of the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy. But since we've only been Shrek's students for only one term, we don't represent the academy at all. So we're participating on our own - I must clarify that upfront. We're the worst of the bunch at Shrek, can't represent the academy." "What?" The middle-aged man was shocked. Whether he or the executives of the Imperial Sun Moon Academy, all of them did not expect this little guy in front of them to actually say something like this! In the past hours, they had busily made all sorts of preparations in order to maximize their momentum, and they were very confident about this match. Victory would greatly boost the Imperial Sun Moon Academy's reputation while dealing a huge blow to Shrek's. Yet Tang Wulin's current words completely negated everything. He had pressed their ability to the bottom of Shrek Academy, plus he said that he wasn't competing on behalf of Shrek. That meant that even if the Imperial Sun Moon Academy won, they won't have the desired effect. If they lost, they would lose face! Seeing the harmless smile on Tang Wulin's face, the middle-aged man in the air couldn't hold it in any longer. He controlled his body and descended from the sky, landing in front of Tang Wulin. "You've said that you came to challenge us on behalf of Shrek Academy!" The middle-aged man said angrily. Tang Wulin sighed. A light flashed in his hand as he took out the soul-guiding megaphone before pressing the button. Wu Changkong's cold voice echoed throughout the arena. "Students of the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy, listen! We six from Shrek Academy at an average age of fourteen, challenging your best students under twenty. Our purpose here is to demonstrate the gap between you and the continent's paramount academy!" There isn't a single sentence that says we are representing Shrek Academy in the tournament! We only said that we are from Shrek Academy and that we are about fourteen years old on average. Then they will challenge you. Let me show you the gap between us. But we represent ourselves!" The middle-aged man was so angry that he almost spat out a mouthful of blood. We have prepared so much. And you say this? F*ck! But these little guys in front of him were generally only fourteen years old! How could a fourteen-year-old child come up with such shameless tricks? Although they had been rivals with Shrek Academy for countless years, in the hearts of the Imperial Sun Moon Academy, the strength and dignity of Shrek were beyond doubt. So when Tang Wulin and the others appeared, they didn't even think about it, and they prepared to face them with the strongest lineup, while wanting to strike a blow to the reputation of Shrek Academy to the greatest extent. However, to his surprise, the powerful punch was missed. The middle-aged man wanted to ask when Shrek Academy had become so shameless. But he couldn't say that! He didn't dare to insult Shrek Academy. Tang Wulin blinked, "So, are you going to fight or not? If you surrender, that's okay." The man's battle armor radiated a simmering aura, like a volcano that could erupt at any moment. As a three-word armor master, he was virtually at the Titled Douluo level. Killing Tang Wulin's group would be as easy as winking. "Alright, alright. Just kidding. We represent Shrek Academy. Long live Shrek Academy. We will fight for the glory of Shrek Academy! We will win!" Just as the man was about to explode, Tang Wulin roared those inspiring words full of momentum as he made his declaration. The middle-aged man was dumbfounded, but at the same time, he was relieved. Finally, these brats didn't go on playing tricks, otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to end it! His esteemed Imperial Sun Moon Academy surely wouldn't bully a few children, right? "The match is about to begin." He rose into the air again. "Well, although we represent the academy, what I said just now was right. We are the worst few in the academy." Tang Wulin emphasized. The figure of the middle-aged man who rose into the air tilted and almost fell from the air. With a faint smile, Tang Wulin stepped forward. "I'm Tang Wulin, from Shrek's Outer Court grade one class one." He didn't mention the class monitor this time. The lowest grade in the Outer Court was originally the lowest grade class. Don't underestimate Tang Wulin's words. They had already dissolved much of the arena's morale boost for the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy. Even his opponents' confidence was shaken. "Long Chen!" The leader from Imperial Sun Moon Academy was a tall, handsome teen whose entire body seemed to emanate light. Despite looking only fourteen or fifteen, he already had a mature build. When Tang Wulin had said those words, he had been the only one among the six from the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy who hadn't changed his expression. Young yet steadfast as a mountain. "With your height, you must be over twenty, right?" Tang Wulin asked. If you exceed the age limit, it won't count even if you win." Long Chen regarded him frostily. "I hope your skills match your mouth." Gu Yue stepped up beside Tang Wulin. "Grade one class one of Shrek's Outer Court, Gu Yue!" "Xue Liushuang!" A girl approached Long Chen, also a female. This young girl was extremely beautiful, with a slender figure, standing beside Long Chen, it was a very good match. In terms of appearance and figure, Tang Wulin surpassed Long Chen, although he did not have the same towering figure as Long Chen. Yet Xue Liushuang's gaze lingered on Tang Wulin with apparent interest. "Ye Xinglan." Ye Xinglan walked to the other side of Tang Wulin. The  Imperial Sun Moon Academy's third member stepped forth. "You Dingqi!" This was a young man with an average build. His shoulders were broad, and his arms were strong and muscular, indicating that he was adept at physical strength. "Xie Xie!" "Xu Xiaoyan!" "Xu Lizhi!" The remaining three from Shrek Academy stepped forward at the same time. The other three followed. "Jian Mochen!" It was a fat youth whose figure was on par with Xu Lizhi. "Kuang Zhantian!" A mighty and domineering woman! Yes, a girl with that name - rather unorthodox. Hearing this fierce yet delicate maiden report her name, Tang Wulin nearly suggested she transfer to Shrek. "Weng Daimin!" The last was a gentle, frail-looking girl with short blue hair, who appeared pure and innocent. Six against six, but unlike their previous academy exchanges, neither side voluntarily revealed their soul master type. Only introducing themselves. "Both sides retreat and prepare. One hundred meters back," the referee directed aloft. Having settled his mood, he was placid again. No matter what, if they claimed victory, there was still a lot they could do. At that time, even if Tang Wulin and the others didn't admit to representing Shrek, it would already be too late. After all, they were Shrek Academy's students now. The two sides steadily retreated. Tang Wulin's previously nonchalant expression vanished as he scrutinized the opponents. Around their age yet each exudes a unique aura, and with home advantage, they would be difficult to deal with. He had to be careful. While the six people were retreating, the triangular battle formation had already been set up. On the other side, the six people from the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy also set up their formation. Long Chen was standing at the front. On his two sides were the short and stout You Dingqi and the fat Jian Mochen. Were they agility-type soul masters?  Behind them were Xue Liushuang, Weng Daimin, and Kuang Zhantian. The three of them also stood in a line. Weng Daimin was in the middle. From this formation, one could tell that Weng Daimin was a control-type soul master. As for Xue Liushuang and Kuang Zhantian, they were somewhat unclear.  At one hundred meters, both sides stared at their opponents. "Go!" Chapter 456 Battle Began Along with a loud shout from the middle-aged man, this clash representing the two great academies, and the last of Tang Wulin's final exams for the six of them had finally begun. Tang Wulin didn't immediately charge forth this time, instead releasing his martial soul in sync with his comrades. Abundant purple soul rings arose, three from Tang Wulin himself, flickering brightly. Not much, but at their age it was already considered quite good. Their opponents from Imperial Sun Moon Academy likewise summoned their martial souls. Long Chen strode forward, dragon roars sounding as he grew three inches taller, four soul rings elevating from his feet. - all purple!   Yes, his four soul rings were all purple. This was beyond Tang Wulin's expectations. Such cultivation could already rival Wu Siduo. Long Chen, there really seems to be such a name on the Genius Youths Ranking. It seemed to be a little lower than Wu Siduo. After all, Wu Siduo had a twin martial soul and a soul fusion skill, and the person in front of him only had a single martial soul. To be able to rank about the same as Wu Siduo with just a single martial spirit, it could be seen how strong he was.  He was likely the ace of the Imperial Sun Moon Academy's younger generation. Besides, Long Chen, Jian Mochen, and You Dingqi also summoned their martial souls. You Dingqi's martial spirit was a hammer, but it was not an ordinary hammer. The short handle of the hammer had a long chain coiled around his arm, the Meteor Hammer. Three rings, three purple soul rings. It was indeed extraordinary. At least not four rings though.  Jian Mochen on the other hand had four rings - two yellow, two purple! His martial soul took the shape of a great round shield with intricate patterns. Vaguely, it was possible to be a tiger's head. A defense-type! The massive shield wholly shielded his stocky frame. Among the three women behind them, Xue Liushuang, a four-ringed soul master, all purple soul ring. Weng Daimin, three purple soul rings. Kuang Zhantian, three purple soul rings. Incredible, half of them were four-ringed! This lineup could likely contend with our class' Genius Youth Ranking crew. Tang Wulin praised in his heart. That was all. The six Imperial Sun Moon Academy students were undoubtedly outstanding, but Tang Wulin believed if they faced Wu Siduo's team, the outcome would be uncertain. On the other hand, he and the others were stronger than Wu Siduo's team. While these students were talented, they probably lacked a true understanding of Shrek Academy. "Prodigious" was the only way to describe the current Shrek Outer Court grade one. What Tang Wulin didn't know was that after Shrek Academy had completed its enrollment, some information had still trickled over to Imperial Sun Moon Academy. They knew five Genius Youth Ranking members had enrolled in Shrek, but nothing more. While Tang Wulin and the others were waiting, the Imperial Sun Moon Academy also conducted an investigation. None of the six of them belonged to Genius Youths Ranking. Therefore, it was only natural that they believed that they would win. Long Chen's left foot tapped the ground, shooting towards Tang Wulin as his second soul ring lit up with a sonorous dragon's roar. His second soul skill, Roar of the Dragon! The sound waves seemed to be tangible, and around his body, faint golden light appeared, vaguely resembling a giant dragon. A powerful aura of light erupted. Martial soul, the Radiant Holy Dragon, ace among the  Imperial Sun Moon Academy! He was known as the most promising four-word fighting armor master in the younger generation, and he was definitely a proud son of heaven here. Seeing no four-ringed opponent from Shrek, Long Chen acknowledged Tang Wulin's self-proclaimed "worst" status. Long Chen clearly knew this match was being broadcast live, watched by countless souls. This was the perfect time for him to become famous! What a chance to make his name by trampling these Shrek students and establishing his status in the soul master world! "Heh!" Tang Wulin chuckled, his companions also smiled. With a wave, he indicated for them to hold back and strode forth to meet Long Chen casually. Tang Wulin's three purple soul rings faded, replaced by golden rings with golden scales that emerged once more. "Woo!" Long Chen's Roar of the Dragon's voice became even louder. One vs one, your three rings vs my four rings. Plus my martial soul is Radiant Holy Dragon. "Excellent!" Long Chen was delighted. Defeating the opponent's leader in a one-on-one battle was definitely the best time to show off. Both sides were getting closer and closer, Long Chen suddenly felt that something was wrong. This opponent didn't seem to be affected by his Roar of the Dragon, his eyes were very bright and the way he looked at himself was a bit off, what kind of look was that? Compassion? How dare you pity me! The hundred meters were traversed in a flash. Tang Wulin also took flight, his golden rings bursting as an unrivaled aura of the Golden Dragon King erupted from his body. Long Chen stomped on the ground with his left foot and soared into the sky. He opened his arms and his first soul ring flashed. Dragon Claw! He didn't look down on Tang Wulin. As the number one youth talent of the Imperial Sun Moon Academy, his steady personality prevented underestimating any opponent. Although he knew that he should be able to suppress the other party, he still went all out. Thus, as the first soul ring shone, the fourth soul ring shone as well. Two rings flashed at the same time. This was a high-end technique for soul masters to control their soul rings. The fourth soul skill, Dragon's Power! His Radiant Holy Dragon bloodline surged with power to infuse his body. Dragon claws gleaming, fine scales emerged on his skin - an embryonic dragon armor. Although it was not a true dragon scale, it had already taken shape. He sought to instantly crush Tang Wulin, then decimate the other Shrek students in their despair, establishing unstoppable momentum for his side. By then, even if they claimed to not represent Shrek, they were still Shrek students! No excuses after such devastation. Yet in that instant, Tang Wulin's aura erupted. Their auras intersected before their bodies could. In that instant, Long Chen felt an indescribable sense of fear suddenly appear in the deepest depths of his heart. How is this possible? How can I feel fear? He was filled with confusion, yet the sensation persisted. It felt as if his heart was seized, his bloodline trembling. In front of him, Tang Wulin, who had also soared into the air, seemed to grow taller and taller, as if he was shrinking in size in front of him. The Dragon Claw's strength rapidly declined despite Long Chen gnashing his teeth and pouring soul power to control his quaking. But Tang Wulin's aura was too overwhelming, directly shattering Dragon's Power, which amplified his bloodline's aura. At this moment, his bloodline aura was suppressed, and even the effects of his soul skill were suppressed. This was the difference between bloodlines, and also the reason why Tang Wulin's Golden Dragon King bloodline was so powerful.
