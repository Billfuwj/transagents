Prologue End of the Legend Black clouds covered the sky. The ground was in darkness, with everything around in chaos. The spiral staircases, the bloodstained corpses, armor, weapons, everything was so chaotic, bleak, with the smell of death and danger. Rhode took a deep breath, but he couldn't sense the coldness or smell the blood in the air. After all, this was just a game. Thinking of this, Rhode shook his head with a wry smile. Then, he turned around and looked at his comrades sitting on the ground not far away. At this moment, they were quietly resting, recovering their strength and repairing their weapons. On the surface, it looked the same as usual, but Rhode knew this battle was more challenging than before. "How many people have survived?" He asked in a deep voice. Hearing this question, they looked at each other, and then, a skinny Mage stood up. "Ninety-six, Guild Leader. The Void Dragon instance dungeon is even more dangerous than we imagined. Many of our companions have sacrificed in the former traps. The only fortunate thing is that our classes are still in order." "That's good." Hearing this, Rhode nodded and did not say anything else. The others also fell silent. If it was an ordinary guild, they would have already lost their courage and started to panic. After all, they would face the strongest, most terrifying elite boss, the Void Dragon, which no one had ever conquered. It was the final boss of the third chapter of the online game Dragon Soul Continent. It was also the most terrifying existence until now. Facing such a battle, an ordinary guild would organize at least ten teams to try to challenge it together. But now, Rhode only had ninety-six people, which could hardly form a complete team. But even so, there was no panic or fluster in their eyes, only calmness, confidence, and trust. And the person they trusted so much was now standing on the stairs not far from them. He looked up at the sky with determination on his face. He had a cold scar drawn down from his brow, giving people a feeling of awe. The armor shining with magical color covered the muscular and robust body, as if it was a wall that would never collapse. Of course, they did not trust the man before them because of his serious appearance. No matter how strong he looked, he was just a designed game character. The scar on his forehead could not trace back to the painful memories of the past. It was just a setting choice when designing the face in the game. The real deterrent was his countless honors and achievements. He was the first professional player to reach the top level. He was the first player to reach the top using the widely recognized most challenging class, the Summoning Swordsman. Ever since the launch of Dragon Soul Continent's first chapter, "The Darkness Descends," he had led the guild, relying on his abilities and the terrifying familiarity with all classes, to sweep through three game quarters and gain the first-kill records of all the bosses. His every video about the instance would be forwarded by countless players and considered the teaching classic. He was the Guild Master of the player guild ranking first in Dragon Soul Continent. He was Rhode. He had personally finished "The Darkness Descends," started the new chapter of "The Era of Turmoil," and conquered "The Era of Turmoil" once again, facing "The Void Trial." And now, he would use his hands to end "The Void Trial" once again. However, he would not start a new era by himself anymore. How many years had it been? Rhode withdrew his gaze from the distant sea of clouds that shone with Lightning Snakes and asked himself in his heart. After his younger sister died of illness, he had been in the Dragon Soul Continent for seven years. In these seven years, to force himself to forget the painful past, he repeatedly set almost unreachable goals and achieved them every time. Only the great excitement and glory he received then would dilute the pain deep in his heart. However, he would come to an end now. A month ago, Rhode's parents were on a business trip abroad. Their plane encountered a hurricane, and they died in the crash. Rhode could no longer remember his feeling when he received the call and heard the accident. But now, he had decided to leave this game and return to reality. It was not just for his parents. Rhode knew very well that it was time for him to change. "Guild, Guild Master?" A timid voice interrupted Rhode's memory. He looked up and saw a female Mage in the crowd raising her hand carefully and staring at him with shining eyes. "You, are you really leaving?" "Yes." Rhode nodded. He then adjusted his complicated feelings. He shook his head and looked at his companions again. These were all his memories and achievements from the past seven years. They were the friends he made during the seven years of struggling together. But now, he was finally leaving them. Although in the game, they were so familiar that they could know what each other wanted to do with just a hand gesture. However, once they removed the game helmets and returned to reality, they probably couldn't recognize each other anymore. "I sent out my resume yesterday. I hope to find a company willing to hire me." "If I receive your resume, Guild Master, I will directly arrange for you to be a department manager. Don't worry!" A knight waved the giant sword in his hand. His words also eased the originally somewhat oppressive atmosphere. Everyone laughed out loud. "Thank you for your kindness. Unfortunately, I didn't mention the game on my resume. You should know that our guild has many enemies. If the people from other guilds receive it, my days will not be easy." Rhode replied with a smile. Then, he coughed and became severe. "I think we all know what we experienced all these years." Hearing this, all the people laughing closed their mouths and quietly listened to his words. "We also know many people criticize us on the forums and the Internet. They said we broke the game's balance and monopolized the first-kill records of all the bosses, making the competition no longer meaningful." "Frankly, I don't think their words are wrong, but..." When Rhode said this, he clenched his fist and waved it forcefully. "But this has nothing to do with us! We are the strongest guild. We are the best team! We have the strength! Then we can do it, to compete! The other guilds are not strong enough. It is their problem to be defeated. If they are strong enough, then they can break our monopoly. Our monopoly on the bosses' first-kill records did not rely on rules, status, or flattering the game company. We achieve it with our strength! We never give up, we never accept failure, and we never slack off. That's why we have our current achievements and everything. It is what we deserve. It is just that simple." Rhode paused for a moment before continuing. "I love this guild. I miss the seven years I spent with everyone. However, all good things must come to an end. I should also go to find a life that belongs to myself." "However, I will never forget you, nor will I forget the guild. This place carries my most painful memories, as well as my happiest ones. I will always remember it." As Rhode said, he pointed at his head. "Many people say that this guild can't continue without me. I think quite a few guilds already know the news about my leaving. They are probably planning to wait for me to leave and preparing to defeat the guild and break our records. However, they are looking down on us too much." "Dragon Soul is not a game that only belongs to me. I can't establish a guild by myself. I can't organize a team on my own. And I can never be the first to kill bosses only by myself." "So, after I leave, you can let those people with evil intentions understand why this guild is so strong. Let them know the real strength of our Starlight for ranking first in the Dragon Soul Continent!" "Yes!" "No problem, Guild Master!" "Leave it to us. When the time comes, we will give those idiots a perfect answer!" "Very good." Hearing the answers from the crowd, Rhode nodded and turned to their right side. "Old Lewis." Hearing Rhode's call, the tall and thin Mage walked out of the crowd and came to his side. Rhode looked at the Mage before him and was silent for a moment. Then, he removed the badge on his chest and placed it in his hand.  "The next era belongs to you." Rhode released his hand, and his voice was very calm without the slightest change. "So, you will be in charge of this battle." "Alright, no problem, Rhode." The Mage nodded, but very quickly, he spoke again. "Then, as the Guild Master, as the Guild Leader, I order you to lead the team." "Old Lewis?" Hearing the answer, Rhode could not help but frown in surprise. At this moment, the tall and skinny Mage smiled silently and patted Rhode on the shoulder. "You started this era. To start well and end well. Rhode, it is our principle of doing things." "..." Hearing this sentence, Rhode fell silent. He raised his head and looked at his companions waiting not far away. They were ready and waiting for his orders as usual. Rhode clenched his sword and turned around to face the high platform not far away. There, thunder raged, and a bright light flashed. Then, Rhode raised his long sword and pointed forward. He once had the most ordinary beginning. Now, he would finish it with the most ordinary ending. "Attack the monster!" The Void Dragon was indeed strong. Rhode had once fought against almost all the top bosses in the Dragon Soul Continent, including the other dragon souls in the settings. However, none was more troublesome than the Void Dragon before him. Its attack pattern was even more complicated without any rules. Its damage was several times higher than an ordinary boss, not to mention its super-class speed, reaction, and even defense.  It was indeed an opponent that was impossible to conquer. Rhode held his long sword and clenched his teeth as he stared at the giant monster. The battle had reached the final juncture. He was the only survivor. But even so, Rhode had no more blood left. The dazzling red reminded him that his HP had reached the limit. Wasn't the Void Dragon the same? Looking at the pair of blood-red eyes full of anger, Rhode suddenly had a strange feeling. He seemed to be able to understand the emotions of the Void Dragon. As the strongest boss in the game, it had never been conquered by anyone. Now, it was going to be defeated to the ground. It must feel bitter. Then, let me accompany you to leave. Thinking of this, Rhode raised his left hand. Along with a loud and clear cry, Rhode's sword suddenly emitted burning flames. They circled and turned into a flying firebird. It raised its head towards the sky and rushed towards the Void Dragon before it. Facing this oncoming attack, the Void Dragon also let out a roar. Then, it raised its front claws high and suddenly pounced down. "!!!" Rhode felt his body suddenly shake. A strong force rushed towards him. The firebird cried out in pain and immediately scattered. However, before it disappeared, the powerful explosion also caused the Void Dragon's claws to be pushed back forcefully instead of swinging down. For the moment, its weak point was clear. Rhode clenched his teeth, and the bright red in his eyes became more and more dazzling, indicating that the harm he had suffered had reached the critical point, but now it was not within his consideration. It was the last chance. They would succeed. Or they would lose their game. He raised the sword in his hand and stabbed forward. However, the Void Dragon had already recovered its strength. It roared and waved its claws forcefully again. At the same time, Rhode threw out the long sword in his hand. Thunder Strike, activate! The sword became dazzling light and shot toward the giant dragon's chest. Rhode focused on it and watched as the lightning brilliance shined from the Void Dragon's claws, quickly tearing apart the scales on the dragon's body. "!!!" A loud dragon roar exploded, and then a giant dragon claw slammed into Rhode's body. The bright red light covered the entire world. Rhode could no longer see the scene before him, but the system prompt appearing from the corner was still as clear as ever.    It ended ultimately. Looking at the system prompt, Rhode revealed a gratified smile. Right now, a bright pillar of light descended from the sky and enveloped the high platform. The pure white light lit up the originally dark sky in that split second, dispersing the lingering dark clouds. At that moment, the others reviving from the graveyard and rushing towards the high platform suddenly stopped. The world chatting channel was bustling with noise because Starlight Guild had once again achieved the first-kill record, but now it suddenly quieted down. At that time, there was only one message left. It was a system announcement.  A legend that ruled totally three eras in the game had ended just like this. Chapter 1 A New Journey The wild wind blew through the canyon, creating waves on the grassland. The bison that was chewing on the tender grass raised its head and looked up at the sky. A wooden merchant ship, which was dozens of meters long, was floating there in the air. It was slowly moving forward, with the sail blown full in the wind. "No matter when I see it, this wind tide is always spectacular." A middle-aged man in leather armor stood beside the deck, looking down at the endless grassland and beautiful scenery. "For us merchants, this is a rare business opportunity." Standing next to the middle-aged man was a slightly obese merchant. He had strange curly hair and was wearing a merchant's robe. His two small eyes slightly narrowed as if he was planning something when he watched the scenery. Looking at his expression, it was as if he could even sell this beautiful scenery for money. "Without it, we wouldn't transport the goods into the central area so quickly." "Frankly, I received opposition when I planned to expand the market. But now it seems that my choice was indeed correct." "However, please forgive me for being blunt. You didn't choose a large-scale sailing route. Instead, you chose to come here. Although it will save time, it will be more dangerous. I heard that the other side is not peaceful recently." "Moreover, I think you have heard from the captain. He reminded me that there were Wind Serpents around here. What if..." The man's expression turned serious. He turned his head and looked at the mountain range not far away. The towering mountains blocked his sight, so he could not see what was behind them. However, he could vaguely see that the sky in the distance was not pure blue but showing some gloomy darkness. That was not a world they should set foot in. "Don't worry. There aren't so many ifs. Wealth comes from danger. It is why I spent so much money to hire you!" "They are just a few snakes, aren't they?" The merchant reached out and patted the man's shoulder. "By the way, how is the young man we rescued?" "He is still alive, right?" "Lize has already bandaged his wound. He is currently unconsciously sleeping. His life shouldn't be in danger." "That's good." Hearing the man's answer, the merchant nodded in satisfaction, but he soon frowned. "But how was the young man injured? From the wound, it seems to be a big lizard. But is there such a strange thing in the north of Paphield?" "I don't know, sir. But it should be a very fierce beast. I hope we won't run into it." As he spoke, the man subconsciously glanced at the entrance to the cabin. Then, he turned around again and looked ahead. Rhode opened his eyes. What happened? He stared blankly at the ceiling overhead, his mind in a daze. He remembered that he had been on the high platform of the ruins and led the team to fight with the most powerful boss in the Dragon Soul Continent, the Void Dragon. Moreover, he had successfully gained the first kill record. He was sure that he had received the achievement and the system prompt. Then, the Void Dragon's last attack also took his life. According to the original plan, Rhode should have revived in the cemetery and logged out of the game. However, the moment he was killed by the Void Dragon, the entire world turned pitch-black as if it was forcefully isolated. Then, Rhode lost consciousness. How was it possible? Was there something wrong with the game? Rhode barely turned his head and saw the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. Where was he? What was this place? What exactly happened? Was he still dreaming? Or was he still in the game? At the very least, Rhode was sure this place was not his small rental apartment. At the thought of this, doubts immediately surged into Rhode's mind. He frowned and tried to sit up. "Ah!" At this moment, an acute pain suddenly came from Rhode's chest. He gritted his teeth and stopped moving. At this time, Rhode discovered that his left shoulder and chest were all wrapped in bandages. Although he didn't know what had happened, he knew he was severely injured when seeing the blood stains permeating the bandages. It definitely was not a game! Rhode was sure of this. The technology was quite advanced now. The Dragon Soul Continent, as the world's first virtual online game, also used a lot of high-tech technology. However, according to the rules, players couldn't feel the pain. It was to help them distinguish reality from the game. At the same time, it was to lower the playing threshold for players. When players were injured, instead of feeling the pain, the game would reduce their moving speed, use the red color representing a danger to block the players' sight, and other ways to interfere with them. These were used to warn and remind players instead of simulating real pain. These rules caused a lot of controversies in society when holographic simulation technology had just appeared. The operating company of Dragon Soul Continent should undoubtedly know this. Rhode lowered his head and looked at his right hand. It did not belong to the character he created in the game. It was not the body that fully showed muscles and wildness. On the contrary, his arm was thin and weak. His skin was sickly pale because he had not basked in the sun for a long time. It was his body in reality, and he knew this very well. However, how could he be injured? Moreover, this place did not seem like a hospital. Rhode looked up, and the entire room seemed to be a cabin. There was no light, no phone, and no call bell. A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed to the wall were all the things here. Rhode didn't know why but felt like he had seen this scene somewhere before. Just as Rhode was scrutinizing the room, the door suddenly opened. A blonde girl in a white robe walked into the room. She looked at Rhode, who was half sitting up, and her eyes widened in surprise. "You are awake?" "Great!" The girl did not speak Chinese or English, but Rhode could understand what she was talking about. It surprised Rhode because he knew this language. It was the Nimu language, one of the official languages of the Dragon Soul Continent! "How do you feel? Are you okay?" However, the girl did not care about Rhode's expression. She quickly walked to his side and carefully examined his left shoulder and chest. "Your injuries are serious. Frankly, I'm a little worried if you might hold on..." "This is..." Rhode frowned but didn't know what to say. He turned around and looked at the mirror on the wall. It reflected his face. It was indeed his face without any doubt, but it shouldn't appear here. "Have you forgotten?" The blonde girl blinked her eyes in confusion. The two ponytails swayed slightly along with her movements. Her blue eyes were clear and pure, making her lively. "Two days ago, you fell in the Paphield Plains and suffered quite a serious injury." "If not for the Silver Scale Commerce Chamber's merchant ship passing by, I'm afraid you would be in danger." "I don't know what kind of battle you were in. Your left body was seriously injured. It was dangerous at that time." Wait, left shoulder? Rhode was stunned for a moment. He immediately remembered the last time he fought the Void Dragon. Wasn't his left body attacked? However, his character was injured in the game. It should not affect the player. But now, he was injured? Although the situation was chaotic, Rhode quickly calmed down. He had a good psychological quality as a top player and the best Guild Master in the world. Talking with the blonde girl before him, Rhode learned about his current situation. He was severely injured and fell in the Paphield Plains. The floating ship of the Silver Scale Commerce Chamber happened to pass by and save him. According to the blonde girl, Rhode's situation was not good, but he had a strong recovery ability. "My name is Lize Noel. I am from the Star Moon Mercenary Group. I'm a Cleric." "You can just call me Lize." The girl introduced herself to Rhode frankly. "My name is Rhode Alander." Although he could not sort out the situation, Rhode said his identity and ID in the game after hesitating for a moment. "I am from the Eastern Plains. I'm an adventurer." "Adventurer, I see. That's why you are alone in the deep mountains." Lize was not surprised when hearing Rhode's answer because many adventurers on this continent liked to explore alone. Therefore, there was no big problem with Rhode's identity. "But what are you fighting?" "Why are you so badly injured?" "I remember there shouldn't be any particularly terrifying monsters in this plain." Hearing the girl's question, Rhode smiled bitterly. What could he say? Could he tell Lize he was injured because he was in the battle with the Void Dragon, one of the Five Dragons of Creation? "Because I was attacked at night, I didn't see what they were. There were many of them, and their speed was fast. I thought maybe they were something from the other side." "I understand." Although Rhode did not explain in detail, Lize nodded as if she understood something. Then, she carefully examined Rhode's wound before she stood up. "You haven't eaten anything for two days. I think you must be hungry. Please wait a moment. I will go to get some food immediately." "Ah, right. I should report this matter to the Guild Leader. I think he will come to see you soon." After saying this, the young girl politely nodded at Rhode before turning around and leaving the room. Chapter 2 Holy Sword Card Deck "Ah..." Only then did Rhode let out a long breath and lay back down. After chatting with the girl just now, Rhode could confirm that this was indeed the world of Dragon Soul Continent. Moreover, this was not the era he had experienced before, but an even more distant past, the Twilight Year. When tracking this period of the game, it was when the Dragon Soul Continent had just begun its open beta. How did he come here? Rodin sighed. He shook his head and stopped thinking about these strange and mysterious things. In any case, he had already come here. It was already a fact. Then what should he do next? First, Rhode decided to try what he could do now. He only thought about it before a clear and familiar system prompt appeared in his eyes. It showed his current status and attributes. Rhode. Level 1. Race: Mixed blood. (?) Talent: Locked. Racial Rewards: Locked. Racial Characteristics: Unknown. Locked. Class: Summon Swordsman (Hero Class). Class Skills: Spirit Summoning Art (Mastery Level: E). Swordsmanship: Moon Shadow Swordsmanship (Mastery Level: E) (Available Skill: Blade of Destruction). Other Classes: Alchemist (Occult Creation). Skill: Sculpting Body with Spirit (Mastery Level: E). It was a usual but abnormal attribute panel. Especially when he saw the first item, Rhode almost cried out. Mixed blood? How could he be mixed blood? The so-called mixed blood on the Dragon Soul Continent did not relate to the intermarriage between different human races on Earth. In fact, most characters with mixed blood attributes were born from the marriage between humans and other races. However, Rhode knew very well that he was a human, and even when he created the character in the game, he did not choose any other race. However, why was there a mixed-blood sign on his attribute panel now? Furthermore, there was a question mark in the brackets. It meant that his bloodline had not fully awakened. Therefore, the racial rewards and racial characteristics were also locked. This meant that Rhode had to understand what kind of blood he possessed and awaken the dormant power in his bloodline before he could obtain it. It was a problem for Rhode because the racial rewards generally would be provided after creating the character. For example, the race reward for humans was to shorten the learning time of skills. According to the different human races, anti-poison, raising reputation, and other benefits would also be bonuses. But now, Rhode could no longer have these rewards or characteristics. However, there were still some surprises. Because in the columns about swordsmanship and alchemy, Rhode discovered that except for the essential skills of the character at the first level, he still had the dozen or so swordsmanship and alchemy techniques that he had learned as a player. They were quietly displayed below, but they were all dark. It meant that with Rhode's current ability and level, he couldn't learn or use them. However, Rhode did not have to worry about this. After his strength developed and met the conditions, he would obtain the right to use these swordsmanship and skills again. Of course, the only problem was that the mastery of these sword techniques and skills had also been reduced to the lowest level, E, not SS. However, Rhode did not consider these trivial matters because he greatly valued these skills for their origins instead of their mastery levels. Many sword techniques were quite challenging to learn. He needed to increase their levels and improve their attributes. Most of the time, he must complete a series of missions, enhance his reputation, and find the hidden items coincidentally. These all required much money, time, and even luck. In the game, it was only during Rhode's last year in the Dragon Soul Continent that he completed his character, and thus, he had the confidence to challenge the Void Dragon. Unfortunately, there was as much joy as worry. Despite solving the problem of swordsmanship, Rhode soon discovered that he lost not only his experience, level, and mastery but also the most significant existence for the Summoning Swordsman, the summoned spirit. In the Dragon Soul Continent, the Summoning Swordsman was a controversial class. At first, it was officially launched as a player's exclusive class and thus attracted people's attention. However, after playing the class, players found that its attributes did not belong to magic or martial arts due to its dual cultivation of both sides. Its attack model required the complex calling of the summoned spirits. And the consumption of experience points in leveling up was also considerable. The three aspects account for the players' evaluation of the Summoning Swordsman as one of the worst classes. Considering the names, the Summoning Swordsman's Summoning Spell was no different from a Mage's Summoning Spell. However, the truth was that the two were completely different. A Mage's Summoning Spell was to consume his strength, tear apart space, summon sub-class creatures, and use the power of magic to control them to serve himself. However, the Summoning Swordsman was different. They could not tear apart space, and all the summoned creatures they had came from the real world. One of the Summoning Swordsman's unique abilities was to use the "Spirit Summoning Art" to awaken the souls of items with history, mystery, and Soul Force. Moreover, these things could be sealed and used again with a contract. Although it sounded good and powerful, there were quite a few troubles. Many players were confused by this skill and chose the class of the Summoning Swordsman. In their opinion, they could buy some damaged ancient items from historical remains or commerce chambers at a low price. Then they used the Spirit Summoning Art to call out the souls of those weapons and seal them. In this way, they could obtain a Divine Artifact effortlessly. It was a pity that the dream was beautiful and the reality was cruel. Not to mention that the souls of ancient weapons could only be activated by high-level Spirit Summoning Art. As spirits, their strength was much weaker since they had lost their physical forms. For example, Rhode had once used a Divine Artifact called the "Dragon King's Fury" in the game. After reaching the top level, he summoned the soul from a weapon's remains. However, the weapon condensed was far worse than the weapon created by a forging master at the same level. After that, Rhode spent two years running around the Dragon Soul Continent. After going almost everywhere, he finally activated all the spirit fragments within the weapon and restored it to its original state. Not to mention the time, just the danger in the process could make many people shrink back. Moreover, when using a spirit weapon, one should consume much Soul Force to maintain it. The summoned spirits also needed to consume a large amount of Soul Force. However, the amount of magic energy stored by a Summoned Swordsman was far inferior to that of a Mage. Thus, many Summoned Swordsmen preferred ordinary weapons to the "beautiful" but less helpful spirit weapon. Apart from that, there were three other sources of spirits for the Summoning Swordsman. One was to awaken the Soul Core formed after the death of a magical creature and make it his own summoned spirit. However, this spirit might change because of the owner's attributes and the environment's effects. For example, if a Summoned Swordsman obtained the Soul Core when he killed a Fire Serpent, but he awakened the soul in an icy and snowy world or other environments, or he was wearing the equipment with dark attributes to do it, then even himself was not sure what kind of monster would he call out in the end. It would be fine if it had become a Hydra with the power of darkness. But the owner could only cry if it was an ordinary monster with weakened ability because of the conflicting attributes. The second method of obtaining the summoned spirits was to defeat non-human creatures. After satisfying certain conditions, one could sign a contract and seal them as their summoned spirits. It was also a relatively common way for the Summoning Swordsman, but the flaw was that the summoned creature had too strong self-awareness. It could follow its judgment and rebel against the summoner's orders in the game. Of course, this would not be welcomed by anyone. After all, no one wanted to be more and more chaotic when he summoned the things to help. The last method was to activate the attribute and adjust the talent after level 10. To fuse several summoned spirits to produce a higher-level spirit. To a certain extent, this method controlled the uncertainty of the summoned spirits. As long as one was familiar with the summoned spirits' characteristics, races, and attributes, the owner would likely know what they would become after they fused. But the flaw of this method was also evident. The level of the newly produced summoned spirit was uncertain. Two high-level summoned spirits could possibly fuse and become a new summoned spirit with level 1. It was also likely to be a summoned spirit with a higher level than the owner, so it could not be used. If the situation had been the latter, it would be fine for the player to work hard to level up. But the player probably could only delete the account if it had been the former. Summoned spirits gained experience points from the owner. It was also the main reason why the Summoning Swordsman grew slower than other classes. For the same experience points, other classes could use them all for themselves. However, the Summoning Swordsman had to share the experience points with their summoned spirits to increase their levels. It was challenging to know how much to share. Sharing the experience points with the summoned spirits could increase their levels. However, after reaching a certain degree, as mentioned before, the spirit's evolution would be affected by the environment, the owner's will, and the outside world. So the evolved summoned spirits might differ from what the owner wanted in some situations. And because of the various "deceptive" characteristics, the Summoned Swordsman was "widely recognized" as the "top of the ten most deceptive professions" on the official forum of the Dragon Soul Continent. Some people gave the Summoning Swordsman a very appropriate evaluation. The people who played the Summoning Swordsman were rookies who had never played games and were deceived by the introduction and CG advertising. Or they were casual players who didn't want to compete. They might also be gamblers who would enjoy gambling on their luck. And the last one was... Rhode. Since this game ID had changed from a simple name to a phenomenon, it was easy to know what the players felt when Rhode obtained first place in countless servers with his identity as a Summoning Swordsman. He even kept his records for three consecutive eras. It was hard to express the players' feelings. Ordinary players did not like the random model because they felt they could not control it. However, Rhode was happy with it. Because the unknown brings challenges. That was also why he chose the class of the Summoning Swordsman. In his long gaming career, he had encountered almost all the "deceptive" performances of the Summoned Swordsmen. However, Rhode was never tired of it. It was because overcoming the difficulties made him feel more satisfied. But now, he had spent seven years cultivating dozens of peak-level summoning spirits. All of them had been eliminated. The mysterious summoning circle was still on his right hand, but Rhode could no longer sense any traces of the spirits. However, after thinking about it, it was no wonder. After all, his body did not belong to the game, so he could not expect too much. However... When he thought of this, Rhode's heart skipped a beat. Then, he reached out and touched his chest pocket. Indeed, he soon found a card. It was a white card. It painted a white and perfect long sword wrapped in thorns. It had complicated carvings with beautiful wings folded on the hilt. Just looking at it gave people a pleasant feeling. On the four angles of the card, there were four different marks. A white half-circle was in the upper right corner, and a small X was in the upper left corner. In the lower left and right corners were two small numbers - 3. A mysterious, elegant text slowly appeared on the back when he turned over the card. Eternal Holy Sword, 10th place: Star Mark, no attribute, available to fuse. The dust of history can not bury its dazzling brilliance. Was it still there? Looking at the card in his hand, Rhode was slightly stunned. It was the exclusive equipment for the Summoning Swordsman, the Summoning Card. Moreover, he was very familiar with this card. It was a rare souvenir that the game company had given him when he participated in the game event. After he led the guild to obtain first place in the game for two consecutive quarters, the game company specially made this card to commend this excellent top player. Of course, there were many cards as game merchandise, but he wasn't in the mood to waste money on these things that could only be seen but couldn't be used, so he only had this prize in his hand. Of course, after Rhode got it, he took it with him as a talisman since it didn't take up much space anyway. It was an ordinary commemorative prize, except it was the only one in the world. But at this moment, Rhode saw a faint light from its surface, shining in his hands. Should he give it a try? Rhode only hesitated for a second. Then, he clenched the card tightly with his right hand. The magic circle on his right hand suddenly lit up. The blue magic lines spread out from it and extended to every finger of his right hand. The white card suddenly burst out with a dazzling white light. It turned into specks of light and completely disappeared into the air. At this moment, a system prompt appeared in Rhode's eyes. "You have obtained the Eternal Card Deck 1/10, Eternal Holy Sword, 10th place - Star Mark." "Ah..." Looking at this system prompt, Rhode sighed with some complicated feelings. Although he did not know why the ordinary cards in the original world had displayed Summoning Card's function here, it was the most helpful thing for him now. Finding a weapon that could increase the ability with two points before Level 15 was rare in the game. However, the "Star Mark" increased the number of attributes by three points. It was enough for the Summoned Swordsman, who was originally almost useless, to compare with the real swordsman. Considering its ability to fuse, it meant that as long as he found a suitable spirit, he could transform it into a weapon with attributes. Summoning cards need the owner to consume magic force to use them, making them inferior to ordinary weapons. However, the rare equipment was already powerful when considering the attack power. But it was hard for Rhode to be excited because the situation he was involved in was too strange. Was it a game? Or reality? If this was reality, then where should he go? "Knock. Knock." Just then, there was a knock on the door. Rhode looked up and saw a middle-aged man pushing the door open. He wore an adventurer's leather armor and casually combed back his long red hair. The man smiled when he saw Rhode. "Hello, sir. I am the Guild Leader of the Star Moon Mercenaries, Carter." Chapter 3 Be Attacked "Hello, Mr. Carter." Rhode raised his head and greeted the man before him with a smile. "Thank you for saving me." "It was nothing. Don't worry about it." He had a muscular body and a tall stature. He combed his bright red hair back messily. From his physical features, he should be one of the people from the Northwest Sand Region, Leicate. Two long swords, one long and one short, were quietly hanging on both sides of his waist. The fortitude and scrutiny on the angular face could prove this man was not ordinary. While Rhode was observing him, Carter was also secretly sizing up the man. His appearance alone made it easy to think he was an ignorant aristocratic child. It was no wonder. Looking at his thin figure, pale skin, womanly face, and clothes, he did not look like an adventurer on a journey. Instead, he looked more like those rich second generations who pursued excitement all day and were bored to come out to play. However, Carter believed that this young man was not that simple. The reason was the strange and mysterious magic circle on his right hand. As a Cleric, Lize could sense magic from it. It meant that it was not some random sign. However, with Carter's many years of experience, he rarely saw anyone directly tattooed a magic circle on his body. Thus, it could be seen that the young man's identity was not simple. And from the previous short conversation, Carter had noticed that this young man's attitude was neither arrogant nor humble. And his expression was very calm. Lize said he had just awakened from a coma for about ten minutes. But he could calmly deal with his current situation. Considering this point alone, he was better than those ignorant and arrogant young nobles. "I heard that you are from the Eastern Plains?" "Yes." Rhode nodded slightly. "So, where do you plan to go?" "I'm just traveling around." Rhode shrugged. "I'm an adventurer. It's my life to explore around freely." "Of course, don't worry. I won't bring you any trouble." "That's good." Since Rhode was so wise, Carter did not say much. They were still on a mission and wanted to avoid meeting new problems. So, after chatting a bit more and letting him rest and recuperate, Carter did not say anything else and quickly left. After all, he still had a lot of things to do as the mercenary group's leader. He couldn't waste time here. The following days were peaceful for Rhode. However, the food that Lize brought him made him a little interested. It was just ordinary white bread and jerky, and Rhode had eaten them many times in the game. But they were all "fake food" in the past. Their function was to restore the character's HP and MP. They were not delicious, nor could they fill him up. It was a new experience for him to taste the white bread and jerky described in the food annotations. But he had to say that the taste was not as good as described in the annotations. "How do you feel? Does your wound still hurt?" Sitting beside Rhode, the blonde girl looked at the young man worriedly and carefully. Her slightly worried gaze fell on his shoulder. She could not bear to see it. "I'm fine now." Rhode said. At the same time, he clenched his left hand. The pain from his sternum was no longer as intense as it was at first. In the beginning, he even found it difficult to breathe. But now, he felt much better. "That's good." Hearing Rhode's answer, Lize's nervous expression relaxed a lot. "But you still need to rest more. When we reach Deep Stone City, the conditions will be much better. Your injuries may heal faster." The young girl's expression was severe. Although the person lying before her was just a stranger she had just met, looking at her expression, it was clear that she did not care about this trivial matter. "Thank you." "You're welcome. It is what I should do." As she said, Lize stood up. The two blonde, fluffy ponytails swayed along with her movements, giving off a playful and lively feeling. "Then..." Lize didn't finish her sentence because the hull suddenly shook. The girl's body swayed, and she almost fell on the bed. Fortunately, she reached out her hand at the last moment and barely stood firm by holding the bedhead. The two looked at each other and saw a hint of doubt in each other's eyes. The floating ship moved with the force of the wind tide and couldn't encounter any reef or vortex because the sky was not like an ocean. But it was not necessarily safe. The current situation was unusual. "I'll take a look. You can rest in peace here. Don't worry." Lize said in a low voice. Then, she immediately turned around and closed the door. Looking at her back, Rhode did not know whether to laugh or cry. He opened his mouth but did not say anything. He looked older than her anyway. Did she need to talk to him with the tone to coax a child? But the next moment, a figure flew past the window, causing Rhode's expression to become severe. He turned his head slightly and carefully stared out of the window. Soon, another three or four green figures flashed by from outside. At the same time, a series of low sounds seemingly appeared. "Hiss …" Rhode's heart sank when he heard this voice. They were in big trouble! But at this moment, the deck was already in chaos. "I didn't expect we would meet these damn things." The red-haired mercenary leader held two swords, stood at the front, and looked at the green figures flying around the floating ship with a severe expression. They looked like snakes with bat wings. Each of them was about a meter long. Although their thin bodies seemed weak, the sharp fangs revealed from their open mouths could overturn this conclusion quickly. Wind Serpents. "We seem to have broken into the Wind Serpent's territory." The fat merchant hid beside the mercenary leader, his face pale. He trembled as he wiped the sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief. "Damn it, that cunning Bichel, I knew it. I knew something was wrong when the bastard told me such a route with little money!" "This was murder!" "After I return, I will let him know how powerful I am!" "Let's talk after we get out of the encirclement!" Carter interrupted the fat merchant's hysterical roar. He looked around and saw hundreds of Wind Serpents surrounding the merchant ship. At first, he could order his men to use the crossbows to attack, trying to scare away these monsters. However, the spirit of the Wind Serpent to "kill or die" was beyond his imagination. In other words, their companions' deaths stimulated these monsters' vicious nature. At this moment, they had already occupied the outer deck and began to break in. As for the mercenaries, they had already thrown away the crossbows in their hands. They brandished their weapons and engaged in close combat with the monsters. "Hide inside. Tell the captain we must leave this place as soon as possible!" Carter pushed the fat merchant into the captain's cabin behind him. Then he took two steps forward, and the long sword in his hands waved with shining snowy light, chopping a roaring Wind Serpent to the ground. But soon, the second one rushed up. There were too few people! Carter could not help but frown. He glanced around the deck. He had only brought six people with him on this mission and only had them left now. Although the merchant ship had guards, they did not have much experience. In fact, in the first wave of attacks, one-third of the guards on the merchant ship had been killed. Now, only half of them were left. Looking at their flustered appearance, they probably would not hold on for long. When he looked at those terrifying monsters, Carter's face was solemn. It was not that he had never faced Wind Serpents before, but it was the first time he had faced such a number. It also made Carter feel a little nervous. He took half a step forward again. His body nimbly turned half a circle, and then his two swords suddenly slashed to the side, heavily cutting the body of the Wind Serpent. With a splash of blood, the injured Wind Serpent fell to the ground. After it let out a few unwilling roars, it turned into a cold corpse. Carter looked up and subconsciously glanced around. Then, his heart suddenly missed a beat. "Lize!" "Be careful!" The girl did not react immediately. Her hands just dropped after healing a mercenary. Because of excessive consumption of spirit, she was still in a trance. She had only rushed to the deck for a few minutes but saw several injured people. Lize naturally took the responsibility as the only Cleric with the healing ability. After hearing Carter's warning, the girl turned around blankly. Then, all she saw was a large mouth that was wide open, revealing sharp fangs. In that instant, the young girl's blood froze. She stared blankly at the Wind Serpent, her mind completely blank, not knowing how to react. In her eyes, Lize could see the sharp fangs shining with a cold light and the fleshy inner mouths. Even the smell of the stench was so explicit. At this moment, a hand suddenly reached out from behind and grabbed Lize by her collar, pulling her away at the critical moment. Chapter 4 Fierce Battle The Wind Serpent bit empty air. It was about to succeed if not for Rhode suddenly appearing from behind. "Mr. Rhode?" Lize raised her head and was surprised to find that Rhode was standing behind her, and she was leaning against his chest. She didn't know if it was because she was shocked, but she found that her entire body was soft and couldn't exert strength. She subconsciously wanted to stand up, but her legs softened and she sat down instead. "Lize!" When Carter saw that Lize had escaped from death, he heaved a sigh of relief. But soon, his heart became tense again. Because at this moment, the Wind Serpent that had missed its target had already turned around, spread its wings, and raised its head, ready to launch another attack. Damn it! He held his swords and ran to the two, hoping to arrive soon. But no matter how he tried, he could not catch up. Looking at the Wind Serpent again, the young girl could not help but hold her breath. She wanted to do something but did not know what to do. As a Cleric, she did not need to use weapons, and she did not carry any weapons with her. So, what should she do now? "Leave it to me." Just as Lize was panicking, she heard Rhode's voice. Then, she saw Rhode take half a step forward and shield her. Did he plan to fight this Wind Serpent with his bare hands? Just as Lize was puzzled, she saw Rhode extend his right hand. At this moment, Lize noticed that a complicated and gorgeous magic circle was shining on Rhode's right hand with a bright and clear magical brilliance. Lines spread from it and extended to every finger. A translucent, card-like thing gradually emerged from the center of Rhode's palm. Then, Rhode turned his wrist to grip it. White, dazzling light suddenly appeared. The invisible magic power broke the seal, becoming a tangible air wave that spread everywhere. The Wind Serpent, the first to bear the brunt, screamed and flapped its wings, trying to maintain balance under the violent air current. However, before it could move further, a dazzling brilliance appeared from the airwave and heavily slashed at the Wind Serpent's body, beating it away. "Ha..." Rhode let out a light breath. At this moment, the dazzling light had already dissipated. What replaced it was an incomparably exquisite, pure white longsword, which appeared in his right hand. He waved the Star Mark Sword. The light pecks slowly scattered down from the sword, creating a fascinating scene. He did not notice that the others were utterly stunned. Lize sat on the ground and stared in disbelief at the man before her. Carter also slowed down and looked at Rhode with shock and surprise. Although he had long noticed that the man was not ordinary, he never thought he would be so "extraordinary." Although sitting on the ground, Lize couldn't help but admire the pure white longsword. The slender sword was engraved with ancient patterns and emitted a faint radiance. Around it, beautiful and fantastic specks of light could be seen with the naked eye. The closed wings on the hilt were even more exquisite. Even the feathers were visible. Although women were seldom interested in weapons, this long sword was far beyond the scope of weapons. It was even a work of art. Lize was purely admiring it, but Carter's looks were different now. As an experienced adventurer, Carter could swear he had never seen such a strange thing. When Rhode summoned his weapon, Carter was stunned. Although he had seen some Mages summon before, most used crystal-type items. Moreover, they also needed to chant some ancient and strange incantations and then summon a few ugly monsters. It was common. But as for summoning a weapon? He had never seen such a scene before. Although he wasn't sure what Rhode was holding, Carter knew that ordinary people could not use such a magic weapon. Those qualified to use this weapon must be people of noble and special status. Seeing the lifelike wings on the sword hilt, Carter could not help but frown. Of course, he knew very well that angels were a noble race on this continent. Most of them had prominent statuses or were the backbone of some influential groups. Like Lydia Paphield Mira Frandrica. She ascended the throne three years ago and became the Lord of the Munn Kingdom. She was an angel. Although he did not know the young man's true identity yet, he could be sure that he had some connection with that noble race when judging from this sword. These thoughts only flashed through Carter's mind when he had come to them. "Are you alright?" "I, I'm fine." Lize's little face was still pale. She couldn't be blamed for being timid. After all, if Rhode hadn't pulled her from behind, the girl would have died. The fear of barely escaping from the God of Death's scythe was not something ordinary people could experience and understand. After confirming that Lize was not injured, Carter immediately shifted his gaze to Rhode. "Mr. Rhode, are you alright?" Rhode shook his head, indicating that he was fine. Although his left body was still in pain when he moved, it didn't impact the battle much. In fact, compared to his own body, he was more concerned about another matter. "What are you going to do?" There were more and more Wind Serpents around. Although the floating ship was moving at full speed, it could not escape the attacks of most Wind Serpents. Their situation was not getting better but becoming worse and worse. "We plan to break out of their territory. Before that, we can only persevere in the fight." If it was on land, Carter might have other ways, the problem was that he was in the air now, and besides this idea, he had no good way to deal with the current situation. But just as Carter spoke, he saw the young man frown. "We can't do it, Mr. Carter." "Oh?" "Wind Serpents have the absolute advantage in the plains. Even if you speed up, we cannot leave before the floating ship crashes." "Really?" Carter was not stupid. The reason why he made this decision was that he was not familiar with this place. As soon as he heard Rhode explain it, he immediately understood the seriousness of the matter. "Then what should we do?" "Fly down immediately." Rhode answered without hesitation. Then, he stretched out his hand and pointed to the side. "Then, let's rush inside." Carter looked in the direction of Rhode's finger. Then, his eyes widened in surprise. "You mean that we rush into the Dusk Forest?" "This is our only way to get rid of the Wind Serpent's attack. And..." When Rhode said this, he glanced around. "We don't have much time left." The situation was indeed worsening. The threat of Wind Serpents was not only their fangs but their deadly corrosive venom. Moreover, since they were small, they would immediately change their target once they could not win a direct attack. Quite a few Wind Serpents had already broken through the glass and drilled into the cabin from below, but people could not resist in the face of such a situation. Although the narrow space in the cabin limited the flexibility of the Wind Serpents, their threat did not decrease. Because of such a situation, the ship's interior was already a mess. The thick smoke came out from a few cracks. The current situation was entirely terrible! Carter did not hesitate any longer and immediately turned to leave. Rhode held the Star Mark and blocked the crack before him. "Hiss!" A Wind Serpent flew from the right and attacked Rhode with its mouth wide open. However, Rhode had already moved to the left when it rushed over. At the same time, the white longsword in his hand suddenly rose and struck the Wind Serpent's chin. As it was sent flying, he also blocked the venom that Wind Serpent had sprayed out in a hurry. Then, Rhode quickly turned around. The silver light in his hand flashed through the air and accurately stabbed into the wing of another Wind Serpent, which tried to sneak attack him from behind. While it lost its balance, he made another slash, ultimately ending the life of this poor snake. However, the attacks of the Wind Serpents did not stop because of this. The smell of blood stimulated them. Just as Rhode pulled out his sword from the corpse of the Wind Serpent, dozens of Wind Serpents pounced on him. They were stacked on top of each other's bodies. From a distance, they looked like a green cloud, or the mouth of some unknown monster that could instantly swallow its prey. "Mr. Rhode!" After healing the poison for the other mercenary, Lize turned around and saw this scene. She couldn't help but cry out instantly. Acid venom sprayed out like a storm toward Rhode. If hit by this acid rain, even if Rhode didn't die, he would lose half of his life. But at this moment, Rhode suddenly retreated. The corrosive acid venom missed him and dripped onto the deck. As it emitted green smoke, it corroded small holes on the deck. However, almost at the same time, the group of Wind Serpents had already rushed toward Rhode. They were about to tear apart this dangerous and hateful person the next moment. If he were an ordinary person, he should have been scared stiff by this scene. However, Rhode was calm as he faced this group of monsters that pounced on him and intended to tear him apart. He only raised his sword with his right hand and then stabbed forward. Blade of Destruction, activate. White blades of light exploded among the Wind Serpents. One turned into two, two into four. Several light edges shot forward at lightning speed, piercing through one Wind Serpent after another. The powerful air current was like an invisible giant hand, sweeping away those serpents not hit by the light and ruthlessly tearing their bodies apart. The dazzling brilliance almost instantly tore the green mist apart, leaving only pieces of flesh and blood. Everyone held their breath at this moment. Chapter 5 Danger The fierce attacks of the Wind Serpents slowed down, and the deck, which was initially chaotic with anger, shouts, and screams, suddenly became silent for a moment. Everyone looked at the young man with incredible looks, not knowing what to say. At that moment, almost everyone thought this young man would die because they had never seen anyone who could escape unscathed under the siege of dozens of Wind Serpents. Of course, those senior classes or warriors with full armor could probably do this. But this young man didn't look old. Besides his white longsword, he had no protective equipment. But he did it. At this moment, the mercenaries and even Lize and Carter could not help but stare blankly at the young man and have mixed feelings. Who was he? It was unknown whether they were intimidated by Rhode's attack, but the Wind Serpents, desperately attacking the floating ship, all scattered and retreated instantly. For a moment, the entire deck was so quiet that nothing could be heard except the whistling wind. The mercenaries were shocked by Rhode's performance. However, Rhode didn't care about what he had done. On the contrary, he stared at the dead snakes beneath his feet and thought the situation was dangerous. Wind Serpents were the lowest-level monsters. They were not strong but could win with the numbers. The class of Rhode as the Summoning Swordsman was good at solo battle. However, a solo fight with many monsters was still challenging. It was so successful this time because the Star Mark in his hand could add additional attributes by three points. It meant that Rhode's attributes could increase by three points when he held this sword. The increase of three points was enough to reduce the danger level of a monster from alarming red to green. Therefore, it was not surprising when Rhode eliminated this group of Wind Serpents. However, Rhode still felt strange when he thought of this. According to his human attributes, even if he had the Star Mark, he shouldn't have obtained such an overwhelming advantage to defeat the snakes swiftly and efficiently. According to his original estimation, the Blade of Destruction should have hurt those Wind Serpents seriously. Therefore, he was already prepared to kill them with more attacks. But he did not expect this Blade of Destruction's power to be far beyond his imagination and directly kill this group of Wind Serpents. Could his attributes not be calculated according to the race of humans? Thinking of this, Rhode subconsciously checked his attribute panel. However, he didn't know how to check it. Before his race was unlocked, his attribute was hidden and could not be checked. Fortunately, this battle had given him 1,900 experience points. He did not expect to receive experience points. It surprised Rhode. Of course, Rhode just thought about it for two or three seconds. Others thought he only stared at the pile of dead snakes at his feet and kept silent for a moment before raising his head again. At this moment, Rhode discovered a strange silence around him. It wasn't because the others were shocked. There was some more dangerous and deadly existence. Where were the Wind Serpents? This thought flashed through Rhode's mind, and then he seemed to remember something. So he quickly turned around and shouted. "Everyone, be careful!" At this moment, the floating ship suddenly shook. The violent shaking caused many people to fall to the ground, and there were even two unlucky people who didn't have time to stand firm, directly losing balance and falling off. At the same time, the bow's deck emitted a crisp cracking sound, and then a giant snake's head poked out from it. "Everyone, be careful! It's the Wind Serpent Lord!" At this time, Carter finally appeared. He shouted, pulled out the two swords, and rushed towards the giant Wind Serpent. The other mercenaries also hurriedly stood up at this moment. Although they were seriously injured, they still gritted their teeth and followed their leader, trying to attack this giant monster. However, Rhode moved faster than them. He crouched down, and lines of system prompts immediately appeared in front of his eyes. "Experience Points: 1,900/200. Level Up. Skill Points: 1. Level 2." "Experience Points: 1,700/400. Level Up. Skill Points: 2. Level 3." "Experience Points: 1,300/600. Skill Points: 3. Level 4." "Experience Points: 800/1,000. Skill Points: 4. Level 5." "Used 1 Skill Point to enhance the Moon Shadow Swordsmanship by 1/3. Mastery Level E." "Used 1 Skill Point to enhance the Moon Shadow Swordsmanship 2/3. Mastery Level E." "Used 1 Skill Point to enhance the Moon Shadow Swordsmanship by 3/3. Mastery Level: E." "Used 1 Skill Point to enhance the Moon Shadow Swordsmanship by 1/4, Mastery Level D. Shadow Flash was unlocked." Activate. Rhode leaped up. At that moment, everyone felt their vision blur. Then, they saw the young man who was originally standing on the ground turn into a black shadow. Like a sharp blade, he tore through the sky and rushed forward. Even the huge Wind Serpent Lord didn't have time to react. When Rhode leaped up and arrived before it, it even had doubts. It was apparent that it had never encountered such a strange situation when the prey jumped up to its mouth. Rhode raised his sword. In that instant, the brilliance of the Star Mark seemed to condense by an invisible force and shine on the white and perfect sword body. Then, he aimed at the Wind Serpent Lord's bell-sized eyes and stabbed down. "Blade of Destruction!" When it faced the oncoming sword light, the first reaction of the Wind Serpent Lord was to dodge. After increasing the mastery of the Moon Shadow Swordsmanship by four levels, the Blade of Destruction increased its amount and strength. Dozens of silvery-white light blades exploded from the sword instantly, circling and shooting forward. One, two, three... In the beginning, the Wind Serpent Lord's hard scales barely blocked the blade of light. However, even with its Lord-level defenses, it only held on until the twentieth sword beam before it fell down. Then, the following sword light quickly tore apart the scales and flesh, piercing through its body. Although the Wind Serpent Lord's body was huge, Rhode cleverly chose a point to break through. Under his control, the blades of light did not disperse like before but focused on the monster's neck and successfully broke its defense. "!" The Wind Serpent Lord let out a sharp cry and then fell heavily. Even so, it had no intention of giving up attacking. Although the left side of its neck had become bloody, the Wind Serpent Lord still raised its head and stared at Rhode. Then, it suddenly opened its mouth. Rhode's figure flashed and again turned into a phantom as he retreated. At the same time, the stinky venom shot up and brushed past Rhode's remnant shadow, spraying onto the mast behind him. Soon, under the corrosion of the poison, the thick and solid mast completely melted in just a few seconds and then collapsed. It deserved to be a BOSS monster. According to Rhode's experience in the game, the average level of the Wind Serpent was around Level 3, and its leader was generally at Level 10. This BOSS monster in front of him shouldn't exceed Level 10. It wasn't difficult for him to defeat this BOSS monster with the help of Carter and the mercenaries. But he could tell this wasn't an ordinary Lord-level monster but an Elite-level monster. After all, if it were just a normal Lord-level monster, Rhode's attack would have been enough to cut off its wings just now. But, even though Rhode had exerted all his force, he had only left a visible deep wound. The problem was already apparent. "Attack its wings! Stay away from its mouth! Attack it from its side!" While instructing Carter and the other mercenaries, Rhode fought the Wind Serpent Lord. He was a Summoning Swordsman and could not be the Master Tank. But the others seemed to have no experience fighting with the Wind Serpent Lord. In the game, they could still restart when they died due to the lack of experience, but Rhode was unwilling to take this risk here. The wound that had healed on his left chest now seemed to burn in pain and split open again. If they were to die here, they would be a joke, and they wouldn't even be able to regret it. Although he was only at Level 5, Rhode was confident he could fight as long as his opponents were not above Level 15. After all, in the Dragon Soul Continent, three classes were famous for killing monsters above their levels: Mages, Rangers, and the last one was the Summoning Swordsman. Mages were famous for their unpredictable spells, while Rangers were good at the "kiting" skill from a long distance. As for the Summoning Swordsmen, they fought with the advantage of numbers. These three classes could easily defeat the boss stronger by five levels and even kill the non-elite BOSS whose level was not higher than theirs by ten levels. Although that was the case, the three classes had their flaws. Mages without magic were no different from targets. Even a group of low-level Elves could beat them to death. Rangers would suffer a lot when they faced close combat. Summoning Swordsmen faced too much randomness, and the operation was so complicated that there was almost no reliable pattern. This was also the reason why these three classes had yet to rank at the top of the game. It was the realistic setting of the Dragon Soul Continent. To take an unusual road or walk steadily forward, the players could decide their fate and future. Currently, the Wind Serpent Lord was a Level 10 Elite BOSS. However, because of the attribute of his Star Mark, its defense was at most at Level 6 or 7. Therefore, Rhode didn't have to worry about the damage. However, in terms of the attack... "Wham!" The violent wind rose from the ground. Rhode's figure suddenly swayed, and he quickly dodged and retreated, leaving a series of shadows. Only then did he manage to avoid its attack with its waving wings. The wings that had missed him hit the deck heavily, immediately creating a large hole in the solid deck. It was indeed the attack power of a Level 10 Elite BOSS monster. Rhode wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead. He was only Level 5 now, and he did not have any equipment. Once he suffered the attack, he thought that even the gods could not save him. He was also worried about Carter and the others. Fortunately, the Wind Serpent Lord focused all hatred on him for the time being, perhaps because he had seriously hurt it. But what was unfortunate was that the boss targeted him with such high attack power. For the non-tank class, he had much pressure... His Soul Force had been reduced to only one-third. Rhode was already feeling a little tired. He had predicted that the battle would be tough when he saw the Wind Serpent Lord, but the pressure was so much. He needed to use Shadow Flash to dodge the attack. Because with his current speed, dodging the Wind Serpent Lord's attack was impossible. But at the same time, he also needed to use the Blade of Destruction to defeat this troublesome existence in the shortest time possible. But now, the task seemed to be not easy. The floating ship was slowly lowering its altitude, but under the attack of the Wind Serpent Lord, it swayed from time to time, like a small boat in a stormy sea, making people feel nervous and scared. Two mercenaries were already thrown out. They couldn't survive in such a situation. Carter was still trying his best to drive away the Wind Serpent Lord. He used two swords to attack the side of the Wind Serpent Lord nimbly, but the effect was not very good. If not for Lize healing these mercenaries with the Healing Light, they probably couldn't persevere until now. He had to think of a method. Otherwise, before the floating ship could land, he would probably be torn apart by this damn snake. Thinking of this, Rhode bit his lips. The Wind Serpent Lord's attack did not weaken. The wings on its side extended, and the two claws on the upper body tightly grabbed onto the edge of the bow. Although Rhode's previous attack had caused considerable damage to it, as a Lord-level monster, it was undoubtedly impossible to retreat just because of this injury. On the contrary, the cunning Wind Serpent Lord seemed to have noticed the enemy's weakness. Its two sharp claws grabbed the outer wall of the floating ship, shaking and pulling the prey in its hands. Although the hull of the floating ship was not fragile, it was seriously damaged from the previous battle with the Wind Serpents. In addition, the roaring wind waves swept the ship's hull, causing it to twist and deform. There were even several cracks on the deck, which could make people tremble with fear. "My god! My god!" The fat merchant curled up in the corner of the captain's room, his body trembling as he stared at the terrifying Wind Serpent Lord outside. Because of his nervousness and fear, his voice had become somewhat distorted. "That damned Richard! Don't let me meet him, or I will take his life! Tell me such a route. This is murder!" After he said this, the fat merchant suddenly trembled and stared at the captain beside him. "And you! Such a terrifying thing. Why didn't you remind me earlier?" The captain did not respond to the fat merchant's angry shout. At this moment, he was clenching his steering wheel and staring straight ahead. At the same time, he cursed this damn bastard in his heart. He had reminded him that if he took this route at this time of the year, he would probably provoke the Wind Serpents, but he did not care. Now, when he was about to die, he blamed him! If he had known the situation earlier, he wouldn't have taken this job even if he had been beaten to death! Chapter 6 Fall The situation was not good. Both Rhode and Carter had the same thought at this moment. This Wind Serpent Lord was difficult to deal with. Although the floating ship was rapidly descending and they could see the forest not far away, it would probably collapse in the air before landing on the ground! "Ah!" Carter flew forward. The two swords in his hands drew two cold lights in the air, stabbing straight at the claws of the Wind Serpent Lord. But just as he was about to succeed, the Wind Serpent Lord suddenly opened its mouth. Carter only felt a foul smell coming at him. He didn't even have time to confirm before rolling on the ground. He dodged the Wind Serpent Lord's bite, but his attack failed. However, just as Carter stood up and tried to retreat, the Wind Serpent Lord seemed to feel that this little bug was too annoying and suddenly attacked him with a claw. Carter, who had not expected that the Wind Serpent Lord would release the hull, was caught off guard. He subconsciously raised his two swords to block but was still hit flying. After sliding a few meters on the deck, he crashed into the mast and stopped. It could not go on like this. Rhode frowned, then he looked at the anxious girl behind him. "Lize, I need your help!" "Eh?" "I will distract it. I hope you can cast a Shield of Protection for me when it attacks me!" "Alright!" Hearing Rhode's words, Lize nodded without hesitation. She held her hands tightly. Bright and soft light floated above her body. Seeing this scene, Rhode did not say anything else. He only turned his head, raised his sword, and stabbed forward instantly. Blade of Destruction. Once again, a flash and shining light blade streaked across the sky and heavily struck the Wind Serpent Lord. Rhode did not consciously condense the light blade this time, instead allowing it to disperse and attack, so its power was weaker than before. Thus, it could not pierce through the Wind Serpent Lord's scales. However, the scattered attacks left bloody marks on the thin membrane of the Wind Serpent Lord's wings. It caused the Wind Serpent Lord to cry in pain, "Hiss!" The Wind Serpent Lord suddenly stopped moving. It quickly turned around, and its two bright red eyes burned with anger. It stared at the young human on the deck. Then, it opened its mouth again and rushed towards Rhode. The Wind Serpent Lord moved quickly. Rhode could see its open blood-red mouth above his head in the blink of an eye. Rhode tensed up because of the risky choice. He deliberately did not use Shadow Flash but maintained a relatively slow speed to lure the Wind Serpent Lord to attack first. It would be perilous when the enemy attacked with full force. But its weakness would also become clear in the process. It was the opportunity that Rhode wanted to seize! The Wind Serpent Lord's bloody mouth was right before his eyes. In just a few seconds, it could swallow Rhode. However, it still failed to achieve its goal. Because at this moment, a faint egg-shaped barrier shining with white light suddenly appeared on Rhode's body and blocked the sharp teeth of the Wind Serpent Lord. The Wind Serpent Lord slowed down and crushed the barrier instantly, but it didn't bite anything. Because when the Shield of Protection covered him, Rhode had already activated the Shadow Flash. He dodged the Wind Serpent Lord's bite like a ghostly shadow. Then, he raised the pure white longsword and slashed it across its throat. It was the Wind Serpent Lord's weakness and the fatal part of its entire body. However, it had always shrunk its neck, so it wasn't easy to be attacked. This time, the Wind Serpent Lord, enraged by Rhode, ultimately exerted its full force to attack. Because of this, it no longer had the time to protect its most fatal weakness. "!" A sharp cry rang out, and the Wind Serpent Lord looked up as if lightning struck it. At its throat, dirty blood sprayed out, covering the entire deck. Then, its body went limp, and it fell heavily onto the deck. There was no longer any aura left. And at this moment, Rhode also saw a deep green rapidly expanding in front of his eyes. "Boom!" Then, he felt the body of the ship shake, and his body seemed to float in the air in an instant. Then, Rhode's vision went black, and he completely lost consciousness. When he woke up again, the first thing he felt was a bone-piercing cold wind. "I am..." After opening his eyes, the first thing that he saw was a beautiful night sky. Unlike ordinary nights, the night here was very "bright." The soft moonlight shone down, reflecting the shadow of every leaf on the ground. In the night sky, in addition to the shining stars, streaks of light appeared. They condensed into a ribbon of light that extended in all directions. It was the characteristic of the Dragon Soul Continent. According to the legends of ancient times, it was initially a chaotic and dangerous space. Then, the five giant dragons came here, using their bodies to create the sky, the earth, and everything in this initially empty space. And to suppress the chaos, the five giant dragons, after creating the world with their bodies, also sacrificed their souls to resist the evil and chaotic power and safeguard the order of this world. Every dragon spirit had its unique form. Just like the sky above Rhode's head, it represented the protection zone of the Light Dragon Spirit. Its characteristic was that there would be light shining even at night. In contrast, there was a protection zone of the Dark Dragon Spirit. Even in the daytime, it was also dark, without any light there. Because of this, the distribution of species on the continent had its own rules. All kinds of green plants grew in the region guarded by the Light Dragon Spirit. But only those nocturnal plants could be seen in the Dark Dragon Spirit's region. Of course, this characteristic also affected the distribution of the various races on the continent. Most humans lived under the protection of the Light Dragon Spirit, followed by elves and angels. As for the undead, the blood-sucking species, and the nightmare races, they naturally became residents of the Country of Darkness. There were no gods on this continent. Frankly speaking, the five dragons that created the world were the gods they believed in. Similarly, the holders of the Dragon Spirits were also included. The souls all had their cores. Even the giant dragons that created the world were no exception. Their Soul Cores would be attached to a specific person. Then the person could use this power to influence the protection of the Dragon Spirits for the continent. For example, if chaos was a virus and the power of the Dragon Spirit was a firewall, then the person holding the Soul Core was equivalent to a CPU. As long as the CPU could still operate, the firewall would not fail and be enough to block all the power of chaos from this world completely. And the holders of these Soul Cores were also regarded as the heirs of the Giant Dragon Spirits. However, these things were meaningless to Rhode at present. Rhode slowly stood up. The intense pain swept through his body, especially the wound on his left chest. It seemed to be even more severe now. Previously, Rhode could barely move his left hand, but now he couldn't even move. Even if he just rolled his fingers, he could feel the pain as if his entire arm was in the fire. However, this made Rhode feel relieved. If he had a feeling, it meant that his arm was still there. If he couldn't feel anything, then it would be a big problem. Looking up, with the bright moonlight, the first thing Rhode saw was the wreckage of the floating ship. The tall trees around him showed that he was in the forest. So, it was clear what had happened. Although Rhode had killed the Wind Serpent Lord, the fragile floating ship was ultimately destroyed as it landed under the violent impact. At this moment, the forest was silent. Even the sound of insects could not be heard. Rhode looked around and saw blood and corpses everywhere on the ground. There were dead Wind Serpents and humans. Not far away from Rhode, a petite figure was lying there motionlessly. "Lize!" Rhode hurried to the girl's side and stooped to check her carefully. The girl looked pale, and her hands were clasped. But fortunately, her breathing was still relatively steady, and under Rhode's call, it didn't take long for the girl to open her eyes. "I... I am..." Lize opened her eyes blankly and stared at the man before her. After a while, she seemed to have regained her consciousness. She seemed to fall and hurt seriously. "I am still alive?" "That's right." Rhode was relieved when he heard Lize answering his question. The girl slowly stood up and shook her head. She bit her lips tightly. It seemed that she had not fully recovered yet. However, the girl still had more important things to do. "What about everyone?" "Where is the leader? How are they?" "..." Rhode did not answer, but Lize did not need his answer. Because, at this moment, she had already seen the surroundings. The initially pale little face, at this moment, had an unusually stiff expression. "How could that be? Crete? Charles! Leader!" The girl rushed to the corpses of the mercenaries, desperately calling their names, but no one responded. However, Lize did not give up. She squatted down and carefully examined the mercenary in front of her. After confirming that the mercenary was dead, she did not cry. Instead, she gritted her teeth and ran towards the next person. However, the young girl's efforts were in vain. Facing those already cold and stiff corpses, she could not do anything. Lize tried to be strong, but when she saw Carter's body, she could not help but feel her legs limp and sat on the ground. The previously high-spirited mercenary leader had also turned into a cold corpse. Half of his body was stuck in the crack of the deck, and a broken wooden stake penetrated his lower abdomen. "Lea..." "Leader..." Seeing this scene, Lize sat blankly on the damp grass. The flame of hope had completely extinguished from her eyes and was replaced with confusion and sadness. In the end, the girl lowered her head. Although she didn't say anything, Rhode still heard the faint cry from the night wind. Looking at the blonde girl's slightly trembling shoulders, Rhode could only silently stand behind her, unable to say a word. In the previous battle, he didn't care about life and death because of the severe situation. But now, after everything was over, Rhode couldn't help but have complicated feelings as he looked at the corpses around him. He had seen corpses before, but it was just a scene simulated in the game. In the game, after a person had died, they could use magic spells to revive or summon their souls. However, it was not a game. People would not revive after death, let alone summon their souls again. Death was the end of life. At this moment, Rhode seemed to recall that night seven years ago. He could only watch death helplessly, unable to do anything. Death walked by him unwaveringly, but he couldn't stop it. Just as he was about to say something to comfort the girl, suddenly, a faint cry for help came. "Heh..." "Is there anyone? Help..." Chapter 7 After the Crash Mase sat awkwardly beside the fire. His fat face revealed helplessness and depression. He wanted to vent his anger but didn't know where to start. On the other side of the bonfire, Rhode quietly leaned against the tree trunk with his eyes closed. Lize silently prepared the food. Although her expression was calm, her red and swollen eyes revealed her feelings. It was hard to say it was fortune or misfortune as the fat merchant became the only person who survived this disaster apart from Rhode and Lize. He had some life-saving magic tools as a merchant who often traveled around. When the floating ship fell, the fat merchant's protective pendant showed its excellent function, so the fat merchant became the least injured among the three. Rhode's previous injuries were not yet healed. It was even worse after such an intense battle and the wounds from the fall. Lize wasn't any better. Previously, she was nervous and didn't notice it. After everything was over, they found her right arm dislocated and her foot injured. Only the fat merchant was relatively well except for a few scratches and a dizzy head after the crash. For an ordinary person, this kind of injury would be enough to make him unable to get out of bed for several months. Fortunately, Lize was a qualified Cleric. Healing was her expertise. Under Lize's treatment, the three of them recovered gradually. However, Rhode still needed some time to recover completely. However, this was already quite good news for him. With his original injuries and after such a fierce battle, he would at least be crippled even if he didn't die. But now, Rhode was completely healthy. Besides being injured and his movements not flexible enough, he was no different from an ordinary person. Lize felt surprised. After all, since they rescued Rhode, she had been in charge of caring for him. Thus, she was very clear about his injuries. But she did not expect that Rhode's body was so strong. Lize wasn't the only one who didn't expect this. Even Rhode himself was secretly surprised. Although he had already noticed that his body wasn't had the attributes of a human, he still didn't expect it to be so abnormal. He had such a heavy injury in such an intense battle and then was thrown to the ground by the violent impact. But he could still move... Was his mixed blood coming from a Barbarian? There was one more thing that Rhode didn't say. He was aware of his body because he understood his own body's attributes. Although he didn't know what it was, it wasn't a pure human body. However, the blonde girl was strange. As he knew, she was a delicate girl. She was a Cleric but did not have the attribute to combat. Generally speaking, she would die in this kind of situation. The reason why he could survive was because his body was not human. Then why was she able to survive and behave normally? It couldn't be her luck, right? The answer only came to Rhode's mind when he noticed a hint of gold hidden in Lize's beautiful azure eyes. This young girl did not survive because of luck. "Umm..." "Mr. Rhode?" Mase rubbed his hands together, a hint of a fawning smile appearing on his chubby face. "What do you think we should do next?" After saving Mase, the three of them searched through the wreckage of the floating ship. However, they couldn't find any survivors. To prevent the corpses of their companions from being eaten by the wild beasts in the forest, Lize proposed to cremate them. Although Mase was very distressed about his precious goods, he had to change his mind when he saw the blonde girl's gloomy face and Rhode's indifferent attitude. He watched them burn the floating ship to ashes with a pained expression. It was as if he was the most seriously injured person. The protective pendant he had spent a lot of money buying had saved his life. But because of the excessive damage, it had now wholly shattered and turned into a piece of scrap metal. Considering this, Mase had suffered quite a lot. After that, they rested in the forest for a day. Although they did not meet any trouble, the fat merchant was like a frightened bird after the attack of the Wind Serpents. Previously, he had vowed that the Wind Serpent was rare and there was no need to worry about it. But now, he had completely changed his mind. The small probability would become a reality for the fat merchant! They said we might run into a group of Wind Serpents on this route, and we did run into them! Moreover, I heard there were man-eating wolves and scary birds in the Silver Moon Forest. Don't tell me we would also run into them! As the saying goes, once bitten by a snake, ten years of fearing a well rope. It described the situation. The fat merchant's forehead was sweaty when he thought of this. Although he was an experienced merchant, he had no experience of taking adventures. When he saw the dense bushes and trees in the forest, the fat merchant could not help but tremble in his legs. In the past, he had heard his guards talk about the poisonous snakes in the grass, wild wolves, and so on. Now, these words were appearing in the mind of the fat merchant, making him a little desperate. In addition, his only life-saving tool had become tattered. In this case, the fat merchant had to rely on others. He didn't expect to depend on Lize. He had known the girl when he hired her. Based on Mase's judgment, he could see that this girl was obedient and adorable, but she had no independent opinions. In addition, she was not a combat class. Once something happened, she probably could not help him. Therefore, in the end, Mase decided to rely on Rhode. Although he didn't know how to fight, Rhode's previous performance was very eye-catching. It meant that he had outstanding strength. He didn't know whether this young man's experience in adventuring was less than those mercenaries, but he should be reliable. As for Lize, she seemed to be still in the pain of losing her companions and did not care about such things. "Don't worry, Mr. Mase." Looking at the nervous expression of the fat merchant, Rhode shook his head. Although he was a bit vulgar, he didn't hate this fat merchant. After all, if not for the fat merchant ordering the ship to stop, he probably wouldn't have been saved. Therefore, Rhode still had a good impression of him. "I am very familiar with this Silver Moon Forest. We will not encounter any dangerous monsters within the area we are currently in. You can rest assured." Rhode's words were not groundless. The northern Paphield Plains had always been the gathering place for novice players. Therefore, Rhode naturally knew the distribution of monsters here. In the plains, the Wind Serpents were the most threatening. With a large amount, they were the nightmare of many melee classes and other classes that couldn't fight monsters alone. The Silver Wolf was the most threatening in the Silver Moon Forest. But unlike the Wind Serpents, the Silver Wolf mostly acted alone, making it easier to deal with. Moreover, after killing the Wind Serpent Lord, Rhode gained 3,000 experience points and rose to Level 8. The most dangerous monster in the Novice Area was Level 10. So if not for a rare elite Lord-level monster, Rhode knew that he could ensure the safety in this area unless he ran blindly without looking at the map like those newbies and broke into some damn monsters' nests. But this possibility was zero for Rhode because he was known as the "Walking Library." "That's good. That's good." Hearing Rhode's answer, Mase couldn't help but let out a long breath. He took out a handkerchief and wiped the sweat on his forehead. Then, he could not help but yawn. He had not slept well all day because of his high mental tension. Even the wind blowing through the woods was like a wolf's howl for him. It could be seen how nervous he was. Now that he had made a decision, he calmed down. Therefore, the fat businessman was no longer worried. Instead, he curled up beside the bonfire and closed his eyes comfortably. With this feeling in his heart, the fat merchant narrowed his eyes. Soon, he fell into a deep sleep. After confirming that the fat merchant had fallen into a deep sleep, Rhode, sitting quietly beside the bonfire, stood up and walked into the forest. Chapter 8 Ten Great Spirit Sources, Wind Card Of course, Rhode had no intention of leaving the fat merchant alone. The reason he left was to check the thing he gained from the fight. In the previous battle, Rhode had gained a lot of experience points, but he didn't get too much loot from the fight. To the players, the destroyed floating ship was a treasure. There were so many dead people. They should have a lot of wealth. However, in the end, Rhode gave up this idea. No matter what, they had saved his life. Now that they were dead, it was inhuman for him to plunder their belongings. Although experience points were valuable, Rhode felt that he had earned something else. It was the black raw stone in his hand now. According to the introduction to the Dragon Soul Continent, this was the Soul Core condensed by creatures with mighty magic power when they died. It had rich attributes. It could be used as a gemstone embedded into a weapon or melted and forged into a soul weapon. They were also excellent materials for making magic tools for Spell Casters. In addition, the drop rate of the Soul Core was very low, so in the world of Dragon Soul Continent, its price had always been high, and for the Summoning Swordsmen, they had an irreplaceable effect. It was the necessary treasure that they needed to awaken the summoned spirits. At this moment, Rhode was standing in the dense forest. He raised his right hand and saw the Soul Core. It had the size of a fruit core and emitted a thick dark aura, quietly lying in his palm. The surroundings were peaceful, quiet forest. The midnight moonlight passed through the leaves and scattered like specks of light to illuminate the earth and bushes. Then, the summoning circle on Rhode's hand shone again, and the flowing magical radiance quickly extended. Then, a system prompt appeared before Rhode. "Discovered contaminated Soul Core. Would you like to purify it?" "Purify." Soon, the summoning circle on Rhode's right hand once again revealed a pure white luster. They flowed down his fingers like water and wrapped around the Soul Core in his palm. With the invasion of holy power, the threads of black fog initially wrapped around the Soul Core quickly melted like white snow under the sunlight, disappearing without a trace. After the black fog faded, the Soul Core wrapped inside finally revealed its original appearance. The egg-shaped rock was transparent, emitting a blue luster and faintly trembling. It seemed to sense something and was struggling to break out of the shell. "The Spirit Core has been purified. Do you wish to awaken it?" "Awaken." Following Rhode's words, the blue egg-shaped gem trembled even more violently. Then, the egg-shaped gem shattered instantly with a "pop" sound. The streams of blue, water-like power burst out. They rotated rapidly and wrapped around each other. Then, they turned into the form of a card and finally lay quietly in Rhode's hand. A cool and comfortable feeling came from Rhode's body, causing him to shiver comfortably. At this moment, Rhode already knew what kind of existence he signed the contract with. He picked up the card. A green Spirit Bird was flying in the sky on the card. In the upper right corner was a blue half-circle (representing the card's attributes), while in the upper left corner was the letter "V." As for the left and right corners, two small numbers were written as "2." Rhode flipped through the card, and soon, the magical text appeared on the back. "Soaring Soul Bird (Wind Elemental Attribute): Flying class. Available to fuse with Elves. Attacks can trigger paralysis by 10 percent. Penetration effect. Ineffective against the magic defense." "Skill: Spirit Wind Phantom (The citizen of wind soaring in the sky. Range skill)." "Obtained Sky Card Deck 1/10. The Soaring Spirit Bird." What good luck. Rhode couldn't help but laugh. The flying summoned spirit was one of the necessary spirits for the early stage of the Summoning Swordsman. Moreover, the wind element could allow it to smoothly pass through items that didn't have any additional magic attributes. In other words, the ordinary defense was meaningless in the fight. Considering the effective range of 30 meters and its unique skill, Rhode could guarantee he wouldn't encounter too much danger, at least now. Even if he accidentally met those mutated BOSS monsters, he was confident that he could fight against them. However, what made Rhode the most depressed was his attributes. Until now, his strength, constitution, skill, willpower, and other attributes were still hidden. It made Rhode a little uneasy. Although this was his own body, the current state of this body was entirely beyond the usual standard that Rhode should have. He had already confirmed that his attributes were definitely beyond a human's, but this feeling of not being able to know his physical condition in detail was not good. You thought you would die, but in the end, you didn't die. It was a beautiful misunderstanding. But if you thought you wouldn't die and ended up dying, it would be a damned nightmare. Since he couldn't know his attributes, he could only rely on his experience to evaluate. After the battle with the Wind Serpent Lord, Rhode had a rough idea. After all, he had studied the information of the Wind Serpent Lord as a BOSS monster in detail. Judging from the previous battle, he thought his strength should be about the same as a typical swordsman, and his physique was quite muscular. At least after coming to this world, although he had experienced danger several times, Rhode's body seemed to have withstood the test. The worst state of his body was only vigilance, and he had never reached the level of emergency. In terms of speed, he was similar to ordinary people. But in terms of willpower, Rhode couldn't test it out. Because he couldn't find a Mage to cast a mental spell at him and see to which level he could resist. At this moment, a soft sound came from the bushes. Rhode raised his eyebrows and put down his right hand. The brilliance of the summoning circle on his hand instantly dimmed. The card he held turned into magic specks and immediately disappeared. After being sealed as a card and confirming the relationship with the holder, the sealed card would no longer appear in a physical form. It would sleep in the summoning circle on the Summoning Swordsman's hand, called the "Ten Great Spirit Sources," waiting for the holder to awaken them to use. Now, there were only two cards sealed in the circle of "Kingdom" at the bottom of the 6th Outer Circle: the "Star Mark" without element and the "Spirit Bird" of the wind element. Rhode did not intend to expose his abilities in front of others. The game introduced that the Summoning Swordsman was a player's exclusive class. It once existed in the distant ancient times of the continent, and the players were the only inheritance of this class. They embarked on a journey to find and restore the glory of this former hero class. Of course, this was all nonsense in the game introduction. But in reality, through Lize and Mase's expressions, Rhode was sure that they did not know about the existence of this class, so it was not convenient for him to say anything more. Moreover, maintaining a certain sense of mystery was beneficial for him. Just as Rhode turned around, he saw Lize walking out of the forest. "Lize? Why are you looking for me?" "Ah..." "No, it's nothing, Mr. Rhode." Lize shook her head, but her expression was a little uneasy. "Umm... I want to ask about your injuries. Is there anything I can do?" In the end, the young girl's voice became softer and softer. Her hands tightly grasped her robe's hem. At this time, she was incomparably fragile. Rhode also noticed Lize's abnormal behavior. Mase could see through her character because, as a businessman, he had been traveling south and north all year round, and he would die if he were not acute to any details. Rhode could see through her character because of his experience as the Guild Master of the biggest guild in the Dragon Spirit Continent. It was different from reality. Players were hidden behind their characters on the Internet. Because of this, their personalities would be more hidden than in real life. In this online world, one should be very sharp to conduct a group. After all, most players came to the game to experience happiness but did not treat it as work. You wanted them to log online timely, play the dungeon on time, update the records, and get achievements. These things were only possible when the leader had a good balance and grasp. Therefore, observing his companions' emotions and thoughts was essential to a Guild Master like Rhode. But now, Lize's performance clearly showed that she lacked support, which made her very uneasy. Rhode could see that losing a companion was a blow to her. It was not only because the person she was familiar with had left her but also because she had a sense of unease and fear toward the future. In the previous battle, Rhode also took the time to observe this girl. At that time, everything she did was perfect. She could immediately cast healing spells on her companions and quickly dispel the poison in them. Ultimately, the Shield of Protection she cast on Rhode was accurate as it was calculated in seconds. This strength could be considered excellent for a supporting class. Moreover, at that time, she was full of confidence and had a clear goal. Although she faced danger, she would not hesitate or fear. But now, this trembling girl no longer had the confidence she had before. There was only one reason for it. Chapter 9 Set Off Looking at the girl, Rhode sighed. "Lize, you should worry about yourself right now. You haven't had a good rest since last night, right?" Hearing the words "last night," Lize's body suddenly shrank as if she had recalled that matter again. But even so, the girl still stubbornly bit her lips and shook her head. "No... I..." "Slap!" Before Lize finished speaking, Rhode raised his hand and slapped her face. What was he doing? Covering her flushed cheeks, Lize widened her eyes in disbelief and stared at Rhode. However, this young man only looked at her quietly and spoke. "I can understand what you are thinking right now."  Anger immediately erupted from Lize's heart when hearing this calm and almost emotionless voice. She put down her hands and clenched her fists as if she wanted to refute Rhode's irresponsible remarks. However, Rhode's following sentence made her lose the strength to do so. "Because you are different from the others, you feel guilty for being able to survive. For a half-angel, this idea is not correct." "!" Hearing this, Lize was shocked. She subconsciously crossed her arms to protect herself and took several steps back. She only stopped when she hit the big tree behind her. But even so, Lize did not care. She stared at the man and opened her mouth, but she could not say anything. How did he know? No, this was impossible. She had never told him about it. Even in the mercenary group, only several people knew about it. "How do you..." "Your eyes." Rhode stretched out a finger. "Your eyes will reflect a golden light under the light. It is the symbol of an angel as the Light Guard." “But unlike pure angels, the light in your eyes is not dazzling because it was covered by your human blood, right?” The young girl did not speak. Although he didn't get an answer, Rhode confirmed his thoughts were correct. Now, the girl standing before him was indeed a half-angel. He had been observing Lize for a long time. As a top player, in his long gaming career, Rhode was good at judging the opponent's attributes through equipment and characteristics. So he could formulate the most suitable tactics in the shortest time to fight the BOSS monster and attack faster in the PVP battle. All veteran players would inevitably master the technique. After Rhode and Lize were rescued, he started to observe the girl and soon discovered her identity. Although she was only a half-angel, the angel's healing power and ability to resist damage did not disappear. It was also the main reason why Lize could survive after being thrown out of the floating ship. Lize must be very clear about this. That's why she was so depressed. "So, I said that I can understand your thoughts." Rhode shrugged. "You know very well how you survive. It is not because of luck but the difference between you and others. You can't accept this..." "If possible, you would wish you were just an ordinary human, facing death like your companions but not being so cunning to survive." "..." Lize lowered her head and clutched her skirt tightly. "But you cannot decide this." Looking at Lize's slightly trembling shoulders, Rhode's tone slowed down. "You cannot decide your birth or stop all of this. It is beyond you." "Never regret what you can't do." "Then..." Lize finally spoke. "What should I do?" "This is your path. You should choose it yourself." Lize was silent for a moment when she heard it. Then she raised her head. "I understand. Thank you, Mr. Rhode." "You're welcome." "However, your slap was painful." Although the process was a little "violent," Lize still eliminated the shadow of losing her companions. When the sun rose the next day, the blonde girl's face was no longer as sad as before but had her usual gentle smile. It surprised Mase, who had fallen asleep and couldn't figure out what had happened. He looked at them curiously and finally revealed a meaningful smile to Rhode. As for its meaning, no one knew. However, Rhode's words immediately plunged his heart into the abyss before the fat merchant could satisfy his curiosity. "I think it's time to set off." Set off? The words made the fat merchant shocked. He had just woken up and finished his breakfast, burping with satisfaction. Then he remembered he was in the dangerous forest, not in his comfortable and warm room. Right, they were not out for an outing. That damned Wind Serpent and that damned captain... Forget it, forget it. There was no point in saying all this now. Most importantly, how could they get out of this damned forest? Thinking of this, Mase hurriedly raised his head and looked at Rhode. Since this young man said he had a way, he must have made a thorough plan. After all, they were in the deep mountains and could get lost easily. Moreover, there were so many ferocious beasts lurking inside. How could they escape from them? These were all essential knowledge of survival in the wild. He had to be very careful. He could not miss out on even half a sentence. He could lose everything he gained if he died here due to his carelessness. With this thought in mind, Mase patted his face hard to dispel the last trace of sleepiness. Then, he carefully watched Rhode stand up from the ground and casually pat the dust off his legs. Then, he stretched his wrist and finally spoke. "Let's go." "Wait, wait, Mr. Rhode!" The fat merchant jumped up like sitting on a chair with iron nails. "Where are we going?" "Northeast, there is a small town there. The road ahead will be much easier as long as we get there." "Is there nothing to pay attention to?" "Nothing special." It was not surprising that Rhode would say that. After all, as a gathering place for novices in the Dragon Soul Continent, the Paphield Region had already been explored by players thoroughly, especially under the influence of online novels. At the beginning of the game, many players deliberately went deep into dangerous areas that were difficult to reach, or no one was around, trying to get a legendary Divine Artifact that was enough to dominate the game. Then they could hold the weapon to be invincible, lead a powerful party, and finally unify the continent. Of course, the reality was always cruel. Although the players continuously worked hard and found some scarce weapons with good attributes, no one could meet the player's requirements to "unify the world with a Divine Artifact." After all, this requirement was too high. This place was full of danger, and every step was likely to cost his life for Mase, but Rhode was familiar with this area as if it was his backyard. In the game, as the guild leader, Rhode had brought many newbies here to level up. So, he knew where to find more monsters and where the monsters were fewer. He also learned what equipment suited a class and where to train efficiently to gain practical attributes. Rhode was naturally familiar with these things. He could walk out here even with his eyes closed, even if thrown somewhere. Therefore, there was naturally nothing special to notice for him here. As for Mase, Rhode had done the quest to protect the merchants in the game numerous times. How could he be worried? Hearing Rhode's answer, Mase's chubby face immediately withered like a frosted eggplant. Of course, he wasn't clear about Rhode's thoughts but thought he was too relaxed. Thinking of this, the fat merchant started to reflect on whether he had made a wrong choice. Thinking carefully, this young man was seriously injured in the mountains. If he wasn't injured, it was more reasonable for him to be so relaxed. However, now that he was injured, he was still so careless... Wasn't he courting death? He felt a little regretful. But it was hard to regret after making a decision. For Mase, there was no second path left. Therefore, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and follow them into the forest. Under the bright sunlight, the Silver Moon Forest appeared very quiet. The sunlight passed through the gaps between the leaves and sprinkled specks of light on the ground. From time to time, the crisp sound of birds could be heard. In the grass, there were even traces of wild rabbits. The scene was so peaceful that the initially nervous fat merchant gradually relaxed. He was no longer as suspicious and uneasy as before. Rhode walked in the front. Although walking in a forest without a road wasn't easy, he was highly agile as he shuttled in the woods. Nothing could stop him as he walked through the vines and the plants with barbs. Just by looking at his back, it was hard to imagine that he had been seriously injured before. Lize, who was following closely behind, was quick too. She was already used to the activities and life in the wild. Although she was wearing an inconvenient robe, she still followed Rhode steadily. Occasionally, she would remind the merchant behind her to pay attention to the road under their feet. The deeper she went, the more surprised she felt. On the surface, Rhode was leading in a very casual direction. He didn't choose to move in a straight line. Instead, he would occasionally turn left or right. Sometimes, he would make a big circle. From the path, she would only think that Rhode was leading the way randomly. However, she noticed that under Rhode's lead, the dense forest revealed a flat path for them, as if it was hidden within the forest, waiting for people to discover its existence. Lize once heard the leader mention this was a very high-end technique. After all, it was too difficult for ordinary people to find their way in the forest. Only the elves who got along well with nature and the Rangers who lived in the deep mountains all year round could master this technique. She had seen it once before. At that time, the team she was in had lost their way in the forest, but the elves sent to help them did not follow the path in the woods. Instead, they chose an opposite direction. At that time, Lize was very worried. But in the end, they managed to leave the forest smoothly. At that time, Lize learned about this technique from her leader. But... Looking at Rhode's back, Lize tilted her head in confusion. According to the leader, only experienced elves and Rangers could master that technique. Although ordinary elves could communicate with nature, they could not do this. But Rhode was so relaxed that he never stopped to interact with the plants around him. It meant that he should not be an elf. But... He didn't look like a Ranger. Although Lize had seldom interacted with a Ranger, she still knew that the primary weapon of a Ranger was a bow. However, Rhode had never used a bow since she first met him. Who was he? At this moment, in Lize's heart, she was increasingly puzzled. Rhode stopped in his tracks. He could see the clear lake water not far away through the bushes. It was the center of the Silver Moon Forest, the Moonlight Lake. In the game, this place was considered the wilderness campsite for players to rest in the middle of the journey. "This is great!" Looking at the clear lake water, Mase subconsciously licked his chapped lips. They hadn't walked too long since they left, but for a merchant who had always been pampered, he seemed to have walked for several days. Seeing such a good place to rest, the fat merchant immediately strode forward, planning to relax by the lake. However, Rhode pressed his shoulder just as his body moved. The fat merchant looked at the young man in confusion, but Rhode said nothing. He only extended a finger and made a silent gesture. Then, he pointed ahead. The fat merchant looked toward Rhode's finger, and his face suddenly turned pale. Because in the shadow of the lake, a giant wolf was quietly lying there, resting with its eyes closed. Chapter 10 Finding a Road in the Forest As a merchant traveling around, Mase certainly had seen a wolf before, but he could swear to the gods that he had never seen a wolf as big as this since he was born. This giant wolf was as tall as a man from its figure alone. The thick fur on its body was glossy. At this moment, it was leisurely squinting its eyes, enjoying the warm afternoon sun. Its thick tail swung around behind it, looking very relaxed. At this moment, Lize had already closed her mouth and quietly followed behind Rhode. As a mercenary, Lize naturally knew how terrifying and dangerous these beasts were. Although she wasn't as nervous as the fat merchant who didn't dare to breathe, the girl looked at Rhode and waited for his orders. And Rhode himself was thinking. The Silver Wolf "Moon Soul" was a Level 10 Elite Monster. Although it was not a BOSS, it was also very troublesome. After all, in the Dragon Soul Continent, other than human-like creatures, the danger of monsters was divided into three levels: Wild Beasts, Giant Beasts, and Magical Beasts. Wild Beasts were ordinary creatures. Giant Beasts lived for a long time or were stimulated by something. Thus they were fierce and dangerous monsters with huge bodies. They would evolve into Magical Beasts when they awaken their Soul Forces. At that time, they would not just rely on their bodies to fight and be even more challenging to deal with. The Silver Wolf was weaker than the previous Wind Serpent Lord in terms of the threatening level. It was not difficult for Rhode to kill it. But... Thinking of this, Rhode subconsciously looked around. Rhode wouldn't mind killing it to get some experience points and materials if it were in the game. However, this was not a game. Moreover, there were only three of them. Lize was only a Cleric and could not protect herself. As for Mase, he couldn't fight. Under such circumstances, it was better to do less than to do more. Thinking of this, Rhode made a gesture and walked in another direction. The Moonlight Lake wasn't small anyway, so there was no need to cause trouble by taking a shortcut. After they saw his gesture, Lize and Mase glanced at each other and followed behind Rhode, intending to leave. However, it was a pity that they did not have good luck. "Crack!" The moment the fat merchant turned around, his feet suddenly slipped, and he fell heavily to the ground, crushing a branch beneath him. At this moment, Rhode, initially walking at the front, immediately raised his right hand. Soon, along with a crisp bird cry, a green figure shot out from his hand and rushed straight behind the two. "Boom!" Following the sound of the collision, a low howl came from behind them. Lize and Mase turned around and were surprised to find that the giant black wolf that was supposed to be far away had already arrived behind them. Its vast body was lying on the ground. It seemed that an external force had hit it. Then, a shadow flashed past the two of them. Rhode knew the situation was dangerous as soon as the fat merchant fell. After all, in the Silver Moon Forest, these giant wolves could rank in the top three for their senses and reactions. Fortunately, Rhode encountered problems caused by stupid NPCs more than once in the game, and these experiences were practical now. Although Rhode's sense wasn't high enough to lock these giant beasts' movement, he immediately judged based on his familiarity with the giant wolves. Although Moon Soul, who was resting, was unlikely to attack them directly, it sensed their presence. With the characteristics of these giant wolves, it would most likely secretly tail them and wait for the sky to darken before launching an attack. They could wait, but he couldn't. Rather than passively dealing with the monster at that time, it would be better to take the initiative to control the situation. Rhode's judgment was correct. The Moon Soul did not expect him to launch an attack so quickly. Facing the oncoming Spirit Bird, it subconsciously reacted, but it was still a little slower. The green Spirit Bird hit its body squarely, and the shockwave sent it flying away. While the giant black wolf was lying on the ground, Rhode had already activated Shadow Flash and arrived beside it before it could recover from the attack. He focused on the giant wolf and stretched out his right hand. "Cage (Elf Language: Transform)!" The green bird flew back into his hand and turned into a card, its color turning from green to white instantly. Rhode didn't look at it. He turned around, grabbed the card in his hand, and stabbed toward the Moon Soul's right hind leg. A white light beam pierced the Moon Soul's right leg and pinned it to the ground. At this moment, the snow-white longsword appeared in Rhode's hand. "!" The Silver Wolf let out a painful howl. It opened its eyes wide and stared at the hateful human before it. At the same time, it tried to stand up, but it shook and had to stabilize itself again. And at this moment, Rhode's second strike arrived. Rhode was secretly relieved after observing the Silver Wolf's movement. After all, the most significant characteristic of these Elite Monsters was their speed. It would be a hard battle if he couldn't slow their speed as soon as possible. Now that the Silver Wolf had lost one of its hind legs, it could no longer rely on its fast speed to fight, so the next step was much easier. Although it hurt one hind leg, the Silver Wolf did not panic. It stared at its target. Just as Rhode thrust his sword at it, it raised its front paw and swung it at Rhode. The Silver Wolf had already made a counterattack, but Rhode, who had already anticipated its action, did not panic when facing the sharp claws. Instead, he flipped his right hand, and the white blade slashed through the Silver Wolf's claws, bringing a trace of blood. When the Silver Wolf retracted its claws in pain, all it saw was the sharp blade of light that was even more dazzling than the sunlight. Vital Strike! The Blade of Destruction pierced its vast body, tearing apart its hard fur. Accompanied by painful howls, the giant black wolf flew into the air and crashed into a small tree before falling back to the ground. Half of its body had already been torn apart with a bloody wound, and the eerie white bones inside could be seen, and even the organs were slowly flowing out. The scene was indeed disgusting. Even Rhode, who originally planned to go up and take the last blow, couldn't help but frown. After all, the Vital Strike in the game was only shown in the form of data, not a distinct scene. Although he had seen it in the battle with the Wind Serpent before, this kind of thing would not make people feel good no matter when they saw it. After being hit by the Spirit Bird and Rhode's extremely targeted attack, the giant black wolf had reached a critical point. Its threatening roar had now turned into a low whine. It supported its body and tried to stand up again. However, Rhode did not give it this opportunity. He only raised his sword and stabbed the Star Mark into its brain, decisively taking its life. Although it looked like a long time, only a minute or two had passed. Lize and Mase saw that the Silver Wolf was knocked to the ground, and Rhode appeared beside it. In just a few short moments, he ended its life. It made them highly shocked. This giant wolf wasn't that easy to deal with. Lize knew that even if in her mercenary group, it would be difficult for them to kill a giant wolf so quickly, even if they were fully equipped. But looking at Rhode's performance, how did it look like he was killing a wolf? It was simply no different from killing a chicken! As for the fat merchant, his feeling was even more complicated. When he fell just now, his heart had already turned cold. Of course, he knew what this meant and feared that the wolf would notice their existence. However, he guessed the process but not the ending. Although the Silver Wolf had seen them, it did not have the time to satisfy its appetite before it tragically turned into a corpse. Although the danger had been lifted, the fat merchant was still unsettled. He looked nervously at the young man not far away. He understood that this was his fault. What if he turned hostile and left him here? Usually, he wouldn't be worried about these problems. After all, he had spent money hiring guards to protect him. Even if he made a small mistake, he wouldn't be worried about what others would say. But it was different now. The young man was not his guard or his mercenary. His position was utterly equal to him. If he was unhappy, he could leave himself here and ignore him. At that time, he would be finished! "Umm..." "I..." "I'm not..." Thinking of this, the fat merchant felt a cold sweat on his back. He licked his chapped lips, intending to say something but could not say anything. At this moment, he saw Rhode stand up again. He turned around and looked at him calmly. "Be careful when you walk." The fat merchant realized that other than nodding his head, he had nothing else to do... Chapter 11 The Lingering Shadow Rhode originally planned to rest near the Moonlight Lake before continuing their journey. However, he had to change his mind after encountering the giant wolf. Considering that the smell of blood from the corpse might attract unnecessary troubles, Rhode finally chose a flat high ground upstream of the Moonlight Lake as his camping ground when the sun went down. After dinner, Rhode once again took up the role of sentry. It was a bit harsh on his body. But he was the most familiar with the environment of the Silver Moon Forest and the only one who could fight. Thus, he had no choice. Although the fat merchant, Mase, had volunteered to help, Rhode and Lize didn't say much when they saw his plump body. However, their eyes showed their attitude. Therefore, the helpless fat merchant had nothing to do except to sit on the side and clean up the luggage they rescued from the wreckage of the floating ship.  Of course, Lize was not idle either. At this moment, she kneeled beside Rhode and placed her hands on his left shoulder. "AliyMia (Dragon Language: Heal)." Along with the clear chanting of the young girl, a faint white light emerged from her hands and slowly wrapped around Rhode's body. In the Dragon Soul Continent, Spell Casters used the Dragon Language to cast spells. Because almost 70% of magic had been passed down in the Dragon Language since the creation of the world, and they were widely used in the Great Magic Era by humans. The remaining parts were the Angel Language, the Elf Language, the Demon Language, and the Undead Language. These races were created and guarded by the ancestral giant dragon and inherited the dragon's magic talent and long life. It also divided the various classes on the continent. Whether it was in the Country of Darkness (Dark Dragon's Country), the Country of Light (Light Dragon's Country), or the Country of Law (Trail Dragon's Country), no matter what political systems they used, the most influential people would be the ones who inherited the five Giant Dragon Spirits. Next would be the non-humans, composed of angels, elves, demons, and undead. And the following would be humans. Of course, due to the different political systems, the class composition of each country was different. As a country ruled by royal power, the hierarchy of the Country of Darkness was relatively strict. There were no humans among its rulers. Meanwhile, in the Country of Light, half of the high-ranking members of the parliament were humans. As for the Country of Law, the numbers of angles, elves, and humans were relatively balanced in the upper class. Because the Country of Law was ruled by the religious centralization system and believed in the rule of balance. Equality was the perfect choice for them. Rhode knew the situation of this continent quite well. He knew what would happen next, which made him a little worried. In the game, players were just players. They could take off their game helmets and leave if they didn't want to play. But now it was different. He lived on this continent, so what should he do in the face of the calamity that would happen next? "Mr. Rhode..." "Mr. Rhode?" “What's wrong?” Lize's voice woke Rhode up from his thoughts. He raised his head and stared at the girl. After that, Lize finally returned to her usual state. There was still a trace of worry between her brows. But it was already a lot better when compared to her gloomy expression that seemed to face the end of the world and that she would commit suicide at any time. "It's like this." Lize shook her head and carefully looked at Mase. Sitting next to the fire, he was counting the supplies in his bag with an expression as if a snake had bitten him. She lowered her voice and said seriously. "Previously... in the battle with the Wind Serpent, I felt something." "Oh?" Hearing this, Rhode raised his eyebrows. "What is it?" "I can sense some dark aura from the Wind Serpent Lord." Lize bit her lower lip when she spoke. "However, this aura is very faint. It doesn't seem like a creature with dark attributes." "Mr. Rhode, the Wind Serpent shouldn't be a dark creature, right? Of course not. Wind Serpents belong to wind elemental creatures. They were never related to dark elements. However... "Are you sure?" "Yes, I am sure." Rhode couldn't help but think deeply when he heard the girl's confident answer. Of course, he knew what had happened during this period in history. The continuous attacks by the Wind Serpents on the cargo ships on the Wind Tide Business Road had caused a considerable loss. The Country of Light investigated and claimed this was the instruction and manipulation of the nomadic people living on the southern border of Paphield, a disputed area ruled by the Country of Darkness. Soon, the Country of Light sent troops to attack the area, driving out and slaughtering its residents. The Country of Darkness quickly responded to the Country of Light's action. They sent troops to attack the Country of Light's garrison, took back the land they claimed belonged to them, and used it as a fuse to launch an all-out invasion of the Country of Light.  This period of history happened during the public beta period. At that time, Rhode and the other players were familiarizing themselves with the new environment, system, and level-up. They did not quite understand this background. By the end of the public beta period, the game had officially launched. When the players flooded in, a full-scale war erupted between the Country of Light and the Country of Darkness. As for what happened, the players had their different speculations. Some people thought this was a tragedy caused by the Country of Light, which tried to reclaim its territory but failed. The other group believed that the Country of Darkness deliberately provoked it and began a war to expand its territory. Many people believed that the Country of Darkness had been eyeing the Country of Light for a long time, and this time it was the Country of Light who had made a mistake. Of course, the players had no position and made speculations based on their preferences. Rhode believed that these thoughts were reasonable to a certain degree. The southern border area was rich in crystal mines, an essential resource for any country. The Country of Light had no reason to give it up. The Dark Dragon, Ian, who ruled over the Country of Darkness in this generation, was a powerful ruler. In the middle of the war, even players famous for being cunning and rogue would find it difficult to gain any advantage from him. It was even rumored that he was not an NPC but a role played by a member of the game company. As for the last statement, during the war, the council of the Country of Light had a somewhat worse performance. Many players complained when its stupid orders provoked them. In the end, many players from the same camp chose to rebel against the Country of Light and join the Country of Darkness. It could be seen how tragic the situation was at that time. But now it seemed that the second conspiracy theory was closer to reality. Lize's senses could not be wrong. As a creature with light elements, angels were very sensitive to dark elements. She, who had inherited half of the angel's bloodline, should be reliable. In other words, the Wind Serpents' attack on the Wind Tide Business Road was a precursor for the Country of Darkness to launch an all-out attack on Country of Light, right? Things did not seem simple. "Lize, don't tell anyone about this." "Yes, Mr. Rhode." Hearing Rhode's answer, Lize nodded. She retracted her hands and carefully examined Rhode's injuries. Her fair face revealed a trace of a smile. "Your injuries are much better. If it continues, you will recover in about five to six days." "Thank you." Rhode nodded slightly at the girl to express his gratitude. Then, he lowered his head and looked at the system information before his eyes. The health of his body had gradually recovered its green color. If this continued, it wouldn't take long for him to move freely. But now, Rhode still had many things to do. What should he do first? Rhode frowned and fell into deep thought. At the same time, at the place where the floating ship crashed, two figures were slowly walking out of the forest. "Is this ship you were talking about?" The man in the lead said coldly. He was wearing white, streamlined, and beautiful armor. Patterns with shimmering gold threads were engraved on the armor. If Rhode were here, he would recognize that this symbolized the Border Defense officer from the Country of Light. The other person standing behind the man was wrapped in a black cloak, and his appearance could not be seen. When hearing the man's question, he only nodded slightly to answer. "They killed my messenger." The hoarse voice echoed in the forest under the night, giving people a chilling cold feeling. "To be killed by such a group of dirty and incompetent mercenaries, it seems your pet is incapable." "This is all your fault!" The man wearing the black cloak raised his voice suddenly. "If you could find me a higher-level, a Ruler-level, no, a Master-level lord, I wouldn't have used such a low-level creature!" "Are you kidding? Ruler-level?" The man snorted. "What do you think we are? We are only responsible for providing resources. You have to do your things. What do we need you for if we can do everything well?" At this point, the man paused for a moment before speaking slowly. "How long will it take for you to start again?" "At least half a month. Do you think it is easy to find a group of Wind Serpents that can be manipulated?" "Give you ten days, and we'll double the reward." After hearing his dissatisfaction, the man's face sank. Then he reached into his pocket, took out a money pouch, and threw it over. "Ten days later, I want you to start again." The money pouch fell to the ground, making a heavy metal collision sound. The black-cloaked man bent down and stretched out a withered hand to open the money pouch and closed it immediately. "Alright, ten days. I will keep my promise." "I hope you understand that there will not be a third person who knows about this." "Of course, I understand." "By the way, considering this ship's situation, two or three rats are running away. Do you want me to help you clean them up?" "No need." The man waved his hand. "I have my ways." Hearing his answer, the black-cloaked man laughed coldly. "Very good. Let me see what you will do." A thick shadow appeared on the ground and wrapped around the black-cloaked man. Then, he disappeared. Looking at where he disappeared, a hint of disgust appeared on the man's face. "The greedy undead, even your bones will turn to ashes one day!" After a cold snort, the man glanced at the surrounding forest thoughtfully. Then, he pressed one hand on the hilt of his sword and put another hand in his mouth, whistling loudly. Soon, a Griffin flew down from the sky and landed on the ground. At the same time, three figures quietly appeared from the forest. The man glanced at them and then mounted the Griffin. "Find the three rats and deal with them." Then, he coldly gave the order. Chapter 12 The Ring of Will The black shadows shuttled back and forth in the forest. Sometimes they separated from each other, and sometimes they gathered again. "Have you found them?" "There are traces left in the east direction. They are the targets probably. Judging from the time, it should be no more than a day." "They are swift. Continue. Be careful. They can kill the Wind Serpent Lord. Do not underestimate them." "Yes!" After the three people finished talking, they turned into black shadows again and disappeared into the forest. Their movements were silent, and they did not even alert the birds perched on the trees. After the black shadows left, the green bird standing quietly on the branches spread its wings and flew into the sky. "Someone is following us?" Hearing the Spirit Bird's report, Rhode's face sank slightly. At this moment, on his shoulder, the translucent green Spirit Bird was standing there quietly. It shook its head from time to time and stretched its wings. It looked no different from an ordinary bird. Only its translucent body and the elemental brilliance surrounding it showed the characteristics of the unreal bird. Summoning the Spirit Bird to monitor was a temporary method that Rhode had thought of on the way. Generally, players form teams with scouting classes like a Thief or a Ranger to ensure no danger on the following road. But Rhode did not have such good conditions, so he had to rely on his summoned creatures to explore the way. Fortunately, the Spirit Bird had an advantage in its visual range and could sense the spirit as a soul elemental creature. It made Rhode feel more at ease. Rhode wanted to see if they had gotten into trouble after killing the Level 10 giant wolf, so he let the Spirit Bird patrol behind them. However, he accidentally encountered a bigger problem. It couldn't sense the specific form of the soul and could only make a judgment through the radiance of the soul. But Rhode felt that their speed was strange. The only people who could travel so fast and freely in the forest were probably Rangers and Rogues. In any case, it should be a class that could not be exposed. In addition, their actions were quite orderly. It was hard to imagine that they were ordinary adventurers. Were they passing by? Or were they specifically targeting them? Rhode didn't dare to take the risk. It would be fine if they came to them openly. But the class hidden in the dark was the most challenging opponent. Moreover, Lize's previous warning made him feel this matter was strange. If these people were hostile to them, then the situation was hard to imagine. However, when Rhode saw Lize beside him, his eyes lit up. He already had an idea. "Mr. Rhode, where should we go next?" Lize asked as she handed the kettle to the fat merchant. He sat the side with a flushed face and sweating profusely. Although Rhode did not say much, Lize took care of this fat merchant on the way. According to the girl herself, her mercenary group had already accepted the task of protecting this gentleman, so even if she was the only one left, as long as the job was not completed, she must continue to carry it out. Mase was naturally very grateful for this, but looking at how he was panting like a cow, he probably wouldn't be able to live for long if he continued to walk. "Mr. Rhode, I am...I am exhausted. Let's... let's rest for a while!" As soon as Rhode stopped, the fat merchant, already sitting on the ground, hugged the bag as if holding a treasure. He took out a handkerchief and wiped the sweat on his face. His chubby face was shiny and even sparkled like a giant light bulb under the sunlight. "Holy, Holy Soul bless me. I..." "I already have... I haven't walked so long for several years. Cough...cough..." As he said this, the fat merchant couldn't catch his breath. He coughed violently several times, and even the fat on his face shook. Only after a good while did he come back to his senses. "We have walked... so long. I feel like... I feel like I will die!" "Rest for five minutes." Rhode glanced at the sky, and after calculating the journey and time in his heart, he gave the order. After hearing his words, the fat merchant, initially sitting on the ground, immediately howled and then fell to the ground. Lize let out a sigh of relief and sat down on a rock. After that, they didn't encounter any other danger. With the Spirit Bird leading the way, Rhode successfully led them to avoid many dangerous areas. Although they lost some opportunities to obtain precious equipment, Rhode wasn't distressed. Because there weren't many players in this world. Ordinary adventurers wouldn't easily climb the mountains and walk into the forest. So he could return after bringing them out of the mountain and resting up for a while. However... Rhode looked up at the mountain range not far away and stood up. "Lize." "Yes, Mr. Rhode. What can I do for you?" "I'll go to the front and take a look. After you rest for five minutes, you bring Mr. Mase up the mountain. Do you see that white stone? Go there, and then go to the shadows, and you will find an abandoned mountain road." "Wait for me there. I'll be there in a moment." Lize raised her head and followed the direction of Rhode's finger. She soon found the white stone on the mountain. She turned her head and looked at Rhode in confusion. She did not know how he knew about this. However, the girl only opened her mouth but did not ask. After a few days of travel, she understood the man was reliable. Although she did not know what he would do, the girl nodded and watched Roude turn around and leave. Of course, Rhode had his plans. That stone was the entrance to the path of Zenar Mountain. It used to be a famous trade route, and the ancestors of the northern people contributed their entire lives to building the route that crossed the mountain range and connected the plains and other regions. This place also experienced a period of prosperity. However, along with the development and utilization of the wind tide, the unobstructed sky was more secure than the dangerous forests, so this trade route was gradually abandoned. Those who relied on it to live had already left here, looking for a better life and abandoning their homes. So this place became a wasteland again. The progress of civilization would always make the previous miracles meaningless. It was the same in any world. However, Rhode wasn't here to stroll and comprehend life philosophy. Rhode stopped in his tracks. At this moment, a barren land appeared before his eyes. And the corpses. The white bones were almost buried by dust, only tattered leather armor and corroded weapons scattered on the ground. It was a mercenary group called "Tiger Teeth." The mountain bandits attacked them during their adventure, and both sides died here. In the game, Rhode first needed to receive a mission from the mercenary guild and investigate their final mission according to the clues. Then, he followed the mark on the map, found this place, and finally returned with the token and treasure. However, that was in the game, and following the steps was necessary. But even so, many veterans would not make things so complicated. They would take the token and directly hand it over to the mercenary guild. It could save time and be convenient and fast. Since it would even save so many troublesome steps, so why not? But Rhode did not come here to save those steps. When he reached the battlefield, Rhode saw a skeleton lying on the side of the mountain wall. It wore corroded steel armor, and a dark, rusty iron sword was falling beside its hand. That was Rhode's goal and also the leader of this mercenary group. Rhode walked to the skeleton and squatted down. He first glanced at it and then reached out his hand. He quickly took out a mercenary badge from the skeleton. It was the token of the Tiger Teeth mercenary group and the necessary item to complete the commission. Rhode carefully placed it in his pouch. Then, he looked down and quickly found his target. It was a dirty ring worn on the finger bone. Rhode carefully took the ring. From the looks of it, this ring had no use and was no different from scrap metal in a garbage dump. However, the system prompt before his eyes told him this was not the case. "Black Iron Ring. Unidentified. Detected magic fluctuations." "Resonance." Rhode closed his eyes, held the ring in his right hand, shouted in a low voice, and injected his Soul Force into it. The ring in his hand trembled slightly, and the faint magic fluctuation became clearer. When he opened his eyes again, the thing in his hand was no longer the scrap metal from before. On the contrary, a pitch-black ring carved with ancient patterns was quietly lying on his palm. "Ring of Will. Identified. Able to activate the Shield of Will for five minutes. Immune to mental attacks. Cooldown: Three days." Done. Rhode put the ring on his right finger and sighed in relief. Then, he looked around for a moment. After ensuring there was nothing of value, he turned around and returned to the mountain. Rhode could see that Lize and Mase were walking toward the white stone with difficulty. The fat merchant had no experience in climbing mountains. He was trembling as he followed behind Lize. Looking at him, if not for the fact that the interactions between females and males should be prudent and conservative, he would have cried and begged Lize to carry him up. How pathetic. Rhode shook his head helplessly. Just as he was about to go down and meet them, the alarm from the Spirit Bird suddenly sounded in his heart. "!" Rhode was shocked. He hurriedly looked in the direction of the forest. Soon, he saw three black shadows flying out. Things went wrong! Chapter 13 Misty Ruins This time, the three figures did not search for any more traces because the two people climbing halfway up the mountain were simply clear. They only glanced at each other before quickly rushing toward the two. However, Rhode was quick too. His figure flashed and slid down from the middle of the mountain. With a loud whistle, the Spirit Bird circling in the sky seemed to have received some order and flew down, rushing toward the three black-clothed men. "!" Facing the Spirit Bird's sudden attack, the three black men did not panic. They quickly prepare their team to counterattack. One of them waved his two swords and rushed forward. The other two continued to fly towards Lize and Mase. It was clear that they had a clear division of labor and were very professional. They would not stop because of this minor trouble. It was impossible to stop them if it was just an ordinary bird. However, it was a pity that the bird did not have a physical body. In the face of the cold blade, the green bird did not intend to dodge and instead directly rushed into it. There was a hint of joy in the eyes of the black-clothed man who saw this scene, but in the next moment, his expression turned into horror because the black-clothed man saw that the green bird had pierced through the edge of the sword, pouncing straight towards him! Elemental creature! The black-clothed man was shocked. He hurriedly dodged the attack. But even so, the Spirit Bird still passed through his shoulder. The black-clothed man instantly felt like half of his body had fallen into ice. His body, trying to maintain balance, paused in the air for a moment before falling heavily to the ground. Even the short swords in his hand flew out. As for the other two, they weren't much better either. When the Spirit Bird flew past them, they didn't care. But very quickly, a bone-chilling cold wind blew over their bodies. They felt their bodies turn numb and stiff, and they had no choice but to stop. Although this strange feeling quickly disappeared, Lize and Mase had already arrived at the location of the white stone because of the delay of several seconds. Seeing this scene, the leader of the black-clothed men frowned. He made a gesture and took out the short crossbow from his waist. "What, what happened!" The fat merchant was exhausted and stumbled to the side of the white stone under Lize's guidance. He held the stone wall with one hand and gasped for breath. But before he could complain, several black shadows flew past the fat merchant and shot onto the stone wall. "Ugh!" Mase hurriedly hugged his head and squatted down. Lize also subconsciously shrunk her body. At the same time, she did not forget to pull the fat merchant and push him into the shadows to avoid another attack. "We have to hurry." At this moment, Rhode also appeared. He glanced at the three black shadows at the foot of the mountain and spoke.  "They, who are they? What happened? Why did they attack us?" "Probably Rogues." The distance wasn't too far. With the sunny weather, Rhode could see that they were wearing the standard clothing of Rogues. Most Rogues' clothing was roughly the same in the various countries under the protection of the Light Dragon Spirit. As for which country these people came from, he would only know after killing them. However, Rhode didn't have this kind of strength. Even the unique ability of the Soul Bird could only freeze them for a few seconds. It wasn't because these people had high resistance to attacks with soul elements but because his level was too low to achieve a better effect. There was no benefit in staying for long. "As for why they attacked us, you can ask yourself. Maybe they will tell you some before you die if they are in a good mood." Although Rhode made a rare joke, the fat merchant did not laugh. As a merchant doing business for many years, he naturally knew those Rogues were difficult to deal with. What would happen if he fell into their hands? The fat merchant's face turned pale, and he was drenched in sweat as soon as he thought of those terrible rumors from his peers. Although his legs were trembling from exhaustion, he still forced himself to stand up and follow Rhode towards the path behind the white stone. The Zenar Mountain was a famous business route, and the road was wide enough for two carriages to move forward together. But now, this place had been completely abandoned. All kinds of rocks tumbled down from both sides of the cliff and piled up on the road, making the initially wide road rugged and narrow. The three of them stumbled forward but did not dare to stop. Rhode looked back occasionally, but the situation did not improve. The footsteps behind him were becoming clearer. They would have been surrounded long ago if not for the terrain here. "Mr. Rhode! There's no way!" Lize's exclamation made Rhode turn around. Sure enough, rolling stones blocked the mountain path, making it impossible to cross or break through. It was as he expected. Rhode shook his head slightly. He initially thought that the game was doing this to force players to take the route set by the system, but now it seemed that this was not the case. Whatever, this was not his original goal anyway. "Turn right." "Right?" When they heard Rhode's order, both were stunned. They looked at the path on the right and couldn't help but hesitate. Although the main road was blocked, there was a small road nearby. The strangest thing was that even though the sky was sunny and clear, there was a dense fog on that road. The sunlight passed through the thick fog, bringing a strange atmosphere. Just looking at it, they felt that there was something strange in it. And now, Rhode wanted them to go in there? "Hurry up, or it will be too late." However, under Rhode's urging, they quickly entered the fog. Soon, their figures were entirely covered by the mist and disappeared without a trace. Rhode heaved a sigh of relief when he saw them enter. He turned around to look back and stretched out his right hand. "Cage!" The card in his palm turned from green to white, and the snow-white blade appeared again. Then, Rhode clenched his long sword and swung it towards the cliff. The bright light blade flew from the sword and hit the crumbling boulders above the cliff. Soon, with a vast roar, the broken rocks rolled down with dust. When the three black-clothed men arrived, Rhode had already disappeared into the depths of the fog under the cover of dust and debris. "Damn it!" Looking at the messy mountain path, a black-clothed man gritted his teeth and cursed. The road ahead had been entirely blocked by gravel, and it was impossible to pass through. Not to mention that Rhode's attack triggered a chain reaction. Now, the cliffs on both sides of the mountain were shaking. It might be even more dangerous to continue walking. "What should we do?" "We have no choice." Another black-clothed man stared at the road that had been completely blocked. "We can only report to the leader and send people to monitor all the nearby villages and towns. They want to leave from behind. I didn't expect them to do so." "Elemental creatures, is there a Mage among them?" "If it is a Mage, then it is not strange. However, from our observation, there seems to be no Mage among them." Just as the two black-clothed men discussed, the other man, who had been silently watching the traces on the mountain, spoke. "There is a rather strong swordsman among them." After saying this, the black-clothed man turned his head away. "Let's go. These three targets are not simple, but we have yet to lose. Send the order to monitor the surrounding villages and towns immediately. They can't always stay in the mountains and not come out." To Rhode and the other two people, the danger had not been lifted. "What is this place?" The fat merchant stared blankly at everything in front of him. He thought he had been traveling around for many years and had seen everything. However, his experience in the past few days showed that he still did not know many things. After passing through the thick fog, a deserted, abandoned town appeared before everyone. The whole town was wrapped in thick fog. Almost everything was blurry. He could only see the gray sky when he looked up at the sky. It was no longer as bright and beautiful as before. The entire world was dim and dull, like a completely different space. "This is the Misty Ruins." Rhode, who came from behind, casually replied. "As long as we pass through here, we can reach the Aragak Mountain, and then we can leave." "But, is this place... dangerous?" If not for being blind, no one would have thought this place was peaceful. "Of course, it is dangerous." Rhode did not make it clear. In the game, Misty Ruins was the first Level 10 five-person dungeon, also the players' first instance. It was not difficult, but it was not easy. However, for the three of them, it was very troublesome. After all, Rhode was only at Level 8, and Lize was only at Level 6. As for the merchant, whose combat abilities were only Level 5, he could not be included in the team to fight. Thus, a Level 8 Summoning Swordsman and a support class would challenge the Level 10 five-person dungeon. In the game, they would be considered idiots for their behavior. Rhode wasn't an idiot. In fact, he only thought of this risky method after seeing Lize. Otherwise, he wouldn't have chosen this path. In fact, this path was the safest when considering the risk rate. "But as long as you follow my orders, there won't be too much risk." "So..." When he said this, Rhode turned around and looked at the blonde girl. "Lize, we will count on you." Chapter 14 Two People's Plan "Me?" Hearing Rhode's words, Lize widened her eyes in surprise. Even Mase opened his mouth in shock. It was common knowledge that Clerics were similar to pharmacists, doctors, and nurses in the Dragon Soul Continent. They were the supporting class in the team. Clerics often bandage wounds, heal injuries, release shields, and expel toxins. As for going to the frontlines to fight? No one had ever heard of this thing! "That's right." Rhode nodded. When he stepped into this place, he became the commander who led the team to clear the dungeon again. "In a while, you should listen to my orders. It does not require complicated techniques, but it requires response and awareness. However, as long as you are familiar with it, it will not be too difficult..." "Right now, your control over energy is...?" "How many times can you use the Holy Light?" Although Rhode had roughly guessed her level through Lize's healing spell, it was better to confirm it for safety. "I am a qualified Cleric on the 7th Layer of the Outer Circle." "As for the Holy Light..." "I can use it once in a day. Each time I can maintain it for the whole day if my Soul Force doesn't consume too much." The class of Spell Casters was different from the combat class. In addition to the class level, their Soul Force also has levels, including the Outer Circle, Middle Circle, and Inner Circle. The Outer Circle had ten layers, the Middle Circle had seven layers, and the Inner Circle had three layers. It was because the Spell Casters believed that their strength came from the depths of their souls. In general opinion, the Spell Casters thought the souls existed in three mutual supporting circles. The deeper a Spell Caster explored his soul, the more powerful he would be. Lize's strength had already reached the 7th Layer of the Outer Circle. It meant that she was likely to break through the limits of the Outer Circle and enter the Middle Circle. It was scarce for a Level 6 Cleric. But this way, Rhode was even more confident. "Very good. Remember. From now on, you do not need to cast Healing Light on me. Even if I am injured, it will be the same. Pay more attention to Mr. Mase. If there is any danger, cast a shield on him. Do you understand?" "Umm..." "I understand, Mr. Rhode." Although Rhode occasionally blurted out words that puzzled Lize, she understood by guessing what he meant and nodded slightly. "Mr. Mase, how many days can our supplies support?" "Three to four days." Holding the travel bag in his hand, the fat merchant thought for a moment and then answered, but there was a hint of sadness on his face. "If we should save more food..." "It's a good opportunity to lose weight." If Rhode smiled when he said this, Mase could still treat it as a joke. Unfortunately, Rhode's expression was very calm without a smile. It made the fat merchant even more conflicted. He held onto the travel bag. Just as he was about to say something, Rhode turned around and gave the order to Lize. "Cast your Holy Light." "Alright." Hearing Rhode's order, Lize nodded slightly. Then, she stretched out her hands and closed her eyes. Soon, a soft light slowly emerged from the girl's palm. The soft white light spread in all directions. It was unknown whether it was an illusion, but the fat merchant noticed that the thick fog around him had begun to retreat quickly after the light shone around. He rubbed his eyes and found that the surroundings shrouded initially in the dense fog had become much clearer. They could only see the vague shadow of some ruins previously, but now they could see the broken walls and houses. It made everyone heave a sigh of relief. After all, it was safer to have a clear view. "I'll go first. Lize, follow me. Mr. Mase, you go last. Don't stay too far away from us. No matter what happens, don't move alone." The ruins were silent. The light with sacred energy dispersed the thick fog but could not dispel the danger. Under Rhode's lead, the group slowly moved forward. Occasionally, they stopped to observe their surroundings and continued to go ahead. But soon, Rhode waved his hand and gestured for the two to stop. If his memory was correct, he was almost close to the appearing place of the first wave of monsters. As expected, shortly after Rhode stopped, several faint light spots appeared in the fog ahead. They shined and looked like eyes. "What, what is that?" Mase immediately became nervous. "It's a Ghost." Rhode stretched out his right hand. Soon, the Star Mark appeared in his hand. "Be careful. They don't dare to get too close." When Rhode finished speaking, everyone saw the thick fog suddenly shrink and expand, and then three strange creatures emerged. They looked like humans, but their bodies were covered in dense fog. The three monsters stood together, and they could barely see their whole bodies. Only those three pairs of bright little eyes could make them confirm that there was not only fog. They might be more terrible. "Lize, cast the Healing Light on the first one." Healing Light? After she heard this order, a trace of doubt flashed through the girl's mind. That was a healing spell. Why would she use it on this monster? However, this question only flashed through Lize's mind. Soon, Lize raised her right hand and cast a Healing Light on the monster. As a Cleric, Lize's skills were quite good. The Healing Light was a mid-range healing spell. Casting it would not be difficult as long as she targeted the location. It was easy for Lize. Perhaps because it was a monster but not a companion, she hesitated for a second. However, she quickly completed the spell. A white light immediately appeared in the air and wrapped around the Ghost. According to the original effect, the life wrapped in it would immediately recover, and it could make people energetic. It was the foundation of the spells used by Clerics.  However, the Ghost's performance was beyond the young girl's expectations. As the white light hit it, the Ghost screamed that even she could hear clearly. Then, its originally standing body bent down as if it had been punched and trembled continuously. The fog that enveloped its body instantly fell apart as if the ice melted in the sunlight. It surprised Lize. She subconsciously looked down at her hands. She could not figure out how she could cast such a destructive spell. Rhode was very calm after seeing the Ghost's reaction. The sacred energy produced by the Healing Light was the nemesis of the Ghost, not to mention that half of Lize's bloodline was from the orthodox angel. The sacred energy condensed by the angel was naturally different in quality from humans. If the sacred energy released by the latter was hot water to the Ghost, then the sacred energy condensed by the former was no less than a high sulfuric acid. Fortunately, Lize was only mixed blood. This Ghost would have turned into ashes if she were a true angel. Lize did not understand why a healing spell could have such an effect, but in fact, the players in the Dragon Soul Continent knew that the Healing Light was just a fake name. The essence of this spell was to cast the sacred energy. The sacred energy would bring healing effects on a living being. It was named so for convenience. It did not mean that it could only heal injuries. In the early period of the Dragon Soul Continent, there was once a joke among players: The most tragic thing for a Necromancer was to encounter a group of undead. Because the spells of the Necromancers were basically from dark energy. Using the spells to attack the undead creatures that were also composed of dark energy would only have the effect of healing but not destruction. Thus, many players who had chosen Necromancers as their class had to give up their dreams of controlling the undead army to fight for the world. They had to learn elemental spells to ensure their advantages against the undead monsters. By the way, they sometimes had to work as part-time healers. There was not much difference between a Necromancer and a Cleric. Most of them lived in groups where their abilities could not cause harm to the group, and only when they encountered the opposite attributes would they have an effect. However, for the Necromancer, the probability of encountering a living being was relatively higher. For Clerics, until the middle of the war of Darkness Descends, when the undead raged, they could change from logistics personnel to powerful fighters in the frontline. Before that, the probability of a Cleric meeting an undead was very low. In addition, NPCs knew less information than players, so it was normal for them to follow the rules. But now, it was not the time to follow the rules. "Attack the two behind it!" Rhode dashed toward the Ghost before him and ordered Lize. "Yes!"  Perhaps because she was encouraged by the scene, Lize's answer was also very energetic. Soon, two more powerful lights with sacred energy descended from the sky and landed on the other two Ghosts. A gentle light enveloped them and stopped their advance. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Rhode activated the Shadow Flash and arrived before the first Ghost. "!" The Ghosts hit by positive energy screamed, while Rhode became the target for them to vent their anger. Soon, the Ghost before him suddenly stretched out its translucent claws and grabbed Rhode. Although Lize's spells had weakened their defense, their attack power had significantly increased. If he was not careful, it was very likely that he would fail. Of course, Rhode wouldn't allow this to happen. His figure shifted, barely avoiding the claws of the Ghost, and then the pure white sword in his hand suddenly turned and stabbed forward. Vital Strike! The Star Mark accurately hit the condensed soul in the Ghost's illusory body. The Ghost was already in pain and wailing under the light with sacred energy. It raised its claws in despair, and the body, already on the verge of collapse, ultimately turned into dust and disappeared. At this time, the other two Ghosts also attacked. Chapter 15 Deep into the Ruins "Ugh..." Looking at the ground covered by the spiritual dust, Rhode wiped the sweat on his forehead and felt a little tired. Along the way, the three encountered quite a few Ghosts, about fifteen or sixteen. It would be easy if they were a team of five people, but since Rhode only had one combat force, he naturally couldn't do as he usually did in an ordinary dungeon. He couldn't find an MT to attract the monster and asked everyone else to attack. On the contrary, he could only carefully attract the monster one by one, let Lize cast sacred energy to weaken their defense, and then kill them as fast as possible. Because the Ghost was at least a Level 10 Elite Monster, it would still be challenging to deal with it even after they had weakened the undead creature's defense. To obtain the maximum damage, apart from using the attribute bonus of the Star Mark, Rhode could only strive to hit the opponent's vital points each time. However, humans were not machines after all. Even in the game, such a high requirement of attack would consume much energy, not to mention that Rhode was still using his own body. If he failed in the game, he could start over again. However, if he failed here, he would probably face death. This pressure was hard to bear for Rhode. He raised his head and gazed at the ruins shrouded in fog. After confirming that there would be no more monsters for the time being, he heaved a sigh of relief. "Mr. Rhode,  how about we rest for a while?" The girl who followed closely behind looked at Rhode worriedly. As a Cleric, she did not understand Rhode's actions very well, but she could feel his pressure. "Not Now..." Rhode shook his head. Although he had cleared out all the monsters here, he still felt a slight sense of danger. He looked around vigilantly but could not figure out where this faint sense came from. Considering the distance, they had yet to reach the territory of the BOSS monster. They should not encounter too many dangers. Moreover, Rhode was quite familiar with the distribution of undead creatures here. Logically speaking, the monsters here should have been cleaned up. So, where did this feeling of danger come from? Rhode looked around again but found nothing. At this moment, the fat merchant suddenly shouted. "Ah!" "What's wrong?" Rhode and Lize quickly turned their heads and saw Mase's pale face. He was holding a travel bag in one hand and pointing at the thick fog behind him with the other. "Just now, there was a black shadow there..." "A black shadow?" Lize looked in the direction of Mase's finger, but there was nothing in the thick fog except the dim sunlight. "I don't see..." "Get down!" At this moment, a thought came up in Rhode's mind. He finally understood where the danger came from. As he shouted, he pressed down on the girl's head forcefully. "Wham!" Almost at the same time, a black shadow flew through the air. Rhode could feel the cold claws brushing past his head. He felt a bit hard and painful. Damn it! At this moment, Rhode's heart sank. He already knew where this sense of danger came from! It was a Gargoyle! In the legends, the Misty Ruins was a lively and glorious small town, but it was gradually abandoned along with the end of the trade route. After that, a Mage came here. To save his beloved lover, he chose to study the forbidden death spell in this abandoned town. But in the end, the research failed, and the Mage died. However, the death spell did not stop because of this. It created dense fog and so many undead creatures. In the dungeon, the one with the highest level of danger was the Gargoyle the Mage had left behind to protect his relics. It was a Rare Elite Monster of Level 15! If it were a team in the game, Rhode would have been happy. Because such Rare Elite Monsters were scarce, sometimes, they might not meet one even if they entered the dungeons several times. But now, he only felt a chill in his heart. It was a Level 10 Rare Elite Monster and even a flying creature. Not to mention its agile movements, there was a significant difference between it and those Ghosts that did not have physical bodies and relied on dark energy. At least Lize's sacred energy would not be useful to it. In addition, its body made of obsidian was extremely hard. The damage from ordinary attacks was very limited. It could be foreseen that this was a hard battle! In the game, Rhode had entered the Mist Ruins 30 times, but he still couldn't find a single Gargoyle, so he subconsciously forgot about it. However, he didn't expect to meet it the first time he came here. Was this good luck or bad luck? However, Rhode didn't have the mood to consider this problem because the danger was before him. There was no advantage in a head-on battle. After all, he was not Level 10. It was almost impossible for him to challenge a Level 15 monster. His attack power was limited even if he had the Star Mark. "Let's go!" Without any hesitation, Rhode immediately gave the order. He pulled Lize up and shouted. "Follow me. Lower your head. Don't look up!" It was impossible to retreat now. The only way was to find and destroy Gargoyle's central control device. Although escaping its attack range was also one of the choices, Rhode couldn't find anyone to lure it away when he considered his team. It would be great if they had a Ranger or a Thief. But it was not the time to complain. Under Rhode's lead, Lize and Mase lowered their heads and stumbled forward. The thick fog around them began to surge again. It was evident that their actions had attracted the attention of the Ghosts. Four or five Ghosts had emerged from the thick fog and started to move toward them. "Lize, attack! Don't stop!" "Yes!" Although it was difficult for the girl to cast spells while running, she still clenched her teeth and stretched out her right hand. Soon, white lights appeared in the air and landed on the Ghosts. Then, Rhode immediately brandished his sword, and with a series of screams, those who blocked the way turned into dust and disappeared. At this moment, a system prompt flashed before Rhode's eyes. "Experience Points: 1,900/1,800. Level up. Level 8." However, Rhode didn't have the time to care about this system prompt. Because more and more Ghosts appeared around him. Although they moved slowly under the Holy Light, their great numbers created another advantage. Compared to those Ghosts who were not agile, the Gargoyle did not care about the Holy Light. Although they were both products of dark energy, as the guardian of the Mage, its rugged appearance made by the black obsidian rock was enough to resist the invasion of most sacred energy. After the attack failed, it immediately identified its targets. It followed closely behind the three of them, waiting to launch the attack. Unlike the undead creatures that relied on instinct to attack, artificial life with a certain level of intelligence to combat was much more troublesome. "Ah!" Just at this moment, Mase's body swayed, and he fell heavily to the ground. The Gargoyle, who had been waiting behind them for a long time, immediately rushed down. Two sharp claws flashed like lightning toward the fat merchant falling on the ground. When Mase turned around, all he saw was the shadow that almost shrouded his body. "God..." The Gargoyle was very fast, and Mase had already naturally closed his eyes, ready to wait for his death. However, its attacks failed again. A faint, golden barrier appeared out of thin air and blocked the sharp claws of the Gargoyle. Then, several sharp blades of light shot through the air and heavily struck the Gargoyle. With a loud "clap" sound, the Gargoyle that could not stop in time was sent flying and heavily smashed into the group of Ghosts. At this moment, Lize had already dragged the fat merchant, who was ready to go to another world to greet his family. They continued to run forward. "Here!" Under the "encirclement and interception" of the Ghosts, Rhode escaped from most undead creatures with incredible difficulty. Then, he raised his head and quickly found his target, an abandoned church. It was also the place where the Mage used to do his experiments. According to Rhode's memory, the central control device of the Gargoyle should also be there. However, this kind of place was naturally not easy to enter. Just as Rhode reached the church entrance, he felt his vision darken. He quickly activated the Shadow Flash and retreated. Then, he saw a pitch-black Gargoyle half squatting where he had just stood. A hard claw had smashed into the ground, shattering the hard stone bricks. "That's terrible." Rhode cursed in his heart. At the same time, he quickly glanced around and found that the stone statues initially used for decoration on both sides of the church's gate had disappeared. As for where they went, it was apparent. To encounter two at a time, he should buy lottery tickets today if he could survive. "Go inside quickly and find the central control device!" Rhode looked at the Gargoyle and ordered Lize and Mase. "Those Ghosts probably won't go in and attack you. I will fight them here. Take this opportunity to go inside immediately, find the central control device, and destroy it. Be careful of traps." "But..." "Mr. Rhode, you..." "This is an order." Rhode coldly interrupted Lize. Then, he held the Star Mark and swung it forward. A snow-white light blade instantly exploded. When Rhode attacked, the Gargoyles also screamed and flew up at the same time. They avoided his attack and made way for the path to the church. "Go!" Chapter 16 Talent Tree Unlocked Rod hit the dark gargoyle of Level 15 with his shining blade in the air, producing bright sparks. "Ooh!" Rod quickly retreated. He felt the shining blade trembling and a powerful impact from its body, causing his upper body to ache. Just like what Rod used to think about it, a gargoyle of Level 15 was indeed not easy to deal with, especially since there were two. The only lucky thing was that the gargoyles were really sensitive in fighting like human beings. Although this was not a good thing in normal times, now having human cautiousness, they were less threatening in their actions. This was especially so for the gargoyle that had been hit by the crushing blade. Now seeing Rod's blade was shining, it immediately screamed and retreated. The other gargoyle had not suffered a blow. But it became hesitant seeing what happened to its companion. This gave Rod a chance to catch his breath. However, this would not last long. Holding the Star Mark blade in his hand, Rod gritted his teeth as he looked at the two gargoyles in the air. Although the two gargoyles did not dare to attack because they were afraid of his crushing blade, Rod was sure that they would not let him off so easily. Although there was a standoff between them, it would not last for too long. When he leveled up to Level 8, Rod had already increased the proficiency of the Lunar Shadow Sword Technique to 4/4. Although the amount of soul force used by the Blade of Destruction had decreased a little after the level-up, problems would still occur if he used it frequently. Moreover, this wasn't the final battle. So Rod had to save a portion of his strength to deal with the possible unexpected situations that might occur next. After all, he was the only one with combat strength among the three, and if all of his strength ran out here, then their situation would be very troublesome. On the other hand, the two gargoyles were not just staring at Rod. Instead, they repeatedly swooped to attack Rod  in turn with their sharp claws. Once they noticed that he had the intention to counterattack, they would immediately fly away. Sufficient physical strength was of necessity for launching a battle of attrition. But it was not a problem for the two artificial creatures that were completely controlled by magic power. But Rod was completely different. Rod's forehead was beaded with sweat. His body had gradually become tired as he had to defend himself all the while. However, Rod could not back down. He knew that now it was impossible for him to be able to fight two gargoyles at once. Thus, he could only count on Lize. After all, there was no particularly dangerous situation in the church that was worth taking precautions against. However. Did I forget to remind them to pay attention to the protective magic circle? However, after thinking about it, Rod shrugged his shoulders and focused his attention on the gargoyles in front of him. Anyway, the circle was not life-threatening.  "Ouch!" Giving a "mournful" scream, Mace fell to the ground, with his whole body twitching. I am going to die! Help! Help! "It was just an electric shock! You are not dead, Mr. Mace." Lize was rummaging through worn-out things placed long ago on a tattered table that had been covered in dust and spider webs. She did not turn around but just cast a healing spell on Mace to heal his pain before throwing herself back into the search. Although most mages would cast many protective spells in their own rooms to protect their secrets, this church had been "desolated" for a long time after all. In addition, as time went by, the power of the protective magic circles weakened greatly. So it would not be life-threatening. What's more, Lize was a half-angel who had sufficient power to resist magic spells. Therefore, these protective magic circles whose power had weakened did not have much effect on her. The traps that would bring fire and lightning if touched only flashed a few times before disappearing. It was the unlucky Mr. Mace who made people believe that these traps were still effective. After all, he was subject to magic spells as an ordinary person, so what happened to him proved that these protective magic circles would more or less pose a threat. "This, this damn place is really annoying." Mace patted his body to remove the dust and slowly got up. He muttered as he secretly observed his surroundings. In the dark church, only the holy light cast by Lize quietly floated beside her, illuminating the originally dark world. However, what Mace saw made him tremble with fear. As the light shone, he could clearly see the dark, strange magic circles and eerie human bones on the floor. These were enough to make Mace go weak at the knees, not to mention the bloody marks on the wall, which scared him so much that he almost ran away the moment he came in. Mace felt embarrassed seeing Lize's calmness. He also knew that there were two real dangers outside the entrance. Otherwise, this fat merchant would have already run away. But now, he had no choice but to stay against his will and search for the "control center" together with Lize. How could I find that strange thing in such a messy place? Mace patted his body to remove the dust and muttered. However, seeing Lize was serious, he did not say anything else but continued to rummage. At this moment, Rod wasn't easy either. A gargoyle screamed and launched an attack. Rod turned his body slightly and dodged the attack. However, this time, the gargoyle did not immediately fly away after missing the attack. Instead, it turned its body and attacked him with its thick tail instantly! Oh no! Rod's heart sank when he heard the wind from behind. He hurriedly turned around, and at the same time, used the blade in his hand immediately to block the attack and protect his body. Rod's reaction was fast, but the gargoyle's attack was faster than his. Just as he turned around, he felt a powerful impact from the attack through the blade. The powerful force not only bent the shining blade in Rod's hand, but also sent him flying. His body rolled around several times on the ground before stopping.  "Ooh!" Rod got up. He felt dizzy and his blood was surging within his body. Even half of his body was numb. He almost could not hold tight the blade in his hand. He wanted to shake his head and stabilize his mind, but a slight sound from behind made him nervous immediately. "Si..." Along with this faint sound, a whiff of cold and gloomy air emerged from behind Rod. Without thinking, Rod instinctively rolled onto the ground to avoid the attack. When he raised his head, he found three ghosts slowly approaching him. It turned out that although the gargoyle's attack did not cause any damage to Rod, it sent him flying from the front of the church entrance to the edge of the barrier. Although those ghosts were unable to get close to the church due to the barrier, they did not leave. Instead, they wandered around the invisible barrier and waited for chances with their instincts. And now, a chance had finally come. However, Rod didn't want to let these ghosts get this chance. Seeing the approach of his enemies, he gritted his teeth and had no choice but to give up the idea of saving his strength. The blade in his hand suddenly released a shining beam of light shooting forward. A shining blade of light shot out from Rod's blade. It rotated and scattered, heavily hitting one of the ghosts and tearing apart its defenses. Then, Rod immediately rushed forward without hesitation. The blade in his hand drew a perfect arc in the air and pierced into the ghost's heart. The unlucky ghost screamed. Before it turned to dust, Rod had already passed through its body and returned to the boundary of the barrier. What should I do next? Just as Rhode was thinking about this question, a system message that appeared in front of him made him stunned. [Experience Points: 4,000/ 1800. Now You Can Level up and Unlock Talent Tree. Current Level: 8] Have I already leveled up to Level 10? But before entering the Fog Ruins, I just earned Level 8. Rod was stunned for a moment. He recalled that after that, he seemed to have seen a system message which said his experience was enough to level up. However, he was ambushed by the gargoyles at that time, so he did not pay attention to it. Now, it seemed that the experience he had gained from killing those ghosts was enough for him to level up again. This wasn't weird. After all, this was a five-player instance dungeon in which almost all of the experience points rewards for killing monsters were obtained by Rod alone. In addition, his level was low to begin with. Killing monsters above his level also brought bonus rewards, so it was natural for him to level up to level 10. The only strange thing for him was that the experience points of games indeed existed in the real world. But now it was not the time to care about these trivial things. Rod quickly opened his stat and made a choice. After all, this might be the only chance for him to gain an advantage. [Experience Points: 4,000/ 1800. Now You Can Level up and Unlock Talent Tree. Current Level: 8] [Experience Points: 2200/2000. Now You Can Level up and Unlock Talent Tree. You have earned 1 Skill Point. Current Level: 9] [Experience Points: 200/2500. Now You Can Unlock Talent Tree. You have earned 2 Skill Points. Current Level: 10] [Do You Want to Unlock the Talent System?] "Unlock!" Without any hesitation, Rod quickly responded. In less than a second, three different Talent Tree diagrams appeared in front of his eyes. In the Dragon Spirit Continent, every profession of level 10 or above had 3 talent options. They could choose one of them as their major ability, and could support it with other stats and skills attached to other talents. This type of talent was also obtained through skill points. This also made the players confused in the beginning. This was because every time a character leveled up, they would only be able to obtain 1 skill point.  Besides the talent tree, increasing proficiency in skills such as swordsmanship and spells also required a lot of skill points. Because of this, players didn't have enough skill points to use when they started to play the game. Fortunately, when players leveled up to the middle levels, they could obtain extra skill points to improve their skills through a type of "awakening scroll" and some difficult tasks. Rod's Summoning Swordsman had three different forms of talent. They were the Master of Summoning, the Soul Messenger, and the Lord of Hell. The Master of Summoning would increase the number of spirits summoned by its owner every time it leveled up to certain levels. The Soul Messenger would strengthen the power of the summoned spirits. The Lord of Hell had a unique skill that could probably turn non-human creatures killed by its owner into its own summoned spirits. Of course, after conversion, these creatures would be determined to be immortal. It could be said that each of the three forms of talent had its own advantages and disadvantages. The Master of Summoning offered the strength of quantity, while the Soul Messenger paid attention to quality. But considering the rarity of magical beasts and the expensive price of the Soul Core, the Hell Lord proved to be a very good option. Any other person who faced the three forms would have been hesitant and unwilling to give up on every single one of them. However, this wasn't a problem for Rod. After all, he had played with the profession of Summoning Swordsman for a full seven years. All the tips and skills he had developed regarding the Summoning Swordsman had long been regarded as a textbook by many players. Even in the game, almost two-thirds of the players who chose the Summoning Swordsman used Rod's experience and skills as the standard to create their own characters. Therefore, while it was difficult for many new players to make a choice, Rod knew how to handle it the moment he saw the Talent Tree. Chapter 17 Master of Summoning The first principle of a summoning swordsman was that one should never fight alone at any time. [1 Skill Point is Used to Increase Moon Shadow Swordsmanship by 1/5 to Proficiency C. Moonlight is Unlocked.] [1 Skill Point is used for designated talent Master of Summoning Awakening.] [Summoning Master Level 1 Talent Unlocked: Echo of Soul (Every time the character levels up by 10 levels, number of summoned spirits will increase), Soul Call (You can share senses with summoned creatures, increase the duration of the soul connection),] Construction Coordination (You can perform Dual Spirit Fusion)] [Permanent skill acquired: Echo of Soul LV 1(Every time the character levels up by 10 levels, summoned spirits will increase by 1)] [Number of Summoned Spirits Increase by 1] Just as the last line of the system message disappeared, a huge shadow flickered across the corner of Rod's eyes. However, he did not retreat, nor did he show any fear. On the contrary, Rod raised his sword and swung it forward. Swish! A green figure flew out from the edge of the blade and launched an attack on the gargoyle flying to Rod. Bird of Soul. [ The biggest problem facing Rod at the moment was that he could not summon two creatures at the same time, and unfortunately, as his weapon, the Star Mark blade was one of the creatures he could summon. Like ordinary swordsmen, normal summoning swordsmen would only be equipped with a "normal" weapon. Rod's case was an exception. Although he had thought of using a normal weapon, he couldn't give up on the type bonus of the Star Mark. It was also because of this ability that Rod was able to easily defeat monsters of levels similar to or even higher than his, which allowed him to gain so much experience at the start. But on the other hand, because of this, Rod was unable to launch attacks together with summoned creatures, which was an ability unique to summoning swordsmen. He looked more like an orthodox swordsman. This made Rhode quite uncomfortable, but there was nothing he could do. If he wanted to summon the Bird of Soul, then he would have to quit the Star Mark first. However, in this case, Rod would be unarmed and defenseless, a predicament he could not afford to face. Although he mainly counted on summoned creatures, he was a swordsman, not a mage. Therefore, Rod couldn't hide behind summoned creatures and do nothing like those mages. But if he wanted to use the Star Mark, he had to seal the Brid of Soul, and if he fought like an ordinary swordsman, it would not be a good thing for Rod. This was because unlike genuine swordsmen, a summoning swordsman suffered the biggest disadvantage, which was a decrease in proficiency in all kinds of swordsmanship by 1, a punishment for its profession. In other words, a genuine swordsman could level up to SSS in the proficiency of swordsmanship, the top level, while a summoning swordsman could only reach SS, no matter how hard they strived. Furthermore, the two did not start from the same starting line. All levels of a genuine swordsman's proficiency in swordsmanship started from D. However, in the case of Rod's summoning swordsman, all levels started from E. This was the difference. In fact, from the moment Rod came to this world until now, the fight had been very hard for him. If he did not have the Star Mark and know the Dragon Spirit Continent well, he would have been in a sorry state long ago. This was because it had become a habit that he could fight together with summoned creatures at any time. He felt extremely pressured if he could not fight with them. But now, with the talent of Master of Summoning unlocked, he finally felt relieved. It was true that the summoning swordsmen were not as strong as the genuine swordsmen in terms of individual offensive ability, but they had never fought alone.  The gargoyle was stunned when it saw the Bird of Soul charging at it. It could sense the magical air coming from the Bird, but its human wisdom was so poor that it could not figure out what the thing that was charging at it was. However, it still thought that thing was its enemy and launched an attack with its claws. But this time, the gargoyle missed its target. Just as it felt its claws were about to hit the Bird, the originally solidified form suddenly vanished into thin air [like a snowball that had been scattered by someone]. It hit nothing but a weak airflow that quickly passed through its claws and disappeared without a trace. But before the gargoyle could figure out what had happened, Rod had already come to it. He held his blade and swung it forward. A shining moon arc shot out from Rod's blade, flying toward the gargoyle who did not have time to defend itself after missing the target. This was Moonlight, the third skill from the swordsmanship of Moon Shadow. Like the Blade of Destruction, it was a skill of launching attacks with condensed sword qi. But the effects of the two were completely different. The Blade of Destruction shot forward in the form of a blade of light. Although it was powerful and strong in penetrative power, the scope of the coverage was narrow. The targets could dodge it easily. However, the Moon Light was different. It would produce an attack [in the form of a crescent moon] that could sweep and at least pose a threat to a large area in the direction of its targets. So it was difficult for the targets to dodge even if they wanted to. Sure enough, in the face of the attack of the blade of light, the gargoyle subconsciously wanted to fly away to dodge it. However, it failed to move quickly and was hit by the shining blade of light in its right wing. With the falling of several small pieces of gravel, the Gargoyle body that was originally floating in the air suddenly slanted and lost its balance. However, this was not the end. Just as it was about to maintain its balance, Rod took two steps forward and waved his empty left hand downwards, making a strange gesture. The Bird of Soul, which dodged the attack of the gargoyle and disappeared like a breeze a while ago, now hovered in the air behind the gargoyle. Its body came out of the condensed howling wind. With a clear cry, the Wind Bird with its body wrapped in the wind heavily smashed into the back of the gargoyle. The explosive shockwave immediately blew the gargoyle away. This made the already furious gargoyle scream in anger, but before it could express its anger, a shining blade of light flickered in its eyes. Then there came one after another. The spinning Blade of Destruction accurately hit the right wing of the gargoyle. Although the wing was made of obsidian, it could not withstand the barrage of attacks. Just as the gargoyle was hit by the waves of attacks, cracks spread across the wing like spider webs. Soon, with a crisp shattering sound, the wing made of hard material completely shattered. Then the gargoyle screamed and fell to the ground, leaving a hole in the bluestone floor. When a summoning swordsman fought in battles, they should be superior both in quantity and quality. Rod finally recovered the confidence he had when he was fighting in the past. In fact, if he had a normal weapon now, he would be able to control two summoned creatures to attack at the same time after unlocking the Master of Summoning. At that time, even if the BOSS came in person, he was confident that he could defeat it in a battle of attrition, not to mention the two rare elites. However, that was impossible. In addition, Rod did not have another Soul Core in his possession that could be used to awaken spirits. Thus, he had no choice but to give up on the idea of continuing the attack. He quickly retreated backward. Because at this moment, the second gargoyle had already swooped down on him. Perhaps it was because the gargoyle saw that its companion was injured, its attack was quite fierce. However, Rod, who now could summon the Bird of Soul, naturally did not intend to be foolish enough to fight it head-on. Facing the shadow that had previously made him miserable, he just raised his head and whistled. Then, a gust of wind suddenly whistled past him and forcefully pushed away the dark shadow that was about to attack Rod. After missing its target, the confused shadow rolled about several times before crashing into the wall of the church beside it and stopping. However, Rod would not want to miss such a good opportunity. With a wave of his finger, the cyan whirlwind rose from the ground, and the flying bird stretched their wings and once again pounced on the enemy in front of it. Suddenly, the situation was reversed. The two gargoyles which had been swaggering around in the air earlier were now as battered and exhausted as drowning dogs, while Rod, who had been struggling under intense pressure just now, immediately brought about an upswing, once again seizing the upper hand in the battle. He intentionally cooperated with the Bird of Soul to forcefully separate the two gargoyles in order to ensure that whenever they fought one gargoyle, the other one was unable to come to the rescue in time. Although the situation was better now, Rod had no way of obtaining any further results. This was because he had already used up more than half of his strength. Moreover, in the game, players could revive in a "full HP" state after leveling up. However, it was obviously impossible to be lucky like that in reality. Therefore, although Rod had leveled up to level 10 and unlocked his talent tree, the strength of his soul was just strengthened with a portion he should possess from the leveling up. He was unable to defeat the two gargoyles if only counting on these things. Moreover, controlling two summoned creatures at the same time would require a lot of strength of his soul. He even had to pay more attention to the consumption of strength of his soul than before to avoid the "blackout". After all, Rod was lagging behind far in level, and the defense of the gargoyles should not be underestimated. In previous attacks, Rod only shattered one gargoyle's wing and did not cause any fatal damage to them. In this case, if Rod spared no efforts to attack, then it was indeed possible to defeat one of the gargoyles. But in this way, he would run out of his strength and have to face the other one alone without any strength left to defend himself. Anyone sensible could figure out what the result was. The only thing Rod could do now was to keep these two annoying creatures under control and wait for Lize and Mace to find the Control Center. Otherwise, the situation would turn back to how it was before. Although one of its wings had been destroyed, the gargoyle was still dangerous. It lay prone on the ground like a giant black stone dog and then started to run with its four claws like a ghost on the ground. This was precisely what made terrifying these creatures of alchemic origins. If one thought that the monsters only swaggered around in the air, then they would definitely suffer a great loss. Fortunately, Rod had a deep understanding of them. Although Rod would not be naive like a newbie who thought that they would be able to intimidate gargoyles as long as they struck them down from the sky, he still felt relieved. After all, he needed no longer to pay too much attention to attacks from above. The pitch-black figure appeared behind Rod. The Gargoyle howled and extended its right claw to attack Rod's back. However, in the next moment, Rod dodged to the side. The pure white blade in his hand just blocked the attack like a bolt of lightning. At the same time, Rod stretched out his left hand. The Bird of Soul circling around him saw his gesture. It immediately let out a clear cry and spread its wings to fly, blocking the other Gargoyle that was trying to attack him from the sky. Although with its level, the Bird of Soul was unable to cause too much damage to rare elites like the gargoyle. But as a pure elemental creature, it could easily block their attacks. As time went by, Rod became more anxious. He felt that his body was a little tired, and he was even a little dispirited. This suggested that the strength of his soul was about to run out. However, there was still no news from the church at this moment. Could it be that they still haven't found the Control Center? [Whir] The shrill sound of wind came from beside Rod. This made him startled. He subconsciously dodged to the side and tried to activate Shadow Flash. However, just as he was about to dodge, he was wobbly and the skill that should have been activated lost its effect. The strength of the soul is about to be exhausted! This made Rod's heart sink. But at this moment, he didn't have time to think too much and hurriedly turned around and stabbed with his blade. The hard stone claws collided with the shining blade, creating an ear-piercing sound of friction. Missing the attack, the gargoyle quickly retreated. But Rod was unable to chase after it. Right at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded from behind him. "Mr. Rod! We found it!" Chapter 18 Heart of Gargoyle "Mr. Rod! We found it!" When Rod heard this voice, he immediately turned around and saw Mace standing at the entrance of the church with a pleasantly surprised expression. He held an exquisite statue high in his hand. On the statue was a gargoyle whose body was curled up together. Its two eyes made of ruby fragments were faintly emitting a shred of dark red light. It was the Control Center! Mace's shout also attracted the attention of the gargoyles. As the creature of alchemic origins, they certainly knew what Mace was holding. Suddenly, the two gargoyles changed their direction and rushed to him. "Ah!" When he saw the two terrifying monsters charging toward him, Mace couldn't help but let out a strange cry. He subconsciously wanted to turn around and run away, but at this moment, Rod's voice was already heard. "Throw it to me!" Mace felt so scared looking at these two fierce monsters that he had an illusion that he would be completely torn apart by them soon. But he still braced himself and threw out the black, refined statue in his hand. When it came to accuracy, one could say that this fat merchant was careless about it. The thing he threw out in an arc in the air flew in the wrong direction, not to Rod, but to the two gargoyles. This might make someone think that the fat merchant and the two gargoyles were a team. The gargoyles were also stunned seeing the statue fly to them. However, one gargoyle still subconsciously stretched out its claws, trying to hold the small statue. However, just as it was about to succeed, a gentle breeze flew past beneath it. It was the Soul Bird, which had almost lost its form. It brought along a series of translucent fluctuations in the air and forcefully snatched the statue. This was the last of Rod's strength. Then, he had no choice but to put away the blade in his hand. At the same time, he raised his right hand and made a snap of his fingers. With this sound, the grace body of the Bird of Soul came out and then flew towards Rod. The two gargoyles also immediately stopped midway and changed their direction. [Swish] One gargoyle was running on the ground. It turned its body over to swing its thick and long tail suddenly, launching a heavy attack on the body of the Bird of Soul. Although it did not suffer much damage from the attack, the cyan wind elements surrounding the Bird became chaotic slightly, which impacted the balance of the body of the Bird. However, the Bird did not give up. It still struggled to swing its wings as it flew above the ground, trying its best to fly toward its master. But it failed to reach its destination as it wished. A huge stone claw attacked the Bird from above and pierced its body. The chaotic wind element instantly turned into the most primitive existence and disappeared as it could no longer maintain the power for body condense. The black statue, once held in the mouth of the Bird, also came out and fell. But soon, two dark figures caught up from behind. They stretched out their claws, opened their mouths, and reached out to the statue in front of them. But the statue quietly and steadily fell into Rod's hands. [You Have Obtained the Gargoyle Control Center. Identification Finished.] [Order] "Aig!" Rod's voice wasn't loud, it was even a little low. But the shadows that had been attacking changed at this moment. Their bodies, once shining, became dim in the blink of an eye. Their limbs that stretched out in the air seemed to be frozen. The strange red light on the gargoyle's face also disappeared in an instant. Then, two black shadows brushed past Rod and landed heavily on the ground behind him. Boom! Along with the sound of the collision, the Gargoyles that had lost their momentum returned to their original form of statue. They maintained their previous flying actions and were quietly lying on the ground not far behind Rod. However, after losing the support of magic power, they were no longer as hard as before. With the collision, the two gargoyles fell apart. The gargoyles, once artistic sculptures, now were worthless trash. [Exhale] It was only then that Rod heaved a sigh of relief. At this moment, he only felt weak. The excessive consumption of strength made his legs go weak, and even his right hand which was holding the statue could not exert any strength. However, superficially, Rod still had a calm expression. He stood there silently and put the statue into his pocket after a while. "Mr. Rod!" At this moment, Lize and Mace ran up to him and looked at him with worried and anxious expressions. "Are you alright?" "I'm fine." Rod took a deep breath. Right now, he really wanted to sit down and rest for a while. Although in the game, excessive consumption of strength would cause all kinds of symptoms, he was unable to bear when those symptoms occurred to his body. However, he could not fall right now. Fortunately, they didn't see figures of the ghosts in the thick fog. It seemed that they had finally made a choice to give up after they could not get close to this forbidden area. Although this did not mean that they had given up, it was still a good thing at the moment. However, Rod did not talk too much. This was also his habit since he became the leader. A leader of a team must always remain calm and not panic because of trivial things. If he shouted when he encountered any difficulties or got carried away after defeating a strong enemy, then what he did would definitely not be helpful to his subordinates. Although Rod was no longer the guild leader of tens of thousands of players in the guild, he still paid attention to this habit. But it was true that both Lize and Mace became relieved when they saw his calmness. After all, while they were rummaging in the church, they had been worried about the situation outside, for fear that bad things would happen. Lize worked very hard, but Mace was obviously better at appraising items. He finally found this small statue in a small corner. It was true that they were really lucky. If it got any later, perhaps the result would be completely different. Rod once wanted to pass through the Fog Ruins as fast as they could. But he changed his mind when they encountered the two gargoyles. After all, he had run out of his strength to deal with the two Gargoyles. If he did not take a good rest and recover his strength, then future battles would be even more dangerous. Therefore, Rod finally decided to rest in the Church Hall for a night before continuing the journey the next day. He was not worried that there would be any accidents here. According to the instance dungeon in the game, this church was also a place that many players used to rest and sort out their spoils of war, so there would not be any serious problems. Although Mace felt scared when he looked at the dark church and the creepy decorations, he was the same as before. He did not have any right to speak against Rod's decision. The sky gradually darkened. The thick fog lingered outside the church, and looking through the window, they did not see anything but the whiteness. The three sat in the center of the church. The abandoned, rotten worship benches and tables, they took to use as firewood to get warm. The cold wind blew from the gap in the broken windows and the crack in the wall, bringing in traces of chill. Lize carefully stretched out her hand and removed the bandage on Rod's left chest. Then, she knitted her beautiful brows slightly. "It cracked again, Mr. Rod." "I know." Rhode nodded and did not say anything else. In fact, this had happened before. After all, all the way here, Rod always took the lead. Although he considered the injury on his chest and tried his best to avoid using his left hand, he could not care so much when he encountered some particularly annoying trouble. So his wounds cracked from time to time. Lize believed that the wounds would coalesce if he rested for two to three days. But in this case, they may not be able to heal even in more than ten days. However, the girl couldn't complain. After all, this happened because of them. So the only thing that Lize could do was to help Rod change the bandage every day to avoid the infection of the wounds. Fortunately, as a spirit master, she carried these things in sufficient quantity before leaving the floating ship. After the bandage was removed, everyone was shocked seeing the wounds with the light of fire. Mace even touched his chest with lingering fear and looked at Rod's chest in fear. There on Rod's chest, they saw three black claw marks, with sizes same as that of a forearm. Black scars were scattered after blood congealed. Because of Rod's intense battle with the gargoyles, many of those scars were torn apart. Scarlet blood seeped out and mixed with the black blood clots. Just looking at it made them chilled in their hearts. Lize took out a handkerchief and soaked it with some water from the pot. Then, she pressed it against Rod's chest. Then, his body twitched instinctively. Even Mace showed an expression in his eyes that he could not bear to see it. He turned his head away and didn't want to look at it anymore. "Sorry, sorry. Does it hurt?" "It's fine." Seeing Lize was flustered, Rod shook his head. It did hurt, but not to the degree that he was unable to endure. Hearing Rod's answer, Lize heaved a sigh of relief and continued to wipe the wounds on his body. At the same time, the girl began to secretly size up the young man in front of her who was slightly older. Frankly speaking, when she first met Rod, she did not think well of him, because he was very beautiful and his skin was white. So Lize naturally believed that he was a son of the influential. However, because Rod was not as arrogant as the young nobles Lize had met before, she could get along with him. However, at that time, she did not think too highly of him. After all, if a man looked like a woman, people might think he was weak when they first saw him. But then, Lize gradually changed her mind. This young man was different from those young nobles who lacked physical strength. He possessed considerable strength, and was not even inferior to her leader. Moreover, he had a very steady personality. With him, she would feel at ease and would not panic even in the face of danger. And unlike his appearance, he had a strong mind. Lize knew how painful this kind of injury was. As a Spirit Master, she had treated many people before. Many men who didn't even frown on the battlefield would shout when they treated their wounds. However, Rod did not utter a single sound all along. He even took the lead in battle with such heavy injuries. Lize's hand paused. What am I thinking? Nonsense. The young girl shook her head and left those strange thoughts behind. Then, she continued her work. Rod did not notice the strange expression of the girl beside him. At this moment, he was focusing on his right hand. In the center of his palm, there were two gems that were emitting dark red radiance. It was one of the spoils that Rod had obtained from this battle, the Heart of the Gargoyle. Chapter 19 Holy Sword Leveled up As a caring guardian of the caster, gargoyles could be said to be the favorite of all the mages. However, since they were mages, most of them would choose to make the best use of everything. Although the gargoyles as guardians were not bad, just using them as bodyguards was far from enough. Therefore, for many mages, gargoyles could be used as a safe besides being a guard. This was also true for the two gargoyles. In their debris, Rhode found a lot of great items. Gargoyle, a rare elite of Level 15, was worthy of their identity as rare elites in terms of the Dropped. In addition to gems, crystals, and some gold coins, Rod also saw three magic items. Ice Talisman [Elite Item]: When you are attacked, it can automatically trigger the Ice Shield, blocking damage by 50 to 150, immune to water type attacks. Oath Guardian [Excellent Item]: Possessor can increase spell effect by 5, spell resistance by 5. Ring of Mist [Excellent Item]: It can activate Ethereal Jaunt once every ten natural days, lasting for half an hour. They were all very good Spell Caster equipment. Selling them to the auction house would definitely bring quite a bit of profit. However, it was a pity that they were all Spell Casters' equipment. In the end, Rod shared the equipment with Lize. As a Spirit Master, although she was not an aggressive Spell Caster, the equipment would be helpful for her. Therefore, Rod handed over the Ice Talisman and Oath Guardian to her and left the Ring of Mist to himself. In the game, the skills that this Ring possessed would be of great help to the players who cleared the dungeon alone, so Rod did not hesitate to keep it. On the other hand, Lize was very surprised that she would obtain two pieces of equipment for no reason. It should be known that in an ordinary mercenary group, although they would also obtain a lot of magic equipment when they went out to adventure, these items of equipment would usually be sold by the leader and then obtained money to maintain the operation of the entire mercenary group. It was hard to imagine that a leader would share the obtained equipment with others like this. From this, one could also see the gap between NPCs and players. As a part of this world, the mercenaries' ultimate goal was only to make money to make a living, so even if they found rare equipment, most of them would sell the equipment. In fact, many small mercenary groups rarely took those difficult-to-pass tasks. They even spent their entire lives doing insignificant missions that were worthless in the eyes of the players. This was because the goal of these mercenaries was to earn money and live, and that was all. Those who were qualified to obtain magic equipment were usually highly respected and powerful people in mercenary groups. Incompetent mercenaries could do nothing but admire them. However, players were different. From the moment they entered this world, their goal was to become better, higher, stronger, obtain better equipment, more experience, higher fame, and more powerful characters. This was what players pursued. So for them, magic equipment was not a rare item, and players were not worried about finding a buyer for them. Anyway, they could still be sold after they found better ones. For example, the three items of magic equipment before him, Rod thought that these items were nothing but equipment for Levels 10 to 15. Although the Ice Talisman was good in type, Rhode did not need it. If he could have a high level summoned spirit of the water element, he could also be immune to Water Type Attacks, so it was not a big deal for him to share this Low End equipment with others. He only paid attention to items of legendary, fake Legend or ancient level such as Sword of Sky and Heart of Sage. However, in Lize's eyes, these items of equipment were extremely "high-end". One must know that even the leader of a medium-sized mercenary group only had three or five pieces of magic equipment, while mages had a greater quantity. But a Spirit Master was a supportive profession. it was very difficult for them to obtain equipment. Moreover, they generally did not need it, which was determined by their stance and nature. But now, how could she, as a Spirit Master of a small mercenary group actually obtain two items of good magical equipment in the blink of an eye? Lize even wonder if she was dreaming. However, compared to Lize, Mace saw more things from what Rod had done. Mace was a merchant who traveled all over the world. He naturally understood how valuable an item of magic equipment was, especially these items of magic equipment. In his opinion, even if he were to auction them at the most prosperous port of Carragher in the north, a price of twenty to thirty thousand gold coins would be no object. However, when Rod gave them to someone else, he was at peace, as if what he was about to give was insignificant. This kind of peace was not what a young man would deliberately show to act to be cool in front of a beautiful girl. It came from the bottom of his heart. In other words, these items of magic equipment were not worth Rod's attention. This was definitely not something that an ordinary person could achieve. Mace had dealt with many people before, including mercenaries and nobles. These people thought that these items of magic equipment were also quite valuable. They rarely gave them to others so casually like this, and they wouldn't be like Rod, who didn't seem to care about these items of equipment at all. What did this imply? This meant that in the eyes of this young man, this kind of magic equipment was not worth mentioning. Moreover, this attitude could also imply that this young man was likely to have an extraordinary background. Previously, Mace thought that Rod was an ordinary noble among countless ones on the continent. But now he regarded this young man as in the same category of the major nobles or royal families with a long history. Only those families would have so many items of magic equipment and only those families would look down on them. It was as if a person with countless wealth would not care about the loss of a small amount of money, although it might be a huge amount that ordinary people would never be able to obtain in their entire lives. Thinking of this, the fat merchant got excited suddenly. As a small merchant, he usually did not have the opportunity to meet with those big aristocratic families with a long history. After all, those big aristocratic families all had powerful helpers. A small merchant like him was not worth their attention. But now this opportunity came. If he could grasp it well, it might bring in hopes. But this idea was soon left behind. He thought of his poor performance along the way. Although the young man did not complain about it, the fat merchant himself understood that he had not done anything worthy of Rod's attention at the moment, which made him feel discouraged again. Indeed, Rod did not care about the three pieces of equipment. In fact, what he cared most about right now were the two heart-shaped gems in his hands. Heart of Gargoyle Condensed composite of artificial soul This theory seemed a bit complicated. But if players considered the Gargoyles a robot, then the Heart of the Gargoyle was the chip. Its value was self-evident. In the Dragon Spirit Continent, creatures of alchemic origins were very high-end techniques. Creating life was the patent of a god, and even mages could not go against this. Artificial souls were the choice they had to settle for the second best. Because of this, the complete artificial soul core was rare, and not every mage could learn it. But for mages, having an artificial alchemical life was one of the highest goals they pursued, just like how a tall and handsome man must have a sports car to prove his value. Mages usually paid close attention to this kind of thing. It was rarely circulated in the market, and a small volume was manufactured. Naturally, it was worth a high price. If it was put up for auction, its price would be surely at more than a hundred thousand gold coins, still higher if traded on the black market. In terms of its quality, the best artificial soul core could even be sold for a few million gold coins, which was enough to buy a large territory. What's more, all mages were rich. However, Rod didn't care about the money. From many years of experience, he learned that one could earn money at any time, and that one would always not have enough money to spend no matter how much they earned. But there were some things that money could not buy. For example, the other ability of the Heart of Gargoyle. Forced increase of Summoned Spirit Evolution by 1. The experience point of a summoned creature was shared with its possessor. Generally speaking, if Rod obtained 1000 experience points during a battle, then he actually only obtained 700, and the remaining 300 points were obtained by the Spirit in the battle. Although this portion of experience points didn't look significant, many a little made a mickle. This was also the reason why it was more difficult for a summoned swordsman to level up to the top than other professions. In fact, according to the rules of the game, if Rod was in a different class, when he obtained the experience points from  a Level 10 5-player Instance Dungeon, then he should have leveled up to Level 12 or Level 13 from Level 8 at the very least. However, because the experience points were shared by Cyan Bird and Star Mark, he was only able to level up to Level 10. As for his summoned creature. [10th place of the Eternal Sacred Sword: Star Mark, no type, can be merged -- the dust of history can not cover its dazzling radiance. LV: 5. Brave advance with the glory of victory, ability of sharp blade.] Level 10 was the highest level of summoning spirits, and after level ten, spirits could obtain a chance to evolve. After evolution, changes would occur to them. Moreover, their level cap will increase by 10, until the third evolution arrived. The ability of Heart of Gargoyle was that it forcefully leveled up the summoned spirits to level 10, and then activated the evolution. This way, more experience points would be saved, and the time needed to level up would be reduced. What couldn't be bought with money? It was time. Rod didn't know what the level limit of Star Mark was. But according to his experience, the summoning card at the end of the card set usually did not have a higher level limit. The highest limit would come after three evolutions. If he spent the two pieces of Heart of Gargoyle, then at least when fighting against monsters of the same level, the Holy Sword, which had been forcefully leveled up, would no longer share Rod's experience points. However. Rod fell into deep thought. This set of Holy Sword cards was very unique. When he took this card from the president of the B&M company, the president clearly told him that this was a one-of-a-kind card in the world. At that time, Rod did not take it seriously. But thinking about it now, he felt puzzled. Just one? Previously, the system message had clearly told him that he had only obtained 1/10 of the Eternal Card Set. How could it become the only one? Then what was with the remaining nine? And this was the 10th, which was also the last card. There should be nine cards before it. However, there was no such set of cards in the game because it was only a souvenir in reality. In the game background of the Dragon Spirit Continent, Rod had never heard of any information about the Holy Sword set. Moreover, this could not be hidden in the game, because the creation of this set of cards was due to him obtaining victory in the competition. Because the guild he formed was called Starlight, the company specially designed this card to give him as a reward and commemoration. This product was made temporarily in a short time, so it was impossible to be placed in the game system. But at any rate, he had to give it a try. Thinking of this, Rod extended his right hand and held one of the gems in his palm. Soon, a system notification appeared in front of his eyes. [Heart of Gargoyle Has been Found (Magical Item). Do you want to use it?] Yes. Rod replied in his heart. Following Rod's reply, the summoning magic circle on his right palm immediately flashed with faint magic light. Then, the dark red gem shattered under the light and turned into powder and disappeared. Soon, a new message appeared before Rod's eyes. [[Target? ] Star Mark. Rod lowered his eyes and replied in his heart. [Target - Star Mark - Forced Evolution] [Level-up completed.] [Do you want to activate evolution? ] Yes. The pure white card once again appeared in Rod's hand. The radiance emitted by it made Lize and Mace look over curiously. At this moment, a series of system notifications appeared before Rod's eyes. [Evolution complete.] [10th place of the Eternal Sacred Sword: Star Mark, no type, can be merged -- the dust of history can not cover its dazzling radiance. Lv: 10, Brave advance with glory of victory, ability of sharp blade. The snow-white wings protected everything, protecting their ability. The holy radiance dispersed the darkness and pierced the ability.] [Attached Skill: Sharp Blade, Guard of Wings, and Star Directional Sign. Can be used three times a day.] Not bad! Seeing this system message, Rod nodded in satisfaction. Star Mark contained three special skills, and these skills were attached to weapons. In other words, casting these skills did not need to use Rod's soul strength. And it could be used three times a natural day. In terms of  the number of times, it could be considered a high grade. It could be imagined that it would definitely be of great use in battle. However, the next system message stunned Rod. [Condensation of magic power is detected.]
