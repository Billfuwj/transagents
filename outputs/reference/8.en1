Chapter 805 The Last Story "In the eastern campus?" Zhou Tu obviously hesitated for a moment. Both the senior students and the teachers had warned the new students not to approach the eastern campus. They did not explain the specific reason, but from their tone of voice, it could be told that the eastern campus was very dangerous. "You have a deep misunderstanding about the eastern campus. It is not much different from here, but the difference lies in the management. Students in the eastern campus live in the real horror, while you live in the false happiness." Chen Ge looked into Zhou Tu's eyes. "Contrary to what you think, they are actually closer to hope, because they at least know who they are and know the way to escape." Chen Ge did not lie to Zhou Tu. Regardless of which campus, they were all trapped in this school. The memories of the students on the western campus were modified to repeat a life scripted by the mastermind behind the scenes. In contrast, the students on the eastern campus knew how to find people to take the blame for them and find the way out. "The students of the eastern campus are more hopeful? But I heard that only trash students from the western campus would be sent there." Zhou Tu had already been persuaded, but he still felt a little uneasy. "No matter what the standard of judgement is, any school that mistreats its students is undoubtedly of poor quality." Chen Ge pointed at the high wall between the two campuses. "Do you know why that wall exists?" "Why?" Because the school was afraid of losing control, they used all sorts of methods to reshape human nature, but they forgot that human nature was the most complicated thing in this world. Things had already happened. No matter how one tried to forget it, the wounds left behind would always leave marks on hearts. Just because they couldn't remember anything didn't mean they didn't exist. As a result, some of the school's plans were doomed to fail. Chen Ge said something that the members of the club could not figure out. They did not know why Chen Ge said that, but they felt that what Chen Ge said made sense. Humans are naturally curious, and Chen Ge kept telling them the truth about this school. Eventually, he successfully attracted their interest. "Shall we go now? To be honest, I really don't believe that my dream painting room exists in the eastern campus." Zhou Tu whispered. "Now is not the time." Chen Ge turned back to look at the shadow. The shadow in Room 413 was still asleep, but his body had changed a lot. Upon a closer look, one would find that Chen Ge's shadow was different from the others. It was as dark as ink as if all the light would be swallowed up when it reached there. It seemed to have become much stronger. Chen Ge saw great potential in his shadow, which was a great thing. Once his full potential was awakened, he planned to lead the students back to the eastern campus to confront the lone ghosts. This way, he could not only increase his own strength but also muddy things in school to cover the other "murderer" in the school. "We are still in the stage of accumulating strength. Before the school master finds me, I have to prepare as many trump cards as possible for myself." Chen Ge turned to look at Wang Yicheng. He had learned about the stories of the other three club members, but the one who joined the club first, the boy with a limp, remained a mystery. "The next place we are going to is Wang Yicheng's dormitory." "To my dormitory?" Wang Yicheng reacted strangely. He waved his hand and said, "Forget it. There is nothing good to see in my dormitory." "When you say this, your voice is higher than usual. You speak faster and your eyes flicker. You are really not good at lying." Chen Ge hugged Wang Yicheng's shoulder. "Why are you against us visiting your dormitory? What are you worried about?" "I..." Wang Yicheng thought for a long time, struggling to find the right words. Finally, he shifted his eyes away and said. "It's nothing. Let's go then." "OK." Wang Yicheng lived in Room 413 of the western campus while Lin Sisi lived in Room 413 of the eastern campus. The dormitory number was exactly the same, but apart from the fourth bed on the western campus, all the other beds had students. The eastern campus was the exact opposite. Only the fourth bed was occupied, and the other beds were empty. "Don't tell anyone about the secrets of our club. Everyone, try to keep a low profile. There are teachers like me in this school, and there are teachers who are not easy to talk to." Chen Ge kept his guard up all the time. The commotion they caused in the lab building was too big, and the school might have already started investigating. "I don't have much time left. After our visit to Room 413, we have to stay low." The male dormitory of the western campus had a total of four buildings. The number of students was several times that of the eastern campus. The lights had not been turned off yet. It was the most bustling time in the male dormitory. From downstairs, the distinct sounds of running water as students washed up, plastic basins being dropped, and conversations filled the air. "This building is similar to the eastern campus." Chen Ge acted naturally and followed the four students into the first building. The door of the small room where the dormitory manager lived was closed, but the glass windows were open. Inside, there was a fifty-something woman who was humming a song. She seemed to be in a good mood. There was a notice next to the small window, which stated that students were not allowed to use high-power appliances and cook in the dormitory. "I remember the notice on the eastern campus dormitory building seemed to be - recently, there has been a sinister case. Students are forbidden to go out after the lights are out." Separated by a wall, it was almost two worlds, just like the inside and outside of the door. Passing through the corridor, Chen Ge and a few members of the club arrived at the entrance of Room 413. "This dormitory is no different from the other dormitories."  Wang Yicheng opened the door. After he entered the room, everyone else in the dormitory acted as if he did not exist and continued to do their own things. No one spoke to him. When Wang Yicheng took a few steps inside, the boy sleeping next to the door suddenly pulled open the mosquito net and glared at him. "How many times do I have I tell you? When you came in, you close the door. Your legs are lame, and it seems you are hard of hearing too." The boy's words were mean, and Chen Ge did not get why he hated Wang Yicheng. "He didn't close the door because there were still people coming in from behind. If you need an apology, we can apologize to you on his behalf. But I wonder what form of apology you need?" Chen Ge grabbed the door handle and entered the room. He glanced at the others in the room. When the man under the mosquito net saw Chen Ge, he was terrified. He did not say anything and pulled the mosquito net back up with a dark face. "Mr. Bai, this is the fourth bed. Since no one lives there, we used it to put our luggage." Wang Yicheng pointed at bed number four with a few suitcases on it. Only his luggage was placed under his bed, and the others all threw their belongings and luggage onto bed number four. Chen Ge was very familiar with bed number four. He had been lying on bed number four on the eastern campus. Walking to bed number four, although the bed was not occupied, it was covered with bedding and sheets, but the bedding was now dirty with luggage and debris. Extra Chapter for Zhang Ya: "Let's Register Our Marriage (Birthday Special Free Chapter)" Dark clouds loomed over the city, and the sky seemed to be within reach. Li Man stood by the window and watched the raindrops glide down the glass, leaving a trail in their wake. The clock ticked away, but time passed quietly in the small room. "It's 5:30. Time to call it a day." Li Man stretched lazily, moved the potted plants on the windowsill back inside the house, and then she walked to her desk. She put the sign that reads 'Marriage Registration Office' on the table into the drawer and glanced at the words on the wall - Follow laws and prioritize serving people. "It's raining so heavily today, there shouldn't be anyone coming to register the marriage." Li Man hummed a song and began to clean up. She was the only one in the marriage registration office, and the staff at the divorce registration office next to her had already gotten off work fifteen minutes in advance. "Hello, is this where we apply for a marriage certificate?" The door was pushed open and a mature and sonorous male voice sounded from the door. Li Man thought, "The voice was so pleasant to the ears, and he must be very handsome too. Li Man looked up and saw a man wearing a black raincoat standing at the entrance of the marriage registration office. He looked ordinary, but he had an indescribable allure. "Yes. Do you want to register your marriage?" Li Man carefully sized up the man. This was the first time she had seen someone wearing a raincoat and carrying a heavy backpack to get a marriage certificate. "Yes, I made an appointment online today." "Let me check. What is your name?" "Chen Ge." Li Man typed Chen Ge into the computer and saw his appointment application. "I'm about to get off work. Let's finish this quickly. Have you brought all the necessary documents? Both party's household registers, identity cards, and proof that you two don't have direct blood relations or collateral blood relations within three generations." "Yes, I brought them all." The man opened his backpack and began to search inside. Li Man vaguely heard a cat cry, and she glanced at the man's backpack with some curiosity. The bag contained a tape recorder, comic books, dolls, ballpoint pens, and a big white cat. "Sorry to bother you." The man handed two household registers and two identity cards to Li Man. "Everything is here. I have visited the woman's family. They are very satisfied with me." "It seems that you have made a lot of preparations." After Li Man finished registering the man's information and was about to start registering the woman's information, she suddenly found that the magnetic bar on the ID card was no longer usable. She looked at the name on the woman's ID card and suddenly realized something. The man who came to register for marriage had prepared all the necessary documents and even brought a cat, but his girlfriend was not present. "Bear with me, sir." Li Man stopped what she was doing and said, "Are you here to get married?" "Yes." "Where is your girlfriend? How are you going to settle it alone?" Li Man forced a smile, "Both parties are required to be present for the marriage certificate to be issued." The clock on the wall ticked away, and the rain outside grew heavier. The man lightly pursed his lips and looked up at Li Man. "She's here. She's standing right behind me." The raindrops hit the window fiercely, and the air in the room seemed to freeze. "Sir, don't joke around. The two parties have to come personally to get the certificate. I can't help you with this." Li Man covered her chest, and she didn't know why she suddenly felt a little breathless. "She really is present. We are inseparable. Wherever I am, she will be there." The man's eyes were clear and his tone carried a trace of determination. Seeing the man so serious, Li Man held the identity card that had long been demagnetized and a wild idea came to her mind. Flipping open the woman's household register, she found that the name on the woman's identification card was accompanied by a police declaration of death, dated several years ago. "Sir..." Li Man wanted to say something, but she looked at the man's serious expression and was somewhat moved. Sweeping her gaze over the man's backpack, Li Man looked at the items in it one by one. Were these belongings once used by the woman? Were these treasured moments from their shared memories? Did the woman have a cat before? In an instant, Li Man understood why the man would bring a lot of items to the Marriage Registration Office and also why the man would say that the woman had always been with him. Li Man held the girl's ID card and she didn't know what she should say to comfort the man, or to tell the man the cruel truth. Her lips slowly opened, and Li Man couldn't say the words she had thought of. She looked at the man in front of her who seemed like a child, leaving her feeling somewhat confused. She forced herself to smile. "Sir, you must love her very much, don't you? How did you meet her?" "She was the one who pursued me. The first love letter I received in my life was from her." The man's eyes drifted as if he was recalling the past. "Our first date was at an abandoned school." "Abandoned school? For the first date, you went to the abandoned school?" "In Western Private Academy, there lies her obsession and past. I am standing in the hall where she used to practice dancing. With my back against the mirror and her back against me, we can talk to each other." Li Man listened silently, and an image appeared in her mind. In the quiet night, the two of them recalled the past in the abandoned school. The school was once beautiful and lively, but now only the two of them were left. With their backs against each other, they sought solace in each other's presence. What kind of sad and beautiful love was this! "The second date was at a mental hospital. She was wearing a red dress, beautiful and flamboyant." "Mental hospital?" "Because of my parents, that day, I..." "I understand. I'm sorry." Before the man finished speaking, Li Man apologized that she didn't like to pry into other people's wounds. Perhaps her parents were another part of the pain in this man's heart. "The third date was in a building. I blocked the man who once offended her in the elevator and taught him an unforgettable lesson." "You really spoil your girlfriend. I think she will be very happy when she finds out about this." "She was present at that time." He was lost in his mind, recalling the image of the elevator shrouded in black hair within Supernatural Tales Association Building. "That scene must be very romantic and warm." Li Man felt that the man in front of her was simply exuding an overwhelming aura of boyfriend material. "The fourth date was in the underground morgue of the Forensics Academy. She was injured, but she didn't tell me. She sat quietly with me, and she even hugged me secretly." The man's voice was very pleasant to hear, hoarse with a mature charm. He was recalling the past, and his skills of story telling had a mesmerizing effect that Li Man found herself naturally overlooking the unusual dating location. "The fifth date was on the roof of a small town. Just like today, it was raining heavily outside. I was leaning against her." Compared to the abandoned school, mental hospital, and underground morgue, this date location was normal but Li Man was a little uncomfortable. "Did you confess your feelings to her that day?" The man nodded. "I stood at the highest point of the town, shouting the words in my heart to this strange world. I don't believe that there is anything more romantic than being inseparable for the rest of my life." "Wow!" Li Man had heard many people's stories, but none of them were as shocking as Chen Ge's story. Perhaps it was because she had seen the proof of death in the household register, and she had already known the result ahead of time. "And then?" "Later..." Chen Ge took a light breath. "She fell asleep. It took her a long, long time to wake up. I have been waiting for her." The death certificate in the household register pierced Li Man's heart like a steel needle at this moment, and her tears welled up in her eyes. Lowering her head, Li Man pretended to be looking for something and secretly wiped her tears when the computer covered her face. She already knew the ending of the story. No one spoke in the room. After a long time, the man broke the silence. His hand gently rested on the empty seat next to him, as if his girlfriend was sitting there. "Our sixth date." What the man said later was no longer important. Li Man knew that this man had trapped himself in the cell named love after his wife had an accident, and he thought that his girlfriend was still alive in the world. Because of his deep love, he refused to believe the fact that his girlfriend had left. Li Man wanted to tell Chen Ge the truth, but she could not bear to say it. She buried her face behind the computer and entered all the information on the application form. She wanted to help the man in front of her fulfill a dream, but when she pressed the confirmation button, the computer popped out a page that said there was a discrepancy in the household registration. That girl had died many years ago, and there was no such person in the household data. The reality was like a basin of ice water poured over Li Man. She looked at the man's face that had been lost in his memories and bit her lips: "Sir, the data here is incomplete. The system is upgrading. I can't help you with it for the time being. Please come back in a week." Li Man wanted to help the man in front of her, even if she had to fabricate a marriage certificate with no legal effect. "Alright, then sorry to bother you." The man slowly got up, packed up his things, and walked out. When he reached the door, he suddenly took off his raincoat and propped it over his head, as if there was another person standing next to him. "Zhang Ya, don't stay too far away from me. The rain is heavy."  Li Man saw very clearly in the room that besides himself, there was no one else under the man's raincoat. Looking at the man's retreating figure, Li Man wiped the corners of her eyes. "Maybe this is love. They love each other and remain faithful to each other, no matter what." Chapter 806 The Door Beyond the Realm of Sight "There are so many things on the bed. If the student on the fourth bed comes back at night, where will he sleep?" Chen Ge seemed to be talking to himself. "Don't tell me he will sleep in someone else's bed?" Ever since he came in, the students in Dormitory 413 turned their attention to him. After all, a person wearing work clothes entering the room was hard to ignore. "Are you a school teacher?" A tall and thin student was sitting on the bed opposite the fourth bed. He wore thick glasses and looked a little strange. "There is no one living in bed four. It is reasonable for us to put the things there." "With the bedsheet and blanket laid out, are you sure that no one sleeps on this bed?" Chen Ge smiled at the student. "Maybe you just can't see him. Be careful when you sleep at night. Don't sleep sideways. In case there is another person lying behind you." Chen Ge stood next to bed four and moved all the luggage on the floor. "This is bold. You even dare to take advantage of ghosts." "Hey! Don't touch our things!" The mosquito net man at the door poked his head out again. "I am saving you. This bed has its own owner. He has always been in this school." Chen Ge had found many things in Room 413 of the eastern campus, and he was eager to explore Room 413 of the western campus. "Do you also know about the story of bed number four in Room 413?" The glasses man's face turned stern and serious. "That was just something we made up to scare Wang Yicheng. Did you take it seriously?" "Whether it is true or not, you will know when you encounter it." After clearing the bed, Chen Ge removed the pillow cover and the blanket to make sure there was nothing hidden inside. "You said there was someone living in bed number four, so why did you touch someone else's things?" The tall and thin student pushed up his glasses. He did not like Chen Ge very much. Perhaps it was because Chen Ge was speaking up for Wang Yicheng. No one supported Wang Yicheng in this dorm. "I don't care. After all, I'm not staying in this dormitory." "If you anger him, he will come after you first." The way Chen Ge spoke was very different from the teachers in the eyes of students. But Chen Ge was completely indifferent to this matter as he knew he was a fake. Lifting the mattress under the sheets, Chen Ge stopped arguing with the people in the dormitory and focused his gaze on the bed. There were five bloody fingerprints on the edge of the beadboard against the wall. "Is this also a prank by you guys?" Chen Ge used his nails to scrape blood fingerprints and brought them closer to his nose. It should be coagulated blood. Why was there blood on bed number four? "Mr. Bai, what is that?" Because the blood fingerprints were quite hidden, Wang Yicheng had just noticed them. "The solidified red paint. I have learned how to paint, so I am very familiar with this smell." Chen Ge glared at the other students in the dorm. "Someone is trying to pull a prank." He did not continue to argue about this topic. He took out Lin Sisi's phone to light up and looked under the bedboard. It was very similar to eastern campus. There was something written under this bed. The tiny and closely packed words should be carved with a knife. "Why isn't anyone talking to me?" "Why is everyone ignoring me?" "I didn't lie to them! There really is a ghost! I really saw a ghost in the toilet!" "It's dangerous here! Why doesn't anyone believe me?" Chen Ge looked at these frustrating words, feeling a sense of familiarity. He continued to read and found a more familiar name. "I, Lin Sisi, swear with my life that the restroom is really haunted! It's true, they are watching me!" "I know that everyone hates me and wants to play tricks on me. I don't mind it at all. I understand, but the bathroom is really haunted! This time I really did not lie!" Every word on the bed was carved very hard, and some of the middle parts were stained with blood as if the person who carved the words had accidentally cut his hand. "Did Lin Sisi leave these words behind? But his description doesn't seem to be the same as the description in the Ghost School diary!" Chen Ge was keenly aware of the problem. The diary said that Lin Sisi was very naughty and liked to play tricks on others. In the end, the whole class could not take it anymore and tricked him into the restroom. They made fun of him, and in the end, he was scared to death. However, the words carved under the bed had another implication. Lin Sisi did not seem to be scared to death by his classmates. Instead, he really saw something in the restroom. Terrifying thoughts crossed Chen Ge's mind, and his pupils shrank. He didn't know who he should believe at this point. The owner of bed four was Lin Sisi, and there was no doubt that it was the same regardless of whether it was the eastern campus or the western campus. "If this dormitory has restored everything in its memory, then the words under the bed should also be true. However, Lin Sisi was scared to death. How could he come back and write under the bed?" When Chen Ge thought of this, he suddenly froze. He looked at everyone in the room. In this dormitory, there was only bed number four that was not occupied, just like what happened before. Lin Sisi was scared to death. The fourth bed was empty, and there were five other people living in the dormitory. Lin Sisi knew that the restroom was really haunted, so after he died, he came back to report and leave all kinds of marks, but no one cared. "No wonder he carved such sentences. He became a ghost. Of course, the living can't see it." Chen Ge did not know if the five people in this room were the same five people who once lived with Lin Sisi. If they were not, then they were too unlucky. In the eastern campus, every living person who had just entered the school was called Lin Sisi. This name symbolized misfortune and curse, targeted by all the vengeful spirits. However, if a ghost wanted to evolve into a higher level of existence, they needed a scapegoat. From a ghost's point of view, Lin Sisi's name represented hope. "It's getting more and more interesting. The curse in the eyes of a living person and the hope in the eyes of a ghost. What did Lin Sisi do in this school?" Chen Ge was sure that Lin Sisi had a deep connection with this school. Even if he was not the master of this school, he must have something to do with the master of the school. "It would be great if we could find him or the last 'Lin Sisi'." Chen Ge continued to read, and the words on the bed became more and more forceful. The anxiety in the person's heart gradually turned into despair. "I really saw a ghost. Can you just believe me this once?" "Listen to me, I am here, I am here!" "Alright, I don't expect you to believe me. I just hope you don't go to the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building! Remember! Don't go there!" "It's over. They still ran out." The information under the bed came to an abrupt end, and Chen Ge could feel the despair in the words. "The restroom on the top floor of the teaching building? Lin Sisi was killed there?" Chen Ge stood there silently, and his brain worked quickly. The ghost school was the most complicated, largest, and most difficult task he had ever done. All kinds of clues and mysteries were intertwined as if it was an endless fog. It was impossible to figure it out in one go, so Chen Ge could only start from the most fundamental point. The door can't appear out of thin air. There must be a door-pusher. If Lin Sisi is the door-pusher, then the door he opened is likely to be located in the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building!" Chapter 807 Black Leather Shoes Chen Ge's eyes lit up as he found a crucial piece of information. "The haunted school is a four-star scenario and I have never come into contact with a four-star scenario before. All my previous experiences won't be much of help here. If I want to know more, I can only check it myself." Chen Ge did not know how strong a person's obsession was to be able to create such a huge nightmare. Even Doctor Gao and Zhang Ya would not be able to do it together. "Maybe there was a door in the restroom. When the students were teasing Lin Sisi, the door was accidentally opened." There was also a door in Chen Ge's Haunted House that he did not dare approach, so he guessed that Lin Sisi might have encountered the same situation as him. He avoided the door, but Lin Sisi opened it. "No matter what the truth is, I have to go and see the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building!" The message on the bedboard did not specify whether the restroom was in the eastern or western campus. To be safe, Chen Ge decided to take a look at the restrooms in both campuses. "Let's leave this place first. Come with me to the experiment building." Chen Ge had already gained enough information from the bed, so there was no point in staying in Room 413 any longer. Instead, it would attract the attention of the students in the building. "The laboratory building? But we just..." Wang Yicheng still wanted to say something but was interrupted by Zhang Ju. He gently tugged at Wang Yicheng's arm. "Listen to the teacher. We will go wherever he asks us to go." Chen Ge said that going to the lab building was just a ruse, and the students in Room 413 treated them very poorly. Perhaps they would immediately report to the dormitory supervisor the moment they left. "The lights are about to go out. Let's get something and come back quickly." Chen Ge tidied up the bed, and they left Room 413. They didn't draw any attention along the way.  After leaving the male dormitory building, Chen Ge noticed many people running toward the laboratory building. Something seemed to have happened there. "Zhu Long just knocked over the dissection table. The teacher on duty can handle it himself. Is there a need to alarm so many people?" Chen Ge was curious about the situation at the lab building, but going there was like walking into a trap, so he decided to avoid it. "Teacher, are we really going to the laboratory building? We just came back from there." "Let's head to the No.1 teaching building instead. Hurry up. Before the school can take action, let's go check it out first." Chen Ge kept changing locations, making it difficult for the school's personnel to track them down. They ran in the opposite direction of the laboratory building. As time passed, there were fewer and fewer people on the campus. "Have you heard of any strange stories related to the restroom here?" Chen Ge asked as he walked, "Have you been to the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building?" "No." They shook their heads. "This school looks normal on the surface, but in fact, there are dangers everywhere. When we reach the destination, you must listen to me." Chen Ge and the others walked around the teaching building. The teaching building in the eastern campus was very stylish. There were three buildings, and each building was four stories high. "Your school seems to love the number 'four' very much." At this time, there were no students in the teaching building. The classroom was dark, and only the corridor was still lit. "This is the first time I came to the teaching building at such a late hour. I haven't found out that the teaching building at night is actually so terrifying." Wang Yicheng walked slowly. As soon as he got close to the teaching building, his expression became very uneasy, as if he was resisting this place from the bottom of his heart. Wang Yicheng's change caught Chen Ge's attention. The limping boy seemed to have encountered something unpleasant in the classroom. "Stick close to me. Let's go directly to the top floor. Don't approach anything you see in other classrooms." Before entering the building, Chen Ge checked the surroundings. Every school building had two corridors on the left and right, and the restroom was near the left corridor. "Are you sure you want to go?" Zhou Tu could not understand Chen Ge's actions at all. Every step Chen Ge took seemed to be done after careful consideration, but after thinking about it, he realized that there didn't seem to be any connection between his actions. However, Chen Ge was acting enigmatic. It made Zhou Tu want to open his skull to see what was inside. "Don't fall behind." Zhang Ju kindly reminded Zhou Tu, then helped Wang Yicheng into the corridor. "Come here quickly. It is a mission that should be done by all club members.." Zhu Long's eyes were red. He was more than 1.8 meters tall and was holding a pink female mobile phone typically used by women. Despite this, he appeared at ease, without showing any signs of discomfort. "I must be crazy to follow you to the teaching building's restroom to find supernatural phenomena in the middle of the night." Zhou Tu reluctantly entered the corridor. They did not stop and ran all the way to the top floor. The teaching building in the middle of the night was very quiet, presenting a stark contrast to the bustling atmosphere it had during the day. "Zhang Ju and I will go in first. Zhu Long, you will be next. Zhou Tu and Wang Yicheng, you two stay outside." Chen Ge gripped the door handle of the restroom. Just as he was about to barge in, someone grabbed his arm. "Teacher, could you please not go in?" Wang Yicheng stood next to Chen Ge. His face was pale, and cold sweat rolled down his face. "I remembered something very bad. It happened here!" "What is it?" This was the first time Chen Ge had seen Wang Yicheng show such an expression. "I just vaguely remembered that I was involved in that matter. I was forced by them. In the end, only I did not enter the restroom, so I survived. Those who entered, they were all dead." Wang Yicheng began to talk nonsense with a quivering voice. "All the people who entered this restroom are dead?" Chen Ge gently held Wang Yicheng's hand. "You are just a freshman. How can you have memories about this restroom?" I don't know, I didn't mean it! "They forced me! Teacher, let's leave! Don't open that door!" Wang Yicheng looked very pitiful. "I'm already here. I won't give up." Chen Ge removed Wang Yicheng's hand and pushed the door open. "Don't open it! Don't push that door!" Amidst Wang Yicheng's screams, Chen Ge opened the door to the restroom and looked inside. The ghost faces made of rubber was thrown on the ground, and the walls were painted with blood handprints and human facial features. When they entered, it was as if they were being stared at from all directions. "Lin Sisi was fooled here." Chen Ge picked up the rubber ghost face on the ground and looked at it. After confirming that there was no danger, he stuffed it into his backpack. He slowly walked forward and took out Lin Sisi's cell phone to take a few photos as he passed by the toilet cubicle. Everything was normal in the toilet, and there were no ghosts. "It doesn't seem to be a problem, but I can't shake the feeling that something isn't quite right." Chen Ge looked at the tightly closed door and gave it a push. The door did not move. "Is it occupied?" He bent down to look at the space below the compartment, where there was a pair of black leather shoes. Chapter 808 Roommates "There's someone in the cubicle!" Seeing the black leather shoes made Chen Ge think of Mr. Bai from the eastern campus. He was wearing a pair of pure black leather shoes. "Don't come over yet." Chen Ge took two steps back. He put Lin Sisi's phone into the gap in the cubicle and quickly took a picture. Lowering his head to look at the phone, the thing that Chen Ge was worried about did not happen. He only found a pair of leather shoes in the cubicle, and there was no "ghost" hidden inside. Lin Sisi's phone can take pictures of ghosts and some special things. There was nothing except a pair of shoes in the cubicle. But if there is no one in the cubicle, how did the cubicle door get locked? The cubicle door could only be locked from the inside, and the position of the black leather shoes suggested that they were placed as if someone was standing inside, rather than being stuffed in from the outside. "Teacher, could you be mistaken? Who would go to the top floor of the teaching building to use the toilet in the middle of the night? It gives me the creeps just thinking about it." The memory in Zhu Long's mind had started to unravel. But it was vague, and there was no way to explain it clearly. However, it did affect him, and there were some changes that no one noticed. For example, he started to keep a distance from the other members of the club and was more willing to stay by Chen Ge's side. It was as if Chen Ge was the same type of person as him. "You guys stay here. If anyone comes near, inform me immediately." Chen Ge shook the cubicle door and used force to open it. In the narrow cubicle, many faces were painted with pigment, creating the sensation of being watched by a multitude of eyes. Why is there a pair of leather shoes? Chen Ge did not find anything unusual in the first cubicle. He came to the second cubicle again. Drawing from his previous experience, this time, he took out his phone to shoot the gap in the cubicle. The photo showed that there was also a pair of shoes in the second cubicle, but this pair of shoes was not black leather shoes, but a pair of shabby blue sneakers. "The positions are all the same. Are there any deeper meanings or implications behind these?" Chen Ge checked the first six cubicles. There was a pair of shoes in each cubicle. All of them were male shoes, ranging from sneakers, tourist shoes, and even flat skates. The size of each shoe was different, suggesting they belonged to different individuals. “The black leather shoes in the first cubicle bear a striking resemblance to Mr. Bai's shoes, which are worn by adults. The shoes in the other five cubicles are worn by students. Does every pair of shoes represent one person” "Lin Sisi was teased by the whole class. Could the owner of these shoes be the person who was most against Lin Sisi at that time?" The biggest difference between a ghost and a living person was that ghosts were made up of obsession and negative emotions. They showed no sign of understanding and kindness. No matter what kind of person Lin Sisi was when she was alive, the moment he became a ghost, his body and mind would be devoured by hatred. This was one of the obsessions of a ghost, and it was the foundation that supported his existence. Based on Chen Ge's understanding of ghosts, it was likely that the ghosts would imprison the person who played tricks on them in the beforelife in a cubicle to keep them company. "Teacher! Someone is coming toward the teaching building!" Zhou Tu supported Wang Yicheng as he stood at the door of the restroom and shouted at Chen Ge, "They seem to be coming from the direction of the lab building!" "Are they coming for us?" Chen Ge took the time to walk to the last cubicle. He naturally took out his phone to take a picture, but to his surprise, the door of the seventh cubicle was removed. "Where is the seventh door?" According to Chen Ge's previous guess, the door related to Lin Sisi was most likely located in the current restroom, but he could not find it even after searching the restroom. "Calm down, don't panic." Chen Ge bit the tip of his tongue. He knew that the people downstairs would need some time to go upstairs. "Every bloody door corresponds to a door-pusher, which means that the door is the only..." His finger touched the door frame, and Chen Ge realized that the door frame of the seventh cubicle had been broken. "The door of this cubicle was knocked open from the inside!" He looked down at the interior of the cubicle. There were no shoes in the seventh cubicle, only two blood-red footprints. The two shoe prints were one in front of the other as if a person was walking out the door. If each pair of shoes represents a person, then did the person in the last cubicle run out? Chen Ge turned his head to look around. He did not know if it was due to a psychological effect or some other reason, but the ugly and weird people on the wall seemed to become vivid and lifelike. Their expressions were different from before. All the despair and negative emotions in the western campus have been transported to the eastern campus. The real 'blood door' is probably in the restroom on the top floor of the eastern campus building. Chen Ge was frustrated by the new problem and the effort to solve it was taking a toll on him. He bit the tip of his tongue to keep himself awake. " At least I am moving closer to the truth, one step at a time." "Teacher! They're going upstairs! Let's find a place to hide first!" Zhou Tu sounded anxious, and he started to panic. "The people who just entered the teaching building don't seem to be teachers or students. Their walking posture is also very strange!" "The walking posture is very strange?" Chen Ge immediately realized that something was wrong. He called Zhang Ju and Zhu Long to run out of the restroom. "Which way did they come up from?" "The corridor near the restroom!" "Okay! Let's go down from the other side! Be careful, don't let them see us!" Chen Ge had no intention of meeting them head-on for the time being. He ran to the first corridor, but when he passed by Wang Yicheng, he suddenly stopped. He noticed that Wang Yicheng's pupil contracted, and he gazed upon Wang Yicheng's shoes. "Blue sneakers?" The shoes Wang Yicheng was wearing now were exactly the same as the shoes in the second cubicle! The shoes in the restroom cubicle were all male shoes. Chen Ge thought about it carefully and suddenly realized that the shoes in the cubicles were exactly the same as the shoes of the students in Room 413. "'Room 413 has a total of six people. The restroom on the top floor of the teaching building has seven cubicles. Each of the six students corresponds to a cubicle, and there's an additional cubicle with black leather shoes, symbolizing the teacher. In total, there are seven cubicles. Chen Ge frowned. "Why does Lin Sisi hate his roommate so much? Didn't he go back to the dormitory to remind his roommate not to go near the restroom?" Chen Ge rubbed his temples, feeling overwhelmed by the thoughts. The eastern campus is chaotic and disorderly. The western campus remained frozen like a souvenir preserved in a glass bottle since the admission day. To uncover the truth, he realized that he needed to compare the scenes from both campuses. The western campus is too perfect, but the beauty is not real at all. It is like a dream made by a child. In comparison, the eastern campus is much more realistic. Chen Ge looked away from Wang Yicheng's shoes. He had already made up his mind to take everyone to the eastern campus. "I have no choice but to search for memories in the dream and find the truth in reality." Chapter 809 They Made Me! The people who were running from the direction of the laboratory building had already entered the corridor. They seemed to have sensed something and went straight to the restroom on the top floor without any pause. "Hurry, let's move!" Chen Ge lifted Wang Yicheng on his back and they quickly ran through the corridor to the other side. They hid there, holding their breath. "Mr. Bai, why did you stop?" "Keep an eye on the third-floor corridor. I will station on the fourth floor. Once they have all gone up to the fourth floor, we can go down." Chen Ge was very brave. He stood at the side of the corridor and stared at the restroom through the long corridor with his Yin Yang eyes. "But..." "Do as I say." Chen Ge stayed alone in the corridor on the right side of the fourth floor, vigilantly monitoring the left side of the corridor. After about ten seconds, he clearly heard footsteps coming from the passage on the left, and then a few in white appeared on the fourth floor. "What a strange outfit! All in white? Even the shoes are white?" A total of three went upstairs. Apart from wearing white clothes, there was another abnormal feature. They all had scars on their faces. Not just a few scars, but like Zhang Ju, their entire face was burned, looking a bit terrifying. "Could these be the school managers?" Chen Ge saw them entering the restroom, so he led the other students down the stairs, perfectly avoiding them. "Teacher, where are we going next?" "We will find a chance to go to the eastern campus." Chen Ge's voice was urgent. And the men in white gave him a lot of pressure. "Why is everyone so nervous? It's like we're doing some shady business." Zhou Tu looked at Chen Ge and the other members of the club, sensing their nervousness. "We are students of the school, and Mr. Bai is a teacher. Even if the school caught us, we would only be reprimanded. At most, we can compensate the dissection table of the experimental building, but it won't cost much money." "Do you still think that we will only be criticized by the school if we are caught?" Chen Ge stared into Zhou Tu's eyes. He avoided his gaze and did not dare meet Chen Ge's eyes. "You will understand when you reach the eastern campus." Chen Ge led the students away from the teaching building and slowly approached the sports equipment room next to the teaching building along a secluded path. "Teacher, aren't we going to the eastern campus? What are you doing in the sports equipment room?" "Look for the tools. Wang Yicheng, Zhou Tu, you two stay outside and keep a lookout. The rest of you join me in searching the ropes." Chen Ge pried open the door to the sports equipment room and found many jumping ropes. "Teacher! Those people seem to be coming towards us!" Zhou Tu's voice came from outside the gate. He saw a few white shadows running out of the teaching building, heading towards their location. "How come? How did they know that we were in the sports equipment room? If their presence on the teaching building's top floor was an accident, how did they know that I was in the sports equipment room?" Chen Ge had a bad feeling. He zipped his backpack. Because there were too many things inside, the backpack was very bulging. He could only hold it in his hand. "The sports equipment room is very big. It is enough for them to search for a while. Let's retreat first." Chen Ge held his backpack with one hand and waved at Wang Yicheng. "Come, I'll carry you." Chen Ge did it out of good intentions, but Wang Yicheng refused this time. He shook his head, his eyes filled with fear, like a child who had a nightmare. "Teacher, I am very scared. I heard someone calling my name. The people behind me seem to be looking for me. I heard their voices!" "You heard someone calling your name? When did it start?" Chen Ge did not give Wang Yicheng a chance to resist. Time was tight, and he could not afford to delay. He forcefully carried Wang Yicheng on his back. "Let's talk as we walk." "Teacher! Those people are looking for me! If you bring me along, they will definitely find you!" Wang Yicheng's facial features were slightly distorted, and his body was trembling. "Cut the crap. You are my student. You just need to answer my question." Chen Ge quickened his pace, but he was curious about what Wang Yicheng had said. "When I was brought to the top floor of the teaching building, I suddenly felt very uncomfortable. For some reason, I wanted to cry. The corridor gave me a very familiar feeling. It seemed that something bad had happened there." Wang Yicheng's eyes were swollen, like a fish that had been thrown ashore, and even breathing became difficult. "Aren't you a freshman? Why do you feel that the corridor is very familiar?" "I don't know either. Sometimes, when I go to a strange place, I feel like I have been there before. I feel that way now." Wang Yicheng's voice was intermittent, and his face was frighteningly pale. "What happened to that voice? Did it suddenly appear? What did it say to you?" Chen Ge asked softly. "As soon as we were in the corridor, I suddenly felt uncomfortable. When we walked to the door of the restroom, a picture suddenly flashed in my mind." Wang Yicheng took a deep breath and paused for a long time before saying, "It seems that a long time ago, I came to this restroom. I had the task of leading a very important person to the restroom. His thin body stood there and the restroom was full of all kinds of demons and ghosts! It was because of this that I tried my best to stop you when you went in." "Wait a minute!" Chen Ge keenly noticed a detail in Wang Yicheng's narrative." Are you responsible for luring someone who is very important to you to the restroom?" "Yes, that person seems to be my best friend. I understand that feeling very well because there are very few people willing to be friends with me. He is the only exception." Wang Yicheng pounded his head hard. His memory seemed to have begun to unravel. "When we arrived at the door of the restroom, his voice appeared in my mind. He was calling my name. I was sure it was him! But I just couldn't remember who he was!" "Is his name Lin Sisi?" Chen Ge said Lin Sisi in Wang Yicheng's ear. As soon as he said that, Wang Yicheng's body began to tremble violently. He tightened his arms around Chen Ge's neck, choking Chen Ge so hard that he could not breathe. "I didn't do it on purpose. They made me! I'm sorry! We are best friends!" Wang Yicheng shouted with his eyes closed. His voice was miserable as if he had suddenly found a ghost standing by the bed in the middle of the night. "Calm down!" Wang Yicheng suddenly collapsed. This was something no one had expected. Such a reaction would invite even more trouble. Chen Ge decisively threw him down and aimed a palm at the artery on his neck. "Mr.  Bai?" The other students were startled. "Shut up! I am saving him!" Chen Ge tried a few more places and finally made Wang Yicheng faint. [Psychosis will cause serious damage to the brain. The best solution I can think of is to make him stop thinking for the time being. ] Chapter 810 On the Other Side of the Wall Looking at the unconscious Wang Yicheng, Chen Ge could not calm down for a long time. He had obtained a very important piece of information from what Wang Yicheng had just said. It turned out that the person who tricked Lin Sisi into the restroom was Wang Yicheng! "I didn't expect the most crucial person to be right beside me." Chen Ge was glad that even though he had entered the world behind the door, he still maintained his kind nature. When he first came into contact with Wang Yicheng, he did not think too much about it. He reached out to him out of compassion, seeing his isolation and hoping to improve his situation. In fact, he made a difference. Wang Yicheng already had several new friends, and these friends would not bully him or discriminate against him. Based on the words he had said when he went crazy, Chen Ge pieced together the whole story. Wang Yicheng and Lin Sisi both lived in Room 413. But the two of them were not very likable for various reasons. Due to their different personalities, the way they dealt with bullying was different. Wang Yicheng chose to endure silently, while Lin Sisi, on the other hand, came up with all kinds of schemes to raise the awareness of school violence among students. These two people couldn't be considered friends, and they were just victims who clung together. The students hated Lin Sisi so much, so they decided to dress up as ghosts and play tricks on Lin Sisi in the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building to take revenge on him. In order to successfully lure Lin Sisi into the restroom, they took advantage of Wang Yicheng, who had a good relationship with Lin Sisi. Chen Ge did not know how those people convinced Wang Yicheng, but he knew that the final result was that Wang Yicheng had agreed to their plan. While Wang Yicheng had his own difficulties, he was the one who pushed Lin Sisi to despair. "Hurry up! Before Wang Yicheng comes to, we have to get rid of the people behind us." Chen Ge was very cautious. He went to a few more places before finally exhaling a sign of relief, realizing that those in white were not following him. The atmosphere in the western campus slowly became abnormal, with more people in white clothes appearing. Chen Ge did not linger and led the club members to the garbage disposal center. "Mr. Bai, are those people in white also school teachers? Why have I never seen them before? And why did they chase us just now?" Zhu Long had many questions he wanted to ask. "They are not teachers. They are the managers who maintain order in the western campus. As for the reason why they have been chasing us all this time..." Chen Ge placed Wang Yicheng, who had lost consciousness, on the grass. "Because of him, and also because of you." "Us?" "Yes, this school is not as simple as you think. If you compare it to a human brain, then the western campus is the place to deal with all kinds of good emotions, and the negative emotions and garbage will be handled by the eastern campus." Chen Ge used a very common analogy to explain. "The western campus only has beautiful memories. All the trash will be sent to the eastern campus, but how can people only have beautiful memories?" "So does that mean we have forgotten a lot of memories?" Zhang Ju was very smart. Before Chen Ge could finish, he already understood what Chen Ge meant. "That's right. What you have forgotten are memories filled with despair. These things are considered trash by the western campus. Once your memories return, they will send you to the eastern campus." Chen Ge said seriously, "Now that you know the truth, are you still willing to continue searching for your lost memories?" "I do." Zhu Long agreed without hesitation. "It is too uncomfortable not being able to remember something that clearly happened. If this continues, I will go crazy. I would rather remember everything." "I also want to know what memories I have lost. The absence of memories makes me feel incomplete, just like a..." a monster.“ Zhang Ju gently touched the scar on his face. His eyes were complicated, and no one knew what he was thinking. "You guys are really crazy! Really crazy!" Zhou Tu kept muttering, he was like a hamster locked in a cage, walking back and forth in place. "Okay, since you don't refuse, I will take that as your agreement." Chen Ge helped Wang Yicheng up. "Actually, there is another benefit for us to go to the eastern campus. The people who are investigating us want to send us to the eastern campus, but they would never have thought that we have already run to the eastern campus." "Is there any difference?" "If we go by ourselves, we can still maintain the appearance of the 'human'. If we let them capture us and send us over, I'm afraid that you will forget more things." Chen Ge comforted the members. "The eastern campus is not as scary as you think. As long as you are careful, nothing will happen." Carrying Wang Yicheng, Chen Ge opened the door to the western campus garbage disposal center. The room was very clean, completely different from the eastern campus. "Don't touch the things here, and don't get close to the doors of the garbage sorting." Chen Ge did not know if there was a manager in the trash disposal of the western campus. He gave the students some ropes in advance. "There is a small window on the second floor. Later, I will climb out of the window and make my way to the top of the wall. You see how I did it. Just follow me." "What about Wang Yicheng?" "Tie him up with a rope. After I climb up the wall, you guys work together to pass him out of the window. I'll pull him up to the top of the wall." Wang Yicheng was short, thin, and not too heavy. This was good news for Chen Ge. "Be careful. When you reach the second floor, do as I say immediately. Make sure to move fast!" After distributing the ropes, Chen Ge tied Wang Yicheng up and connected a rope between himself and Wang Yicheng. Then, he carried Wang Yicheng to the second floor. After confirming that there was no one on the second floor, Chen Ge did not bother to take a closer look and headed straight for the window. Opening the small window, Chen Ge stepped on the windowsill and climbed up the wall. "What are you waiting for? Pass Wang Yicheng out." He had a rope tied to his body, and the other end of the rope was tied to Wang Yicheng. "Does Mr. Bai teach sports?" Zhang Judi was the first to react. He raised Wang Yicheng and was about to send him out the window. "This is the second floor! Be careful." Zhu Long and Zhou Tu also began to help. The three of them worked together to pass Wang Yicheng out. It took a lot of effort, but Chen Ge finally managed to get Wang Yicheng to the top of the wall. He was one of the key figures tonight, and Chen Ge would never leave him behind. Sitting on the wall again, Chen Ge's mood was completely different from before. He untied the rope on his body and moved along the wall to make space for the other students. "Hurry up!" Chen Ge supported Wang Yicheng and found a few gaps between the bricks on the wall. He tied the rope to the wall. The next time you want to go from the eastern campus to the western campus, you don't have to go through the garbage disposal center. Just use the rope he left behind. It took them more than ten minutes to jump to the eastern campus. For the students of the western campus, the eastern campus was a completely unfamiliar scene. Chapter 811 Zhang Ju's Memories "On the second day of the freshmen registration, we were chased by the teachers and jumped over the wall to escape. This is completely different from what I imaged college life to be!" Zhou Tu patted the dirt off his body and untied the rope around his waist. "There might be more things that you can't imagine later." Chen Ge pulled the rope that he had tied to the top of the wall a few times and hid it behind the ivy. Even if someone walked past, they would not be able to find it if they did not look closely. "This rope is my way out." When Chen Ge left the eastern campus, he was alone. Now he returned as the leader of a club. "Teacher, did you find anything wrong?" Zhang Ju stood up straight, his eyes hidden in the scar slowly widening. What's wrong? "Perhaps it is due to my sensitivity. I feel the air on this side of the wall is moist and sticky, carrying an unfamiliar scent akin to the smell of blood. Zhang Ju spoke calmly, saying the most strange words. He slowly opened his mouth and licked the scar on his upper lip with the tip of his tongue. There was confusion and doubt in his eyes. "Compared to the western campus, this place feels more familiar to me." "Are you joking? Do you know what blood smells like?" Initially, Zhou Tu thought that Zhang Ju was very ugly, but now hearing what he just said changed his opinion about him. "I am not joking. It is true." Zhang Ju looked at Chen Ge. Chen Ge stood there with a smile on his face. "You didn't feel it wrong. This is the fertile soil for cultivating beautiful dreams. In the world behind the door, only the corpses and blood can be used as fertilizer to bloom stunning flowers." Chen Ge carried Wang Yicheng on his back and gestured for Zhang Ju to follow behind him. "I'll take you to a place first. Be careful, don't make too much noise." Walking through the unattented bushes, the pitch black of the night became their best disguise. They made it through without any incidents, and Chen Ge led Zhang Ju to the tree hole where the female ghosts were located. "Does this place look familiar to you?" Chen Ge pointed at the tree hole with the head of a female ghost and the surrounding trees. "We seem to have been here before." "Right, isn't this crime scene where the girl was killed? We have seen it in the western campus! Why is there the same scene in the eastern campus?" Zhou Tu widened his eyes. Both scenes were exactly the same, even the position and angle of the tree hole. "The murder scene in the western campus is only a disguise. The bodies and the souls of the dead are hidden in the eastern campus. What you see now is the real crime scene." As Chen Ge said this, Zhang Ju seemed to be attracted by something. He stood alone by the tree hole, his shoulders trembling slightly. "Zhang Ju?" As if he could not hear Chen Ge's voice, he slowly crouched down and knelt beside the tree hole. His hands trembled as he reached into the tree hole. "Hey! Are you out of your mind? I remember that the girl's head was found in the tree hole! Why are you putting your hand in?" Zhou Tu wanted to pull Zhang Ju away, but Chen Ge stopped him. "Don't disturb him. His memory is hidden in the hole of the tree. The lost things have to be dug out personally." "Dig it out? You guys are really crazy!" Zhou Tu was not as strong as Chen Ge, so he could not break free. He could only stand to the side and watch. Kneeling on the ground, Zhang Ju leaned over the tree hole, staring at the darkness inside, his arms sinking into the hole bit by bit. His body had been trembling and sweat had stuck to the scars on his face, as if it were dripping tears. "Nothing? No way! Impossible!" Zhang Ju did not touch anything. His voice quivered as if his nervousness stifled his breath. "I saw it with my own eyes! I saw him hide that thing in the tree hole with my own eyes! How could it not be!" His fingers scraped against the soil and tree bark, causing his nails to start bleeding, yet Zhang Ju remained impervious to the pain. He persistently dug the depth of the tree hole. "Zhang Ju, is this what you are searching for?" Chen Ge took out a rusty kitchen knife from his backpack. This kitchen knife was something left by a ghost inside the tree hole. After the black shadow swallowed the ghost, he found it deep inside the tree hole (For more details, read chapter 787). At first, Chen Ge wanted to use the kitchen knife to protect himself, and he did not think too much about it. Suddenly, everything became quiet. Everyone's eyes were focused on the kitchen knife. "I found this kitchen knife in the tree hole. The soul of the deceased who has gone crazy is attached to this kitchen knife." Chen Ge placed the kitchen knife in front of Zhang Ju. "Pick it up. Can you remember your past?" Zhang Ju was on the verge of collapse. His arms were trembling more and more, and his pupils were throbbing violently. "Are you familiar with it? Have you seen this knife somewhere else? At that time, who held this knife, and whose neck was this knife thrust into?" Chen Ge's words pierced Zhang Ju's mind like a nail. His trembling hand reached for the kitchen knife. When his fingertip touched the handle of the knife, his expression suddenly changed. His pupils shrank and his mouth gaped open. It was as if he had touched a red-hot iron. Before Zhang Ju shouted, Chen Ge had already covered Zhang Ju's mouth. "It's okay. Those things have already passed. It's just your past." Chen Ge comforted Zhang Ju, but his eyes were fixed on Zhang Ju's hand that was holding the knife. Once Zhang Ju made a move, he would immediately subdue him. Zhang Ju was much stronger than Chen Ge had imagined, and as his memory resurfaced, his strength continued to grow. He was probably not an ordinary ghost. Just as Chen Ge was about to lose control of Zhang Ju, the man finally calmed down. Chen Ge released his grip and Zhang Ju fell to his knees. His lips were pressed against the dirt on the ground, and the scar on his face was glaring. "I, I remembered something." Zhang Ju stared at his broken nails, "That day was the birthday of the senior. There was a girl who wanted to confess to the senior, but the senior had his own girlfriend, so he asked me to reject the other party in his place. I arrived at the appointed place and did not see the girl. I just waited there. Later, I vaguely heard some movements in the tree forest. I quietly ran over and saw someone holding this knife. The girl is still struggling, but I don't dare to go out. I was scared silly. I have never seen so much blood before. His nails dug into the soil, and the scars on Zhang Ju's face squeezed together. "If I had defended the girl at that time, that girl might not have died." Self-blame and guilt tormented Zhang Ju as he tightly clenched the kitchen knife. "When I went back to call the police, those perpetrators had already escaped. I didn't know if they had been caught, but I saw a figure that looked very familiar." The next night, we drank a lot of wine and then went to sing. Then there was a fire. I was sent to the hospital and what happened after that... Zhang Ju suddenly pounded his head. "What happened later? Why don't I have any memories of what happened afterward?" "You were sent to the hospital in a coma due to burns. Your memory stopped here." Chen Ge already knew about Zhang Ju's past. Chapter 812 A Portrait of a Doctor "I can see that the raging fire is spreading faster. Thick smoke is billowing, and there are screams everywhere. I can't open my eyes and want to run out, but as soon as I open the door, the fire rushes directly into the room." Zhang Ju lay on the ground, his forehead veins bulging, while the scars on his face quivered. "I could not pinpoint the source of my pain. I rushed out in desperation. Breathing became a struggle, and my vision blurred. In the end, I blacked out in the corridor." "I vaguely felt someone lift me up. At that time, I still had some consciousness left." His fingers, smeared with dirt and blood, reached into his hair as Zhang Ju propped himself up with the elbow. "I was supposed to be taken to the hospital. I faintly caught a conversation between my parents and the doctor. I struggled to open my eyes, but when I managed to do so, I was met with a complete darkness, as though everything had been burnt." Zhang Ju's voice gradually returned to normal. He collapsed on the ground. "I can remember the faces of my parents, the doctors and nurses who took care of me, but I just can't remember how I woke up from the coma, and I don't remember how I came to this school." "Is is possible that you never really woke up in the real world and you fell into this world after the coma." Chen Ge's words surprised Zhang Ju. "I didn't wake up? This is the world after my coma?" Zhang Ju repeated Chen Ge's words. "Then all of this is my dream? Are you all just my imagination?" "Imagination? All is fake? Your words are getting more and more absurd. Can we be a little more normal?" Zhou Tu snatched the kitchen knife from Zhang Ju. "I don't know about other people, but I'm not your dream person. I'll keep the knife for you first, so that you don't have to kill people for experiments later." Zhou Tu felt that he was the only normal person in this club, and it was safer for him to hold the weapon. What Zhang Ju said is not completely unreasonable, but he got one thing wrong. This world was not his dream alone, but a nightmare formed by the accumulation of many people's negative emotions and despair. Chen Ge glanced at the faces of all the club members. "You are all trapped in this world, and this world was created by you personally." After Chen Ge finished his words, the forest was extremely quiet. Everyone looked at him, and the expressions on their faces were mixed. "I know that you may not be able to accept it for the time being, but it doesn't matter. We still have time." Chen Ge carried Wang Yicheng on his back and glanced at the wall in the distance. "After Wang Yicheng's memories resurfaced, he attracted the manager. Now, Zhang Ju, your memories are starting to resurface as well. The manager will most likely come over. We have to leave as soon as possible." Chen Ge turned around and walked out of the forest. "Wait a moment!" Zhang Ju grabbed the red soil on the ground with both hands and slowly raised his head. His eyes stared at Chen Ge. "Who are you? Why are you telling us this?" "It doesn't matter who I am. What matters is that I can help you escape from here. In reality, your relatives have been waiting for too long." Chen Ge smiled. "In fact, I am very similar to you. I have also lost a part of my childhood memory, so when I met you, I seemed to see my past self." Waving his hand, Chen Ge walked into the distance. "It was your luck to have met me. Back then, I did not have anyone to guide me. I was groping in the dark and lost too many things." Chen Ge sighed with emotion. He led the members of the club to avoid the experimental building and the faculty building and followed the small path to the school building. "The restroom on the top floor of should have the answers I need." While the teaching building in the West Campus was quiet and eerie, the one in the East Campus exuded an even more eerie atmosphere. As soon as one approached, a chill would climb up his back and rush straight to his brain. "Be quiet. If anything happens here, the consequences will be severe." Chen Ge whispered. "What consequences?" Zhou Tu's forehead was covered in sweat. He held the kitchen knife he had taken out from the hole in the tree. His back was hunched and his eyes were looking around. He looked very nervous. "The eastern campus is filled with trash that the western campus does not want. How do we usually treat trash in our lives?" Chen Ge maintained his smile, but the words he said made the members of the club suck in a breath of cold air. "After we are caught, we will be separated into useful things. After squeezing out all the value, we will directly be discarded. Death here is really an extravagant hope." Once you shoot an arrow, there's no turning back. Chen Ge was the first to enter the school building on the eastern campus. It was unknown if it was an illusion, but the night on the eastern campus was even darker than on the western campus. Stepping on the broken stairs, there were burn marks on the handrail of the stairs, and the sound of tables and chairs moving could be heard in the empty classroom next to them. "This place is so scary. I can't imagine that it is separated from us by a wall." Zhu Long murmured, bringing up the rear of the group. "Shh, don't talk." Zhou Tu held his knife and followed closely behind Zhang Ju, afraid that this student whose face was full of scars would suddenly lose control and hurt him. The more you worry about something, the more likely it will happen unexpectedly. Zhou Tu had been staring at Zhang Ju the entire time, and the other party suddenly stopped walking. "What is wrong?" "It's nothing. I'm just wondering. Why are so many pictures of doctors hung in the corridor of the academic building?" Zhang Ju raised his gaze to the doctors displayed on the wall. "We are not a medical university, and these doctors do not appear particularly famous. A lot of them lack some sort of introduction, just a work photo of them in white medical coats. By the way, have you noticed that the photos of these doctors are all work photos? Zhang Ju's words caught Chen Ge's attention. He had felt that the pictures of these doctors were bizarre, but he could not find the reason. Now that Zhang Ju said this, he suddenly thought of a possible explanation. "The world behind the door is woven based on the memory of the door-pusher. This school is exceptional. It contains the memory of all the students. The pictures of the doctors on the wall may be the people the students have met." Chen Ge pressed down on Zhang Ju's shoulder. "Pay attention to these photos and see if you know any doctors." "Only top-tier doctors get their photos posted on the wall. How can I know them?" "In this world, doctors may have some special meaning. Just do as I say." Chen Ge led the club members up the stairs. When they passed the third floor, he suddenly stopped. "Don't move, there's someone ahead." The classroom near the corridor on the third floor was not locked, and the low-quality wooden door creaked from the wind. Chen Ge and the others stood still in the corridor. After a while, a black shadow walked out of the classroom. "This figure looks familiar. Is it Chang Gu?" Chapter 813 Do You Dare? The shadow's figure resembled Chang Gu, but his movements were agile, and he did not look like a person who was almost blind. Chen Ge hesitated to venture outside. He wanted to maintain his observation here a bit longer, but the man dashed towards the opposite end of the corridor, as though in search of something. "Is that Chang Gu? Have his eyes returned to normal?" The teaching building was pitch black. Even though Chen Ge had Yin Yang eyes (the ability to see through darkness or ghosts), he still walked carefully. "Teacher, is that someone you know? Should we follow him?" "Better to avoid unnecessary trouble. Let's go to the top floor first." Chen Ge kept his eyes on the shadow. The shadow did not leave but entered another classroom. There were other people in the teaching building at night, which increased the uncertainty. Chen Ge did not know if it was good or bad. They arrived at the fourth floor. The restroom was located on the other side of the corridor, so they needed to pass through the corridor. "No matter what you hear, do not answer. No matter what you see, you can not leave the team. Do you understand?" Chen Ge reminded the club members before carrying Wang Yicheng into the corridor. He lowered his body and glanced at the classrooms on both sides of the corner. It was pitch black inside the window and nothing could be seen. The members of the club followed behind Chen Ge. They tried their best not to look to the both sides, but the more they told themselves not to look at them, the more they could not help but glance elsewhere. "What is that?" The classroom here seemed to have not been cleaned for a long time. When Zhou Tu passed by a window, he saw that there were strands of hair under the window frame. It gave people the feeling that there was a girl lying on the seat next to the window of the classroom. "It can't really be a person, right?" Zhou Tu stood on tiptoe. He maintained his walking posture and tilted his head slightly to look below the window of the classroom. "The hair... is moving?" Before Zhou Tu could see clearly, he suddenly bumped into something. Caught off guard, he failed to hold the kitchen knife in his hand, and the rusty kitchen knife fell to the ground. The rusty kitchen knife collided with the foor, making a faint sound that was extremely ear-piercing in the middle of the night. Everyone stopped, and Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu. "What are you doing?" "I accidentally bumped into Zhang Ju." Zhou Tu covered his nose and pointed at Zhang Ju, who was frozen in place. He found that Zhang Ju's expression was a little strange. "You were walking. Why did you suddenly stop?" Zhang Ju did not reply. He looked up at the photo on the wall. His mouth was slightly open and his pupils shrank. "Zhang Ju?" No matter how the others called out to him, Zhang Ju did not respond. He stared at the photo on the wall with a hint of sadness in his calm eyes. When he saw the kitchen knife that killed the girl in the tree forest, he had a mental breakdown and hysteria, and now he was completely different from before. There was no crazy scream, nor did he use self-mutilation to slow down the pain in his mind. He just stood quietly in front of the photo. "I have seen this doctor before." His voice was very low, low enough that only the people around him could hear it. "That fire burned a fifth of my skin. I watched as my flesh was burnt and smelled the stench coming from my body until my eyes melted and my eyelids were glued together. My world fell into darkness." "I was sent to the hospital. The pain was too much to bear. "I can't open my eyes. My nose has been burned away. One ear is left with two-thirds, and the other ear is left with one-third." "I became a monster and I couldn't see myself, but I knew I was no longer me. I couldn't go back and live like a human being." "Have you tried to listen to your family members with two-thirds of your ears?" "Someone saved me. The agony in my body intensifies. I am getting closer to consciousness. but how do I wake myself up?" The eyes have been severed by something cold. The left eye is missing, and the right one glimpses a dim and gray world. "I am unable to discern any light. The world visible through my right eye is blurry. Do you believe I should persist in living?" Zhang Ju rested his hand against the photos on the wall. Blood trickled down his face, and tiny streaks of blood emerged from beneath his skin, resembling surgical sutures. "I know this doctor. He accompanied me for a week. He fought with death and saved my life." Zhang Ju's voice grew hoarse, and his voice seemed to have been burned by fire. His appearance was also gradually changing. The scars and blood vessels spread across his face, his ears began to wither like flowers, and the eyelids of his left eye slowly melted. "I didn't say a word to him, but I was impressed by him. At the last moment of my life, he was one of the three people accompanying me." Feeling sorry for the deceased helped Zhang Ju remember things. The doctor who had saved him before made his unclear memory become clear. The bits of memories in his mind came together, and blood started coming out from his skin, like a scar that had healed was now open again. The blood gathered to form droplets and dripped onto Zhang Ju's coat. The coat on his body was slowly turning red. "If you were in the same situation as me, would you choose to live or die?" "Dressed in half red? After the memory is restored, will the ghost return to its original appearance? Could it be that the female ghost in the tree hole was unable to maintain a normal human form because the memory has not been erased?" Chen Ge's eyelids twitched, but his response was much better than the other members of the club. Zhou Tu did not even bother to pick up the kitchen knife. He grabbed Zhu Long's arm and the two of them unknowingly retreated three meters away. No one replied. Zhang Ju slowly shifted his gaze away from the picture and looked at Chen Ge. "I remember who I am. Can you tell me who you are now?" The two stood in the dark corridor and looked at each other. "You asked me this question before, and I have given you the answer." Chen Ge stood where he was and did not take a step back. "We are the same kind. I want to find my forgotten memories. Helping you is also helping myself." "You are lying!" Zhang Ju reached out to grab Chen Ge, but when his fingers were about to touch Chen Ge, he stopped. "Why did you stop?" Chen Ge took a step forward and moved closer to Zhang Ju's face. "Are you afraid that after you kill me, the other me will stand up from the corpse? Are you afraid of me in red?" Grabbing Zhang Ju's shoulder with both hands, Chen Ge's expression was extremely crazed. He moved his hands on Zhang Ju's shoulder and slowly lifted Zhang Ju's face, gently touching the other's forehead. "Kill me? Do you dare?" Not only Zhang Ju, but Zhou Tu and Zhu Long, who were hiding behind him, were also shocked. The corridor was silent. After a long time, Chen Ge let go of Zhang Ju and looked at the other members. "I just want to find my lost memories. If you help me, you are helping yourselves. Likewise, your assistance is equally beneficial." Chapter 814 The Moving "Door" Zhang Ju had been quick to realize that Chen Ge was not like most people. His eyes remained calm regardless of what he encountered, as if nothing in the world could catch his off guard. To be honest, Zhang Ju was very afraid of such people, but it was precisely the reason why he chose to listen and follow him. Standing in front of the photo, Zhang Ju opened his remaining right eye and fixed his gaze upon Chen Ge's face. With ordinary facial features, bleeding in with the crowd, he did not attract attention. Yet, it was this very person who unintentionally displayed an expression even he dreaded. It was hard to describe. It seemed like a mix of a vengeful spirit and a twisted madman. Looking at that face, you could sense insanity, sickness and cruelty, yet there was no fear or terror. Zhang Ju knew what he looked like. He had always thought that he was a terrifying monster, but Chen Ge's actions made him realize that there was another "monster" that was even more terrifying than him in this world. "Yes, we should be the same kind of people." He trusted Chen Ge's words because only those who had undergone hellish experiences could carry such an expression, and similar to himself, Chen Ge had also lost his memory of the past. "I'm sorry, Mr. Bai. I recalled some very unpleasant memories, so I lost control." Zhang Ju's voice was unpleasant and harsh, but there was an improvement in his attitude., "It's fine. Why would the teacher really blame the students?" Chen Ge had a smile on his face, and he gave off a kind and gentle feeling. It was hard to believe that the person who had just spoken to Zhang Ju was also him. "What did you remember? Don't worry, tell me everything." "Actually, it's nothing. It's just some painful memories." The wound on Zhang Ju's body was still bleeding. His clothes were dyed red bit by bit. "I remembered witnessing the murder, feeling weak and cowardly; I recalled the feeling of the fire burning my skin, like needles stabbing into my flesh until I couldn't feel any pain. I also remembered how I struggled in the sterile ward. Despair took root in my heart. I didn't want to die, but I didn't know how to live. "Then in the final stage of your life, did anything special happen to you or around you?" Zhang Ju found himself in the world behind the door, but he had already lost the ability to open the door. Chen Ge was curious about how he entered the school. Only by knowing the way to enter would he have the chance to guess the way to escape. In the three-star scenario, the "door" was the only entrance and exit, but the four-star scenario seemed to be somewhat different. " In the final stage of life..." Zhang Ju reached out to feel his face. "I feel like I am in a coma, yet I can somehow sense what is happening outside. It is hard to tell apart reality from nightmares, but there is one thing I remember. Each night, a door appears in the sick room.” "A door?" "I stayed in the hospital for seven days. That door would appear every night, getting closer and closer to me until it was right beside my bed." Zhang Ju raised his head, his face full of blood. "That is a moving door. The more afraid and desperate I am, the closer it will be to me. I couldn't ask for help. On the eighth night, the door was pushed open from the inside. One by one, a hand reached through the door and pulled me in. The situation that Zhang Ju described was the same as what had happened to Chang Gu. They had all encountered a "door" that could move on its own. Every midnight, this door would slowly approach the people in deep sleep and eventually stand by the bed. The door was pushed open from the inside and took away the living people on the bed. "Is this school behind the door?" Chen Ge was even more curious about what happened next. He wanted to know how Zhang Ju had lost his memory. How did this student who had been disfigured in the fire become a half-red-clothed ghost? Zhang Ju shook his head. "I had a dream, an incredibly realistic dream. In the dream, they all called me Lin Sisi. I repeatedly told them that my name was Zhang Ju. They recognized the wrong person, but they felt that I was joking." "No one believed me. I could only live in the dream with Lin Sisi's name and experience everything that happened to Lin Sisi. As time passed, even I began to wonder if my name was Lin Sisi." "Being bullied, ignored, the feeling is not good, but thinking about it again, in reality, I have already become a monster, living like this in the dream is actually quite good." Zhang Ju's voice was calm as if he was narrating someone else's story. "I have no friends. The whole world hates me. The double torture of spirit and physical body slowly made me numb until one day, a girl entered my dream." "It was a rainy day. A frog was stuffed into my desk's bag. She suspected that I did it, but why would I do such a boring thing?" "No one listened to my explanation. The students drove me out of the classroom. Everyone in the corridor looked at me strangely. I had to escape to the rooftop of the teaching building alone." "There, I met her." "Even if I know it's a dream, I still think that girl is very special." Zhang Ju's voice changed. "Her name is Chang Wenyu. She is the only one who did not ignore me." "I told her about my grievances, and she expressed her understanding." "Later, I told her about my past and told her that I was not Lin Sisi." "She is very interested in what I said. I also like to stay with her, because only when I stay with her, I can not forget myself and not be assimilated by that dream." "We meet on the rooftop every evening. I slowly feel that I can't leave her." Just when I felt that life was getting colorful, she suddenly asked me a question - do you want to see the scenery outside the school? "I didn't understand the meaning of this question at that time. I just wanted to be with her, so I nodded." "That night, after midnight, she took me to the library." "The school library's door has been locked. We flipped through the window and entered. We found a mirror behind a bookshelf on the third floor." "That mirror is very big. The girl said that this mirror can be used a few more times. She told me not to tell anyone else." "I trust her very much. At the same time, I remember something. This is the first time I saw a mirror in my dream!" "I asked the girl what I should do." "The girl just told me to look at the mirror quietly." "I stood in front of the mirror. She hid behind me. In the dead silence of the night, I looked at myself in the mirror." The more I looked at it, the more I felt that the person in the mirror did not look like me. Slowly, I began to bleed in the mirror, and scars began to appear on the face of the person in the mirror. "His ears are withered, his left eye is closed, and his face is bloody!" "I didn't dare to continue watching, but when I wanted to leave, the monster in the mirror caught me!" "Blood flows on the surface of the mirror until it turns red!" "I shouted for help and turned to look at Chang Wenyu, but she was indifferent. I still remember the last sentence she said to me - why should you be afraid? The person in the mirror is real you." "Her slender fingers gently pressed on my left eye and slowly pulled it out!" The world instantly lost its color. I was dragged away by the monster in the mirror. All the beautiful expectations turned into the most vicious curse at that moment. Chapter 815 This Was Just a Speculation "Chang Wenyu took out my left eye. I am exactly the same as the monster in the mirror." "She shattered all my fantasies. I am not Lin Sisi but Zhang Ju. The terrifying monster in the mirror is myself." Blood ozzed out from the wound, and more than half of Zhang Ju's coat had been dyed red. What was more terrifying was that the blood on his clothes were intertwined, growing more and more. At first, Chen Ge thought that Zhang Ju was a half red-clothed Specter, but he soon realized that he had underestimated him. As his memories were awakened, more and more blood stains appeared on Zhang Ju's body, and it almost dyed his entire body red. I was dragged into the mirror, looking at Chang Wenyu standing outside the mirror. She pinched my left eye, her lips moving, as if to say - one more to go. "My left eye slowly changed in her hands, and the memories of my life flashed in my eyes. When she took out my left eye, she also took away all my good and hope." Tick, tick........................ Droplets of blood fell on the corridor floor, and there were faint footsteps coming from the teaching building, but no matter which direction they looked, no one came over. "What kind of world is behind the mirror?" Chen Ge asked softly. "Red, there is only red there. Everything is red." Zhang Ju's description reminded Chen Ge of the scenario behind the Three Star Trial Mission Gate. "Then how did you come back from there?" There is another me in the mirror. He is completely covered in blood-red and eager to devour me alive. Without any time to powder, I can only run away in sheer panic. After running for a long time, I found that there was also a school behind the mirror. It was empty, at least it looked like this on the surface. "And then?" "I didn't make it through the first night. In the end, I was caught by the other person behind the mirror." Lost in his thoughts, Zhang Ju appeared increasingly bewildered. "In my memory, he murdered me, yet when I woke up again, I found myself back at this shool. I had lost a majority of my memories and became part of this school." "In other words, your memories were altered after your death?" "I don't know what happened in between. If you want to figure out, you will have to go to the blood red world in the mirror to find out." Zhang Ju should not be lying. Although his appearance was terrifying, his expression was very serious. "I think I understand." Chen Ge said softly, "Normally speaking," "The Gate" is the only entrance to the bloody world, but there is a ghost in this place that goes beyond our imagination. He might be a presence above the Red Specter. He used the mirror as a channel to create a different scene within the bloody world, the school we are currently in. Do you get what I am saying?" All the members of the club present shook their heads. Let me give you a simple example. As we open this door, we step into the blood-red world. We found another mirror in this blood-red world. When we touched the mirror, we entered the world inside the mirror again. "It should be easy to understand if I use dreaming as an analogy." In reality, when a normal person is deeply asleep, they usually enter a dream. But what if we dream within that dream world? This is when our awareness plays tricks on us, making us think we have woken up." The blood red world is made up of despair and negative emotions, and the world behind the mirror is more like a 'dream' created by the door-pusher. Chen Ge tried his best to explain the situation to the students, and he figured out a very important question. When he woke up, he lost contact with all the employees, and the black phone was not with him, which left him in a very dangerous situation. He had been unable to understand how the school master had done it. Not to mention the black phone, Zhang Ya was hidden in his shadow, but at this moment, his shadow had become very normal. Zhang Ya was not inside. This could only mean one thing: he himself wasn't in the school; he was just a projection. Just like what Zhang Ju had just said, when he looked at the mirror, there was another him in the mirror. One was gentle and kind, the other brutal and bloody, and only when these two combined, did they form the real him. "I should have encountered the same situation as Zhang Ju. A part of the personality is in the mirror, and a part of the personality is outside the mirror." All of this was Chen Ge's speculation, and it could not be guaranteed to be correct. He was like walking in the fog, and the only light in the world was himself. "The mirror that Chang Wenyu used is in the library. After investigating the restroom, the next goal is to go to the library." Chen Ge voiced his thoughts. "Everyone avoided that place. Why did you have to go there yourself?" Zhang Ju could not understand Chen Ge. His memories had just resumed, and all sorts of memories floated in his mind. His eyes were blurry. "Compared to this place, I prefer that blood-red world, because that place is more real." From Chen Ge's words, it was obvious that he was not an ordinary person. Zhang Ju thought about it and did not object. "It just so happens that I also want to find out what happened to me. Logically speaking, I should have died." After receiving Zhang Ju's confirmation, Chen Ge's expression became even more relaxed. He had a good helper. "Let's go and take a look at the restroom first." Chen Ge and the others had lingered in the corridor for a long time, but fortunately, nothing had happened in the teaching building. The blood on Zhang Ju's body dripped to the ground. Along with the sound, the footsteps that were gradually approaching could be faintly heard around them, but strangely, they only heard the footsteps and did not see anyone. "Zhu Long, do you see the changes in Zhang Ju? His face is too scary." Zhou Tu did not dare approach Zhang Ju and Chen Ge. He felt that they were both lunatics. "Now that things have come to this, we can only believe in Mr. Bai. Doesn't the change in Zhang Ju also mean that he didn't lie to us? We are recovering the lost memories." Zhu Long's expression was also not too good. He gritted his teeth and the fingers holding the phone had turned white. "Alright." Zhou Tu turned around and looked behind him. He was frightened and did not dare to go back alone. "I am really crazy to join such a club." He composed himself and lowered his head, wanting to pick up the kitchen knife on the ground, but the moment he lowered his head and his vision turned upside down, he saw that the inverted heads on the corridor behind him were staring at him. Something is wrong! To be precise, those upside-down figures were all staring at Wang Yicheng, who was on Zhang Ju and Chen Ge's backs! Zhou Tu was so scared that he almost fell to his knees. Fortunately, Zhu Long helped him up. "What happened to you?" "There are people behind us! There are a lot of people following us!" Zhou Tu's voice was trembling. "How come?" Zhu Long looked back. There were only them in the empty corridor. "Are you hallucinating?" Chapter 816 The Faceless Boy Zhu Long held onto Zhou Tu as the two looked behind them. It was dark around them, and they could vaguely hear footsteps, but they really could not see the living. "Where are these people?" "When I was picking up the kitchen knife, I saw them all following behind us upside down, as if they were living in a world that was reversed with us." Zhou Tu was still in shock. "Those people have been staring at Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. Should we tell Mr. Bai?" "Alright." Zhu Long looked behind him doubtfully. Zhou Tu did not look like he was lying. While the two were in a daze, Chen Ge and Zhang Ju had already reached the middle of the corridor. The closer they got to the restroom, the more nervous they became. "Mr. Bai, Zhou Tu saw that there were people following us. They were all upside-down. I don't know what to describe it. Forget it, you should ask Zhou Tu." Zhu Long dragged Zhou Tu to Chen Ge. Just now, when I lowered my head to pick up the kitchen knife, I saw that there were people behind us. They had their heads hanging upside down and were suspended in the air. No, they seem to be walking on the ceiling. Those guys should have been attracted by Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. I saw with my own eyes that those inverted monsters were staring at Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. Zhou Tu did not want to get close to Zhang Ju, driven by his instinctual aversion. "Inverted people?" Chen Ge had seen those people in the lab before. "Let's go to the restroom first to check if the' door 'exists. If we don't find anything in the restroom, we will leave immediately." This school was too weird. Even with the protection of the Red Specter, it could not give Chen Ge a sense of security. Chen Ge picked up his pace. By the time he arrived at the entrance to the restroom, his neck was held tight by two hands. The cold, thin arms locked around his neck. The man was slowly exerting strength, and Chen Ge found it difficult to breathe. "Wang Yicheng? You're awake?" Chen Ge turned to look. Wang Yicheng's head was on his shoulder, and his eyes were bloodshot. He seemed to be fighting something in his heart. "Don't go in. They are inside." Wang Yicheng's voice was very different from his usual voice. It was filled with deep regret. He appeared like a wounded stray dog, who was protecting his companion's corpse with all his strength and then let others beat him up. "Them? Who are they?" "Student, senior, all the people who hate you are inside. Don't go over. I have already secretly told the teacher." Wang Yicheng tried his best to squeeze out a smile, but he could not. "Have you been messing with his head? What kind of nonsense is he speaking?" Zhu Long gripped the pink phone and drew nearer to Chen Ge. The ambiance in the teaching building was heavy. It was only by being near Chen Ge that he could feel a sense of relief. "Wang Yicheng, had something come to your mind?" Wang Yicheng's old memory was triggered by the door of the western campus restroom. At that time, Chen Ge was worried that he would be exposed, so he knocked him out. Now, although he had woken up, there seemed to be some confusion in his mind. They asked me to deceive you into entering. If I said no, they would hurt me and make me hobble up the stairs. I did everything they said, yet they still weren't willing to release me. "Remember, no matter who asks you to go to the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building, you must not go! Do not go!" Wang Yicheng's voice was weak, and his body seemed to be utterly frail. "Other than you, did they find someone else to trick Lin Sisi?" "I don't know, but I've already told the teacher about it. Why isn't he here yet?" Wang Yicheng was a little anxious. The only life-saving straw in his heart was that teacher, but that teacher did not appear. Perhaps that teacher also hated Lin Sisi very much. "It's fine. I'm just going over to take a look." "Don't go! Don't go in!" Wang Yicheng regarded Chen Ge as Lin Sisi. These were his true thoughts. It could be seen that he was very guilty and wanted to make up for it. He had already reached the door, and it was impossible for Chen Ge to give up. With Zhang Ju's help, this half-body Red Specter that was still growing stronger was one of Chen Ge's reliance. Wang Yicheng's arms grew stronger and stronger. Blue veins popped out on his arms. He was trying to stop Chen Ge from entering because he did not want to see the tragedy reappear before his eyes. The restroom on the top floor of the teaching building was in the deepest part of the corridor. There was a pungent smell of disinfectant in the air. Yellowish-brown stains on the wall bricks and water stains on the ground and footprints on the floor. Those shoe prints came from different people and there were many of them. The door of the toilet was locked, and Chen Ge took out his tools to forcefully open it. When he pushed open the door, Chen Ge took a step back and carefully looked inside the restroom. The restroom in the eastern campus looked completely different from the one in the western campus. It was very dirty and messy, as if this place had been forgotten by the school and had never been cleaned before, and no one had ever come in. "Has this toilet been locked up since Lin Sisi's accident?" Chen Ge turned around to ask Wang Yicheng. The man could no longer speak, and his body trembled violently as if he had fallen ill. Compared to the western campus, this restroom gave Chen Ge a more realistic feeling. He carried Wang Yicheng inside. As soon as he stepped into the toilet, Wang Yicheng directly closed his eyes. He did not dare to look at it, nor did he dare to recall it. "This room gives me a different feeling from the other rooms." Zhang Ju looked around and saw that the walls were covered with blood streaks. They were like cracks that covered the entire restroom. The ghost faces drawn on the wall had become blurry as if they were about to be forgotten. The dried streaks of blood climbed over all the patterns on the wall and wrapped them up as if they wanted to hide or prevent them from being seen again. Walking to the door of the first cubicle, Chen Ge took out Lin Sisi's phone and reached into the gap in the cubicle. There were several figures moving on the screen. "Who's inside?" Chen Ge forcefully opened the door, and the scene before him was beyond his expectations. There was a mannequin in the first cubicle. He was wearing a pair of black leather shoes and was about thirty to forty years old. He looked very much like Mr. Bai whom Chen Ge had met before. "A pair of shoes is placed in the western Campus restroom. There is indeed a mannequin in the first cubicle in the eastern campus. Why is there such a difference?" The white figure in the cubicle lowered his head and stood straight with his hands behind his head as if he had made a mistake. Chen Ge did not see anything wrong with his Yin Yang eyes. In the end, he took out Lin Sisi's phone and shot the first cubicle. The scene that appeared on the screen surprised him a little. There was a mannequin of Mr. Bai standing in the cubicle, but the picture captured on the phone was of a faceless boy with his hands behind his head, doing the same gesture as Mr. Bai. "Is this faceless boy Lin Sisi? Did Mr. Bai punish him like this before? So he used the same method to deal with Mr. Bai?" Chapter 817 Would You Like to Be My Friend Chen Ge pushed open the second cubicle. Inside was a skinny male mannequins. One of its legs was deformed, and it was curled up inside the cubicle, surrounded by mud and garbage. "It looks a bit like Wang Yicheng." The mannequins in the second cubicle and Wang Yicheng, who was behind Chen Ge, were both wearing blue sneakers. This mannequins should be Wang Yicheng. Chen Ge raised his hand and aimed the phone at the second cubicle. The scene on the screen was heart-wrenching. The faceless child was forced into the toilet cubicle by a group of people, and those people threw all kinds of trash on him. The boy did not resist and allowed himself to be bullied. The mannequin in the third cubicle was wearing a pair of glasses. His body was sprinkled with red paint, and he stood blankly against the wall of the toilet cubicle. The appearance of the mannequin was similar to the tall and skinny boy Chen Ge had seen in Room 413. With his previous experience, Chen Ge aimed his phone at the cubicle. A boy with no facial features appeared on the screen. He stood alone in the toilet cubicle, surrounded by people pouring paint into the cubicle. His once clean clothes were dirty, and the paint streamed down his clothes. The boy lowered his head and said nothing. "These bullies have gone out of control." Chen Ge pushed open the door to the fourth cubicle. The mannequin inside was not wearing any clothes, and its clothes were wet and thrown next to the squat. Chen Ge took out his phone to shoot the fourth cubicle. The faceless boy in the painting slowly took off his coat that was covered in paint. Someone poured a bottle of water on him. The fifth cubicle, the sixth cubicle. What happened in each cubicle were shocking. When people fell into madness, they would not know how bad their actions were. They recklessly vented all their negative emotions on one person. When he opened the first cubicle, Chen Ge only wanted to find the truth. Everything here had nothing to do with it. He was just a passer-by, a victim who wanted to leave. However, after he looked at the six cubicles in a row, his heart had unknowingly changed. His face was gloomy. If someone who knew him well saw it, he would definitely be surprised because this man rarely showed such an expression. The change in his expression mirrored the shift in his emotions. If he allowed it to show on his face, the thoughts in his mind would be laid bare, and his vulnerabilities would be exposed. Thus, during Chen Ge's black phone mission, he always maintained an unwavering composure. "Are these still students?" Raising his head, Chen Ge looked at the seventh cubicle. This was the only cubicle without a mannequin, and it was also the only one without a door. The door shaft was violently destroyed, and broken sawdust could be vaguely seen at the connecting point. The door of the seventh cubicle was knocked open by someone. The door was missing, and the interior of the cubicle was filled with something that looked like blood streaks. To be precise, the blood streaks in the toilet actually crawled out from this cubicle, and the seventh cubicle was the source of all the blood. "Was Lin Sisi locked in this cubicle?" The black and red blood streaks were like dead creepers. They crawled all over the walls of the cubicle and seemed to be hiding something. Chen Ge took out Lin Sisi's phone, adjusted the brightness of the screen to the maximum, and then aimed at the cubicle. The faceless boy held his coat and pants, the sewage and paint flowing down his body, colorful, like a monster baring its fangs and claws on his body. The toilet cubicle door on the screen seemed to be blocked by something from the outside. The boy lowered his head, hugged his clothes, and hit the door. He had no face, no expression, no voice, and did not know if he was crying or if he was calling for help. The only thing Chen Ge could see was the child knocking against the door until the door was pushed open. He stood barefoot at the door, covering his trousers that had been splashed with paint and dirty water. His hands were drooping, and the arm that had hit the door just now had been cut by sawdust. Blood was drawn on his arm, but the paint flowed into the wound. An oppressive, uncomfortable feeling wrapped around him, filling the air with discomfort and stealing his breath away. His neck twisted, and the face without any facial features glided across the vacant restroom. The evil had departed, yet their vicious words continued to echo in the restroom. The boy stood at the door for a long time. Gradually, he lifted his hand and methodically donned his damp clothes, piece by piece. Other than his arms, no other parts of his body were injured, but he quivered in agony. The middle of the trousers was slashed, revealing a large tear beneath the fabric. The boy managed to put on all his clothing, and the damp stains on the floor cast a ghastly shadow resembling a monstrous figure. He wiped his face and tried to take a step towards the toilet door. The light in the corridor spilled into the restroom, illuminating it. The exit was lit, revealing the boy's current state with clarity. The brightness was so intense that he had no hiding place. He returned to the seventh cubicle, wearing his dirty clothes. Leaning against the wall of the toilet cubicle, the boy's body slowly slid down. He curled up in the corner, his face without any facial features, and he seemed to be waiting to turn off the lights. The image on the phone screen did not end there. The child looked at it for a long time and then raised his head. The face with no facial features faced Chen Ge. He seemed to know that someone was looking at him. "Would you like to be my friend?" Chen Ge heard this very clearly, but when he looked in the direction of the voice, there was nothing there. "It came from the phone? That's impossible." The image was fixed in the last scene. The faceless boy curled up in the corner of the cubicle, his face aimed at Chen Ge as if he was waiting for Chen Ge's answer. "I am willing to be friends with you, even though your words sound like a curse." Chen Ge did not care about the curse. His life had started to change from a cursed love letter. Without the love letter, he would have been chopped into pieces by Wang Qi on the first mission. Chen Ge agreed, but the boy on the phone screen continued to do the same. He moved his phone away. There was nothing in the seventh cubicle, but he could clearly see the faceless boy with his phone. "Can you hear me?" Chen Ge tried to communicate with the other person, but there was no effect. After waiting for a while, the image on the phone screen changed again. The door to the seventh cubicle of the toilet was pushed open and a blood-red hand reached in. This hand gently grabbed the faceless boy. He seemed to have said something to the boy, and the faceless boy nodded slightly. Behind him, the faceless boy was held by that hand and walked towards the other side of the "door", disappearing. "That bloody hand reached out from the '- door'? What did he say to the boy?" Chen Ge suddenly remembered what he had just heard. "Is that what the master of the bloody hand said to the faceless boy - would you like to be friends with me?" "The faceless boy agreed, and then he disappeared?" Chen Ge carefully combed through it. The faceless boy was Lin Sisi. He did not open the door, but the bloody hand came out of the door, which meant that there was a door in the toilet cubicle. The owner of the blood hand invited Lin Sisi, and in the end, Lin Sisi agreed. And that is to say, the blood hand was the door-pusher. Chapter 818 I and He Are Not Necessarily Enemies It took Chen Ge a great effort to finally find the real owner of the ghost school. Although he only saw one of his hands, it was a breakthrough for Chen Ge. "I just heard someone asking in my ear - would you like to be my friend?" "This sentence didn't come from the phone. I heard it clearly from my ear." "He might not have said this to Lin Sisi, but for me." Chen Ge turned around and saw that the black and red blood streaks in the toilet cubicle had started to peel away. They were like fallen leaves in autumn, losing their vitality. "Did you agree?" Wang Yicheng, who had his eyes closed behind Chen Ge, suddenly spoke. He pressed his head against Chen Ge's shoulder. His voice was hushed, barely audible unless one listened closely. "Kind of. He looks very pitiful." Wang Yicheng clasped Chen Ge's neck tightly, their bodies pressed closely, and Chen Ge senses Wang Yicheng's body temperature dropping. "His friends are all dead, all dead!" The voice came from behind Chen Ge. He felt that his shoulder was a little wet. He turned around and saw that his left shoulder was already soaked in blood. That piece of bright red was a bit dazzling. "You..." Chen Ge flung Wang Yicheng off his back. The boy's hands flailed helplessly, clawing at the air. Blood trickled from his tightly shut eyes. 'Did you recall something?" Returning to his old place, Wang Yicheng's memory was triggered. He did not open his eyes, but when he heard what Chen Ge said, he realized what had happened. "There's no escaping now. You promised that person. He would come to find you. No matter where you go, he will find you!" Wang Yicheng's voice changed a lot. He fell into madness, completely different from the timidity he showed at the beginning. "He won't need to come for me. Even if he doesn't, I'll go find him. I like to make friends. In all sense, that is the case." Chen Ge had many friends, but they were not around, so he wanted to make some new friends. The blood seeping out of Wang Yicheng's eyes slid down his cheeks. His outer clothes were dyed red, and bright blood blossomed on his skin like a flower. This thin and weak boy also had the potential to become a Red Specter. "I'm getting more and more interested in the school master. How did he get all of you into the door one by one?" Chen Ge did not expect that the members that he had randomly found were all not simple. This was partly due to luck, but it also explained the horror of the ghost school from another perspective. Half a Red Specter was enough to support a normal two-star scenario, and Chen Ge had met several Red Specters and would-be Red Specters in the school. "Are you constantly joking to hide the panic in your heart?" Hearing Wang Yicheng's words, Chen Ge was even more certain that he had recovered his memories. In the past, Wang Yicheng was cowardly and weak, and he would never raise any objections. He would only blindly obey. I am not joking. I have the despair of pushing open the 'door', and I also have had hope, even if that hope had long been crushed. I sincerely want to help him. Becoming his friend is only the first step. Chen Ge carried Wang Yicheng and walked out of the toilet. "Have you noticed that most of the students in this school have abnormal childhood, or innate physical defects, or their personalities become distorted because of some external factors. Each of them has their own unbearable memories." "What are you trying to say?" "I am very curious about what the owner of the school experienced before. As the door-pusher, what kind of experience did he have to push open this 'door'?" "If you agree to be his friend, you will be left behind forever. This school was not that big before, and there were constant desperate and painful memories added to it, causing it to become like this." After Wang Yicheng said this, his eyes stopped bleeding, but his body was still trembling. "Looks like you know a lot of things." Chen Ge felt that this school was very similar to his own Haunted House, but the school was constantly looking for the students who were in despair, or perhaps they were trying to attract the students who were giving off the aura of despair, but Chen Ge's Haunted House welcomed them all. "This school has existed for many years, right?" I can only recall opening my eyes here. I don't have Zhang Ju's experiences. I died in this school and was reborn here. I have forgotten a lot of things. I only know that the size of this school is constantly expanding. "Why are you here? Is this Lin Sisi's punishment for you?" Chen Ge asked another question that he was very curious about. Wang Yicheng paused for a while before saying, "I am the only one that Lin Sisi let go of. The reason why I came here is because after Lin Sisi disappeared, I became a substitute for him." The fear and uneasiness of the students turned into violence. They vented it all out onto me.  One night, when I was about to collapse, the door found me. And then you came in? According to what Zhang Ju said, the first time the door appeared, it was very far away from the place where you would sleep, and then slowly approached you every day. Before Chen Ge could finish, he was interrupted by Wang Yicheng. "He is completely passive, and I am active. I want to find a corner where I can hide. Besides.." Wang Yicheng hesitated for a long time and said another secret, "At that time, the hand that stretched out the door was smeared with all kinds of paint. It was Lin Sisi's hand. He was inviting me, and I wanted to say sorry to him face to face. I actually reported to my teacher that day, but he did not come over. "What else do you know about Lin Sisi and this door?" "No more, I didn't see Lin Sisi when I entered the door. Until today, I have never seen him." Wang Yicheng released his hands. "You can put me down." "Are you sure you are not lying?" Chen Ge put down Wang Yicheng. "At the entrance of the western campus toilet, as soon as your memory resurfaced, the school manager immediately appeared. In the end, if I hadn't knocked you out, I'm afraid we would have been caught by now. You are completely different from Zhang Ju and Zhu Long." "Maybe it's because Lin Sisi is his friend, and I am Lin Sisi's friend." The few of them walked past seven cubicles in succession. This place contained what Lin Sisi had encountered before, and what the phone captured should only be a part of it. "I really can't imagine what the door-pusher experienced before." When he was about to leave the restroom, Chen Ge looked at the seventh cubicle. "It can be confirmed that the door is in the seventh cubicle. If you want to know the school master, you only need to investigate all the incidents that happened in the restrooms in the school." Based on the clues that he had gotten, Chen Ge planned to go to three places - the school archives, the school library, and the oil painting room that he had promised Zhou Tu. Chapter 819 They Came In the school archives, they might find information about the school owner; within the library, mirrors possibly leading to the blood-red world could be discovered; and the experimental building's oil painting room was the place where Chen Ge had committed to going with Zhou Tu. "Where should we go first?" Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu. "I know the location of the art club and have seen the scene in your dreams. Now I can take you there at any time, but are you really ready to restore your memory?" Zhou Tu had not interacted much with Chen Ge, so he was at a loss when Chen Ge suddenly asked him this question. Before regaining his memories, he had always wanted to know what he had forgotten, but after seeing what happened to Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng, he hesitated. Are you ready to bear the past? Without resuming the old memories, you are just an insignificant student in this school, you can think about nothing and repeat the peaceful and beautiful day. Once you awaken your memories, you will definitely be tracked down by the school administration, and there will be no way out. Chen Ge kept asking Zhou Tu. His continuous questioning of Zhou Tu was also a test. Of all the members of the club, Zhou Tu was the most assertive. "I thought about it. It's better to find my memories. Without the past, no matter how comfortable life is, it's just self-deception." Zhou Tu's gaze shifted to Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. "I wonder if my true appearance will scare you to the point of tears.” "You should think twice." Zhang Ju's voice was hoarse as he twisted his burnt face. "You give off a feeling that makes me very uncomfortable. The real you must be a terrifying monster." Zhou Tu was at a loss for words. He did not know how to reply. His eyes wandered and he seemed to waver. "Let's go to the school archives first. You still have enough time to think about it." Chen Ge patted Zhou Tu on the shoulder. "Don't feel pressured. I respect whatever choice you make.” "Thank you." Zhou Tu lowered his head and pondered. Zhang Ju nudged Chen Ge. "His real appearance should be terrible. If he can wake up his memory, it will be easier for us to do whatever we want next." "Everyone has their own choices. I won't interfere." "Didn't you help us regain our memories in order to help us recover our past, increase our strength, and then help you achieve your goal?" Zhang Ju was confused. He still remembered what Chen Ge had said before. They were just helping each other and using each other. In a certain book, I came across a sentence that went like this: The rose never questioned why, nor did it seek anything in return. It simply blossomed for the sake of blossoming. Although I can't be so selfless, at least I have experienced the pain you have experienced. When I see you, I think of myself. Chen Ge turned his gaze to the other members, his expression serious. "There is something else I want to emphasize. Our connection is not about taking advantage of one another, but about achieving victory together. Mutual respect is just the groundwork. Hearing Chen Ge's voice, the ghost seemed to have forgotten that the man in front of them was just an ordinary person. Perhaps he had yet to recover his memories. Zhang Ju and Zhu Long nodded and followed Chen Ge. Wang Yicheng opened his eyes, which were filled with tears of blood, and he appeared to hold an even stronger recognition for Chen Ge. Zhou Tu, who was walking at the rear, was deep in thought, and his eyes slowly became firm. Back in the corridor, Chen Ge had only taken a few steps when he felt that something was wrong. The air had a strong bad smell, like the one he noticed in the experimental building earlier. A sense of unease crept in. The more Chen Ge walked forward, the more depressed he felt. It was as if he was walking at the bottom of the lake, and the chill came from all directions. "Are those reversed monsters have appeared again?" Chen Ge did not lower his head to look. Things had already happened. If he lowered his head to look, it would only disrupt his judgment. He would try his best to leave the teaching building as much as possible. Standing next to Zhang Ju, Chen Ge's eyes narrowed and he lowered his voice. "Did you see the monsters in the corridor?" "Monster?" Zhang Ju stared at the corridor. The blood on his body slid down his coat. "There seems to be something, but it seems that they can't hurt us." Before he finished speaking, Zhang Ju saw his hair float up, as if there was an invisible baby pulling his hair in the dark. Small wounds began to appear on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng's body. Those monsters seemed to be drawn to them. "I can't see them. How did they hurt me?" The scars on Zhang Ju's face continued to bleed. His body was covered in blood. Despite regaining his memories, he had not mastered how to wield his power yet. "As long as we reverse our gaze, we will be able to see them. However, I do not recommend that you do this." "Why?" "Because once you see them, you will be even more desperate." Chen Ge motioned for the group to leave the corridor. It was unknown whether the monsters attacking Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng were done by instinct or by someone else. If it was the latter, it would be more troublesome. The stench around them grew stronger and stronger. Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng also had more and more wounds on their bodies. What was worth noting was that every time a wound appeared on their bodies, a thin black thread would drill into their bodies. That thing looked like a curse. Just as they reached the corner of the third floor, Wang Yicheng could no longer hold on. His footsteps became more and more powerless. "I feel like a lot of things are biting my body. My memory has become blurry again." "Mr. Bai, the situation is getting worse. There seem to be more dirty things downstairs." Zhou Tu said in a low voice. They had just arrived on the third floor when they smelled a pungent stench. What was even stranger was that the smell came from their side. Lowering his head, Zhou Tu pretended to pick up the knife like before, looking up at the place where the stench was coming from. In the empty ground between him and Wang Yicheng, there was an upside-down face. The coat of the monster was pressed against the flesh and blood. It seemed to have no skin, and the blood streaks were surging under the clothes. The blood and clothes were stuck together, dyeing the whole clothes red! "Wang, Wang Yicheng, that thing is right in front of you!" Zhou Tu screamed. His memory had yet to awaken when he suddenly saw such a scene. He was so scared that he almost fell down the stairs. "I told you not to look. If you can't see, you won't be annoyed." Chen Ge carried Wang Yicheng on his back and stepped on the place with the strongest stench. Then, he ran downstairs. Zhou Tu clutched his chest. The place Chen Ge had just stepped on was the monster's head. "Alright, I understand." When they went down to the second floor, the stench filled the corridor, and  Zhu Long, whose memories had begun to restore, also became the target of those monsters. Zhang Ju could still resist, but Zhu Long and Wang Yicheng could not hold on any longer. They could only rely on Chen Ge and Zhou Tu to continue forward. Chapter 820 Archives The situation continued to deteriorate, and Zhou Tu was also starting to be targeted by the monster. The first wound appeared on his finger. "Mr. Bai, what should we do now?" Chen Ge did not have a better idea. All he could do was bear down. Even if everyone was bitten by the monster and lost their ability to move, he would bring them all out. The stench entered his nostrils and almost made him faint. When Chen Ge was about to approach the corner of the first floor with Wang Yicheng on his back, he felt a sharp pain in his chest. With a stagger, Chen Ge almost fell to the ground. Looking down, he saw that a sharp nail had been pierced into his chest. "The curse of Room 413?" He immediately grasped the situation and looked at his shadow. The originally normal shadow was constantly twisting at this time as if the "figure" hidden inside was enduring great pain. "Even he was attacked?" The members of the club all reached their limits, covered in cuts and bruises, looking very miserable. "The exit is just ahead. Keep moving!" Chen Ge had a strong will, and he was used to the pain. Pulling out the nail, Chen Ge ran forward with all his might, knowing that every step he took brought him closer to a glimmer of hope. "Plop!" Zhou Tu, who was carrying Zhu Long, fell down on the stairs, his right hand covered in scars, looking as if it was about to crack. "The hand I use for drawing..." Chen Ge was already struggling to rescue one person, so bringing along a few more was out of the question. "Hang on there! We are almost on the floor." The legs seemed to be laden with lead, and each step became heavy, and the stench on the first floor was thicker than on the second floor, where more monsters were waiting for them. Other than Chen Ge, everyone else was already in despair, but it was at this moment that the stench in the air suddenly faded as if someone had lured some of the monsters away. "A Chance!" Chen Ge grabbed Zhou Tu and ran at full speed with Wang Yicheng on his back. When he reached the first floor, he saw a shadow standing on the other end of the corridor. The figure of the man was very similar to Chang Gu. There was a scarlet light floating in his left eye, and blood was seeping out of his coat. He seemed to be holding something in his hand. "Chang Gu?" Chen Ge shouted, but the man did not respond. He turned around and left, and the stench in the corridor faded. "Did he lure those monsters away?" Chen Ge recalled that Chang Gu was timid and weak, and he was very different from the figure he saw earlier. "He only entered the door a few seconds earlier than me. What happened to him?" The figure had lured away more than half of the monster, and Chen Ge quickly led the club members out of the teaching building. "Mr. Bai, what happened to those monsters just now? Why are we only able to see them when we turn our eyes upside down? And why did they only attack Wang Yicheng and Zhang Ju and not you?" Zhou Tu collapsed on the ground. He felt that the stench had already seeped into his body. "Those monsters should be used by the school to punish students. It is even possible that they were once students who broke the school rules." Chen Ge did not expect that those monsters were not even afraid of Red Specters. They had completely lost their minds and were a bunch of complete lunatics. "The school owner wants to build a beautiful 'paradise' behind the 'gate'. You can recall the past, which goes against his initial plan. He will naturally target you." Chen Ge checked Wang Yicheng and Zhang Ju's bodies. The black threads had already drilled into their wounds. When he got close to the wounds, he could smell a faint stench. "Be careful. Those monsters might be trying to turn you into their kind." Standing outside the teaching building, Chen Ge used his Yin Yang eyes to scan his surroundings, but he did not see the shadow that had saved him. "If he really is Chang Gu, why didn't he come to find me? Isn't it time to meet him? Or is it that he has actually been targeted?" Chen Ge had no communication with Chang Gu. He needed to understand Chang Gu's motives before making the correct choice. "It's good to have someone help me divert attention." Chen Ge helped Wang Yicheng up. "Let's go to the office building now. The school archives should be there.". The office building of the western campus was very close to the wall. Standing at the highest point of the office building, one could see both the eastern and western campuses. "The monsters I have seen in this school can be divided into several categories: ordinary ghosts and ghosts with strong obsession in their beforelife, common red-clothed specters, the managers in white clothes in the western campus, and the monsters in the eastern campus who are covered in burns, and the monsters in the eastern campus who are emitting a foul smell. Other than them, the most dangerous ones are the teachers and dormitory managers in this school. We are going to the office building. There is a high chance of encountering them. Everyone must be careful." It was not the first time Chen Ge had done something like this, but the other members of the club were not used to it. "Mr. Bai, aren't you also a teacher?" "Do you think that I'm not a threat?" Chen Ge did not even turn his head as he spoke and entered the office building. He had been to the office building of the western campus, but what he did not expect was that the interior architectural style of the office building of the eastern and western campuses was very different. The western campus office building appeared neat and orderly. However, upon entering the eastern campus office building, an air of gloominess enveloped the area. The floor, which was left unattended fo a while, displayed muddy footprints. The walls bore scratches, transforming the once-white surface into a faded yellow shade. Furthermore, substantial patches of mold had appeared there. "Did the teachers in the eastern campus usually work here?" Zhou Tu couldn't believe it. "In this school, the teacher's duty is not to educate you, but to manage you. They spend most of their time with the students. The office building is just a symbolic place." Chen Ge tried to push the door to one of the offices. The wooden door was not locked, so it opened with a push. The various facilities in the room were very shabby and looked like things from many years ago. "I've been to this place before. I know the location of the archives room." Zhang Ju said coldly. Ever since he found his memories, he had become less and less talkative. "When did you come to this place?" Zhou Tu was a little afraid of the current Zhang Ju, so he lowered his voice as he spoke. "Before I was deceived by Chang Wenyu, in order to figure out what was going on in this school, I secretly came to the archives room." Zhang Ju walked in front. "Follow me closely. This place makes me very uncomfortable. There might be something very dangerous hidden here." It was unknown whether the monsters in the office building had sensed Zhang Ju in advance or because of other reasons, they did not encounter any danger along the way and smoothly arrived at the third floor of the office building. "This is the archive room. We will leave immediately after we find what we want. Don't linger too long. I feel that there are other people in the building." Zhang Ju opened the door of the archives room. There were several rusty metal cabinets and four rows of wooden bookshelves in the room. Chapter 821 Raging Fire! There was a musty smell in the archives room, and Chen Ge covered his mouth and nose before entering. The aged wooden bookshelf was placed next to the rusty case cabinets, producing an inexplicable and strange contrast. "These bookshelves and metal cabinets seem to belong to different schools." Chen Ge took out a document from the wooden shelf, but perhaps due to the poor storage environment, the document bag was damaged with only a slight force. "These documents were moldy and water-damaged. They had been neglected by the school. Chen Ge carefully opened the document bag. The contents of the document confused him. "Gratitude List for Donors? Why does this paper look so familiar?" Chen Ge looked at it again and again, and a sudden realization crossed his mind. He looked at the document bag riddled with wormholes in surprise. "I seem to have seen such a list in Mu Yang High School's principal office!" He observed carefully and tried his best to recall something that surprised him more than the name of the donor. "Exactly the same! I've seen this list in Mu Yang High School's headmaster's office!" Back then, in order to find the old principal of Mu Yang High School, he had entered Mu Yang High School many times. Despite the efforts, he did not find the old principal even after digging three feet into the ground. "The world behind the door is woven based on the memory of the door-pusher. This school is special. It seems to be formed by the combined memories of all the people in the school." Chen Ge held his chin. "Apart from the old principal, all the others from Mu Yang High School are in my ghost room. Why would this list show up here? Could it be suggesting that the former principal of Ming Mu Yang High School is also trapped within this school?" Chen Ge widened his eyes. He looked at the bookshelf that gave off a musty smell. The more he looked at it, the more familiar he felt it was. "Could these things have also been moved out from Mu Yang High School? A part of that two-star scenario is hidden here?" "It seems that I have a certain fate with the old principal." He put the document back to its original place with an intriguing expression. "Before the mission of the School of the Afterlife is unlocked, there are nine other pre-missions. Is it possible that these nine pre-missions have some special connection with the School of the Afterlife?" "Mr. Bai, did you find anything?" "I did find something, but I'm not sure yet." Chen Ge pulled out another file that was filled with mold. "A school environment survey book?" This place was designated as an archive room. In fact, it was more like a miscellaneous storage room for stacked documents. There were all kinds of documents here, including graduation design, reimbursement bills, association statistics table, canteen shopping index, and so on. "Mr. Bai!" Zhu Long found a few crumpled newspapers from the corner and brought one to Chen Ge. "Look at the news with the big picture in the middle." "The school building caught fire for some unknown reason. Many students were trapped in the restroom, and the firefighters rushed into the fire to rescue them." This report was located right in the middle of the newspaper and was very eye-catching. "Looking at the typesetting and content, the person who wrote this report should be young." Chen Ge took the newspaper. It was covered in mold, and there were still many stains. Many parts were blurry. "This seems to be the school report." Mu Yang High School was just a private welfare agency, and it did not have the ability to run a school newspaper. After perusing all the newspapers, Chen Ge came across a name he recognized - Western JiuJiang Private Academy. The name of this place had appeared many times, with numerous reports linked to the Western Jiujiang Private Academy. "Isn't Western Jiujiang Private Academy Zhang Ya's school?" In the abandoned school, this was the first time Chen Ge had a date with a Red Specter. It was also in that school that he entered Zhang Ya's heart. "There was a fire in the Western Jiujiang Private Academy building?" As he recollected, he remembered he had seen the burnt staircase handrail in the teaching building. "It's a bit strange. Not only Western Jiujiang Private Academy but also Mu Yang High School and the abandoned school I visited all bear traces of fire. He reread the newspaper that Zhu Long handed to him. At that time, the fireman rescued six people from the restroom on the top floor. The article hailed the firefighter as a hero, with the entire piece filled with praise. But he also saw a report in the corner of the newspaper that called for everyone to learn about the knowledge of summer fire, which vaguely mentioned that a classmate died in the fire. "The fire started from the restroom, but why would a fire break out there? The fire happened after the students finished their evening self-study and school had already dismissed for the day. Why are those students staying in the restroom on the top floor of the school?" According to a few reports, Chen Ge quickly grasped the issue. "The fire burned on the fourth floor. At that time, there were only students in the restroom on the fourth floor. Six firefighters were rescued, but one student was lost in the fire. That is to say, there should be seven people in the restroom at that time!" What was the cause of the fire? It was impossible to figure it out now. There was no record of this at all in the data and files. The student who had died in the fire seemed to have become a subject of taboo as well. "Did something like this happen in Western Jiujiang Private Academy? But when I went there, I didn't notice anything abnormal." Chen Ge was confused. If the door of the restroom was pushed open by the student who died in the fire, then he should be the 'door-pusher' of Western Jiujiang Private Academy. However, the entire reason why Western Jiujiang Academy had attained a three-star scenario status was entirely due to Zhang Ya!! Now that Western Jiujiang Private Academy had become a part of the Haunted House, Chen Ge was sure that Zhang Ya was the scariest existence in that school. "There is a door in all three-star scenarios. Although Western Jiujiang Private Academy is a three-star scenario, there is no door." Chen Ge looked at his shadow, contemplating the name. He kept repeating the name, but there was still no response. "Western Jiujiang Private Academy was named a three-star scenario because of Zhang Ya. As far as I know, Zhang Ya never pushed open any doors. When I went to Western Jiujiang Private Academy, I didn't see any doors either." Chen Ge slowly lowered the hand holding the newspaper, and the red dress appeared in his mind. Zhang Ya, the door that should have existed but disappeared, the door-pusher. The three words formed a sequence in Chen Ge's mind, and he suddenly thought of a possibility. His eyes widened, and Chen Ge sucked in a breath of cold air. "Could it be that the door-pusher of Western Jiujiang Private Academy was consumed by Zhang Ya?" Only this explanation could explain why Zhang Ya was different and why she was ridiculously strong. "What will happen to the door after the door-pusher is eaten?" Chen Ge speculated. "Because of her obsession, Zhang Ya did not become the door-pusher." The door with the missing 'door-pusher' should slowly lose control like the door in Li Wan City, but that did not happen. This door would only appear by the bedside of the children who were in despair. Wait a minute! Could it be that it is searching for a new 'door-pusher'? Chapter 822 The Constant Effort to Search for Desperate Students Chen Ge was shocked by his own thoughts. A door without an owner, constantly searching for desperate children, and after several years, it finally evolved into a four-star scenario? This sounded unbelievable, and Chen Ge forced himself to regain composure. "There are thirteen easels in the oil studio of the experimental building and a total of thirteen students are painting. They know the secrets of the school and this place is riddled with blood and violence. They are probably the thirteen candidates that the door found for itself." It was difficult for a single person to support a four-star scenario unless they surpassed a Red Specter. However, if more Red Specters joined hands, the outcome is uncertain. After all, even he had never seen so many Red Specters together. "Thirteen, such an ominous number." Chen Ge glanced at Zhou Tu. He had been searching for the art club, and he had even dreamed of the scene in the oil painting. It was likely that he was one of the thirteen painters. "The door should have selection criteria. Zhang Jue definitely didn't meet the criteria, but Zhou Tu did." At first, Chen Ge did not have much expectations for the oil studio, but after analyzing it, he changed his mind. "Zhou Tu's memory is the key." Among the members, Zhou Tu was the most special one, and Chen Ge had to prepare for both possibilities now. Either Zhou Tu would regain his memories and help Chen Ge, or Zhou Tu would become Chen Ge's enemy after regaining his memories. "He is a crucial figure. Was my attitude towards him too casual before?" Chen Ge stared at Zhou Tu, and the man shuddered. "Mr. Bai, I'll go over there and take a look." Zhou Tu made up an excuse and ran to the deepest part of the archives. "Why are you running? I should be the one who should be afraid." Chen Ge continued to search the room. The surprise that the archives had brought him was far from over. Soon, Chen Ge found a few more reports about the fire in the filing room. The fire seemed to have a special meaning in this school, symbolizing both destruction and rebirth. "There was a fire at Mu Yang High School. There were burn marks on the stairs, and the school used to be a crematorium. Now I found that there was a fire at Western Jiujiang Private Academy. Is this a coincidence, or is there a deeper reason behind it?" Other than the reports about the fire, Chen Ge also found a few well-preserved student records at the bottom of the cabinet. Among them, two records were very special. One of them had Lin Sisi's name written on it, and there was a teacher and a classmate's evaluation of him. The students were unwilling to be friends with him, and the teacher was too lazy to care about him. This student did not have a mother, and his father was a murderer. He had been adopted since he was young, but for some reason, he had escaped from a foster family many times, which was very troublesome. In his opinion, the only person in the entire world who truly helped him was an intern at the welfare institute. The university student who had just graduated had helped Lin Sisi finish his primary school and even attended Lin Sisi's parent-teacher conference. According to the teacher's comments, only when the intern was around, Lin Sisi's "ADHD" could improve a little. There was no picture of Lin Sisi and specific information in the file, but there was a handwritten signature - Gu Youjia. The entire file was tattered and moldy, full of wormholes. Only the signature of the guardian remained unblemished. "Gu Family, Hanjiang Welfare Institute. If I can leave here alive, I can go and take a look." Chen Ge seemed to be muttering to himself but also deliberately saying it for someone to hear. He then looked at another picked file. This file was marked earlier than the other files. There were no names or records on it. There was only one sentence written on it. "Bear with it. Bear with it again. Everything will be fine. They can't bully me for the rest of my life. One day, I will grow up too." The words on the file were crooked, not like what the teacher could write, but more like it was written by a student with an injured hand. Unconditionally enduring bullying will only make the abuser more aggressive. This is true in any situation. Those who find pleasure in violence are unlikely to sympathize with others or reflect on their own deeds." Chen Ge used Lin Sisi's phone to take a picture and then put the files back in place. "The earliest file should have been left by the real door-pusher. After he opened the door, it is very likely that his emotions have changed greatly and he has gone to another extreme." "If the door-pusher Zhang Ya ate is him, then after his death, the door he pushed open is probably still doing something according to his will. If I want to increase the probability of surviving behind the door, it is best to follow his thoughts." Chen Ge had never encountered school violence before. The closest he had come to it was likely during his time in primary school. The teacher asked the children to bring the toys they rarely played with to school, intending to donate them to the welfare institute. Everyone had already donated, but Chen Ge was the only one who held his bag and remained silent. A few of the most naughty children in the class began to snatch little Chen Ge's school bag. They broke the zipper in the confrontation, and a bloody plastic intestine and a bag of broken fingers were scattered all over the place. The vivid and lifelike broken fingers rolled around in the classroom like chalk. The bloody plastic intestine bounced a few times on the desk, scaring the students in the class and the teachers who were walking this way. When the vice principal arrived later, he even specifically asked the class teacher, "What's this child's family background?" That evening, Chen Ge's parents were called to the school, and then they were taken away by the police for questioning. Speaking of which, Chen Ge should be the only student who was bullied at school, and his parents were interrogated by the police. However, there was a silver lining. At least, from then on, no one else of the same age dared to bully Chen Ge. "You absolutely can not surrender to school violence." There was another meaning behind Chen Ge's words. In this school, some of the victims had become the new source of violence. The School of the Afterlife was constantly expanding, and the door that was not dyed red by blood would approach all the desperate children, turning them into a part of the door, reproducing their nightmares behind the door, using their souls as bricks to build a grave that buried reality. After searching in the archives room for a long time, Chen Ge decisively led the other members out of the office building as a familiar smell wafted into his nose. "Teacher, we have good luck. Those smelly monsters only came to us in the end." Zhu Long whispered. "It's not luck. Someone helped us lure away those monsters." Chen Ge was not sure if Chang Gu was helping him, but he knew that something must be happening in this school, and those things were probably related to the Chang siblings. "Let's go. Next, we will go to the experimental building." Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu. "You should have made your decision, right?" Chapter 823 The Red-Clothed Club Memories were a difficult thing to describe, like snow that would never melt, or like a fleeting light that slipped through one's fingers. They remained just beyond reach and persisted even when one wished to forget. Zhou Tu had been troubled by that dream for a long time. He knew that he was different, but he did not dare to be sure. In the end, he fell into deep self-doubt. It was not until this day that he met Chen Ge. This man was the first person to trust Zhou Tu. The dreams he had were all real. Everything he experienced was not fake. It was a memory that was imprinted in the depths of his mind and could not be erased. Zhou Tu got the answer he wanted, but at the same time, he was trapped in a dangerous whirlpool. He did not know if he would be smashed to pieces if he continued to follow Chen Ge, or if he would be freed. "Have you made up your mind?" Chen Ge stood in front of Zhou Tu and repeated. "I..." "If you really can't make up your mind, you can look at him." Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng suddenly walked over. They sandwiched Zhou Tu in the middle. "Zhu Long, come here." Zhu Long, who was bringing up the rear, seemed to be in a strange state. His gaze was very intense as if he was burning with flames, and his entire body was on the verge of collapse and madness. "What did you do to him?" Chen Ge looked at Zhu Long's left hand. The veins on the hand holding the phone bulged. "We found an incomplete news report in the archive room. It mentioned a courier who often wandered around the university and disappeared from the school. After several days of investigation, the police found a severely mutilated body in the anatomy lab's utility room." Zhang Ju handed Chen Ge a few damaged newspapers. "That barely recognizable body is him - Zhu Long." The fictitious memory was shattered and Zhu Long remembered a lot of things when he saw the newspaper. Trying hard to study and finally successfully entering university was just his dream, but the reality was so cruel that people could not bear to see it. The girl he liked had excellent grades and was admitted to the best medical university, while his grades were in a mess, and he could not even afford to pay the tuition fees to repeat a year. His family was poor, and his only family members were seriously ill, growing weaker by the day. Fate dealt him heavy blows, but it did not bear this guy down. He began to learn to take care of others and support the family himself. When he was looking for a job, people found him unenthusiastic. So, he shaved off his unruly hair, and when they said his tattoos would scare customers, he scraped his skin with a small knife, bit by bit. He wasn't defeated. He eventually found a job—delivering packages. He was very diligent and friendly. There was stubbornness in his eyes and a smile on his face. He used all his strength to live and relied on his own efforts to win respect and material protection. After spending the most difficult summer vacation, he was used to this job and worked late every day. The only pleasure he had was to pick up some orders sent to Jiujiang Medical University. Every time he entered the school, there was a trace of hope in his heart. He knew that the girl was in this school. Even if he only peeked at her from afar, he would feel very satisfied and could be happy for the whole day. The school wasn't too big, nor was it too small. He didn't know when he'd meet her again. He had fantasized countless scenes about their encounter, but when the girl really appeared, he discovered that all the preparations and drills were useless. He was so nervous that he couldn't speak, like a child who was caught doing something bad. After that day, they exchanged their contact information, and the girl was unexpectedly active. She liked the feeling of control, and Zhu Long mistakenly thought it was love. His unwavering obedience only subjected him to mental devastation. The girl liked to torture Zhu Long, and she would always remind Zhu Long - he was nothing. His hard-earned self-esteem was crushed bit by bit, and Zhu Long became the puppet in the girl's hand, and what was even more terrifying was that Zhu Long was unaware of it. He, a single-minded fool, was no match for the female bookworm who was proficient in anatomy and criminal psychology. He was like a naked lamb whose feathers had been plucked. He was on her plate, ready to be slaughtered. The torment eventually transitioned from psychological to physical abuse, and as death approached, Zhu Long finally understood. But by then, it was too late. Fresh blood flowed from the wounds. Zhu Long held the pink phone and stared at the newspaper in Chen Ge's hand. The gate in his memory was finally opened after repeated stimulation. "Do you know which piece of human flesh is pink?" The blood streaks seemed like threads, sewing up the skin. Zhu Long walked toward Chen Ge. "When the wound is about to heal, the flesh is the most tender. She likes pink." Zhu Long's body began to dislocate, and there were many stitches on his body, which was hard to imagine what he had encountered after his death. "Another Half-Red Specter." Chen Ge's gaze was unusually calm. When Zhu Long was only two steps away from him, he raised his hands and hugged Zhu Long. "I want you to understand one thing. No matter when or for what reason, anything that hurts you should not be allowed, even if it is in the name of love." Looking at the boy in front of him, Chen Ge felt his heartache. He patted Zhu Long on the shoulder. "I don't know what you are thinking now, but I can promise you that if we can leave this school, I will let you see that girl again." The blood streaks that moved through Zhu Long's flesh suddenly paused. Zhu Long looked straight at Chen Ge and slowly lowered his head. "Deal." Holding the pink phone tightly, Zhu Long silently retreated behind Chen Ge. Zhu Long and Zhang Ju's coats continued to turn red. Even if they were not Red Specters, they were at least top-tier Half-Red Specters. Including Wang Yicheng. Chen Ge did not think that he would be too afraid of normal Red Specters. "We can go to the laboratory building now." Chen Ge did not ask Zhou Tu for his decision. He had already gotten the answer from the man's eyes. After he saw Zhu Long's appearance, his nails dug into his flesh. He should also have an unfulfilled wish, but now he even forgot what that wish was. After passing through the bushes, Chen Ge led the members of the club to the laboratory building. This was the second time he had visited tonight. "That Red Specter should still be in the duty room. If we meet him, we can just return his clothes to him." Chen Ge was much more confident in his words. He led the students to stop outside the building. "This building is the nest of those monsters with their bodies turned upside down. The art club we are going to is on the fourth floor. After we finish looking at that room, no matter whether Zhou Tu's memory is awake or not, we have to evacuate immediately." Chen Ge walked to the window of a room on the first floor. "Now, come up with me." The students looked at each other, and then they saw Chen Ge easily climb to the second floor. "I told you he must be a sports teacher." Zhang Ju, Zhu Long, and Wang Yicheng's memories had already awakened. It was not a big deal for ghosts to climb up the stairs. Only Zhou Tu looked troubled.
