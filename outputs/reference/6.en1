Chapter 449 "My Neighbor's Dog" After carefully inspecting the house and confirming that there were no major issues, they more or less finalized the decision. As for the remaining matters, Nanfeng would negotiate with the real estate agent and the former homeowner. Curly Hair was in an extremely good mood today, joyfully frolicking around. Seeing that, Nanfeng chuckled. "Don't worry, Curly Hair. We'll be able to move in directly the next time we come, and you can play for as long as you want. You can even swim in the sea every day and have fun with the little fish and shrimp..." After swimming a lap in the sea and being called ashore by Fang Zhao, Curly Hair spent a while happily digging in the sand. When it was time to leave, its eyes remained fixed out the window, full of reluctance. Curly Hair was happy. It lay in the car and began to daydream about its happy future. What impression did the sea have on Curly Hair? The impression of eating a seafood buffet for free. Its cheerful mood lasted until it returned to the dormitory. After Nanfeng and the other two left, Fang Zhao closed the dormitory door. "Curly Hair, come here." Curly Hair wagged its tail and trotted over. "Did you have fun today?" Fang Zhao asked. "Woof!" "Was it fun there?" Fang Zhao asked again. Curly Hair jumped up and barked again, wagging its tail vigorously. "Speak." "Fun!" Curly Hair replied. By now, it had become adept at switching languages and could speak with impeccable pronunciation. "Mm." Fang Zhao nodded, then turned on the learning device. Curly Hair fell silent. Its ears twitched, and it shuffled its paws, thinking it was discreetly retreating a step back. Fang Zhao ignored its reluctance and turned the learning device on. He showed Curly Hair a newly created folder containing a set of recently purchased e-books: "Marine Environmental Protection Law" "Youth Environmental Protection Knowledge Series" "Directory of Marine Wildlife Conservation" "Marine Environmental Management" "100 Essential Marine Knowledge for the New Century" "Oh, Sea, My Home" They were all books related to the ocean, a total of twenty. Not only were there e-books but also corresponding sets of test questions, twenty in total. Curly Hair was rendered speechless. Its excited ears drooped. "I know you read fast. You can do it even faster now, right? Once you finish reading the twenty books in the folder and score full marks on the corresponding twenty sets of test questions, I'll let you go play in the sea. "We'll expect to move in no more than 15 days," Fang Zhao said. They were all knowledge-intensive books requiring rote memorization, something Curly Hair's current memory and learning abilities could easily handle. Fang Zhao was not worried about Curly Hair's safety in the sea; on the contrary, he was worried that it would eat some endangered marine animals to extinction. He still wasn't entirely sure about the capacity of the canine's stomach. During the program recording on Planet Bu, Curly Hair had secretly eaten in the desert and the sea. If Fang Zhao hadn't warned it, it would've likely feasted. After all, the time spent on Planet Bu wasn't long, and with Fang Zhao keeping Curly Hair in line, not to mention that they had to take other people on Planet Bu into consideration, it couldn't eat too much either. But once they moved to the new place, Curly Hair would have the chance to go to the sea every day. That said, without regulation, it could potentially lead to a form of species invasion. With its ability alone, Curly Hair could disrupt the ecological balance of that sea region. Thus, Fang Zhao had to make sure Curly Hair understood some things in advance—the marine life had only recently recovered to its current state, so he couldn't let Curly Hair disrupt it. Forget about ever entering the sea until you score full marks. Go have fun with the learning device! On this day, Nanfeng came to see Fang Zhao about matters concerning the new house's renovation. As soon as he entered the dormitory, Nanfeng spotted Curly Hair facing the wall, head drooping dejectedly with traces of tears below its doggy eyes. Nanfeng paused for a moment before averting his gaze to look for Fang Zhao to sort out the matter at hand. As for Curly Hair, this was the norm, so Nanfeng didn't make anything of it. After discussing the renovation, Nanfeng recalled what he had seen today and said, "By the way, Boss, do you know what happened online today?" "What is it?" Fang Zhao was writing his thesis today. His communication settings were arranged so that he wouldn't be disturbed unless it was something important. Recently, there had been a lot of discussion about him online, and many people have been trying to reach him. As such, Fang Zhao could only switch his communication to 'do not disturb' mode. "Do you know about Will's drawing?" Nanfeng asked. "I do. Is it about his graduation work?" Fang Zhao had visited Will's graduation art exhibition before. It was also an A+ high score. One of the paintings was of Curly Hair, titled "My Neighbor's Dog." It had been two days since the art exhibition, and since Fang Zhao had been writing his thesis in the dormitory all day, he wasn't aware of what had happened on the Internet. With that, Nanfeng briefed Fang Zhao on what he had learned. It turned out that after Will's graduation art exhibition ended, the academy showcased his paintings on their website, causing quite a stir. Will had successfully completed the study plan he had set for himself last year—his short-term goal was to paint Fang Zhao, and his ultimate goal was to paint Fang Zhao's dog. The short-term goal had been accomplished a while back. Will's painting titled "My Neighbor" had caused a buzz online, with some netizens playfully saying that Will portrayed Fang Zhao as an extraterrestrial. This time, following "My Neighbor," "My Neighbor's Dog" once again made it onto the trending searches. "My Neighbor's Dog" was Will's longest and most painstaking creation during his study period. It was a work that required significant effort, and at the same time, it was the piece Will was most satisfied with. This painting shared a similar style with "My Neighbor," but it appeared more enigmatic and harder to comprehend. While "My Neighbor" at least had some semblance of the subject's appearance, "My Neighbor's Dog" lacked any recognizable dog features. If not for the title, no one would identify the subject as a dog; it looked more like a small pet. The color was extremely vibrant. It was mysterious and contained great spirit. It seemed to transcend the ordinary, yet it was impossible to pinpoint any specific aspect that was inappropriate. The more one studied it, the more a sense of tremor would arise within. "Is Fang Zhao's dog really that scary?" A student from HuangArt recalled the little curly-haired dog he had encountered on campus. They then went online to confirm their memory of that canine. However, at HuangArt, the people who had heard Fang Zhao's graduation concert and closely analyzed Will's painting had a different impression. "To be honest, the feeling this painting gives me is somewhat similar to Fang Zhao's piece 'η.' "It's a bit beyond the scope of ordinary understanding." Even if an outsider stood in front of this painting and looked at it quietly for a few seconds, even if they couldn't comprehend it, they would sense an eerie sensation as a chill ran down their spine. On the Internet, the discussion was even more intense. "I've noticed that after his studies, Will has completely unleashed his creativity. His thoughts roam freely, beyond the reach of us common folks." "Do they have some personal grudge? Why would he paint Fang Zhao's dog like this?" "I bet you've never seen Will's previous piece, "My Neighbor." I suggest you take a look at how he painted Fang Zhao first. " "Maybe Will was bitten by a dog before and was traumatized, or he wouldn't have painted it so terrifyingly! What a cute little girl painted like a monster!" "This is called art!" "The world of artists is indeed not something that mortals like us can understand." "Neutral comment. After staring at it for five minutes, I still can't grasp what he's trying to convey. Regardless, I sensed an inexplicable awesomeness and a weird feeling." "This belongs to the deeper realm of artwork, requiring careful study." "This painting is not easy to sell, right?" "You could buy it for exorcism purposes." "It's still worth investing in. I have high hopes for Will as an artist. Plus, he's still young." In actuality, after Will's painting was showcased on the school's website, people began approaching him to purchase his artwork. In the end, a collector from Muzhou purchased the piece for a high price, and "My Neighbor's Dog" far exceeded the estimated value by HuangArt. Some people believed this collector from Muzhou collector was overly zealous over Curly Hair. Whenever facing Curly Hair, the Muzhou people seemed to lose their composure. Others thought it was all a publicity stunt, whether for Will himself or for Fang Zhao's dog. The Muzhou people were indeed incomprehensible when dealing with dogs, as if they had lost their sanity. In this regard, Huangzhou TV Station's art and calligraphy channel sent someone to interview the collector. During the interview, the Muzhou collector said, "Many people buy Will's art as an investment Will himself, not his paintings. "I'm different; I see the art and, of course, the dog in the painting. "I have a feeling this painting will be valued at an astronomical price in the future." Little Bear, who was watching the live interview, commented, "Muzhou people indeed have a terrifying intuition when it comes to dogs. Humans truly are peculiar creatures." And so, because of Will's painting "My Neighbor's Dog," Curly Hair also went viral and made the news headlines in Huangzhou. After Nanfeng left, Fang Zhao browsed the news online and said to Curly Hair, "Don't go out for the next few days. Face the wall for another five minutes before you resume your studies. "Your morning test score was only 62. Revise the section about animal protection a couple more times! Can you eat whales?! Corals are off the menu too!" Chapter 450 Moving House Curly Hair spent another two days memorizing everything about marine life conservation. It even used videos and pictures to enhance its memory, going over the content repeatedly. It familiarized itself with creatures from both the Old and New Eras, even memorizing their appearances and habits. To obtain permission to swim freely in the sea as soon as possible, Curly Hair went all out once again. The last time he had done so was to claim his helmet. At last, Curly Hair's score went from just passing to seventy, eighty, then to ninety before ultimately succeeding after strengthening his memory once more. Nanfeng originally thought Curly Hair would feel moody due to being restricted in its activities and unable to go for walks after being reprimanded because of the incident online. But who'd have thought its enthusiasm grew by the day, unaffected by any negative influences?! Fang Zhao had already completed the follow-up work at Huangzhou Institute of Art, and the courses of his studies had all ended. After the rest of the students in the advanced course had completed their final assessment, the academy held a graduation ceremony for the students of HuangArt's Twelve Tones who had successfully completed their studies and issued their certificates. There were no complicated procedures. Most who entered the Twelve Tones were no ordinary students, leaning toward academia. There was no need to add any unnecessary frills. The graduation ceremony took place in HuangArt's most prestigious academic hall. As a family member, Great-Grandfather Fang sat in the audience, watching Fang Zhao on stage. His excitement brought tears to his eyes. His hands trembled as he took a bunch of photos and videos, which he later shared on his social media and the retirement home chat group. Once the ceremony concluded, Great-Grandfather Fang briskly walked up to Fang Zhao. "Let me take a look." Great-Grandfather Fang carefully took the certificate that seemed to emit its own radiance from Fang Zhao's hand and grinned widely, ecstatic. He took several high-resolution photos from different angles before returning the certificate to Fang Zhao. "Keep it safe. Don't let a dog chew it. "There's an old man in our retirement community whose grandson owns a dog. In a moment of carelessness, his newly received graduation certificate was dragged out and torn to pieces by the dog. They couldn't even glue it back together," said Great-Grandfather Fang as he looked at Curly Hair. Curly Hair widened its innocent doggy eyes as if it had suffered a great injustice. Great-Grandfather Fang turned to Fang Zhao. "Sigh, in any case, you must keep it safe." There were only so few who could receive the certificate of the Twelve Tones Advanced Course every year. It was the most prestigious advanced course in the field, and those who were accepted would eventually graduate as masters. It was incredibly precious! At the very least, none in the Yanbei City retirement facility had ever received this certificate. Great-Grandfather Fang was content after attending Fang Zhao's graduation ceremony and taking enough photos. They had spent quite some time in Huangzhou. It was time to return. Before leaving Huangzhou, Great-Grandfather Fang looked at his mild-mannered and gentle great-grandson with a hint of worry, then turned to Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, advising sternly, "You two must ensure Little Zhao's personal safety! I heard that there are many crazy fans these days, and competitors can be quite unscrupulous. My Little Zhao is too good-tempered; he doesn't guard himself against others and is unaware of the wickedness in people's hearts." Yan Biao and Zuo Yu fell silent. Do you remember what happened in the year Fang Zhao served his military service, Great-Grandfather Fang? Do you know how he became a reserve officer? Do you know how he dominates in games? Who knew how thick of a filter Great-Granfather Fang had on to say such words, or perhaps his selective memory declined due to old age? But then again, Fang Zhao indeed appeare much milder now. Could this be the influence of art? Their thoughts aside, Yan Biao and Zuo Yu bite the bullet and promised the elder, "Don't worry, we'll definitely protect him well!" Great-Grandfather Fang took another photo with Fang Zhao and left contentedly. He would visit again when he had the time after Fang Zhao settled into his new home. The phase of academic advancement had temporarily concluded, and the advanced students were about to leave the academy. However, before that, they would each have to give an academic conference presentation at HuangArt. It wasn't something formal or overly serious. The student union had set up a live broadcast channel to allow those who couldn't attend in person to watch online. Fang Zhao didn't keep any secrets. He shared all the experience and skills he had gathered during his year of study. The academic presentations took two hours, but the post-conference interactions and signing event lasted four hours. Many even suggested that Fang Zhao stay at the academy. Considering his current strength and the glory he had obtained, he was more than qualified to become a lecturer in HuangArt. "Sigh, it'd be great if Fang Zhao could stay in HuangArt." Some students sighed. However, not long after, they discovered that although Fang Zhao had left, he would still appear in their exam questions... After completing a year of advanced studies and leaving HuangArt, Fang Zhao returned to Yanzhou to pack up and move. The weather was just right. Fang Zhao moved from the city center of Qi'an City to the seaside. Perhaps smelling the scent of the sea, "rabbit" was exceptionally lively today, moving about in the water tank, its two "ears" always eager to explore outside. Fang Zhao had a large aquarium custom-made and transferred "rabbit" from the small portable water tank to the larger one. "rabbit" crawled around in its new home almost immediately, looking like fluffy cotton candy. However, this cotton candy almost stung two burglars who tired to break in to death. What a perfect disguise. The strikingly colorful weren't the only ones deadly; so, too, were those absolutely adorable. The one most excited about moving to a new home was Curly Hair. Having finally completed its test the day before the move, it ran around bright and early that day, urging Fang Zhao to move. As Curly Hair watched the collection rack being moved into the house intently and made sure none of his gaming helmets were left behind, it suddenly wanted to lock its learning device in the rack, but Fang Zhao took it out. "The learning device is still needed," Fang Zhao said. Curly Hair mewled pitifully and walked out with a drooped tail before perking up again soon after in excitement, eagerly patrolling its new territory. Guided by Zuo Yu. Dogs had a strong sense of territory, claiming territory was in their nature. The new home had a larger territory, and Curly Hair patrolled it happily. It even greeted the other dogs in the residential area while it was at it. From this day on, I'll be staying here! By the time Fang Zhao finished sorting out the items, the sky had turned dark. He asked the guys to head back first and take a two-day break. After the three of them left, Curly Hair, who was lying by the door, trotted over. "I want to swim in the sea," Curly Hair said. "Just swimming?" Fang Zhao asked. "And look for food," said Curly Hair warily as he checked Fang Zhao's expression. "I'm hungry." During their time at HuangArt, Curly Hair had been under significant restrictions. Most of the time, it was in a state of not having enough to eat, and it only managed to sneakily find some food when Fang Zhao took it out. It had indeed been rather famished in the past year. Fang Zhao had long discovered that Curly Hair's appetite had been increasing. The diet was also expanding. It would now sniff anything he had never been interested in as though determining if it was edible. On one trip out, it sniffed the car for a long time, leading Nanfeng to think someone had tampered with the vehicle. He freaked out and immediately sent the car for inspection. In the end, he found that other than some scratches caused by unknown reasons, there was nothing wrong with the car. Later, Fang Zhao asked Curly Hair, who revealed that it was hungry and caught the smell of food. It knew what was edible and what wasn't, and even if it hadn't seen something before, it could distinguish. Previously, it hadn't had the opportunity to fully indulge in eating due to various constraints, but now that they had moved to a new home, it wanted to seize this rare chance. It had been waiting for a while, enduring until Nanfeng and the guys had left before proposing to go out and look for food. Fang Zhao checked the weather forecast, and the next two days were going to be sunny. Since Curly Hair had scored its required marks and could also speedily and accurately answer Fang Zhao's pop quiz, letting it go out for a bit of adventure was fine. However, it was easy to be noticed during the day, especially with residents from nearby communities active along the coastline. Fang Zhao had seen people sailing out to sea on a yacht not far away when they were moving in earlier in the day. It was good for Curly Hair to go out at night. "Sure," Fang Zhao said. "I want to swim further and find something to eat," Curly Hair said. "I'll be back before eight in the morning." It wanted to play for a while longer. Fang Zhao considered it and agreed. "Pay attention to the weather changes and avoid ships. If you sense something off, return immediately." "Yes!" "Remember, don't eat protected animals!" "I won't eat them! I definitely won't!" "And don't eat anything random!" "I won't!" Curly Hair promised. "Off you go." Having received permission, Curly Hair dashed out. Under the cover of the night, it raced into the sea. Chapter 451 Disappeared! Fang Zhao looked at the distant sea and placed the leash on the cabinet at the entryway. This was his first time letting Curly Hair out alone, and he still felt somewhat uneasy. But he couldn't watch over the canine constantly. After an extended period of training, he was willing to give Curly Hair a chance to go out on its own. Based on Curly Hair's performance this time, he would decide what measures to take in the future. Curly Hair's matter was not trivial. Fang Zhao had never relaxed his control over the creature. Without proper guidance, it could very well become a killing weapon in the hands of the wrong people. The weapon itself was innocent; the rightness or wrongness lay with the person wielding it. Fortunately, Curly Hair had its consciousness, perception, and concept—it was a complete life form. Furthermore, Fang Zhao always felt that his rebirth was related to Curly Hair, but he had yet to discover exactly how. Being strict with Curly Hair was both guidance and protection. "Don't go astray." The wind at night had grown stronger, and the waves crashed forcefully against the shore, only to retreat to unseen depths. Everything was filled with the unknown. At the same time, Curly Hair, completely unaware of what Fang Zhao was worried about, was truly like an unleashed wild dog, frolicking in the sea, riding one wave after another. Oxygen? Breathing? Not needed. It swam so freely in the sea after charging into it that it didn't even remember such things existed. Ignoring the need to breathe, water pressure, and light, Curly Hair chased after schools of fish happily. Corals weren't edible, so it licked the stone next to the coral. It wasn't delicious. It also played with a sea turtle upon seeing one. It could even sing. "Lalalala, look at the sea turtle swimming in the water..." As a dog of a music artist, it could sing if it could speak. No one heard it anyway, so there was no worry about being discovered. If Curly Hair sensed someone nearby, it would either dive deep or hide. Though hungry, Curly Hair didn't feast right after entering the sea. Instead, it played for a while. After all, it was allowed to play for a long time this time, and Fang Zhao was not around to supervise it. After chasing sea turtles and schools of fish for a while, Curly Hair spotted a large fish still in the ranks of protected animals in the New Era Ocean. It was the type that could not be eaten, but that didn't stop Curly Hair from being interested in it. I'm only not allowed to eat protected creatures, but no one said I can't play with them! Curly Hair abandoned the fish schools and sea turtles and chased after the large fish. It followed closely behind the fish, occasionally touching it with its paws. I'm not eating, just touching. When the fish sped up, Curly Hair also accelerated. With doggy paddles, it kept up, not considering how its doggy paddles could match the speed of a sailfish. After playing for a while, Curly Hair became even hungrier and decided to eat something first. It wouldn't eat marine creatures that were part of the protected species, not even a fin. Even if Fang Zhao couldn't see, it didn't dare. After all, it was his first adventure; it wasn't courageous enough yet. the first time it had run out, so its courage was not that great. The thought of eating brought to its mind the books Fang Zhao showed it, along with the test questions in the learning device, and the time it spent in self-reflection. But when it came to creatures that weren't protected, Curly Hair didn't hesitate! Time to feast! Amidst its excitement, Curly Hair was actually a bit perplexed. Where should I start? As its first adventure alone in the sea to hunt freely, its first catch should be special. This should be the "sense of ritual" Nanfeng talked about, right? Curly Hair carefully searched for its first prey of the day. Finally, it found one. It looked somewhat similar to a species in the protected animal catalog, but just on the surface. Curly Hair quickly noticed the differences in that fish and swiftly analyzed multiple pieces of evidence, allowing it to answer confidently even if Fang Zhao questioned it later. Once certain the fish wasn't part of the protected species, Curly Hair moved forward with determination. Although the prey wasn't particularly big, not even a meter in length, it was incredibly appealing to Curly Hair. With its target locked in, Curly Hair paddled its doggy legs and swiftly pursued the fish. One in the morning. An anti-terrorism department in Yanzhou was still working diligently. "The nighttime stationed surveillance team hasn't detected any suspicious individuals, and the sonar array hasn't identified any suspicious targets." "Continue to enhance the area's defense and control, maintain vigilance through patrols and nearshore detection. Scrutinize even the slightest abnormal sounds and energy fluctuations—don't let any bird or fish slip through!" They had received intelligence that the notorious "Tomorrow Empire," also known as the "T" organization, would launch an attack on Yanzhou at two in the morning. They knew the general area, but the specific location remained unknown. Moreover, the "T" organization had stolen cutting-edge biomimetic technology. No one knew what kind of modifications those lunatics had made. At the same time, in a secret basement. The dimly lit room was only illuminated by the glow of screens. Seven or eight people were either standing or sitting, all fixated on one particular screen. "Successfully evaded a patrol boat!" one of them exclaimed excitedly, their bloodthirsty eyes sweeping over the area marked with a blood-red "T" on the map next to him. They had devised a new plan, their first operation according to their strategy—a test, to use their newly developed biomimetic torpedoes to strike a harbor located a hundred kilometers from Qi'an City in Yanzhou. Although they only released one biomimetic torpedo this time, the high-energy payload it carried was enough to devastate dozens of cargo ships in that harbor, inflicting a severe impact. Navigating past the patrol boats was within their expectations; it was the subsequent confrontation with the nearshore defenses that was the key. "Approaching smoothly, almost there!" The person holding the controller didn't blink, their gaze fixed on the point of light on the screen. As he was about to enter Yanzhou's coastal defense range, he had to be even more cautious. Simultaneously, they needed to assess whether their new creation could successfully deceive Yanzhou's defense systems. As long as the attack succeeded, the subsequent operations could immediately be set in motion! The people in the basement were all staring intently at the screen. Just as they were about to enter Yanzhou's coastal defense range and while everyone held their breaths in anticipation, the point of light on the screen suddenly disappeared. Everyone in the basement was dumbfounded. For a moment, they all doubted their eyes. The person holding the controller froze for a moment, their expression momentarily stunned. Where's my torpedo?! Looking again, it had indeed disappeared, completely and unexpectedly. The sudden turn of events left the group in the basement feeling uneasy. They had thought of several possible scenarios, but this one right before them was beyond their expectations! They hadn't even done anything before it ended just like that. The psychological impact was too great, making it difficult to accept. "What's going on?" "The biomimetic torpedo has lost contact! No energy response detected! The reason is unknown!" "Impossible! Could it be a display malfunction?" "No, the display and controller are normal, but the torpedo isn't responding!" They had invested immense effort, manpower, and resources, spending a long time orchestrating and developing their current product! And now it vanished without a trace just like that?! "Has Yanzhou's coastal defense become so strong? No... I refuse to believe it! The person holding the controller trembled. His face was twisted, and his bloodshot eyes were filled with unwillingness and madness. He couldn't accept this failure! Another person who had been sitting in the corner said with a sullen face, "Notify the others, cease all actions immediately! Figure out how their coastal defense system intercepted us!" They had spent quite a long time devising this strike against Yanzhou, yet the first step had failed. On the other side, the Yanzhou anti-terrorism department was also puzzled. They waited and waited, past two in the morning, not daring to relax, not daring to be complacent. They continued waiting until seven in the morning. No sign of any activity. The madmen from the "T" organization wouldn't easily call off their operation. Even if they knew their information was leaked, they wouldn't stop. Instead, they would continue their madness in a provocative manner. However, this time, until dawn, they hadn't received any reports of an unknown attack happening anywhere. The land was calm and so was the sea. Theoretically, there shouldn't be any detection blind spots. So why was there no activity? It was strange. Could the information have been incorrect? The night gradually receded, and the clouds brightened. The morning sunlight spread across the sea, dispelling the coolness of the night. Whoosh A dog's head emerged from the water, its nose blowing out a burst of air as if it suddenly remembered that it could still breathe. It broke the surface of the water, moving slightly and inhaling the damp morning air. Slowly, Curly Hair swam toward the beach, its legs causing splashes of water and sand. After coming ashore, it vigorously shook its fur. "Burp..." Chapter 452 Really Don't Have a Big Appetite Though Fang Zhao gave the trio a break, Nanfeng pride himself on being a responsible assistant and a busy man. So he showed up bright and early after texting Fang Zhao and receiving his approval. Many people sought Fang Zhao for collaboration after he graduated from HuangArt. The way they saw it, he could start business activities since his studies had ended. However, Fang Zhao had no intentions of doing any of it. Despite the refusals, most people were not deterred. If they couldn't reach Fang Zhao, they would approach Nanfeng. After all, Nanfeng had previously dabbled in the entertainment industry on Huangzhou and had numerous connections with industry personnel, making it much easier to contact him. Therefore, Nanfeng, who had assumed the title of a "part-time talent manager," was enthusiastic and rushed over with work. After summarizing the tasks at hand, Nanfeng filled Fang Zhao in and then scanned the area, not seeing Curly Hair. Within their small team, aside from Fang Zhao, the boss, Curly Hair, a nearly three-hundred-million-worth dog, was whom Nanfeng was concerned the most. "Where's Curly Hair?" Curly Hair had been consistently excited since moving into the new home. Where in the world is it? Did it play too hard yesterday and fall asleep somewhere today? Fang Zhao checked the time and said, "He went swimming and is back now." Nanfeng opened his mouth. He wanted to say, "You actually let a dog worth nearly three hundred million go play in the sea on its own? Are you crazy?!" But in the end, he held back. After putting down the document in his hand, Nanfeng said, "Boss, I'll go check the beach," and rushed out. Nanfeng had just walked out when he received a call from Yan Biao, inquiring about the situation and whether he and Zuo Yu should come over. While answering the call, Nanfeng looked toward the beach. At this time, Curly Hair had just emerged from the sea, shaking off the water on its body, and running back toward the house. Under the morning sun, Nanfeng thought the gleaming reflection of Curly Hair's fur as it ran carried a metallic luster. "That's our nearly three-hundred-million-worth dog, alright! Even basking in the sun, it gives off a metallic luster!" Nanfeng exclaimed. He took a photo and sent it to their private chat group of three, saying, "Even the footprints on the beach are so cute!" Yan Biao and Zuo Yu were rendered speechless. Nanfeng continued, "I'll turn on the camera for you guys to see. Do you see that? That running figure is sparkling. Our Little Curly really is the cutest dog in this entire district!" "And also the most expensive," Yan Biao added. "Boss, he..." Nanfeng was about to say that their boss lacked common sense, but considering Fang Zhao's keen hearing, he changed his tone, "Boss doesn't have the time to watch over the dog constantly. We have to keep a close eye on it whenever we're here, especially when it goes swimming in the sea. It's too dangerous! " As Nanfeng spoke, he jogged over to Curly Hair. Curly Hair, intercepted by Nanfeng, shook off its damp fur. Burp... Pfff... Curly Hair burped and let out a fart. Nanfeng was excited, regretting that he hadn't captured that scene just now. "I just saw a dog fart for the first time, truly a dog worth nearly 300 million! Regardless of burp or fart, the release is so prolonged. Upon closer sniffing, there's even a hint of gunpowder smell." Yan Biao and Zuo Yu were speechless once more. This guy's brain had been deeply corrupted by money. His mindless bragging is beyond redemption! While Nanfeng continued to creatively brag about how extraordinary Curly Hair was, the canine had already sped past him and dashed back into the house. It checked the time—it was 8:02 AM. Before going out, it told Fang Zhao that it would return before 8:00 AM. It was already two minutes past. Curly Hair needed to defend itself. "I was already ashore before eight o'clock! I just wanted to shake off the water outside before coming in! And! Nanfeng impeded me midway!" Curly Hair wanted to continue explaining but then heard Nanfeng's footsteps. At that, it whimpered a couple of times before falling silent. "Go to the dryer and dry your fur first," Fang Zhao instructed. By the time Curly Hair finished drying its fur, Fang Zhao had already sent Nanfeng away. Fang Zhao checked the gaps between Curly Hair's teeth only to find nothing other than a bit of green, suspected algae residue. "How much did you eat this time?" Fang Zhao asked. "I ate a fish and only ate one! The rest were all snacks," said Curly Hair confidently. It wanted to prove that it didn't have a big appetite. Many times, Curly Hair had heard people say that owning a pet was expensive, especially those that ate a lot and were quickly abandoned. Curly Hair needed to clear its name. It really didn't have a big appetite! "Really? Just one? Are you not hungry?" Fang Zhao asked. He was oh-too-familiar with Curly Hair's appetite. "Really! I'm not hungry!" Curly Hair affirmed. "Did you secretly eat a whale?" "No! I didn't eat a whale! I didn't eat any other protected marine animals, either! Not even a scale! The fish I ate was only a little longer than me. It only looked like a protected animal, but it wasn't. I checked it several times and confirmed it!" Curly Hair hurriedly defended itself. It had to be clarified! It didn't want to face the wall! "What snacks did you have?" Fang Zhao pressed on. "Just two shells, a bit of seaweed on my way back, and some unknown stuff. I only licked them, they weren't tasty at all." "Mhm." Fang Zhao inspected Curly Hair closely. Aside from being a little overexcited, there was no other abnormality. He didn't know if Curly Hair really didn't feel hungry or was just saying so, so he decided to pour him a bowl of dog food. Just as he got up and stepped forward, he heard Curly Hair burp. Fang Zhao stopped in his tracks. After carefully identifying the smell in the air, his expression turned serious. He set the bowl aside, approached Curly Hair, who was stretching lazily, and squatted down to examine it closely. As a thought crossed his mind, Fang Zhao asked, "What did the fish you ate look like? Have you seen it in any of the books?" "It looked a little like one in the "Directory of Marine Wildlife Conservation," Curly Hair replied. Fang Zhao fetched the electronic album and let Curly Hair point it out. "This one! It only looked a little similar, but it definitely wasn't! I can tell!" Curly Hair was a little proud of himself. Fortunately, it made sure to observe during its hunt and even noted the differences between the two fishes. Prompted by Fang Zhao's inquiries, Curly Hair provided a detailed account of its findings. It even pointed out the fish scales one by one, including a faintly discernible "T" shape carved into the belly of the "fish." Curly Hair remembered it all. Fang Zhao took a pen and drew a picture in his notebook according to Curly Hair's description. Comparing the fish's swimming direction on the map and the information he knew, Fang Zhao marked out several routes. After some contemplation, he marked out three of the routes, and among those three, one route led to the harbor a hundred kilometers away from Qi'an City. Looking at the drawn routes and the "T" symbol on the fish's body in the picture, Fang Zhao asked Curly Hair, "How was its taste and texture? Was it hard?" "I don't know," Curly Hair said, looking perplexed. "I swallow everything that's bigger than me whole." Fang Zhao was rendered speechless. What perfect logic. From that perspective, Curly Hair completely followed an instinct similar to that of wild animals—exchanging the least amount of physical energy for the highest energy intake. Why bother nibbling in batches if it could be swallowed whole? It wasn't like it couldn't swallow it, why go through the trouble? There wasn't anyone around to see anyway. Fang Zhao's silence made Curly Hair believe it might have done something wrong. At that, it tentatively defended itself, "Although I don't know what the taste is, I feel that its composition should be more complicated than dog food... "Definitely more complicated than dog food! Should I try biting it into pieces next time and taste it? The books I've read didn't describe the texture of the meat from those protected fish species. Without a control group, I'm not sure if it's special compared to other fish that look similar. "I just felt a bit full after eating it." Fang Zhao shifted his gaze away from the notebook and ruffled Curly Hair's head. "No need, you've done well." Having received praise, Curly Hair felt at ease and wagged his tail happily. "How do you feel now?" Fang Zhao asked. "How do I feel? After eating that fish, I feel stuffed like you guys after eating compressed biscuits." At that, it emphasized, "I really don't have a big appetite!" However, Fang Zhao still felt concerned and performed a simple examination on Curly Hair. After moving to the new house, the equipment used to check Curly Hair's health had also been transferred. The results showed that Curly Hair did not have any injuries, rather healthy. The only anomaly was the blood test results, showing a slight elevation in heavy metal levels. Fortunately, it was only slightly higher than usual. Previously, Curly Hair's blood had contained slightly higher levels of heavy metals compared to other dogs. Now, after ingesting the suspicious fish-like object, there was only this small change. This surprised Fang Zhao. Upon closer inspection, the luster of Curly Hair's fur seemed to have changed a little as well. Even with the grooming Nanfeng had done before, they had never achieved this kind of sheen. Curly Hair's fur wasn't something that ordinary chemical agents could easily change. These were all changes that occurred overnight. To be cautious, Fang Zhao still attached a miniature detector to Curly Hair's legs, so that in case of a crisis, they could promptly learn about Curly Hair's condition. "Don't go into the water for the next two days," Fang Zhao said. "Okay." It had a wonderful time this time and was now feeling a little drowsy from overeating. It planned to stay indoors and watch TV and sleep for the next few days. "Next time you come across another one of those 'fish' that can fill you up when you're out exploring, and you really want to eat it, just swallow it. Don't bite. "Come back and tell me immediately after eating." "Got it!" Curly Hair wagged its tail happily. I'll look for it again when I'm hungry! It sure can feel me up! I'm sure one of these fish can last me at least half a month! This would save Fang Zhao a lot of money! Well, downside, I just keep burping. Chapter 453 "Enemy Attack, Howl!" Having eaten its fill and escaped scolding, satisfied and relieved, Curly Hair, yawned and settled down in its bed for a nap. Fang Zhao had originally planned to take a look around the area today. He had even inquired with the property management about renting a speedboat the day before. With his studies completed and thesis submitted, he intended to relax a bit and spend a few days fishing out at sea while also collecting some fresh seafood for "rabbit." However, what Curly Hair had brought back made Fang Zhao change his plans. Back in his study, Fang Zhao scanned the drawing he had just made in his notebook, divided it into several screens in front of him, and then opened the map of Yanzhou. he outlined a region and placed it alongside the other drawings. The "T" represented the organization known as Tomorrow's Empire, a group that enjoyed launching attacks and longed for another apocalyptic era. Fang Zhao's first encounter with them was during his service on planet Baiji. Then, they crossed paths again later on Whale Island. Fang Zhao, looking at the three marked routes, analyzed the enemy's objectives. As someone who had lived through the Period of Destruction for nearly a century, he was susceptible to many things. Certain influences had penetrated his very soul. Even with a new body and different surroundings, he couldn't erase them, despite living in an era of peace for so long. Curly Hair's belch, which carried a scent of gunpowder, almost instantly triggered Fang Zhao's nerves. In the Period of Destruction, the smell of gunpowder symbolized warfare and bloodshed. Beep... beep... As he was contemplating, the sound of a notification on his personal terminal caught Fang Zhao's attention. He shifted his focus away from the map and checked the alert. It was the miniature detector he had attached to Curly Hair's leg. If there were any anomalies, he would be notified. The popped-up screen displayed a real-time monitoring result chart. An hour ago, the blood's heavy metal content had only slightly exceeded the limits. Now, it was rising rapidly. No, it should be said that it was rapidly changing! Several types of metal content suddenly rose and then plummeted at high speeds. There were even some heavy metal elements present in Curly Hair's body that should not have been there. These metal elements had likely come from what Curly Hair had ingested earlier in the day. People also consume some non-essential elements from their food, but the situation was clearly different. Within less than ten seconds, based on the measurements from the detector, the levels of certain metal elements in Curly Hair's body had dropped from the cautionary level to zero, and then surged to astonishing values that were jaw-dropping! Among all the creatures Fang Zhao knew of, there was no creature that exhibited such changes! For example, according to the real-time readings from the instrument, the levels of several heavy metal elements were at values that would be lethal in a normal human body. The same applied to dogs! Yet Curly Hair hadn't shown any signs of lifelessness. Fang Zhao could even hear its rhythmic snoring s it slept. However, the sudden change in the detector's results was far from normal! Was the detector broken? Fang Zhao quickly approached Curly Hair's bed. He looked at Curly Hair, which was sleeping soundly, snoring. After a moment's pause, he extended his finger and held it in front of Curly Hair's nose, testing its breathing. Curly Hair often snorted when it slept. It wasn't a short-nosed breed, nor was it overly obese. However, it still snored. Fang Zhao had taken it to the vet for a checkup, but nothing unusual had been found. At this moment, as Fluffball snored, its breathing was forceful, not exactly rapid, but the exhaled air's temperature was abnormally high, much higher than what the detector on its leg had measured. As a warm-blooded creature, exhaling air at a temperature more than twice as high as its usual body temperature—was this normal? Fang Zhao patted Curly Hair's head. "Curly Hair?" Curly Hair continued to snore. "Your game console has been stolen," Fang Zhao patted it again. "Howl..." Curly Hair let out a couple of low, struggling howls, licked his nose, and shifted its position before continuing to sleep. It went from lying on its back to its side, its four legs moving as if it was about to start running. After a while, the snoring continued. Fang Zhao's expression became even more serious. He couldn't believe not even 'your game console has been stolen' couldn't even wake it up. It seemed that the situation had escalated beyond imagination. However, he had never encountered nor heard of such a situation before. Fang Zhao didn't know what to do. Should he forcibly wake Curly Hair up or continue observing? He wasn't sure if waking Curly Hair up forcibly under such circumstances would be harmful, so he dared not act rashly. Just as Fang Zhao was thinking about what to do, the alarm from the detector grew more urgent and piercing. On the real-time monitoring chart displayed on his personal terminal, the changes were terrifying. Its heart rate, pulse, blood pressure, and so on—were all rapidly fluctuating. And this was only what the instrument could detect. There were likely many changes occurring beyond the scope of the detector. The screen displaying the monitor chart flickered and distorted as if being pulled by some kind of force. The room's lighting also became unstable, flickering as if it was encountering interference. The appliances that were working one after another started emitting urgent alarm sounds. A ringing noise, resembling tinnitus, triggered intense discomfort. Fortunately, Fang Zhao could tolerate it. If it were anyone else here, they might already be in a state of confusion. A faint chill seemed to spread through the air. Fang Zhao's intuition, cultivated through the chaos of the Period of Destruction, clearly sensed an unknown danger emanating from Curly Hair. He quickly retreated several steps. The data collection from the detector stopped, and the shrill alarm abruptly ceased. The connection between the instrument and his personal terminal was severed. The lights in the room all exploded. Electric sockets crackled with electric currents. A cold glint of metal reflection suddenly appeared. A massive... seemingly... a paw? Moving so fast it was like a mirage, it descended directly. Bang! Dust and debris from the ground were sent flying. The sudden appearance of a powerful gust of wind caused the curtains to flap loudly. The entire three-story building shook. Then, the metallic radiance vanished. The entire incident happened in the blink of an eye, as if an illusion. Fang Zhao looked at the massive paw imprint in front of him, along with the cracks on the floor, and fell into silence. The area covered by the massive paw imprint originally contained a chair. It was a high-priced piece Nanfeng had purchased and gifted to Fang Zhao for his new residence. When Nanfeng bought a chair, he believed that solid wood showcased a higher class; pure solid wood furniture was considered a luxury in the New Era. However, the seller also mentioned that people with dogs at home should opt for more durable furniture, especially when it came to the legs of tables, chairs, and benches, which could be chewed on. That was why Nanfeng chose alloy. It was sturdy enough. However, now, the "sturdy enough" premium alloy chair that the seller bragged about had been flattened into a pancake, embedded deeply into the floor. Aside, Curly Hair, who had been sleeping, seemed to awaken suddenly from a nightmare. It stared with its innocent doggy eyes, looking around the chaos. The floor was cracked open, revealing views of the lower floors. There were even sinister footprints on the ground. Startled, Curly Hair leaped out of its bed, bared its teeth, and let out a loud howl, "Enemy attack! Howl!" Upon seeing Fang Zhao, Curly Hair rushed over quickly, standing by Fang Zhao's side and growling low at the massive paw imprint that had appeared out of nowhere in the room. Its flattened ears, bristling neck fur, deep angry marks on its nose, and exposed sharp teeth all indicated that the dog had entered a battle-ready state. It seemed like a valiant warrior, determined to defend its territory and repel intruders. Its demeanor was extremely fierce. "Awooo!" Fang Zhao was deeply at a loss for words. Chapter 454 Can't Contain It Fang Zhao really intended to take a low-profile break for a while, but things just couldn't come to a halt. The commotion here was too loud, and the security network set up by the property management in the community quickly detected the abnormal activity and called to inquire. "May I ask if you're having trouble over there? Do you need us to send someone to help?" "No need. It's just my dog causing a fuss at home," Fang Zhao said. The property management responded with a smile. Alright, if you say so. I believe you on the surface. The property management didn't press on. As long as it didn't affect the other residents and didn't endanger anyone's life, they wouldn't bother if one tore down their house. Although the spaces between the houses here were a little distant, many had paid attention to the movements of this Yanzhou celebrity since he moved in. Any slight disturbance could be easily noticed. Thus, when Nanfeng and the others received a call from Fang Zhao and rushed over, others had already come to inquire. A middle-aged businessman walking his dog claimed he was just dropping by for a visit. However, his eyes were always assessing and suspicious. Fang Zhao didn't let the person into the house, only saying that it was a little messy inside, and invited him into the yard, where there were tables and chairs. "Your dog made a fuss, huh? Sigh, I get you. Some frustrations can only be understood by those of us who have dogs." The man sighed, seemingly speaking from experience. After talking for a while, the businessman felt he had gathered enough probing information. Further probing wouldn't yield much, so he left with the dog. As he turned around, he shared what he knew with other friends from the same community. "He caused quite a ruckus today and seemed to have broken a lot of things... "I didn't see the dog. I suspect he was beating it... "No, you know that some people are different inside and out. They might seem fine outside, but who knows what they're up to at home? Hehehe... "Well, he'd just come home to release the stress from outside, no? Besides, celebrities like him are normally bad-tempered behind closed doors... "I understand. We all have secrets. If something goes wrong, just blame it on the dog; after all, they can't talk." People living in this area wouldn't easily leak information to the media; they'd just talk privately amongst themselves. Soon, a piece of news started circulating within a certain circle. It was said that Fang Zhao had violent tendencies and was dishonest in private. At the same time, various rumors abounded. They said was attacked by rivals, entangled in romantic disputes, assaulted by terrorists—every kind of story had its place. There were also those who observed from the sidelines, believing they had uncovered the truth. Something happened right after he moved into a new home. Who could Fang Zhao have offended? Fang Zhao was aware of what these people were privately discussing, but he didn't intend to pay any attention. He had Nanfeng repair the house again and deal with the matter quietly. The place that was originally damaged by Curly Hair had conspicuous footprints, so Fang Zhao had to destroy the footprint himself. In doing so, the already cracked floor ended up with a hole. On the second day of moving in, this newly renovated small building had to undergo major changes again. Yan Biao and Zuo Yu were both ashamed. The extent of this destruction was definitely from an ambush! They had failed in their duty as bodyguards! Although Fang Zhao had granted them a break, they had personally supervised and arranged the security facilities inside and outside the house. However, it did nothing at all. Nothing! Alas, it was on them. They had failed their high wages. While the two discussed how to upgrade the house's security system, Nan Feng, with a pale face, poked the pancake chair embedded onto the floor with a trembling hand. What kind of force was needed to crush an alloy chair that was supposed to easily withstand the weight of an elephant into a pancake?! The first floor was fine, but the second floor was a lost cause. It was a mess. Inside the house, half of the newly purchased household appliances were rendered useless,  two-thirds of the lights needed replacement, and the walls needed repainting. Various assassination, vendetta, and crime scenarios flashed through Nanfeng's mind, and he became greatly concerned for Fang Zhao's personal safety. He dared not ask what happened, and judging from Fang Zhao's attitude he seemingly had no intention of revealing it either. So, they could only keep all their doubts to themselves. "Boss, do you want to hire a few more people?" Nanfeng asked. "No need." Fang Zhao had Nanfeng handle the house repair matters, then called Curly Hair, who had been hiding in the corner with his head down, into the study. They had been on the second floor earlier, and luckily the house was sturdy. Otherwise, that hit might have brought the whole thing down. Fortunately, they had moved home. If they were in the previous house, the neighbors downstairs might have encountered some shock. After bringing Curly Hair in, Fang Zhao closed the study door to muffle the sound. Right then, Curly Hair was still reeling in bafflement. It had been in a state of shock from the moment Fang Zhao told it the truth. The shock was far greater than when he first found out that he could sing while playing games. "You really don't remember?" Fang Zhao asked. "I really don't." Curly Hair refused to believe it was the kind of dog that would wreck a house! Fang Zhao nodded and took out a recording. Although all the surveillance cameras in the house were broken, before they were broken, there was a segment of recording from before they malfunctioned—a sort of noise resembling bursts of tinnitus. "Listen." Curly Hair twitched its ears, and gradually, its conviction that it wasn't that kind of dog wavered a bit. "It sounds familiar." Curly Hair said weakly. Fang Zhao quirked a brow. Had something like this happened before? "When was the last time you heard this kind of noise?" Fang Zhao asked. "When you were locked up," Curly Hair said after a moment's ponder. Fang Zhao fell silent. He searched through his memories and believed Curly Hair was probably referring to the time he was isolated. Fang Zhao asked, "On Whale Island?" "Yes!" "What did you do back then?" "I swallowed a person," revealed Curly Hair, rendering Fang Zhao speechless. "But I faked being unconscious right after swallowing him. Nobody noticed!" Good. Very good. "Were there any similar occurrences? Think carefully." This time, Curly Hair recalled for quite a while. "There was another time, I think, but I can't remember when." While Curly Hair couldn't remember, Fang Zhao found a memory from that time. Once, Will had taken Curly Hair to an art exhibition to seek inspiration for his painting. Unexpectedly, an accident occurred, and it was Curly Hair who dragged Will out of the fire. During that incident, the place where the dogs were kept had their cages all cut open, and the surveillance systems went on strike. Even until now, the culprits hadn't been found. As for Curly Hair, it only remembered biting through the cage; it was unaware of the surveillance issue. At that time, Curly Hair didn't possess that awareness. Even now, Curly Hair didn't know that every time it underwent such transformations, it would destroy the surveillance systems. From biting through cages and ruining surveillance, to swallowing a person on Whale Island, and now suddenly manifesting a giant paw that nearly demolished the building. In just a short year, the changes were becoming more pronounced, and Fang Zhao speculated that it was evolving toward a certain form, resembling a kind of evolution. But how long this process would last, no one could tell. What would happen next was also unpredictable. What was even more worrying was that Curly Hair couldn't control these changes on its own. What should he do if another incident like this occurred? He would have to find another place where nobody was around. Fang Zhao recalled the size of the paw that shattered the floorboard. It was only a paw. If the canine completely transformed... The house wouldn't be able to contain it! "How do you feel now?" Fang Zhao asked. "Not much... "Does having an itch on my paw count?" Curly Hair raised one of his front paws. After the floorboards were shattered, Fang Zhao examined the dog paw that had seemingly enlarged and only found some tiny scratches. However, now as he looked at the dog paw again, all the scratches had disappeared, as if the paw had been meticulously maintained. After advising Curly Hair on some precautions, Fang Zhao checked his savings and felt troubled. Sigh, it's so hard to support a household. With a helpless sigh, he beckoned Nanfeng over. Nanfeng was currently pondering how to repair and reinforce the house, thinking that Fang Zhao had summoned him to discuss discreetly repairing the house. He had already thought of several plans. However... "I want to buy an island," Fang Zhao said. Nanfeng was stupefied. Buy what? Boss, calm down! Don't buy an island of all things! The way Nanfeng saw it, there was absolutely no need for Fang Zhao to buy an island. Even many laypeople knew that private islands were depreciating! There was a time in the New Era when buying islands was in vogue. A group of businessmen collectively inflated island prices. Later, due to environmental protection and other factors, some islands were banned from being bought and sold. The number of private islands available for trade was reduced, making island prices even higher. However, with the constant development of extraterrestrial ventures, those with money shifted their focus to investing in outer space. Who would still invest in buying islands? Even small plots of land had been inflated to astronomical prices, especially those obscure, unpopular islands. If anything, they might harbor some apocalyptic virus! What's the point of acquiring one?! With more choices, some things became less valuable. If there were better options, why not choose the better ones? Currently, there were indeed many private islands but they were very difficult to sell. Buying was easy—just have the money ready, and you could complete the transaction immediately. The island owners were quite willing. Nanfeng suppressed his astonishment, cleared his throat, and squeezed out a faint smile as he analyzed the current situation of the island transaction for Fang Zhao. "People say to buy when prices are low, not high. Our native star's island prices have been dropping consistently, and it's tough to resell them... "Some who bought islands during the trend before are just keeping them vacant. They don't even know how many insects and poisonous plants are on the island. It's quite dangerous. Island prices were already high to begin with, and the initial investment costs are high..." Nanfeng rambled on, analyzing the situation for Fang Zhao and trying to persuade him that this investment wasn't worth it. After listening to Nanfeng's analysis, Fang Zhao said, "Curly Hair needs a bigger space for activity." Nanfeng looked at Fang Zhao with a numb expression, unable to detect any hint of a joke in his eyes. Seeing that Fang Zhao had already made up his mind, Nanfeng could only acquiesce. "Alright, I'll create a list and budget." Nanfeng thought to himself, Wonder what Boss has encountered to the point of wanting to avoid the world? At that, he decided he needed to buy an extra insurance policy for himself. He was seriously tempted to ask Fang Zhao if he regretted donating so much money. If he hadn't donated, he could even acquire a group of tradable islands let alone a small one! As Nanfeng mentally grumbled, he searched online for privately-owned islands up for sale, filtering for small islands with suitable spots for building and a landing strip. He estimated that after buying a small island, Fang Zhao's savings would be bottomed out. If it was for any other reason, Nanfeng could understand. But if it was really for the sake of raising a dog, it was... On this day, Nanfeng derived a life lesson from his boss—raising pets makes people poor. Chapter 455 Not Knowing What You Look Like Without a Mirror The islands on this planet were easy to buy, with plenty of choices. Nanfeng selected a few and showed them to Fang Zhao. Fang Zhao picked one of them. The island owner was ecstatic to learn that someone had come to ask for a price. Seeing that more and more people were investing in outer space over the past two years, he was getting anxious and wanted to quickly sell off this island, so he compromised on the price during negotiations. The transaction was swift; they inquired about the price one day and settled it the next. Seeing Fang Zhao complete the procedures so quickly, Nanfeng was helplessly resigned. Fang Zhao isn't fit for investing; he needs a wise investment consultant, he mused. Though it remains a question what happened in the house that day, he doesn't need to hastily buy an island, right? Sigh, Boss should just focus on his art. He'll lose too much in investments. Nanfeng wasn't the only one who thought so. Even the former island owner thought Fang Zhao was foolish. After all, only an idiot would eagerly purchase an island when the planet's island was in a downward price trend. Alas, this guy is still too young, too impulsive. The new island Fang Zhao bought wasn't particularly large, but it was enough for Curly Hair to move around. The location was relatively remote, some distance away from every continent. Even the shape lacked any distinctive features. Moreover, it had no popularity whatsoever. The former owner hadn't lived there for nearly twenty years, merely sending people to clean it a couple of times each year. It was a very primitive island. The calamity of the Period of Destruction swept across the globe; no paradises were untouched. This island had also experienced the catastrophe of the Period of Destruction. Five hundred years had passed, and it had already recovered to its present vitality. The existing buildings on the island were constructed over 50 years ago. There had been two upgrades due to frequent storms, but Fang Zhao hadn't made any major changes. It was fine with him as long as they were sturdy and suitable for habitation. After the security system was set up, Fang Zhao sent the trio back to wait on standby. The sizable island had limited food resources; most supplies were brought in from the outside. Fang Zhao had stocked up on some necessities, and in the future, whenever supplies were running low, he would have Yan Biao and Zuo Yu send them over. After the follow-up copyright fees came in, Fang Zhao bought two more aerospace flying vessels—the type that could only fly within the atmosphere. The wallet that had just 'fattened up' was empty again. Nanfeng and his companions looked at Fang Zhao with a sense of pity. They all wondered if their boss had gone crazy. One of the two newly bought flying vessels was placed on the island, while the other was for the guys to transport goods. "Boss, are you... are you really going to stay here alone?" Zuo Yu asked again, concerned. "Yeah." Fang Zhao replied, appearing much calmer. "Do you really not need more manpower?" Yan Biao asked as well. "No need." "In that case... "Contact us immediately if you need anything, alright, Boss? We'll be on standby." Nanfeng stepped onto the flying vessel, glancing back several times. After seeing the guys depart on the flying vessel, Fang Zhao returned to his house and called out Curly Hair, who had been curled up in his bed the entire time. Now, Curly Hair's mental process had transitioned from "I can't be that kind of dog" to "Should I go out and make money?" It originally thought the 'fish' he swallowed could last him for at least half a month, but who'd have thought it started feeling hungry in less than a week?! Fang Zhao brought out a large bag of dog food, the 50 kilograms kind. "Go ahead and eat. I'll watch you," Fang Zhao said. "Can I just swallow it whole?" "Sure." Curly Hair licked his nose and quickly walked over to the bag of dog food. Then, Fang Zhao saw a colossal mouth suddenly appear. A cold silver metallic light flashed. And the 50 kilograms bag of dog food was gone just like that. Fang Zhao asked, "Are you full?" Curly Hair hesitated for a moment before nodding. "Still... a little hungry." In other words, it wasn't full at all. With that, Fang Zhao brought out another 50-kilogram bag of dog food. "Can you take it slow this time? Slow down your swallowing?" Curly Hair nodded decisively this time, "Slow!' This time, Fang Zhao saw it even more clearly. The head of the dog transformed, while the rest of its body retained the normal form of a dog. The slightly elongated and curly dog fur seemed to retract back into Curly Hair's body at that moment. The morphed form of the dog's head was somewhat vague, like it was composed of some kind of metal, making it difficult to clearly see what it looked like. One could only make out a large mouth with pointed teeth, which opened wide to swallow the 50-kilogram bag of dog food. Effortlessly. It could probably even swallow 100 kilograms without batting an eyelid let alone 50. Fang Zhao watched the scene with contemplation. He thought, the canine could no longer simply be classified as a carbon-based life form. It might have another form. If its usual form was a dog, what would it be after transforming? A metallic dog? A life form composed of unknown metals? The cameras placed in the house had, as expected, malfunctioned. Only parts of the footage were recorded. From the moment the transformation started, the recording had been interfered with. Looking at the other surveillance cameras positioned around the house, those located closer also suffered severe malfunctions. Cameras positioned twenty meters away had fewer issues, but the images captured at that moment also showed distortion. All electronic devices were affected. Fortunately, Fang Zhao had prepared a lot of them when moving. Curly Hair was oblivious to its changes, and since electronic devices wouldn't work, Fang Zhao rummaged through the warehouse before bringing out a fitting mirror the previous island owner left behind. Curly Hair swallowed another mouthful of dog food in front of the mirror, but this time, it almost choked. It stared blankly, dumbfounded. It was almost scared out of its skin by its own reflection in the mirror. Sure enough, one wouldn't know what kind of freak one was without looking in the mirror. The shock it felt was even greater than when it found out it destroyed the house in its dreams. However, no matter how great the shock, hunger would always replace it. After a few changes like this, Curly Hair began to feel exhausted. It seemed that the three bags of dog food it had consumed earlier were already depleted. Hungry. So hungry! Helpless, Curly Hair went to the sea to look for food again This time, there were no other residents around, so Curly Hair didn't need to wait until nightfall. As soon as it received Fang Zhao's permission, it rushed into the sea to look for food. As if a switch had been turned on, Curly Hair's transformation became more frequent in the subsequent period. Sometimes, while it was digging a hole to play, its paw would suddenly enlarge and it dug a crater. Fang Zhao didn't even dare let Curly Hair sleep inside the house. What if it had a dream about chasing thieves and ended up wrecking the place in its excitement?! And accompanying these frequent transformations was a significant demand for energy. Food! Fang Zhao really had no solution for it. He could only let Curly Hair go to the sea to find food itself. He emphasized important points and issues that needed attention to Curly Hair every time. Every day, Curly Hair would go for a swim in the sea and return. Within a week, it had consumed two biomimetic torpedoes near the sea of Yanzhou. However, one biomimetic torpedo was no longer enough to last for half a month. It couldn't even last a week now. With such frequent transformations, Bullet needed to make another trip every two or three days. Curly Hair was quite happy about it, for it could eat to its heart's content and save money at the same time. However, after swallowing the third biomimetic torpedo, it couldn't find any more. Curly Hair had gone to the coastal waters of Yanzhou several times, but he had never encountered it again. Fang Zhao knew the members of the "T" organization might have given up on using the biometric torpedos. That said, he didn't know what their next move would be. The counterterrorism measures in Yanzhou were quite effective. Even if Curly Hair hadn't gone to consume the torpedos, there was a high likelihood they would still be intercepted. With no more torpedos, Curly Hair could only shift its target. This time, it planned to swim a little further. Fang Zhao neither agreed nor objected. He handed Curly Hair a comprehensive test paper he had personally created. It involved responding to various critical situations and emphasized things that had been mentioned many times before. Curly Hair quickly completed the test paper, scoring 93 out of 100. After deducting seven points, Fang Zhao gave Curly Hair some additional lessons before agreeing to let it go. This time, Curly Hair stayed out for a bit longer, only returning after 12 hours. It looked energetic and well-fed. Fang Zhao asked, "What did you eat?" "I ate a big box!" Curly Hair briefly recounted its experience from this trip, summarizing it as follows: After leaving the island, it kept swimming and thought it found something edible and very delicious, so it ate it. Fang Zhao asked about some details. Curly Hair mentioned that it found "food" this time in a sunken submarine in the deep sea. The "food" Curly Hair referred to was inside the submarine, likely some sort of high-energy substance. Out of the eight big boxes, Curly Hair devoured two of them. Due to the distance, and because Curly Hair still couldn't control its transformations, it couldn't bring the boxes from the deep sea to show Fang Zhao. After devouring the first box, Curly Hair felt full. It wanted to bring a box back for Fang Zhao to see, but while carrying it, it ended up swallowing it. It didn't want to devour the third box. With Fang Zhao's reminder, instructions in mind, it didn't dare to forcefully open the box, so it returned to the island. Curly Hair said, "So stuffed." A rare moment of being stuffed. Without diving equipment, Fang Zhao had no way to go and see for himself. He could only guess from Curly Hair's description. This time, the information was insufficient, and nobody knew how long ago the sunken submarine had gone down. Curly Hair didn't recognize it either, so Fang Zhao couldn't sketch it. He could only wait for Curly Hair to provide clues the next time it went searching for food. After Curly Hair ate his fill, the results were obvious. From initially being unable to control the sudden transformations to gradually becoming aware of the feeling of those changes, Curly Hair managed to avoid unnecessary destruction before each transformation. The island also didn't experience sudden appearance of new pits anymore. However, the transformations became more frequent and more intense. To prevent the detection of abnormal energy fluctuations by patrolling aircraft or satellites in outer space, Fang Zhao instructed Bullet to head to the sea whenever it felt a transformation coming on. The land or sea had no effect on Curly Hair. Over the next month, Bullet went out a few more times and devoured the remaining boxes from the sunken submarine in batches. Using the information brought back by Bullet and combining it with gathered clues, Fang Zhao was able to determine that it was the submarine from the "T" organization that had been sunk by the Yanzhou Navy a hundred years ago. There were also rumors that there were at least eight tons of Grade A energy ores on that sunken submarine. Many had attempted salvage operations, not for the submarine itself, but for the eight tons of Grade A energy ores inside. However, all attempts had been in vain. The area was prone to being engulfed by underwater currents, attacked by deep-sea creatures, and it was said to have abnormal magnetic fields. Communication could easily be interrupted, and underwater vehicles often malfunctioned. It wasn't worth pursuing an unverified rumor. Gradually, people forgot about the sunken submarine and the legendary eight tons of Grade A energy ores. As Fang Zhao looked at the reasons behind Yanzhou Navy's sudden deployment back then, he fell silent. His mood was complicated. Chapter 456 This Little Island Has Poor Signal Curly Hair didn't have such complicated thoughts at all. After devouring all eight boxes, it persistently searched a few more rounds but didn't find those kinds of boxes again. Fang Zhao advised against casually consuming the underwater creatures there; scaring them away was enough, no need to eat them. So, it could only take a few more bites of the submarine wreckage, especially the energy compartments. Above the sunken submarine, three fully equipped submersible vehicles cautiously approached the demonized oceanic trench area. As they got closer and closer to the legendary dangerous abyss, they did encounter a few instances of disrupted communication. Fortunately, they did not encounter strong underwater currents during their dive. The extreme underwater environment imposed some limitations on the submersibles, creating a profoundly uncomfortable sense of oppression and fear of the unknown world beneath. Despite humanity's advancement into space and other planets, the complete dominion of the ocean had not been achieved. Many parts of the deep sea remained off-limits. "Approaching smoothly... Yes, if the obtained map is correct, we should be reaching the target point soon." "No signs of danger yet. It seems like our luck is holding today." They never expected success on their first attempt. This was an exploratory operation. Who would willingly venture into this perilous area if not forced by circumstances?! What was strange was that the three biometric torpedoes that they had launched had seemingly suddenly disappeared from this world. The three failed attempts deepened their wariness of the defense in the waters near Yanzhou. This interception was truly terrifying, to the extent that it sent shivers down their spines! Not even a sound was heard! It was so astonishing that the members of the "T" organization in other regions immediately halted their plans to launch biometric torpedoes and started investigating this interception technique. They had reason to suspect that the biometric technology stolen from the military had bug or was intentionally implanted with a flaw by the military before being stolen. In their pursuit of the biometric technology, they lost a lot of people and exposed several strongholds. Now it seemed that this was a complex conspiracy aimed directly at them! Indeed, cunning! Now on their end, they had to change their original plans as well. The higher-ups of the organization were already very dissatisfied with their branch in Yanzhou. If they did not do some meritorious deeds, they would not be able to survive in the organization. The consequences would be disastrous. Either they had to stage an attack or find another way to prove themselves. After losing three precious biometric torpedoes, they faced a temporary suspension of most of their funding support from above. They had to retrieve all the biometric torpedos and halt their original plans. It seemed like they were being left out to dry for a while. The head of the Yanzhou branch of the "T" organization was becoming increasingly anxious. He had initially considered just causing an attack in a densely populated area, like certain less-strictly guarded malls in Yanzhou. However, he was concerned about disrupting the organization's other plans. Recently, the organization appeared to be active again, but they weren't getting any information on their end. The actions of the different branches were kept separate, and they couldn't gather precise information. Moreover, the Yanzhou military was keeping a close eye on them. They would probably be intercepted before they even got close to the mall. With no other options, the only way to prove themselves was by finding alternative routes, like through resources. After much contemplation, he set gus sights on the submarine that had been sunken for over a hundred years. He had a senior who was in charge of transporting energy ore in that sunken submarine. Unfortunately, they encountered the Yanzhou Navy back then and couldn't escape successfully. In the end, they were sunk along with the submarine, and no one from inside the submersible survived. Eight tons of Grade A energy ore sank to the bottom of the sea. Eight tons! Imagine the time it took to accumulate eight tons of Grade A energy ore! All of it d*mn well sunk! That incident also dealt a tremendous blow to the organization, leaving it in a slump for a long time and causing it to become much more discreet, entering a period of recovery and rejuvenation. After that, the organization never transported more than two tons of ore at a time again, and the Grade A energy ores were distributed during transportation to avoid repeating past mistakes. Those responsible for transportation back then had their share of misfortune. The well-planned energy mineral transport was unexpectedly met with a sudden naval exercise by the Yanzhou Navy. It was said to be due to the anniversary of the passing of some prominent figure from the Yanzhou Period of Destruction. They had received no prior information, and it was all so sudden that they were caught off guard. F*ck the Yanzhou Navy! What was the name of that prominent figure from the Period of Destruction again? His surname seemed to be Fang? Bah, whatever. He was dead now anyway. It was said that the organization had planned numerous times to bomb the cemetery of martyrs but had failed every time due to the resilience of the cemetery's guards. Since that "eight tons" blow a century ago, every head of the "T" organization's Yanzhou branch had received a task: whenever an opportunity arose, they had to bomb the graves in the Yanzhou Martyrs' Cemetery, especially the grave of that "Fang." In a secret basement somewhere, the head of the "T" organization's Yanzhou branch commanded the salvage operation with a gloomy expression. If he had any other choice, he wouldn't be focusing on this submarine that had sunk into the trench for a hundred years. Although the discovery of more energy ores had lowered the price of Grade A energy ores slightly, they were still worth around 14 billion Fortunately, communication technology had improved rapidly. Although the salvage operation had been interrupted a few times so far, it was generally going well. As they approached the target and encountered neither deep-sea currents nor attacks from deep-sea creatures, it seemed like fate was on their side. "Stay alert and beware of attacks from deep-sea behemoths." "Understood! But Boss, is there really a legendary sea monster here?" One of the people in the submersible asked. "I don't know." "This area we're approaching is incredibly quiet. "Maybe at this depth, there's originally no fish, let alone deep-sea monsters. It's just stagnant water. "Those documentaries probably only captured shadows. We can't be sure if they're the legendary abyssal monsters. There are even rumors that the production crew fabricated the scenes." That said, deep down, they still believed in the presence of deep-sea monsters. The three individuals executing the salvage mission in the submersibles became more vigilant. "Found it! There is indeed a sunken submarine there!" After being underwater for a century, the submarine's original appearance was hard to discern. "Find the ore first!" An anxious voice came through the communicator. "Yes, Boss!" The individuals inside the three submersibles felt excitement rise within them. Eight tons of Grade A ore, worth over 14 billion! They could finally make a fortune after this operation! Three submersibles, with one executing the task and the other two providing protection. However... "Boss, we haven't detected any ores." "The boxes containing the ores are made of special materials. It is very difficult to detect. Get closer and look for any of those boxes. "The eight tons of ores should be divided into eight or more boxes." After a while, the submersible executing the task reported. "Boss, the submarine is severely damaged, reduced to debris, and the parts that have been cut off are uneven... It looks like it's been gnawed on by a dog." "This joke isn't funny." The voice on the communicator was cold. It was obvious that he was not in a good mood. "Boss, I took a closer look, and they really look like bite marks. There really is an abyssal monster!" The people inside the submersible shivered with fear. If it could bite a submarine like this, biting them would be just as easy, right? Honestly, they'd rather go bomb graves in Yanzhou than become fish food here. "Find the boxes!" a stern voice commanded through the communicator. "Yes!" In the end, the "eight tons of Grade A ores" triumphed over their fear of the "deep-sea monster." However... "Boss, no boxes found! It's empty here. A huge section of the submarine is missing! The energy chamber is gone too! Looking at the cuts... they look fresh." Heavy breathing came through the communicator. Probably pretty exasperated. It just felt like nothing was going their way lately. "Keep looking! Search the vicinity! See if there's... "Zt...a drop... "Zzt zzt..." "Boss, what did you say? I can't hear you clearly!" The connection was cut off. However, they did not panic. They had encountered communication breakdowns a few times during deep dives. It would be back in a moment. However, as they waited and waited, communication didn't return, and the control systems of the submersibles vehicle seemed to be malfunctioning, and the problems were increasing. This time, the people in the three submersible vehicles panicked. "Retreat! Retreat quickly! Get back to shallower waters!" The submersibles were becoming increasingly uncontrollable, and their operation becoming sluggish. As they started to ascend a little, the control panels of the submersibles suddenly went dead, completely malfunctioning. A sound like ringing in the ears echoed, and their consciousness began to blur. On the other side, Fang Zhao was talking to Nanfeng. Nanfeng was reporting recent events to Fang Zhao. He had received numerous invitations—for variety shows, news interviews, and collaboration offers—and Fang Zhao had to decide which ones to accept. Ever since Fang Zhao moved to the island, Nanfeng's responsibilities had grown heavier. However, there was no complaint from him; he was actually quite happy. Fang Zhao had given him another raise, but that wasn't the most important part. What mattered was that Nanfeng could network with more people, which would be beneficial for his future career path. "So, I'll turn down the variety show and only accept  an interview program from Yanzhou TV station, along with a collaboration...zzt zzt..." Nanfeng hadn't finished speaking when he heard the sound of static. In a moment, the communication was completely lost. Nanfeng said to Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, "What did I tell you? Remote and dilapidated islands like this one have poor signal reception. It is always unstable." The trio grew worried after losing contact with Fang Zhao and intended to head over to check the situation. However, they received an alert from the Yanzhou coast monitoring station, warning of a minor earthquake near a certain trench and reporting a severe magnetic anomaly. They advised people to avoid the area if possible and to wait until everything was back to normal before heading out to sea. There was nothing they could do but only sit and wait. A minor earthquake might not be a big deal, but a magnetic anomaly was troublesome. Who knew if the anomaly would worsen, and what if all control systems malfunctioned halfway through a flight? "Sigh, why did Boss move to a rundown little island when the city is so good?" Meanwhile, on the small island. After the communication was cut off, Fang Zhao noticed that all the screens were flickering with familiar patterns. At that, he went out of the house and looked toward the sea. Changes were happening right at that moment. Chapter 457 Dogs, Too, Need to Have a Goal The interference lasted for nearly two hours before it disappeared. Fang Zhao received a call from Nanfeng and the others and reported that he was safe, but he did not let Nanfeng and the other two come over right now. After the call, Fang Zhao did not return to his room immediately. Instead, he sat on a rock by the shore and checked the online reports about the abnormal magnetic force at the sea. There were no casualties for the time being. Due to the fact that there was basically no activity in the area with the strongest magnetic force, and the earthquake's intensity had been relatively mild, the people basically stopped paying attention to the news after seeing it. After browsing through the news for a while, Fang Zhao heard that something was approaching at an extremely fast speed underwater. He did not dodge. Instead, he got up and looked over. Splash! A dog rushed ashore from the sea. It was too fast, or perhaps it was too excited that it lost its footing and fell to the ground. It rolled for a long time before stopping. Flinging away the water and gravel on his body, Curls trotted over to Fang Zhao, looking rather excited as it happily wagged its tail. Fang Zhao didn't find any scars on Curls. He rubbed the dog head and asked, "Are you full?" "I'm full, woof!" That "woof" was imposing with a hint of pride. "What happened? You caused quite a stir this time." Fang Zhao showed Curls a few pieces of news regarding this incident. Looking at the news, Curls immediately felt somewhat guilty. However, it relaxed when it realized that nothing serious had happened. "Can you transform now?" Fang Zhao asked. "Yes!" Curls regained its confidence. Fang Zhao didn't let Curls transform here. Although there was no one else on the island, the satellites were probably keeping an eye on him because of the magnetic anomaly this time. He had to be careful. "Go into the sea." Fang Zhao changed into his diving suit, put on his equipment, and swam off into the distance. Firstly, it was to prevent being detected by the satellites. Secondly, it was to prevent the electronic settings on the island from being affected. The inventory was already insufficient. When he was a distance away from the island and dived into the water, Fang Zhao had Curls transform. Sunlight shone through the surface of the sea and into the water. One could see some floating objects in the sea. Fish of different sizes were moving their fins leisurely. Suddenly, there was a wave of movement, and the fish swam off in panic. A huge creature carrying the sharpness and coldness of metal suddenly appeared under the sea. The sunlight that passed through the seawater shone on it, reflecting a dim blue light. The light and shadow that changed along with the flow of the seawater added a hint of mystery. The two ears, four limbs, a tail, and sharp teeth it had were barely enough to make it look like a dog. Fang Zhao was not even as tall as its legs were long. Judging from the size of that dog's mouth, it could easily swallow a person. Fang Zhao looked at this unfamiliar appearance in front of him in surprise. He could not imagine how Curls could transform from a carbon-based life form that looked like a pet puppy into a new type of creature that seemed to be made entirely of metal. In the instant that it transformed, he even heard a high-frequency sound similar to a machine speeding operation. Fang Zhao waited for this new form to stabilize before he turned on the underwater communication device. "Impressive. "But can't you get smaller?" "I...don't think so?" Curls cocked his head and thought for a while. "I can't do it now. Maybe in the future? "I can control my transformation now! It's just that I can't maintain it for a long time." As it spoke, it emphasized, "In the future, I won't have to eat a lot if I don't transform into this form!" In Curls' opinion, it wouldn't get hungry so easily if it didn't transform into this big form. This way, he would be able to save on its food! Curls quickly returned to its puppy form and happily started digging around Fang Zhao. It believed that it had finally solved a big problem and no longer had to worry about it. Fang Zhao still had a lot of questions to ask Curls, but this was not a place to have a detailed discussion. After returning to the shore and entering the house, Curls told Fang Zhao everything that had happened. "There were no more boxes to eat. After gnawing on the submarine, I searched along the trench and smelled the scent of food in a deeper place. I dug it out and ate it." "Food? What did it look like?" Fang Zhao asked. "It's a stone. It's white, round, and as big as a soccer ball." Curls couldn't describe it any better than that. He hadn't paid much attention back then. He had been so hungry, he ate it as soon as he dug it out. Fang Zhao guessed that Curls was talking about a new type of energy ore. It was very likely that it contained even more energy than a Grade A energy ore. The stone in the trench was either originally from this planet, or it was a rock that fell from the sky. During the Period of Destruction, many meteorites and energy ores fell. Fang Zhao was inclined to believe that they fall from outside the planet. However, now that the stone had been swallowed by Curls, it was indeed difficult to confirm its origins. It was fine as long as he was sure that the stone was beneficial to Curls. "Are there any other stones in the trench?" Fang Zhao asked. "No! There's only one." Curls still felt regretful. If there were more of these stones, he wouldn't need to spend money to buy dog food. He could play in two different forms every day. Unfortunately, there weren't many things that kept him full in one bite. Fang Zhao didn't keep asking about this. Instead, he asked about the reason for the abnormal magnetic force and earthquake. Curls gingerly glanced at Fang Zhao and lowered his head slightly as he defended himself. "I can't hold it in anymore after eating too much." After gnawing on the submarine's energy compartment and swallowing a rock that was suspected to be a high-grade energy ore, Curls suddenly realized that it was about to transform again. It then found a place to hide and quietly wait for this period to pass. "I also didn't expect that I would be able to complete the transformation this time. I checked that there was no one around, and there weren't many fish in the trench. I even intended to control it. I didn't want to make any noise." As if thinking of something, Curl wagged its tail with its eyes alit. It tried to take credit for a discovery it made. "After my transformation period passed, I discovered that there were three submersible vehicles not far away. There were people on both sides and signs of life. I gave them all to the nearest naval vessel! "They didn't notice me when I secretly pushed the submersible over!" It just so happened that the account Fang Zhao was paying attention to had a new news advertisement. Fang Zhao clicked on it and looked. On the surface, it was said that the Yanzhou naval patrol team had discovered three submersible vehicles and had confirmed the identity of the people inside. They were all members of T-Organization. The positioning information on the submersible vehicle was precisely the middle of the earthquake and the abnormal magnetic force. The masses also suspected that the abnormal incident on the sea this time was caused by T-Organization. One could imagine how badly T-Organization had been scolded. Fang Zhao looked at Curls, who was squatting there without knowing anything and scratching the itch with its hind legs. After a long while, he complimented, "You handled this matter really well!" Curls immediately perked up and wagged its tail as it came over to ask for praise. Its eyes were filled with hope as it gazed at Fang Zhao. "Then, can I...have...a...game console?" "Sure." Actually, Fang Zhao had prepared some things beforehand. He went on and took out two boxes from the warehouse. The first box contained a gaming helmet. Curls looked at the brand-new gaming helmet that Fang Zhao had taken out and its eyes widened. A real gaming helmet! It was not a deceptive-looking learning console! Fang Zhao opened the second box, which was smaller than the first. Inside was a personal terminal that looked like a pocket watch adorned with puppy patterns. Curls shifted its attention away from the game console and stuck to this new personal terminal. This was the terminal that it had been thinking about for a long time! Curls then licked his nose and wagged his tail in an attempt to curry favor. "Which one do you want? You can only choose one," Fang Zhao mentioned. Curls scanned the gaming helmet and personal terminal with great difficulty, whimpering in a low voice as if it was in a difficult situation. "Actually," Fang Zhao added, "there is another problem." Curls' innocent, clear eyes widened as it pitifully looked at Fang Zhao. "No matter which one, you won't be able to use it long even if I give it to you," Fang Zhao said. "Nu-uh!" Curls was very strict with its things. Even if it wanted to avoid the learning console, it would put the console into the collection rack for Fang Zhao to help him keep it well. Fang Zhao began to lay out the evidence from the time Curls dismantled the building board to the data collected from the recent magnetic anomaly. "Every time you change your shape, you will interfere with electronic equipment. In severe cases, it renders them unusable." Faced with the evidence, Curls dispiritedly stopped talking. "However," Fang Zhao continued, "I see that you have improved a lot during this period of time. From the beginning, you were unable to control the changes in your body. Now, you can control your entire body to complete the transformation. I believe that you will soon be able to transform without affecting electronic equipment." After hearing what Fang Zhao said, Curls regained its confidence again. Fang Zhao gave him time to make a choice, provided that he could control his influence on electronic equipment. Curls quickly entered a new training period. Dogs, too, needed a goal. Only with a goal would they have motivation and direction. Otherwise, Curls would only think about what it would eat today, tomorrow, the future, and what it would eat. It would sleep after eating, and play games when it woke up. Fang Zhao tidied up the warehouse for it to barely accommodate Curls' transformation. Even if Curls accidentally grew big, it wouldn't break the house. Every day, Curls practiced eating canned food, fruits, bones, and so on. Every time he swallowed one, he would try his best to control itself and reduce interference. There might be some changes in its head, now that its control over its body had increased, but the interference it released was not as great as before. It would not directly destroy the electronic equipment that was close to it. That fitting mirror was placed back into the warehouse by Fang Zhao. Curls would occasionally look at itself in the mirror to check out its new form. Only by looking in the mirror would it know what it looked like. After dealing with Curls, Fang Zhao contacted Nanfeng and the others to replenish his supplies. Although there were many fish in the sea and there might be energy ores at the bottom of the sea, there were still more supplies to be prepared. After receiving Fang Zhao's order, Nanfeng and the other two were full of doubts. This time, Fang Zhao had too many things to add. The canned dog food didn't bother them, as they knew the dog food was for Curls. However, there were tons of fruits, meats, and compressed biscuits. How was Fang Zhao going to finish it all since he was the only one on the island? Nanfeng looked at the shopping list and informed Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, "I suspect that Boss is secretly rearing a shark. "Or could it be some kind of fish? Just look at the number of goods this time. He might be rearing more than one." Chapter 458 A Good Dog Is One That Brings Bones to Its Master The boss had a secret, but Nanfeng and the others didn't dare to dig deeper. They didn't want to lose their jobs. When Nanfeng and the others sent the supplies over, Curls wasn't training in the warehouse anymore. Instead, it was lying chest-down on the couch, watching TV. After taking inventory of the goods, Nanfeng turned around and smiled. "Oh my, Curls is watching TV again!" After finishing his job, Nanfeng stretched and ran over to sit on the couch to watch TV with Curls. A program about dogs was playing, and a dog owner was proudly showing off his dog. "There are dogs and land. One look and I can tell that they are from Muzhou," Nanfeng commented as he drank water. "Hey, look at that shepherd dog inside. It even brings gifts to its owner! Look at how happy the owner is smiling! Curls, let me tell you. A good dog is one that brings bones to its master. When are you going to give your owner a bone? Your owner will definitely be elated!" Nanfeng was just saying it casually. He knew that Curls' IQ was similar to that of a child. As the latter could understand some simple words and orders, Nanfeng would only tease it without taking what he himself said to heart. On the other hand, Curls' ears twitched as Curls glanced between Nanfeng and the program on TV. It seemed to be thinking about something as it sprawled on the couch. "Boss, the goods are all packed. The e-checklist has been sent to you. Please check it," Zuo Yu informed Fang Zhao. "Thank you for your hard work." "Do you want to send a domestic robot over next time? It can talk to you while doing chores." Yan Biao suggested. "Not for now." Fang Zhao shook his head. He didn't want to have too much electronic equipment before Curls could completely control its interference ability. After a while, Nanfeng and the other two left. Curls, who was lying on the couch, immediately jumped up and loudly informed Fang Zhao, "I'm going out for a bit!" Fang Zhao asked, "Are you going somewhere far?" "It's not far. I'm going to swim near the island for a while." Curls looked left and right, but he did not look Fang Zhao in the eye. Fang Zhao's eyebrows twitched. From the look of it, he knew that this dog had other intentions. However, he still said, "Go ahead." "Woof! I'll be back soon!" After saying that, Curls ran off. Fang Zhao originally wanted to go over and see what this dog was up to when he received a call. It was Mo Lang. After graduating from the Huanyi Advanced Course, the communication between Fang Zhao and Mo Lang never ceased; they remained in frequent contact. Fang Zhao went back to his room to answer the phone. The outdoor wind was a little strong, and there was too much noise. Mo Lang first asked if Fang Zhao had encountered any trouble and if the previous magnetic anomaly was affected. He told Fang Zhao to hire more people. The Yanzhou Navy had just caught a few terrorists on the sea. Mo Lang was worried about Fang Zhao's safety. Of course, when Mo Lang made the call this time, it was not only out of concern for Fang Zhao's safety after seeing the news but also to deliver an important piece of information to him. "There is a very important performance. The invited people are all famous musicians. The organizer has also taken a fancy to you. Do you want to go?" Hearing Mo Lang's words, Fang Zhao remembered that a judge had mentioned that there was a very important performance at the graduation concert. It was likely that it was still the kind that could not be publicly announced. "Who is the organizer?" "The military. The venue of the performance is quite far." "Count me in." Mo Lang smiled, satisfied with Fang Zhao's reply. "This kind of performance will be good for you in the future. "Someone will contact you within a week. If you have any questions, you can ask them directly. "You still have nearly a month to arrange matters on this planet." "Got it." One month should be enough. From Mo Lang's words, the location of the performance was on an alien planet. The specific planet was not known to Fang Zhao at the moment. However, one thing was certain: if he decided to attend the performance, it wouldn't be just for a few days. He wouldn't feel at ease if he didn't watch over Curls. It was also risky if he took Curls with him to the performance. Fang Zhao can only observe Curls' behavior in the coming period. If Curls could control it and not interfere with the electronic equipment, Fang Zhao would bring it to the performance. Of course, only if the organizers allowed him to bring a dog. Even if he couldn't, Curls wouldn't easily be exposed as long as it could master its control. With the stimulation from the game helmet and personal terminal, Curls' improvement in the past few days was very obvious. It could already reduce the scope of interference in the warehouse. In places outside the warehouse, the electronic equipment received very little or almost no interference. After talking to Mo Lang for a while, Fang Zhao looked at the time after the call was over. His call with Mo Lang had lasted for more than half an hour. Curls had yet to return. "Curls?" Fang Zhao walked out of the house and called out a few times. He did not hear any response. He listened carefully again. There was a sound coming from the rock stratum near the island. It sounded like a hole was being dug. Fang Zhao did not call it again. He opened an electronic book and read it while sitting on the shore. What he was watching was "Su Mu's Book of Dogs," a legendary work that had been acclaimed by the people of Muzhou. It was written by an old comrade he had met in the Period of Destruction. As the leader of the Muzhou battlefield, Su Mu had considerable influence. His remarks and stories were collected by the people of Muzhou and compiled into books. "Su Mu's Book of Dogs" was a book where Su Mu talked about how to raise dogs. Of course, only part of this was what Su Mu had said, whereas the rest were all analyzed and elaborated by the later generations. The people of Muzhou loved dogs a lot because they were influenced by their ancestors. However, he truly deserved the title of the number one dog whisperer in the Period of Destruction's battlefields. The things mentioned in rhe book were quite reasonable. Fang Zhao felt that he had to learn more from this old comrade who had rich experience in raising dogs. Even if Curls became a mechanical dog, it was still a dog. What was inside remained unchanged. Just as he was reading the book, Fang Zhao heard Curls come ashore. Curls walked out of the sea, not caring about the water on its body as it ran over with a bone that was much bigger than its head. When Fang Zhao saw that bone, his eyelids twitched. Probably afraid of breaking that bone, Curls was especially careful when it came over. In a position similar to a sea lion, it slowed down and cantered over with a bone five or six times bigger than itself. Only when Curls arrived in front of Fang Zhao did it put down the broken bone. There were bite marks and cracks on the bone. As a dog that could easily bite off a submarine, this was the result of Curls trying its best to control itself. After putting down the bone, Curls relaxed a lot. It shook its body to shake off the seawater on its coat. "This bone is too soft! It broke with just a touch! It grew in the rocks, but it's way softer than the rocks! When I was digging under the sea to play last time, I saw bones in the rocks, but they weren't delicious. They weren't filling at all. "But this is big enough! It's huge!" Curls wagged its tail at Fang Zhao, looking like he was asking for praise. The bone it had brought back were much bigger than those from the Muzhou dogs it saw on TV! "Amazing!" After Fang Zhao stroked its head, he picked up the broken bone in front of him. This bone was not a whole bone as it had been broken by Curls. There were also some granule-like crystals on the broken surface. Some parts of the bones were still attached to stones. Curls wasn't particularly meticulous when digging out the bone. Some blood vessel-like lines could be seen on the bone. Fossils! Some kind of bone fossils that lived tens of millions of years, even hundreds of millions of years ago! The disaster of the Period of Destruction and the war that lasted for hundreds of years had destroyed too many things. Survival was the utmost priority. Everything else was left behind. Anything could become a sacrifice for the war of survival in a hundred years. After the end of the Period of Destruction, people of the New Era gradually became intrigued once again by the ancient prehistoric giants. They resumed their efforts in excavation, often only unearthing fragments. Finding complete skeletons that would become the prized possessions of museums was a rare achievement that they could boast about for many years. Instead of real bone fossils, the giant skeletons released from the museums in various places were mostly made through the records of the materials from the Old Era and were created using technology. According to fossil trading records spanning nearly two decades, a tooth from a carnivorous dinosaur that lived seventy million years ago could be worth as much as a room more than a hundred square meters in the heart of Qi'an City in Yanzhou! "Curl, you've got your food sorted." Chapter 459 His Way of Dominating the Headlines Sure Is Different Curls didn't quite understand what Fang Zhao meant. It really thought that the bone was not tasty or filling at all. However, it could tell that Fang Zhao liked this "gift" very much. Just as it was waiting for Fang Zhao to continue praising it, it heard Fang Zhao say, "Curls, if you can control the electronic equipment one meter away during the transformation within a week, I can give you both the terminal and gaming helmet." Curls was stunned by this pleasant surprise. It then jumped and wagged its tail vigorously as it confirmed with Fang Zhao. "Really?" "Yes. The one-week starts now." Curls immediately ran off to the warehouse to practice. Fang Zhao put away the bone fossil that Curls brought back and put on his diving suit. After he entered the sea, he arrived at the place where Curls dug the hole. The seawater near the island was not too deep. There were many traces of dog digging. Ever since he had moved here, Curls would often dig underwater to play around. The hole that Curls dug was tiny, and only Curls could enter the hole. Instead of using tools to dig, Fang Zhao took out a small energy wave transmitter. Without a professional detector, Fang Zhao could only rely on his hearing to determine the general situation inside the rock formation. While he listened carefully to the changes in the sound waves inside the rock formation, Fang Zhao's brain was like a layer of analytical apparatus, describing the general situation inside the rock formation. There were many interferences inside the rock formation, but Fang Zhao already had a rough understanding of the situation. After returning to the shore, Fang Zhao marked a few places on the ground and brought the digging tools. Of course, he didn't intend to dig out the remains of the giant beast that had been buried in the ground using his limited tools by himself. He just wanted to do some processing first, divert the attention of others, and cover up the "abnormal" traces of Curls in the process of digging the fossils. This was Fang Zhao's task in the next few days. The good thing was that the giant beasts buried below were large enough. Some of them could directly dig on the island, even though he had to do a deeper digging. As for Curls, it was improving rapidly with the double stimulation of the game console and his personal terminal. In less than a week, five days to be precise, it reduced the range of interference to one meter. It impatiently trotted to Fang Zhao to ask for rewards. Game console! Personal terminal! It had been waiting for too long! It was great that Curls didn't have to choose between the two options. Fang Zhao didn't lie to Curls. After checking that Curls had indeed met the requirements, he gave it the game helmet and terminal. He also especially changed the terminal that looked like a pocket watch to a dog collar and put it on Curls' neck. "You can use these two things anytime, but don't get too close to them when you transform. "Remember to take off your terminal before you change." Fang Zhao helped Curls put on the dog collar with the terminal. "Howl!" Curls replied. Even without Fang Zhao saying this, Curls would always keep an eye out. This was a reward that it went through a lot to get! How could Curls not protect the first game console and terminal that belonged to him properly? After putting on this special collar, Curls ran to the mirror in the warehouse and looked at the mirror for nearly two hours. Curls was familiar with the game helmet. This was his first time with a terminal, but the item's operation was simple. It could remember the functions after reading through the electronic instructions that Fang Zhao wrote. In the future, Curls would not even need to run to Fang Zhao. It could speak directly through the terminal. When Curls ran off to the warehouse to look at the mirror, Fang Zhao read "Terminal: User Manual for Children" again and deleted it. But this time, Curls only needed five days to reduce the range of interference to a meter. It was indeed beyond his expectations. It seemed that Curls' control over its abilities had become stronger. Fang Zhou would have to raise the bar in the future. After settling Curls' matters, Fang Zhao contacted Nanfeng and the other two and directly made a voice call to the group. After receiving Fang Zhao's group chat notification, Nanfeng and the other two did not dare wait a second longer. They immediately put down the matter and went online to wait for the boss' orders. Since Fang Zhao usually contacted them once a week, and only five days had passed, the three of them guessed that the things on the island had finished. But that wasn't possible. They had sent over so many things last time that the items were enough for him to consume for a month. They started to wonder if something had happened. And yet, Fang Zhao didn't look like he was in a hurry. Or was he finally going to reveal his secret to them? For example, his rearing a shiver of sharks on the island. The three of them suppressed the surging doubts in their hearts and waited for Fang Zhao to speak. "Curls dug out a bone," Fang Zhao started. Nanfeng's tone was excited. "So Curls even knows how to bring bones home!" "Boss, was it a human bone or an animal bone?" Zuo Yu directly ignored Nanfeng's silly appearance. Only after being jolted out of his mindless boasting did Nanfeng's expression turn serious. "Right. Did something happen?" As stated in the island purchase contract, this island was not an ominous one. Since the previous owner bought it, there had been no fatal accidents. After all, the previous owner didn't really live here much, and apart from some basic renovations and building houses, there hadn't been any significant activity or burials on this island. Could it be that there was some vile incident that the previous island owner did not know about? Fang Zhou wouldn't have contacted them if it was just an ordinary animal bone. The three of them saw that Fang Zhao did not seem to be worried, so they patiently waited for him to continue. Fang Zhao continued unhurriedly, "Preliminary assessment: it is a bone fossil belonging to a giant beast tens of millions of years or a hundred million years ago." The three of them remained silent. There was the sound of breathing. "A-A-A-A fossil?" Zuo Yu's lips were trembling. Yan Biao did not know much about fossils, but he was still calm... As if! "Is it a dinosaur? The legendary prehistoric giant beast?!" As a fan of dinosaurs, Yan Biao wished he could immediately fly over. When he was young, he loved to listen to stories of dinosaurs the most and had even fantasized about becoming a dinosaur hunter! "Not necessarily a dinosaur. It could also be some sort of marine reptile," Fang Zhao replied. "To me, those are all dinosaurs!" Yan Biao did not care what the specific definition of dinosaurs was. No matter those on land or in the ocean, those creatures from that era were all dinosaurs to him! Yan Biao also asked Fang Zhao to send a few more pictures of the fossil. "It's huge! The one buried underground must be ginormous! Boss, if you can't dig it out by yourself, I will go help you now!" Nanfeng had not said anything, but there were soft sounds coming from his end. After a while, Zuo Yu and Yan Biao calmed down slightly and heard Nanfeng speak. "Boss, I just checked the relevant laws and consulted a few authoritative lawyers. In the past 500 years of the New Era, fossils have become usable goods. The things dug out on private islands are all private property! Boss, you struck gold!" His voice during the last half of the sentence cracked, showing how excited Nanfeng was at this time. The private trading islands had been explored long ago, but if the early scouts had checked if there were energy ores, or if there were no virus or dangerous things, the islands Fang Zhao bought were the same. There was no need to think about energy ores; if there were, they would have been dug up long ago. Even the islands might have become become an untradeable asset. Therefore, after an island without an energy ore was established, the island, including the things on it, became a commodity for merchants. Fossils were significant events in the circles of archaeology, collecting, paleontology research, and more in the New Era. Over these years, if it weren't for the scarcity of excavated fossils, they wouldn't have gradually become overlooked by people. In fact, there were countless ancient biological fossils that had passed through the fog of history for billions of years, such as some insects, plants, and so on. Even after the Period of Destruction, some could still be dug out. As much as people still loved dinosaurs, there were too few dinosaur fossils. However, no one would have thought that there were actually several tens of millions of ancient biological fossils under such a remote island. A fossil! It was a real fossil!! Unlike the excited Nanfeng and the other two, Fang Zhao calmly arranged the matters related to the fossil excavation. To dig up fossils, he had to get a professional team. Therefore, he took a picture of the bone fossils he had dug out, as well as a video of the excavation site he had created. He then posted it on social media platforms and expressed his sincerity in finding a professional team to cooperate with. After Fang Zhao posted it, his personal terminal did not stop ringing. Research bigwigs always had a way to get his contact number, and the major media outlets also directly called him to inquire. On this day, many people were shocked by the news headlines that were being sent in real time. "Fossils? The tens-of-millions-and-hundreds-of-millions-of-years-ago kind that is mentioned in textbooks? Is this real? It's not for hype, is it?" "Look at how big the bone that has been dug out is. The rest haven't been dug out yet. It's gotta be a humongous one!" "Fang Zhao again? His way of dominating the headlines sure is different." "Was it dug out by his dog? I suspect that the bone that my dog gave me yesterday was also a fossil, but I threw the bone into the garbage disposal tool. I feel like I lost a few hundred million!" With Fang Zhao's inherent popularity, coupled with the significance of dinosaur fossils in the New Era, Fang Zhao became known to the whole world in no time. On a small island that Fang Zhao had recently acquired, his dog, yes, the one named Curls, whose value was close to 300 million, dug up a dinosaur bone dating back millions of years. This piece of news carried a significant amount of information. In an instant, it caught the attention of several different circles. At the same time, more professional excavation teams were catching flights to Fang Zhao's small island. Chapter 460 A Bustling Island When Fang Zhao found the dinosaur fossil on the island, many island owners who had originally planned to sell the island quickly removed their signboards and contacted professional scouting teams to check the seabed around their islands and the islands themselves. No, they contacted at least three different teams to check it over three times before they could be at ease. "Quick, quick! See if the island I bought has a fossil!" For a moment, many specialized fossil detection teams that had been almost on the verge of disbandment and overlooked by people came back to life. Unfortunately, the veteran research teams were all focused on Fang Zhao's island. They did not know if there were other islands, but Fang Zhao definitely had one. Not only that, but it was a big one! Therefore, the anxious island owners could only find the ground exploration team or other non-scientific research teams. There were also some teams that had already flown to Fang Zhao's island. For the sake of the high reward, they temporarily changed their ways and planned to go to his island to investigate. They just might find a fossil, too! The saddest of them all was the former island owner who sold the island to Fang Zhao. He knew exactly how many shortcomings his island had. It was located in a remote area and was difficult to manage. If he wanted to modify it, it would cost a lot of money. Moreover, with the market rate, it could not be quickly commercialized. When he sold it, he was so happy that he threw away a problem. But how long had it been since it was sold? Was it half a month? Looking at the news that was pushed out in front of him, the former island owner almost had a heart attack. He was regretful and hateful, and his face was twisted in glum. However, this was how business transactions worked. It was hard to say who was the winner. Yesterday, he thought that he was the big winner, but today, he found that he had thoroughly lost. He had to see how many jokes the Internet had made about the person who sold the island to Fang Zhao. The former island owner felt as if his heart was bleeding when he thought of the fossils buried underneath the island. He felt so regretful! He should have explored the island again back then. Fang Zhao... what a sinister man. How treacherous! The former island owner refused to believe that Fang Zhao hadn't known about the fossils in advance. He must have known that there were dinosaur fossils under that island. That was why he was in a hurry to buy the island! Sure enough, every action of Fang Zhao had a purpose. Every action was worth studying. No one could guess what his next step would be. Because Fang Zhao's news had stirred up too many fields this time, everyone in the world could hear discussions. Even Mo Lang who didn't pay much attention to the news also knew. Mo Lang had originally thought that Fang Zhao would spend his time on that remote island preparing for the performance, but he hadn't expected that there would be a disturbance again just a few days later. Worried, Mo Lang quickly called Fang Zhao and told him not to forget the performance scheduled because of the fossils. That was an important matter concerning his future! Of course, Fang Zhao had not forgotten that important performance. Other than dealing with the fossils, he had been preparing for the performance for the rest of his time. After placating the anxious Mo Lang, Fang Zhao saw Curls come over after the call. Curls ran over to Fang Zhao and raised its chin, practically looking up at the sky. "The new collar is pretty good. It looks nice," Fang Zhao complimented. Curls let out a happy bark. "I'll go somewhere else to dig out bones next time!" "Do you like digging for bones?" "Yes!" Curls replied without hesitation. It would get a game console if it dug out bones. It even got a game console and terminal after digging out half a bone this time! Fang Zhao thought of something and nodded. "Okay." He changed his mind. He had originally planned to use the fossils to exchange for dog food, but now that Curls could control its own changes, it could also go out to hunt for food in the sea. Normally, if it didn't transform for too long, the consumption wouldn't be too great. Fang Zhao could still afford to raise it. Furthermore, this fossilization incident could probably earn some dog food money, so there was no need to rush to sell the fossils. He could help Curls collect the fossils or some other things it picked up in the future. As Su Mu, his old comrade, said in his book, "The owner has to take every gift their pet dogs give them seriously." Fang Zhao thought that this was reasonable. Or, he could directly set up a private collection center and store all the things that Curls had picked up. The more Fang Zhao thought about it, the more he felt that this was a good idea. Going to dig bones was better than playing games at home all day. Fang Zhao had already told Curls that many strangers would come to the island. Curls was not worried. After all, Curls could already control the interference. It would not suddenly transform and scare people. No matter how many people came, it was not worried about being exposed. However, since more outsiders would be coming to their territory, Curls would definitely patrol the area—both above and under the water—more. "Is this terminal waterproof?" Curls asked worriedly. "Within 200 meters, yes. It should be fine if the depth doesn't exceed 200 meters," Fang Zhao said. "Only 200 meters?" Curls decided to be more careful and not wear its terminal when it went to patrol underwater. Hearing the sound of a flying transport landing, Curls glanced over and ran in that direction. It was Nanfeng and the other two. When the trio received Fang Zhao's call, they immediately rushed over. Before they landed, they discovered that the southeast side of the island was already riddled with holes. But it didn't matter. They didn't care about all the fossils being dug up. Just as they got off the flying transport, Nanfeng saw Curls trot over to them. Curls raised its head and showed them the new terminal on his neck. Nanfeng might have noticed it during normal times, but his mind was already flooded with dinosaur fossils. Because of that, he didn't notice Curls' subtle mood. The way Nanfeng looked at Curls now was like looking at a golden hen that popped out golden eggs. "Look at Curls! He knows that he has done something big and has his head held high! You have done well, Curls!" Nanfeng praised excitedly. Curls only looked at him with its dark eyes. Nanfeng continued, "Your master is gonna get rich this time. We are talking about a dinosaur here. "And it's a massive one at that. If it were tens of millions of years ago, ten of you wouldn't even be enough to fill the gaps between its teeth!" Curl glanced at them again before it turned around and left. Nanfeng couldn't care less. He first understood the situation with Fang Zhao, then went with Yan Biao and Zuo Yu to personally dig out two bone fossils. He excitedly turned on the camera and took as many photos as he could to show off to those on his friends list and social platforms. Because there would be other people coming soon, the three of them didn't have that much time to relax. After digging up the fossils and taking pictures to act cool, they went to do their own things. What was buried under Fang Zhao's island was highly likely the first complete prehistoric giant fossil more than 20 meters in the past 500 years of the New Era. The attraction was too strong, and teams from all over the world quickly came. However, this was a private island. The area around the island was also considered private territory. Fang Zhao could directly open fire if anyone entered the area without the permission of the island owner. Nanfeng was responsible for communicating with these teams. Fang Zhao hired some people to maintain order on the island and the surrounding area. The Yanzhou Navy also said they would send a team of people to help. There were too many people coming, and they were all from various continents in the world. The Yanzhou Navy had to pay attention to them. Even if not for Fang Zhao this time, if it was someone else, they would have negotiated with the island owner. Fortunately, Fang Zhao was extremely cooperative. After Fang Zhao sent out the news of his looking for a partner, professional research teams from various continents volunteered to participate in this excavation operation. They didn't want any reward as long as Fang Zhao allowed them to participate in this excavation operation. There were even people who fought over the spot. Not only these teams, but the media did not fall behind. The Yanzhou TV station also invited Fang Zhao for an interview. The originally deserted island became lively, and some simple temporary housing was set up. There was also an increase in the number of boats of various sizes near the island. If they could not get onto the island, they would stay on the ship! Those who wanted to watch the show would also form a group to go over. As long as they did not enter the waters of the private island, they would not be considered to be trespassing. There were many private flying devices in the air. As they did not dare to fly into the private areas without permission, they only flew around the area. There were even people on top who were observing with binoculars. Some even did live broadcasts online. This excavation operation was a memorable event. The competition between the teams was intense. From these teams, Fang Zhao selected 12 teams representing 12 continents, with the majority being research-oriented teams. For such a big project to be divided, the teams were not very happy at first, but they understood what Fang Zhao meant. Anyone who was dissatisfied with the arrangement was free to leave. Many private teams were still not allowed to enter the island. They were waiting for the selected teams to leave so that their people could squeeze in any empty spot. Therefore, even if they were reluctant to share with others, these 12 teams agreed to it. No one wanted to miss this opportunity, so they had no choice but to cooperate now. Fortunately, Fang Zhao did not order them around. He even said he felt relieved leaving the professional matters to the professionals. This time, Fang Zhao also met with the members of the number one family in the world—the Bryan family. They had taken the initiative to look for him. Fang Zhao had some impression of the Bryan family. This family made a great contribution to the Huangzhou Battlefield during the Period of Destruction. Now, they had the largest private museum, the Bryan Museum, in Huangzhou. The Bryan Museum possessed the world's only Tyrannosaurus rex skull and a complete Deinonychus fossil. Apart from those precious collectibles, the most famous part of the Bryan family was the members of their family. The members of the Bryan family, regardless of whether they were male or female, were extremely good-looking. However, everyone who had paid attention to the Bryan family knew that this was a family that regarded looks as insignificant. Not long ago, there was a member of the family who had nearly turned himself into a savage in order to find the Insect Amber from 100 million years ago. This time, the leader of the Bryan family team was also the curator of the Bryan Museum. He knew that it wasn't easy for private teams to participate alone, so he joined forces with the Huangzhou Museum to form an excavation team to cooperate with Fang Zhao. He came to look for Fang Zhao because he hoped that the dinosaur could be rented for two months each year after it was dug out. The Bryan Museum and the Huangzhou Museum would each put it on display for a month. Of course, it would be great to just buy the fossil. The Bryan Museum and the Huangzhou Museum did not mind spending more money. However, Fang Zhao had clearly stated that he would not sell it when they first arrived. Therefore, the museums could only settle for the second best, which was to rent since they could not buy it. Fang Zhao did not want to talk about this for now. "Let's talk about it after we dig it out." He had to take a look at the performance of these teams before deciding. The management capabilities and level of importance placed on collections varied among different museums. For that reason, Fang Zhao didn't want the dinosaur they excavated to be destroyed by those careless museums. The curator of Bryan Museum did not expect Fang Zhao to agree right now. He only hoped that after the fossil was dug out, Fang Zhao could consider them first if he wanted a partner. They had the greatest sincerity! The Bryan family had five people following the curator this time. No matter male or female, many of them were personally involved in the digging. Sweat was pouring, dust was flying, and everyone's faces were smeared with mud, making their appearances vague. Only those blazing eyes were visible. They did not care about the cameras that followed them, nor did they care about the way they acted in front of the global audience. In any case, their family's style of working had long been famous. Their appearances meant nothing to them. What was important was the fossil! After multiple professional teams divided the work, their work efficiency was much higher. While the other side was busy digging for fossils, Fang Zhao's side had long been blocked by reporters. The Yanzhou TV station reporters with regional advantage came to interview Fang Zhao. "How did you find the fossils at first? Did your dog really find them?" The reporter looked at the dog that had been sitting next to Fang Zhao and asked with a smile. "Yes. He was the one who dug out the first bone." The camera faced Curls who crouched next to Fang Zhao. Curls raised his head slightly, revealing the collar on its neck and the terminal with a puppy pattern, not allowing a single strand of dog fur to cover what was on its neck. On the other side, the camera shot the dog for a while before turning to Fang Zhao. The reporters asked some questions that the masses were curious about, such as how Curls was able to find the fossils underground. Fang Zhao replied, "I recently bought the island and am having it rebuilt. Due to the construction, the rock stratum underneath was exposed. No one noticed. It was Curls who dug out the bone." Nanfeng and the others, who were paying attention to the interview, were speechless. The boss was pushing this on Curls in order to weaken his ears' ability! Others might not know the truth, but they did... When was there ever a large-scale construction on the island?! As for why the reporters asked why Fang Zhao had bought this island, Fang Zhao only said that he wanted to find a quiet and undisturbed place. It was purely by luck that he had found the fossil. Luck? Most people did not believe it. Heh, as if it was luck at work! There was no point in him hiding what his ears were capable of doing now at this point. No matter how much the reporter quietly complained, he still put on an "I see" look and followed the topic to praise Curls, who was obediently squatting next to Fang Zhao. Now that Curls had been praised by everyone, it was extremely pleased and excited. After the interview ended, it ran around to inspect the territory. When the interview was broadcasted, it stood guard in front of the TV. As an official television station in Yanzhou, the news was still relatively serious. The broadcast of the interview clip was also Fang Zhao's original words, and it had not been distorted or edited. The camera also focused on Curls for several seconds. In today's world of ultra-high-definition visuals even for minor news outlets, the official TV news coverage was clear enough for people to properly see this dog. The terminal at the dog collar was probably covered by mosaic tiles in order to avoid suspicion of advertising. Seeing this, Curls was speechless as it kept standing guard in front of the TV. Chapter 461 Watch Dog Curls, who had failed to show off its new collar, seemed to wither as it was deeply hurt. Fang Zhao made a trip to the excavation team. When he returned, he saw Nanfeng anxiously talking to Curls who only walked away with its head lowered. When Nanfeng saw Fang Zhao, he quickly told the latter about Curls' odd behavior. "Boss, does Curls have an upset stomach? Or is he not used to having too many strangers who come to the island? Is he sick?  But he was fine before!" Fang Zhao took the leash and gestured for Nanfeng to get busy while he took care of things here. Fang Zhao could roughly guess the reason behind Curls' actions. "Curls, I have a mission for you." Fang Zhao mentioned. If Curls had something to do, it wouldn't have the mood to think about anything else. Hearing that, Curls raised its head and looked at Fang Zhao. "A big warehouse has been newly built on the southeast side of the island. The bones and stones that have been dug out are all in there. Help me guard it. Don't let anyone steal it." The prehistoric organism buried under the island was too big. In order to minimize the damage to fossils, even digging was a little difficult. Although there were twelve teams in charge, they still couldn't finish digging in a day or two. Fang Zhao had built a temporary large warehouse southeast of the island. Apart from the fossils, the tools and supplies for digging the team were placed inside. There was also a temporary lounge inside. Although a security system was already installed, Fang Zhao believed in Curls' ability. It also served as a way to divert Curls' attention. There were too many people on the island recently. When Curls moved around in other places on the island, there had to be someone walking it. Its movement was limited as it needed to be tied with a dog leash. Now, Fang Zhao might as well let it freely move around in the big warehouse. It was a little small, but there was no need to put a leash on it. "If you do well, I will take you to an alien planet after a while," Fang Zhao mentioned. Curls' eyes lit up, and it became excited in an instant. It knew that Fang Zhao was going to leave for a performance in a while, and it might not be able to follow him. Of course Curls was happy now that Fang Zhao had said this. Thus, just as Nanfeng finished his call and was about to return, he saw Curls, filled with energy, rush into the warehouse like a gust of wind. "What is Curls doing?" Nanfeng looked at Fang Zhao in confusion. "Guarding the warehouse entrance." Fang Zhao greeted the staff at the warehouse and hung a sign next to the "precautions" posted at the warehouse door. The staff entering and exiting the warehouse looked at the three exclamation marks on the warning sign, lost in thought. Danger? What danger? Was it necessary to put such emphasis on it? They had been working here for two days, so why didn't they find any danger in the warehouse? Only a dog had appeared just now. "The island owner's dog won't break the bones, right?" Someone was worried. "The bone is on the table, though. The dog can't reach it." "Since Fang Zhao has chosen to let it in, I'm sure he will be responsible if anything happens." Even if the staff members of the warehouse were reluctant to see a pet dog in such a place, Fang Zhao was the owner of the island after all. Everything was in accordance with his will. On the other hand, Curls, who had already entered the warehouse, was in work mode. In order to get the results out and let Fang Zhao bring it to play in outer space, it was serious about inspecting the warehouse. After galloping around the warehouse, he would check every corner, not letting even a single bug off. After patrolling, Curls crouched at the entrance of the warehouse as it watched the staff entering and leaving. Instead of running around, it did its duty as a watchdog. At this moment, a yacht was parked a distance away from the island while there were many other boats nearby to watch the show. The yacht was not conspicuous. "We have successfully infiltrated the island. Great disguise! The current bionic technology is truly amazing. We spent a lot of money to buy it from the black market. It seems that the seller did not lie to me." "According to the instruction manual, this is the latest bionic technology which can bypass most civil security systems. "There is no doubt it's good, but it's expensive, and no one knows how long they can last. More than half of our net worth has been invested in this. "Also, it is still small. It can only carry things within 45 pounds." "I'm not greedy; I only want a small bone. No one would find out if only one or two small bones are missing from such a big skeleton." "I'm not greedy either. I'll be satisfied with just one bone." "Let's split the money after we sell the bones!" "There are night guards in the warehouse. We have to be careful." "Don't worry, I've added a dissolvable anesthetic needle. It's enough to take down an elephant. It's the kind which needle can't be found." "Fang Zhao is still too impatient. He made it public the moment he dug up a fossil. He wasn't prepared. So many people have come to this isolated island surrounded by sea. There aren't enough security personnel. "Moreover, Fang Zhao trusts the so-called intelligent security system too much. He is too young to know the speed at which electronic equipment changes." "Are we making a move at night?" "Yes. It's more convenient then." The sun was setting, and the night was getting darker. The excavation team, who had been busy for the whole day, returned to their residences and took a short break after tidying up. They were too excited to sleep on the first day. The next day, they also slept late. On the third day, the workload during the day was exhausting even though there wasn't much to do. A slight carelessness could easily result in damage to the fossils. Entrusted with such a huge responsibility, they didn't feel at ease about letting smart machines do the digging. They all chose to do it themselves. Therefore, at night, they had to make the best use of the time to recuperate. According to the current progress, the giant beast buried under the island would be completely dug out in two days. They would immediately be able to see the skeleton of this prehistoric giant beast that had been buried for tens of millions of years! The excavation workers went to bed with smiles on their faces. They did not know that there were many shadows that were ready to make a move in the dark. The island was much quieter at night. Only the insects that moved at night came out one after another. A little reptile crawled out from the grass and headed toward the warehouse. On the surface of the sea outside the small island, inside a certain yacht, a few people were staring at the surveillance footage. The footage was taken from the reptile's perspective. It was already close to the warehouse and was about to enter through the window at the next moment. The few of them stared without blinking, watching as the reptile enter the warehouse. But before they could celebrate, they heard an ear-piercing hissing sound. The connection broke off then. "What's going on?" "Did they notice us?" "Could it be that the civil security system has been upgraded?" "It shouldn't be. Has he already upgraded it when the new generation of bionic technology has just been released? He didn't do it this fast in the past." "The security system in the warehouse was set up by Fang Zhao's bodyguards and a security company. Did they have military equipment set up?" A wave of suppressed silence ensued. Military equipment was more than half of their net worth! Similar incidents were happening on the inconspicuous boats on the surface of the sea outside the island. The high prices they paid for various tools released through underground channels, claimed to be new bio-mimetic technology manufactured micro-probes, surveillance tools, intelligent theft tools, and the like, all went out but never returned. Each one of them lost connection as soon as they entered the warehouse, some seemed to be trampled, while others simply vanished abruptly. Whether it was flying in, crawling in, or drilling in from underground, all of them had the same result. Not to mention stealing bones, they did not even succeed in taking pictures! They also secretly asked which company in Fang Zhao's security system had helped to make it. However, they didn't believe what they had heard. It was definitely false information that had been released to confuse people! How sinister! Sure enough, the more powerful one was, the more mysterious they were. Fang Zhao definitely had a trump card hidden! Could it be that Fang Zhao had really asked the military for help? In the newly built warehouse on the southeast side of the island, Curls carefully held a badly deformed reptile in its mouth and placed the reptile into a box in the corner. It was the 15th one he caught! If he gathered 20 of them, he would be able to exchange them for a gaming console once more! Chapter 462 Apex Predator The security system at the warehouse was controlled by Zuo Yu and Yan Biao who took turns guarding it. Naturally, Curls' actions were also under their surveillance. Curls knew that there was a camera in the warehouse, and it also knew that this was another test Fang Zhao had given him. In order to prevent Curls from developing a bad habit of eating whatever it saw, Fang Zhao had indeed put in a lot of effort. This time, it was also to check whether Curls had fixed its habit or not. Curls was happy. It could actually swallow this kind of bug directly without transforming. It wouldn't even be discovered by the surveillance cameras. It even considered catching the bugs and splitting them up into food and plaything. However, catching 20 of them would give it another chance to play games. Naturally, it couldn't afford to swallow even one. Every time Curls added another one to the box, it would count everything again. It was afraid that someone would touch its box. Tonight, Yan Biao, who was watching over the surveillance room, clicked his tongue in wonder. "As expected of a dog who has done an inspection job!" In fact, he had already noticed that there were many bugs in the warehouse tonight even though the bugs had clearly been dealt with. But as he watched Curls catch and place one bug after another into the box that Fang Zhao had prepared for it, and one of the bugs even emitted a faint electric spark when Curls stepped on it, that was when Yan Biao knew something was wrong. Immediately, he contacted Fang Zhao. Fang Zhao had said that Yan Biao and Zuo Yu were personally guarding the warehouse. No one else was allowed to enter the surveillance room. If they wanted to take a leave, they could directly explain to Fang Zhao that Nanfeng was taking over or Fang Zhao was personally guarding it. If they encountered any unusual incidents in the warehouse, they had to inform Fang Zhao immediately and not leak any information. Yan Biao and Zuo Yu only thought that Fang Zhao valued fossils and did not think there was anything odd about Fang Zhao's orders. However, after Yan Biao told Fang Zhao about the strange occurrence here, Fang Zhao only told him to keep an eye on the surveillance and not care about the things Curls caught. Yan Biao also consulted some old comrades who had retired and learned some information. Recently, there had been a large number of bionic devices sold in the black market. However, the price was high, and very few people bought it. It just so happened that the number of bionic devices in the black market had increased rapidly after the news about the fossil had been released on Fang Zhao's side. He had just received a reminder about this from a comrade. Unexpectedly, the security system was not as useful as Curls. None of those release devices managed to get close to the dinosaur fossils! Seeing Curls break a seemingly ordinary weed in the crack and throw it into the box, Yan Biao sighed and thought that he would have to upgrade the security system tomorrow. He started to worry that he would end up being completely useless if all of this was done by Curls. In the next two days, there were all sorts of things that tried to sneak into the warehouse. Some looked like insects, whil some looked like plants. In short, their disguises were great. However, none of the bone fossils that had been sent into the warehouse had been stolen, nor had there been any stolen photos leaking out. There were also those who had tried to bribe the staff. However, the teams that Fang Zhao had chosen were all veterans. The management of the team was strict. Even if there were any such attempts, before Fang Zhao could intervene, the teams themselves had already expelled those individuals. At that time, when they had signed the contract with Fang Zhao, it had been written that as long as someone in a team had any problems, the whole team would be responsible. Not only would they be expelled from this project, but they would also have to pay a huge amount of liquidated damages. Because of this, as long as their team discovered problems, they would be more proactive than Fang Zhao in capturing the traitor. At noon that day, a digger who was feeling mentally fatigued was instructed by the leading professor to take a break in the rest area of the warehouse. This staff member had just entered the warehouse with a box when he was stopped by Curls. "Woof!" The people guarding the warehouse surrounded him. The other staff members who were either entering or leaving the warehouse also looked in that direction. The worker who was stopped while carrying the box turned, not because he was guilty of doing something wrong, but because he was genuinely startled. The guard at the warehouse then brought him to the side and opened the box that Curls had been staring at. Glancing at the various tools in the box, Curls placed his paws on a geological hammer. The person who was stopped had a sudden change in expression. "This isn't my hammer! My hammer has my name carved on it! I even carved it myself. There is nothing on this geological hammer!" As he spoke, he quickly contacted the leading professor. "Sir! Someone has put their hands on my box!" In order to protect his favorite student and let his team stay to continue participating in the excavation project, the leading professor reacted quickly and cooperated with the investigation. Moreover, they had their own way of handling things. Soon, the members of this team all proved their innocence and helped to catch three suspicious people. What happened to this team also made the other excavation teams be on guard. Except for themselves, no one could touch their toolbox! The clothes on their bodies were also checked every day. They were extremely vigilant against anyone who tried to approach them. In the past, they were eager to be interviewed by the mainstream media. Now, it was those media outlets who tried various ways to get into their way every day. They might still be somewhat complacent if the incident with the box hadn't been tampered with. However, today's events seemed to have poured a bucket of cold water on them, making them more level-headed. It was already the final stage of excavation, with the skeletal fossils about to be completely unearthed. Being expelled from the project at this point would undoubtedly be a major regret in their lives. They could not afford to slip up at this critical moment. Soon, the others on the island noticed that the excavation team who had been talking and laughing while working were now solemn. Moreover, no matter how busy they were, there would always be a team member responsible for keeping an eye on the surroundings. With the joint efforts of the twelve teams, all the bone fossils buried under the island were finally dug out. As the bones were relatively intact, there wasn't much that needed to be repaired. After digitally reconstructing the skeleton through computer simulations, they proceeded to assemble the skeletal fossils. At the moment when the assembly was completed, they looked up at the nearly 50-meter-long skeleton as if transcending time and space, glimpsing the ancient marine ruler from 70 million years ago. A young staff member standing at the side was already at a loss for words. Tears streamed down the faces of the veteran professors who were directing the assembly of the skeletal fossils. "I didn't expect that I would be able to see the apex predator of the ocean 70 million years ago with my own eyes!" After an hour of non-stop discussion around the newly unearthed giant skeleton, they had no choice but to deal with a problem. "It has to have a name," a professor leading the team mentioned. After searching through a vast amount of information and finding no corresponding species, there was no doubt that they had unearthed an unknown species. Therefore, they needed to give it a name. But the problem now was that this time, it was not discovered alone by a team, but by multiple teams digging together. Furthermore, the skeleton belonged to the island owner. "According to the naming rules... "Do we have the right to name it? "Where is Fang Zhao? Hey, Fang Zhao, Mr. Island Master Fang! The name—" "You guys can decide," Fang Zhao replied. The leading professors were still thinking about how to persuade Fang Zhao if he gave the creature a random name. To their surprise, Fang Zhao handed over the naming rights to them. During the Old Era, in many places, such valuable ancient vertebrate fossils were considered national property. Even though the cultural heritage management laws of the New Era were different, Feng Zhao didn't really care about any of this in the first place. If not for Curls, Fang Zhao would have unhesitantly donated the skeleton to one or a few museums. Fang Zhao glanced at Curls, who stood by the box with the reptiles, yawning. Other than playing games and eating, this dog had no interest in anything else. Upon hearing Feng Zhao say that he wanted to give them the naming rights, an elderly professor became so excited that his whole body was trembling. A quick-witted assistant beside him promptly handed the old man two pills. The twelve excavation teams were once again in a heated discussion about the name. In the end, they named this prehistoric marine apex predator the "Sea Emperor Dragon." This is the largest skeletal fossil discovered so far. Just by looking at those teeth, it was clear that it was a carnivore. It was, without a doubt, the top marine predator of its time. It deserved the title "Emperor." After that, it was time to set up a file. The twelve teams once again began an intense debate. To be exact, the newly unearthed Sea Emperor Dragon should belong to marine reptiles and, theoretically, not be classified as a dinosaur. However, the mainstream folk culture was used to calling the unique creatures that lived in that period "dinosaurs." Many ancient biology researchers in the New Era proposed to re-classify them. The study of prehistoric creatures in the new century was marked by significant gaps, and regarding the limited information left from the old century, they consider it only as a reference and didn't fully believe it. They only believed in their own research. After the file was completed, an ancient biology professor held Fang Zhao's hand. "I see that you have a connection with dinosaurs. Would you be interested in participating in paleontological research?" Fang Zhao paused for a second. "No." They might be asking him to study paleontology, but their true purpose was the skeleton of the Sea Emperor Dragon. Two days later, news about the "Sea Emperor Dragon" on various platforms on the Internet almost flooded the screen. Whether it's the archaeology field, entertainment industry, dinosaur enthusiasts' circle, early childhood education circle, life sciences, geological research, and so on, all of them were buzzing with news about the Sea Emperor Dragon. The general public also held a sense of shock and comfort with the thought, "So our own planet once had such enormous creatures not any less impressive in size than those extraterrestrial beings that have been found." They enthusiastically flooded the internet with praises, weaving various imaginative stories as if they had personally witnessed it all. "The 'Overlords of the Ocean' that were discovered in the past all look like mere lackeys now." "Invincible! It truly is invincible!" "An ocean apex predator-level predatory creature! I'm looking forward to a movie featuring the Sea Emperor Dragon in the future!" "I wonder if the skeleton of the Sea Emperor Dragon will be publicly exhibited in the future?" "This skeleton is too expensive. I don't think it will be made public." "Even a model of it is fine. When will the model of the Sea Emperor Dragon be made?" "This... I reckon it is up to Fang Zhao to decide." "I declare that the only one who can step on the Sea Emperor's head is Fang Zhao!" "Wait a minute..." "That actually sounds legit. "Fang Zhao indeed lives on the tomb of the Sea Emperor Dragon. In other words, he is stepping on the Sea Emperor Dragon's head!" Soon, a new topic appeared. "Fang Zhao, the Man Who Steps on the Head of the Sea Emperor Ocean" Nanfeng looked at the trending topic that had suddenly gained popularity on social media and burst into laughter. Leaving everything else aside, thanks to the discovery of the Sea Emperor Dragon's skeletal fossil during this period, there was a significant increase in rental income. "Boss, you've really hit the jackpot this time! Selling those skeletons will get you back into the billion-dollar club!" "I don't plan on selling it," Fang Zhao said. After a moment of surprise, Nanfeng's face lit up with realization. "Exactly! We should definitely hold onto something as precious and unique as this for a couple of years!" "I plan to open a collection gallery. Apart from the Sea Emperor Dragon, there might be other additions in the future," Fang Zhao added. "A collection gallery?" After another round of surprise, Nanfeng regained his composure and thought that Fang Zhao was indeed an impressive boss who always thought ahead. Instead of selling the skeletal fossil now, Fang Zhao would set up a gallery as he liked. Plus, he could make money through various related products. The Sea Emperor Dragon was the largest creature ever unearthed on this planet so far. While there might be larger creatures on other planets, paleontologists hadn't even fully understood the ones on this planet. Where would they find the energy to study extraterrestrial ones? Moreover, people's attachment to this planet was irreplaceable. This planet held the history of human development—a shared history for everyone. Feelings were biased. In addition to these factors, according to current policies and regulations, there were strict limitations on extraterrestrial life on this planet. In terms of collectible value, the artifacts from this planet definitely took precedence. There was no substitute for them. Nanfeng felt satisfied at the thought that he had guessed Fang Zhao's thoughts. His boss had the mindset of an investor. As Nanfeng looked at the various possible appearances of the Sea Emperor Dragon simulated by the research team on the computer, he sighed. "As expected of a top ocean predator. Each one of these simulations looks ferocious. I'm glad they went extinct a long time ago. "I wonder what the universe's apex predator looks like." Nanfeng began to fantasize again. "It must be quite powerful." Fang Zhao glanced at Curls, who had been staring at the boxes while counting the bugs. "Or not. Some creatures may appear cute but possess extremely destructive capabilities." Nanfeng guffawed at that. "Haha! You're funny, Boss." Fang Zhao only quietly replied, "You will see what I mean one day." Nanfeng had a look of approval on his face, but he was still laughing on the inside. Whatever the boss said! Nanfeng would wholeheartedly support Fang Zhao even if the later said that Curls was an apex predator! Chapter 463 I Can't Possibly Be Worse Than a Dog The coverage of the Sea Emperor Dragon flooded the media, numerous research papers on paleontology rushed to be published, and many things that were previously deemed impossible in documentaries were overturned. A student studying vertebrate paleontology smilingly replied during a media interview. "Our previous professors always told us that documentaries, just like archaeological excavations, will always be contradicted as new data keeps pouring in. "The discovery of the Sea Emperor Dragon is a significant event for us. We, too, believe that there are more surprises waiting to be discovered in many places that we don't know." The fact that Fang Zhao's island had dug out the Sea Emperor Dragon made everyone's attention shift from land to island and sea. In those inaccessible places, there were definitely more creatures from millions of years ago buried and luckily avoided the Period of Destruction. The islands' prices had increased! While not experiencing a major surge, the number of people interested in purchasing islands has increased, causing island prices to quickly stabilize and even rise. There was even a paleontology enthusiast who specifically bought an island to establish their own research base and form a new exploration team, with the goal of studying the underwater rock layers. After the excavation of the Sea Emperor Dragon, Fang Zhao signed cooperation agreements with Bryan Museum and Huangzhou Museum. Over the next two months, the Sea Emperor Dragon would be transported to Huangzhou Museum and exhibited in these two museums. It was said that the online ticketing platform would sell out within minutes of opening every day. The tickets for the first two months of the exhibition, which were already available for pre-sale, were completely sold out, showcasing the tremendous enthusiasm for the event. As for the Yanzhou Museum... The curator was so aggrieved that he wanted to cry. There was no other way. The Yanzhou Museum had a geographical advantage. After all, Fang Zhao was from Yanzhou. However, in terms of strength, they were temporarily unable to bear the pressure that the Sea Emperor Dragon brought. Even so, they would definitely be ready to welcome the Sea Emperor Dragon after two months of buffer time. The curator wouldn't know what to do with the embarrassment otherwise! Everyone's attention shifted as the Sea Emperor Dragon was sent away. Fang Zhao's small island once again quieted down. Fang Zhao planned to build a collection center. However, the island was not a good location for that. He also wasn't sure how long he would be away. If someone came to the island to cause trouble, he would not be able to take care of it. He did not want all the things Curls had dug up to be stolen. At the same time, he did not have enough funds on hand, so he could only wait until he had saved up enough money. Sea Emperor Dragon had been rented out, and there were also merchants looking for him to cooperate. However, Fang Zhao's focus was still on the upcoming performance on another planet. He received an invitation from the organizers. Only then did Fang Zhao know who Mo Lang had never told him who the organizer was. Hidden Star. They were the head of the three major extraterrestrial military bases! As for the rest, too little information was available. Even the military reports rarely reported things on Hidden Star. However, Hidden Star was publicly acknowledged to be the place with the highest scientific research capabilities. "These are the basic things to take note of. I will send you an electronic document on the specifics. The itinerary will be arranged. Someone will notify you when the time comes." The other person gave Fang Zhao all the questions he needed to take note of and then added, "Do you have any questions?" Fang Zhao asked, "Can I bring a dog?" There was a pause on the other end of the communicator, and the voice, which was originally devoid of emotion, showed some fluctuations. "Are you talking about Curls? Curls, yes. However, no other dogs are allowed. "Of course, if you don't have time to feed the dogs while you are in Hidden Star, we can help as well. It would be a good opportunity for it to interact with our spaceport team." Fang Zhao was not surprised that the other party knew about Curls. Curls had been registered in several military districts and departments. He had indeed made a great contribution. Every spaceport wanted to have that dog. Hidden Star's spaceport had indeed had ideas about Curls. Later, when they found out that Fang Zhao was unwilling to let the dog go, they did not say anything. Of course, they were also very interested in Fang Zhao's ears. However, Fang Zhao was too focused on music and arts that it was difficult to poach him. After ending the call with the organizer, Hidden Star, Fang Zhao received an electronic document. There were accompanying personnel and accompanying pets applying for guidance. Fang Zhao told Nanfeng and the others about this matter, but he did not tell them that the performance would be on Hidden Star. The three of them all said that they wanted to follow. With his keen insight, Nanfeng guessed that the place Fang Zhao was going to was definitely of a high standard. He didn't want to be left here! After hearing Fang Zhao say that he was going to bring Curls along this time, Nanfeng was worried. "They said the place we're going to this time is strict. Are dogs allowed too?" Although he didn't know where he was going this time, he was still allowed to bring pet dogs in this kind of complicated and strict place. Fang Zhao did not explain much and only said, "I will send the application link to you. When you submit the application, submit Curls' as well." "Understood, Boss!" Nanfeng acted quickly and called Yan Biao and Zuo Yu to submit the accompanying application. The accompanying personnel were subjected to much stricter scrutiny. The first round of screening they had to go through was a political review. Inappropriate public statements or tainted records could lead to being flagged or rejected. "Even pets have to go through a political review?" Nanfeng found it novel, but still, he followed Fang Zhao's request and submitted an application for Curls as well. One minute later, Curls had passed the political trial. Nanfeng was speechless when he saw this. Was the review process for pets now this fast? An hour later, Yan Biao passed, and another half an hour later, Zuo Yu also passed. Nanfeng could only wait. However, he didn't receive any notice even until it was dinner time. "Why did you guys pass the test so quickly? Surely I...I'm not..." Nanfeng's face was pale, and his voice was shaking. Yan Biao comforted him, "It's probably because you've been in the entertainment industry for a long time that the interrogation is a bit stricter." Nanfeng was still worried.  He had experience in the entertainment industry in Huangzhou. He might speak a bit casually and not be overly meticulous in his actions even though he worked in a lower-level position. However, he definitely hadn't said anything inappropriate or done anything out of line! Nanfeng didn't sleep that night. Fortunately, the next day, he received the news that he had passed. His heart, which had been hanging by a thread, finally calmed down. "Done! Let's apply for the next round of examination!" The following rounds of examination were quite smooth, but the last one required them to go to the designated location within seven working days for a physical examination. Fang Zhao went with them. "Boss, haven't you passed all the tests already? You don't need to follow me. I can handle all these," Nanfeng said. The physical examination wasn't anything important. "I'll go over and take a look," Fang Zhao insisted. When they arrived at the designated location, the three of them and the dog entered different detection channels. Fang Zhao found a bench and sat down to read. Half an hour later, Curls ran out with his little paws, relaxed and without any pressure. Two hours later, Yan Biao came out of the testing tunnel. Seeing that Zuo Yu and Nanfeng were not there, Yan Biao couldn't help feeling a little proud. He just knew that he was the strongest! It seemed that he had the upper-hand because he had served on planet Baiji for many years. As for Curls, Yan Biao did not take it seriously. He believed that the standards for pet inspections here must have been relaxed. Curls let out a yawn. When Zuo Yu came out, Curls yawned again and found a comfortable position to continue lying down. By the time Nanfeng came out of the test tunnel, Curls had already fallen asleep beside Fang Zhao. Nanfeng, who had just walked out of the test tunnel, still felt a little dizzy and wanted to throw up. "The testing this time is quite strict, especially the physical fitness assessment standards." From the physical fitness tests inside, it was evident that the performance location they were heading to this time was probably not a comfortable place. Zuo Yu mocked from the side, "Say, Nanfeng, you're from planet Baiji. This won't do. You've gotten worse! You'll start training tomorrow!" Yan Biao also agreed. "Yes, we need to enhance the training. I mean, even a dog can outperform you. How embarrassing!" With a dazed expression, Nanfeng looked at Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, who were already sitting on the bench, and then at Curls, who was sleeping soundly. "No... T-That's impossible. Surely I'm not worse than Curls?!" Did he really deteriorate to the level of a weakling after retiring for so many years? Chapter 464 Departure After all the applications had been approved, Fang Zhao rejected all of the invitations for upcoming events. He did not even attend the opening ceremony of the first public exhibition of the Sea Emperor Dragon in Huangzhou. On the day of the exhibition of the Sea Emperor Dragon. There was a long queue outside Huangzhou. The people who had been attracted by the Sea Emperor Dragon were all so excited that their faces turned red. They even endured the slow process of queuing up for security checks. There were also some dinosaur models and toys by the side of the queue. The people in the queue couldn't wait to play with the toys. After the invited media reporters entered the museum through the reporter passage, they started taking pictures of the Sea Emperor Dragon. Not all of them were allowed to land on Fang Zhao's island, so they had not been able to take pictures before this. They were basically reposting news by other media outlets. The two directors of Huangzhou Museum and Bryan Museum kept smiling during the first exhibition ceremony. When they returned to the office after being interviewed by reporters, the smiles on their faces disappeared. The director of Huangzhou Museum looked at the few bionic mechanical reptiles on the table with an extremely twisted expression. At this moment, Bryan Museum's director was also rejoicing. "If Fang Zhao hadn't reminded us to carry out a special upgrade, there would have been losses one way or another this time." When handing over the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil to them, Fang Zhao reminded them and advised them to carry out a security upgrade specifically targeting biomimetic technology. The two museum directors attached great importance to the inaugural Sea Emperor Dragon exhibition event. Of course, they took note of Fang Zhou's suggestion and initiated a specialized upgrade for their own museum's security even before the Sea Emperor Dragon was handed over. While the two directors were both angry and glad, there was also a group of people who had ideas about the Sea Emperor Dragon. They were so angry that they stomped their feet. "It's fine if we can't enter Fang Zhao's warehouse. We can think that he has used some military equipment. But for Huangzhou Museum and Bryan Museum to fail as well... Do you know what that means?" "This technology is outdated!" "I can't believe I spent so much money to buy something outdated!" "The seller lied to me!" The latest bionic machinery that the seller bragged about was all a scam! He had spent so much money on trash! When the technology was outdated, it was not worth much. The things in the black market were expensive, but the black market had never cheated people like this. Out of anger, the people who felt thoroughly scammed couldn't successfully get a refund from the seller or locate the seller ended up spending a significant amount of money to hunt down the original seller. They then warned others, "Be wary of shady dealings in the black market!" In T-Organization, the people who were ordered to sell bionic technology fled in panic. After realizing that stolen biomimetic technology was ineffective against Yanzhou's coastal defense, members of T-Organization devised a plan to generate more money using this technology. Coincidentally, when the news of the fossil excavation by Fang Zhao made headlines, they seized the opportunity to create a batch of biomimetic machinery and made a substantial profit on the black market. However, not long after, the people who had bought the bionic machinery demanded a refund. This made the members of T-Organization firmly believe that the bionic technology was a conspiracy against their organization. They might have accepted their failure to breach the coastal defense for military purposes, but they never expected that even civilian security systems would be upgraded to counter biomimetic technology. Despite their considerable efforts, all they managed to steal was outdated technology! This time, Fang Zhao, who had caused all of this, had dealt a blow to T-Organization. After learning about the presence of bio-mimetic crawlers on the island, Fang Zhao reported the matter. Following the updates at the Huangzhou Museum and the Bryan Museum, more critical facilities would undergo upgrades focused on bio-mimetic technology. However, Fang Zhao temporarily did not have the time to pay attention to security upgrades. He was busy packing his things to head to Hidden Star. This time, he would leave for a bit longer. Fang Zhao informed Old Mr. and Mrs. Fang. He didn't elaborate. He only said that he needed to leave for a period of time. Moreover, it would be inconvenient to contact him during this period. The two old elderly shouldn't worry even if they couldn't get in contact with him. "Boss, 80 million— Are we going to leave this 'rabbit' at home?" Nanfeng asked. "Yes." Fang Zhao glanced at the water tank. He placed the "rabbit" in the house by the sea and did not put it on the island. If anything happened here, the alarm would ring, and the property management would be able to respond quickly. "Alright." Although Nanfeng was still a little worried, he did not say anything else and continued giving his report. "The construction team's progress on the island is going smoothly. The island will be restored by the time we return." Due to the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil, the island underwent significant digging, building, and demolition. Now, Fang Zhao had hired a team to restore the island. The large excavations from fossil digging needed to be filled, and other areas of the island required repairs and reconstruction. After packing up his things, Fang Zhao received a call. It was someone sent by the military region to pick them up. The flying transport stopped on the tarmac. Before long, two soldiers came over to verify their identities. There was Fang Zhao, an assistant, two bodyguards, and a dog. Nanfeng noticed that the soldier's gaze was fixed on Curls for quite a while as if he was repeatedly confirming whether this was the dog in the application form. Four people and one dog. While the identity verification was completed and the luggage was checked, the two soldiers did not say much. They took Fang Zhao's group onto the flying transport and headed to the Yanzhou military district. Fang Zhou and other invited personnel from the Yanzhou military district and Yanzhou would gather at the outer spaceport. Nanfeng and the other two, one from a special forces team and the other two from the extraterrestrial garrison, stood tall and composed, showcasing their steel-like demeanor. In front of the personnel from Yanzhou's military district, they couldn't afford to embarrass Fang Zhao at a time like this. However, after boarding the aircraft, the two soldiers only glanced at the three of them indifferently before focusing their attention on Fang Zhao and Curls. The orders these two soldiers received were to take care of Fang Zhao and his dog. Nanfeng and the other two were not within their scope of care. The soldiers only needed to verify their identities. They did not especially come to pick up Fang Zhao, but after completing a mission, they were the closest to Fang Zhao's residence. That was why they were sent to pick him up. There was also a box of energy ore and some goods in the tightly shut energy cabin. They were all transported to the military region. This trip was just to pick up someone on the way. Curls quietly lay at Fang Zhao's feet as its pair of black eyes swept the surroundings. Licking its nose, Curls then looked up at Fang Zhao. Fang Zhao glanced at Curls and reached out to pat its head. Curls settled down again, lying down quietly. However, every now and then, it would lick its nose and jerk its jaw. A soldier who saw this asked, "Is he thirsty?" "Yes, he is. Nanfeng, please take out the bowl he drinks from," Fang Zhao instructed without a change in his expression. "Here!" Nanfeng took out the dog bowl and handed it over. Yan Biao watched this scene from the side and thought about how pampered pet dogs could be. Fang Zhao took the dog bowl and received the water from the soldier. After thanking him, he poured half a bowl of water and placed it in front of Curls. He pointed at Curls' head as a warning. Ever since Curls had completed its transformation, its diet had expanded, and so had its appetite. Fang Zhao even let it go out to forage for food yesterday. Thirsty? No, Curls was just a glutton. Of course, Fang Zhao would not tell the truth. He couldn't possibly do that. What could he say? That Curls was drooling at the energy compartment of the aircraft? Fang Zhao was a little worried. It seemed that he wouldn't feel at ease if he didn't keep Curls by his side. He had to keep a close eye on his pet during this trip. If he wasn't careful, Curls might just run off to gobble up something strange, leaving not even a crumb. Chapter 465 No One Was Allowed to Steal the Dog In the Yanzhou military district, several reporters were just about to interview a certain armored division who had just returned from a mission. They were discussing the upcoming interview activities when they heard the surprised words of one of the journalists. "Is that Fang Zhao?!" The others who heard that immediately looked over. "I think so!" "Judging from the dog beside him, that man must be Fang Zhao!" "What is he doing at the Yanzhou military district?" "I just noticed that they came down from a military aircraft. There are also two soldiers escorting them." "Interesting. What did he do this time?" A young reporter was about to take a few photos when he was stopped by others. After the young reporter calmed down, he regretted his impulsiveness. After entering the military district, no one was allowed to take photos as they wanted unless it was an arranged event. Therefore, even if they were extremely curious, they still had to control themselves. Otherwise, they would be chased out directly, and their professional career would end there. Even so, they would still gossip in private even if they did not take photos. "I think Fang Zhao is going to stir up trouble again." "The whole world has been talking about him nowadays. I thought he was busy with the matter of the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil. I didn't think we would get to see him here." "Now that I think about it, I haven't seen any updates from him recently. All the news online is about fossils; there's no mention of his whereabouts." "I heard from my friends that many entertainment reporters are watching him, but they can't find him. "The entertainment reporters nowadays have regressed. When I was young, they were crazy fast. They could dig up information that we haven't yet reported." Indeed, it was as these reporters had said. Because of the heated discussion raised by Sea Emperor Dragon, everyone naturally paid attention to Fang Zhao. However, what was different this time was that many investors also had their eyes on Fang Zhao. They analyzed the process of excavating the Sea Emperor Dragon and believed that Fang Zhao must have received advance information, which is why he was in such a hurry to buy the island. After analyzing Fang Zhao's path to fame, they felt that he would do something big every time he made a move. The Sea Emperor Dragon fossil incident was definitely not going to be the last thing he did! This time, they kept an eye on Fang Zhao and paid special attention to his movements. They wanted to know if he had secretly gone to dig up fossils or if he had found something valuable. However... He had disappeared again! Fang Zhao, including his assistant, bodyguards, and the dog that could dig fossils, had all f*cking disappeared! He didn't even attend the opening ceremony of the Sea Emperor Dragon exhibition. There must be something more important going on! But recently, no one heard anything about him attending any activities. They looked into it! They wanted to know if there are any movements from him recently. Or if he was going to stir up trouble again. However, there was still no news. Not to mention the investors who were sulking, the online audiences who were watching the show were also anxious when they saw that there was no progress. The last time Fang Zhao appeared in front of the public was in Yanzhou. The netizens of Yanzhou began to contribute to the online discussions. They did it according to the usual practice... "Wang Tie, you useless bum!" "Wang Tie! Come out and work!" "Look, Wang Tie, we even started a crowdfunding campaign. Are you seeing this? More than ten million people have already participated just after the launch. If I were to make a conservative estimate, it will definitely reach over a hundred million by this time tomorrow. As long as you can dig up information about Fang Zhao, all this money is yours! Are you surprised? Are you pleased? Are you happy?!" As a result, the rapidly rising popularity of the competition pushed Wang Tie onto the topic list. Wang Tie, who saw all these, could thank the netizens from the bottom of his heart. While the internet was bustling with noise and excitement, Fang Zhao had already turned around from the Yanzhou military district and headed for the spaceport. They needed to stay at the space port for two days before setting off for Hidden Star. In the spaceport, Fang Zhao met other artists who were invited to go to Hidden Star. He also bumped into an old friend. Back when they were involved in the filming of "Genesis," they collaborated with the professional antagonist and self-proclaimed ladies' man, Qiao Tingzheng, and his wife, Wensha. Wensha was invited to perform on Hidden Star, and this time, Qiao Tingzheng was accompanying her to Hidden Star as a family member. Qiao Tingzheng was delighted when he saw Fang Zhao. He said that he would come over and talk to Fang Zhao after he had put away his luggage. Nanfeng leaned over and whispered to Fang Zhao, "Boss, I saw the invited artists. You are the youngest of this batch." Which also meant that he had the lowest qualifications. Although Nanfeng hadn't finished his sentence, Fang Zhao understood what he meant. He had the least experience and might have to suffer some grievances. However, he was prepared for this. As he spoke, a middle-aged artist passed by them. His gaze swept over Curls, who was lying by Fang Zhao's feet, and he frowned, looking extremely dissatisfied. He then looked at Fang Zhao to say something. He opened his mouth, but in the end, he snorted and left in a huff. Fang Zhao, who had just gotten up and was about to greet the other party, was left confused. Fang Zhao knew the middle-aged artist who had stormed off for some unknown reason. He was David Heer, one of the top three violinists in the world. He was also the mentor of the famous "Fei Fei" Fei Hamernik, who was known for his lively, fiery red hair when he played the violin. Recently, it seemed that Fei Hamernik and Zaro had been engaged in a war of words online, exchanging criticisms and arguments from a distance. However, Fang Zhao hadn't been paying attention to their battle situation recently, so he didn't know what the results of the "battle" were. Unlike the high-profile Fei Hamernik who lept appearing in entertainment news, his teacher, David Heer was much more low-key. Apart from concerts and lectures, he rarely appeared in front of the public. Fang Zhao had never talked to this person before. Usually, he didn't have much interaction with him. This was the closest they had ever gotten. He had no idea what this world-class violinist was angry about. When David Heer was far away, Nanfeng came over and whispered to Fang Zhao, "I know the one who just passed by. He's a violin master. His student is Fei Hamernik, who has a high profile in the entertainment industry. People in the circle often compare Fei Hamernik to you. He probably doesn't have the best of impressions of you, Boss. "He was already biased to begin with. He's probably even more displeased, now that he saw you attending the performance with a dog." There were too many things like this in the industry. Nanfeng believed that he had found the truth. Even if not for the truth, it was still very close to the truth. Fang Zhao did not think that it was like what Nanfeng had said, but he really did not know where David Heer's anger came from. This question was only answered when Qiao Tingzheng came over to chat with him. "David Herr? Ah, him..." Qiao Tingzheng looked at Fang Zhao before tuning to Curls who lay beside Fang Zhao. "He must be angry because his application for his beloved dog was not approved. Before coming, I heard people comforting him by assuring him that dogs were not allowed during performances on other planets. He was already depressed. How can he not be angry when he saw you with a dog right after he arrived at the spaceport?" Qiao Tingzheng recounted the journey of this globally renowned violin master-turned-dog enthusiast to Fang Zhao. All of these stories were shared with him by his wife. "...... This maestro's current favorites, besides his violin, are his dogs. In comparison to these two, even Fei Hammerneck, his close disciple, has to take a step back. Behold, this is his beloved canine." Qiao Tingzheng showed Fang Zhao the saved picture of David Heer's beloved dog. David Heer's dog belonged to the artificial breeding type of dog in the New Era. It was combined with the genes of three elegant dog breeds from the old century as well as hunting dog traits. Its signature feature is the "long hair," which, when well-groomed, truly gave it an elegant appearance. Nanfeng also came over and glanced at it. "This maestro...seems to have a special fondness for long hair." Qiao Tingzheng laughed as well. "That's right. He really likes long hair." As he spoke, Qiao Tingzheng glanced once more at Curls by Fang Zhao's feet. "Your dog's mane isn't that long," he mused, "so he probably won't catch the maestro's interest. But you can rest assured; he's good with dogs. His feelings are more about envy and jealousy toward you. It's nothing serious. You don't need to let it bother you. He won't get angry at you for real." Qiao Tingzheng looked at Curls again. He knew that this dog had made big news recently. "Was the first fossil of the Sea Emperor Dragon really dug out by him?" Fang Zhao replied, "That's right." "I thought that the news was just spouting nonsense." Qiao Tingzheng looked at Curls as if he was looking at a rare treasure. Curls opened its mouth and stuck out its tongue. Drops of saliva dripped down before the canine licked its lips. It looked a little restless. "Is it too warm for Curls inside?" Qiao Tingzheng asked. Although he did not understand dogs, he had some common knowledge about them. For example, when a dog was hot, it would stick out its tongue, pant, and drool. No, that could not be considered saliva. It should be sweat from a dog, right? However, Qiao Tingzheng glanced at the indoor temperature and atmospheric pressure, both of which appeared to be perfectly normal. Logically, Curls shouldn't be acting this way. "He is just not used to it," Fang Zhao said calmly. "Right. It's usually difficult for pet dogs to adapt to the atmosphere of a spaceport. "I heard that dogs are afraid of heights. Going to outer space is also considered a type of height. Haha!" Qiao Tingzheng was amused by his own joke. Fang Zhao also smiled politely. However, he only grew more worried on the inside. This dog had gone to the sea to look for food the day before they set off. It had not frequently transformed and had not consumed much energy. So why was it hungry? It was just a glutton. The surplus of energy sources in the outer space spaceport was a tremendous temptation for Curls' expanding appetite. Fang Zhao even suspected that if he didn't keep a close eye on Curs. If the dog really started eating, it could eat up the entire spaceport. After seeing Curls' reaction, Fang Zhao strengthened his restraint on it. Curls also restrained itself a little because Fang Zhao had also taught it in private before. At the very least, it didn't drool despite its wandering eyes. Fang Zhao and the others, who had been invited to perform, would occasionally be called over for a meeting. It was impossible for him to keep Curls by his side all the time. Thus, he handed over the task of keeping a close eye on Curls to Nanfeng and the others. The reason he brought three people with him was to keep an eye on the dog. "Keep an eye on him." "Understood!" Nanfeng and the other two had solemn expressions on their faces. No one was allowed to steal the dog! Chapter 466 Be a Rational Fan Hidden Star was a global militarized place. In addition to a small number of places where people gathered, a large area of space was used for various products experiments and military exercises. The natural environment here was not suitable for human survival, but because of the rich energy mineral reserves of Hidden Star, the outer space military base was built here. More than ninety percent of the current cutting-edge aerospace technology originated from Hidden Star. From the moment of departure until their landing on Hidden Star, Fang Zhao and the others couldn't catch a glimpse of the outside world. During this period, they also signed non-disclosure agreements. In short, they were only invited to participate in the cultural performance. It was best for them to not be too curious about anything else. When Fang Zhao and his group disembarked from the spacecraft, they found themselves in the designated area of Hidden Star's landing zone. The unique nature of Hidden Star meant that very little real information about it was available online. Even the older members of the artistic delegation who had visited several times only possessed partial knowledge about art-related matters. They remained unaware of the rest and were cautious about delving too deeply into it. As someone who had come to Hidden Star for the first time, Fang Zhao did not know anything else, but he was certain that Hidden Star's energy mineral reserves were extremely abundant and the amount was quite high. After all, Curls' saliva had not stopped dripping. Stepping out of the spacecraft, they gazed upward and saw an immense protective shield enveloping the area. Without protective suits, they could only move about in indoor spaces. Despite that, there was no sense of constriction or crowding. "Over here is the accommodation arranged for all of you esteemed teachers," introduced a person dressed in Hidden Star's standardized attire. This was a reception center, dormitories, canteens, and activity areas. They had already been informed of some things that needed to be paid attention to. The confidentiality agreement had also been signed. For the next time, they just had to listen to the arrangements and cooperate with Hidden Star's band and dance troupe to perform a literary performance together. They could freely move about in their free time. In terms of accommodation, family members could live together, but the assistants and bodyguards were divided into another building. "Fang Zhao, your dormitory is over there," the guide informed. "Can I take the dog with me?" Fang Zhao asked. "Yes." Fang Zhao then took his room card and went to the assigned room. The interior space wasn't overly large, but it was well-equipped. Each unit had two bedrooms and a living room, complete with a bedroom and a study. The decor exuded a futuristic aura and bore a hint of artistic style. In addition, there was a dog bowl and a dog potty area. It was indeed thoughtful. After settling in, the team leader gathered them for a brief meeting to outline the plan for the upcoming days and allocate individual tasks. Among this invited group, there were musicians, dancers, actors, and even calligraphers and painters. Everyone had their own area of expertise. Upon arriving at Hidden Star, they would be collaborating with different partners. Fang Zhao was paired with members of a youth art troupe from Hidden Star. Most of the art troupe members on Hidden Star were amateurs, so professional standards couldn't be expected of them. "Fang Zhao, as the conductor of the youth orchestra, do you have any concerns?" the team leader inquired. "Not at all," Fang Zhao replied. The youth orchestra from Hidden Star had chosen to perform a grand piece composed by Mo Lang. It was the epic finale theme of the series "Genesis," a monumental ten-minute track titled "Legends." Regarding this, Mo Lang insisted that Fang Zhao must be the conductor. The reason behind this choice was that Fang Zhao had been involved in the composition process and understood this piece better than anyone else. This was also a test Mo Lang had given Fang Zhao. After the meeting, everyone went back to rest. They were arranged to visit the exhibition hall in the afternoon. Visiting these areas was exclusive to the invited participants; most of the accompanying staff members were not allowed entry. Even Qiao Tingzheng, as a family member, couldn't enter, let alone security guards or assistants. Therefore, Fang Zhao arranged for the Nan Feng trio to take care of the dog instead of tagging along with him. The exhibition halls here were predominantly filled with aerospace research products. Since it was Fang Zhao's first visit, he was greatly intrigued by these exhibits. Among the displays, what caught Fang Zhao's attention the most was the folding engine. The folding engine ushered in the era of space travel and was widely regarded as the greatest invention of the New Era. The guides in the exhibition were currently explaining the details of the engine. "In front of us is a part of the first generation of the folding engine. It was this invention that made spatial jumps possible. However, the energy required to maintain the stability of the engine far exceeded everyone's expectations. The old energy sources couldn't sustain the engine's operation. Consequently, people began searching for new energy alternatives..." The guides moved from discussing the folding engine to innovations in energy technology, and eventually to mineral extraction. However, they deliberately avoided mentioning the main points. For instance, they didn't delve into the birth and development process of the folding engine, its history, how long it took to develop, or its range of travel. None of the details about questions that particularly piqued Fang Zhao's curiosity were mentioned. However, those who had come along knew the unwritten rule here: they were to listen without asking too many questions. The information the guides omitted was certainly classified, and the guides would not share it regardless of how many questions were asked. For the others in the art troupe, the narration about the discovery of energy minerals, the advancement of energy conversion technology, and the categorization and extraction of energy minerals, all seemed like anecdotes to be merely acknowledged. Perhaps because Fang Zhao had prior knowledge about them, he listened intently to what was being explained. Fang Zhao might not be able to delve into the details of the folding engine, but he was keen to hear more about energy ore. The more he knew, the deeper his sense of wonder grew. It was all happening so rapidly! The breakthroughs in new energy and aerospace technology in the New Era had far exceeded Fang Zhao's expectations. During the Period of Destruction, Fang Zhao had repeatedly inquired with relevant researchers whether achieving cosmic travel was possible. Yet, the responses he received were, "Perhaps not even until the day humanity faces extinction will there be significant breakthroughs." However, at the end of the Period of Destruction, within the span of the New Era's first hundred years, the folding engine had been created, giving birth to the seven venerable "Dream Team" spaceships that stood as pioneers of space exploration in the New Era. This was probably something no one who lived through the Period of Destruction could have foreseen. A century might seem long, but Fang Zhao was acutely aware of the conditions during the latter part of the Period of Destruction. From his perspective, a hundred years might have been merely enough for recovery and rebuilding. In Fang Zhao's opinion, the actual development speed of the New Era could be considered a miracle. A folding engine could appear in the New Era in a hundred years. It had already been five hundred years since the New Era, and no one knew how far along the development it had been developed. It was a pity that he would not see it. However, he was grateful to be able to see a part of the first-generation folding engine. He was glad. Whatever emotions Fang Zhao harbored in his heart were his own, and the artists invited here might not necessarily share his sentiments. Therefore, their time at the exhibition hall was brief. Following that, there was a small-scale meet-and-greet session, where fans from various departments of Hidden Star came to meet their idols. There was a huge crowd here for the signings and group photos. Despite that, it was all well-organized. The unique management environment of Hidden Star made such fan gatherings incredibly efficient. The fans allowed to attend had undergone a selection process. There were many who wanted to come, but the numbers had to be controlled. Fang Zhao's fans included both the young and old.  Especially the older ones who had watched "Genesis: Continent," their gazes toward Fang Zhao held a hint of pity. Not far away, two organizers of the meet-and-greet and high-level management staff walked over. When they saw the long line on Fang Zhao's side, they smiled. "What a surprise. Fang Zhao has quite a few fans on Hidden Star!" "The children and elderly in my family like him. This kid is not bad. It's just a pity that he could not continue to stay in the army and get better." "Speaking of which, why haven't we seen Xiao Yuan? Wasn't he making a fuss about preparing a big gift for Fang Zhao?" "Yeah, I looked around and couldn't find him anywhere. "Ever since the list of invited artists was finalized, that little rascal Yuan Zheng has been pestering me with questions about the invited artists. I even gave him the schedule." "The meet-and-greet will only be for a limited time. There's only half an hour left." "Did he oversleep? Or did he get too engrossed in work and lose track of time? Or maybe he got assigned a last-minute task?" Hidden Star Folding Engine Technology Research Institute. At the security checkpoint near the institute's exit, a young man who appeared to be of a similar age to a college student sat impatiently on a chair, tapping his fingers on the table while constantly glancing at the time. Facing him was security personnel from the research institute. They had a neutral expression as they removed the last item from the gift box they had just finished inspecting and placed it neatly on the table. "So, you intend to present these..." The security personnel pointed to the table full of items. "An interstellar expedition fleet is giving a gift to a celebrity?" "That's right!" "But these haven't been made public yet. Not to mention the classified technologies involved, at least two of these models might not be disclosed within the next decade." "These are only models!" "Models are not allowed either. "Please be rational." Yuan Zheng took a deep breath. "I'm a fan, but I'm a rational fan. I'm different from those mindless fanatics who blindly worship without any limits! Please don't underestimate my intelligence!" "I don't doubt the intelligence of a Gold-level engineer." The security personnel maintained their composure. "Wasn't your previous idol the Star Maestro?" "My idol now is also the Star Maestro! He's the god in the hearts of all of us at the research institute! He is someone we can only look up to! But Fang Zhao is still more down-to-earth. "Fang Zhao is my idol. I just think he is super awesome! "What do we chase when we idolize someone? It's the brilliance that radiates from them! Fang Zhao is a shining giant in that respect! Just tell me, who else at his age has garnered so many accolades in the entertainment industry?" The security officer nodded to show that he understood. He knew Fang Zhao. The impact of crossing worlds was too great, not to mention that Fang Zhao still had military merits on him. There were very few people who had been invited here to participate in the performance in their 20s. Seeing that the other party's expression had loosened up, Yuan Zheng continued,  "Ever heard this saying? 'The target is ahead, and the idol is by your side.' It's a form of motivational spirit, you know! It's about progressing together, you know! I even have a poster of Fang Zhao in my room!" The security personnel nodded again in understanding. He had heard that when Fang Zhao won the Starry Award, the highest artistic award, Yuan Zheng had worked tirelessly and upgraded from a Silver-level engineer to a Gold-level engineer. Of course, he understood that young people who were avid fans of celebrities could be impulsive. When he was young, he also worshipped a basketball star in Mazhou. Unfortunately, that basketball star hadn't passed the screening and couldn't come. The individuals invited here had undergone rigorous screening; aside from their professional capabilities, their character, personality, and other factors were also considered. In comparison, Yuan Zheng was considered lucky. At least, as a fan, he could meet his idol in person. However, Fang Zhao was relatively young despite his strong abilities, which meant he might not be able to keep secrets well. It would be better not to give out the models of unreleased aircraft designs. Seeing the other person's expression becoming tense again, Yuan Zheng quickly played the emotional card. "Mister, you've watched me grow up. You know the kind of person I am. When facing my idol, of course I want to showcase my own accomplishments. "Mister, you've also had an idol before. I'm sure you understand where I'm coming from. Right now, I'm just making models of certain aircraft designs I've been involved in. I've blurred out some critical details. I have absolutely no intention of leaking anything!" "I do believe you, of course." The security personnel's expression eased slightly. However... "Secondary request denied." "Mister..." Yuan Zheng had a pitiful look on his face. "All models are being confiscated. I'm sorry, it's my duty." Yuan Zheng almost cried when he heard this. He had spent so much time preparing that space fleet model, only for it to be confiscated at the security checkpoint! Seeing Yuan Zheng sitting there dejectedly, looking as if he had been deeply affected, the security personnel let out a sigh. "Here's what I can do." Yuan Zheng looked up at the security personnel, his eyes filled with anticipation. Then, the security personnel picked up one of the spaceship models, disassembled a component in the engine area, and placed a small piece from the edge of that part in front of him. Yuan Zheng stood there dumbfounded and frustrated. Then, with a face full of desperation, he muttered, "Fang Zhao has come all this way to perform, and I'm giving him a...spare part?" The security officer responded expressionlessly, "This is the limit. "Boy, be a rational fan." Chapter 467 Second-Gen Fold By the time Yuan Zheng arrived at the meeting venue, the event was already over. The artists had already left on the return bus. There was no other way, so Yuan Zheng could only turn to the door. He couldn't miss the rare opportunity to meet his idol. For the artists who were invited to come, the schedule on their first day at Hidden Star was quite tight. The older ones among them were already looking weary and showing signs of fatigue. After returning from the meet-and-greet event, Fang Zhao went to fetch Curls. "Boss, is Curls still not used to the environment here? Why does it seem like he keeps salivating and panting?" Nan Feng expressed his concern. "He will get used to it in a few days," Fang Zhao said. Nan Feng pondered for a moment. "You're right. Adapting to the environmental conditions here at Hidden Star does take some time. Even when I arrived with Zuo Yu and Yan Biao, we felt a bit dizzy at first." Nan Feng handed over the newly acquired dog food and pet supplies to Fang Zhao. "The receptionists gave these to me and said to come collect more once we've used them up." Seeing that the other artists were looking tired and preparing to head back to rest, Nan Feng didn't say much more. "Boss, you should go back and rest for now. If there's anything, just contact us directly. We'll take care of things here. We're ready to assist anytime!" "Alright, you guys go back and rest too." Fang Zhao brought Curls back to his room and poured a bowl of dog food for the pup. Curls reluctantly started eating. It picked up each piece of food and ate them one by one, showing an appreciative demeanor. The food in the bowl would be gone after eating. Curls would have to wait four to five hours for the next meal. There was no other way, After arriving at Hidden Star, it couldn't just do as it pleased anymore. Besides the dog food, it couldn't eat anything else, and even the amount of food was restricted. "You have to learn how to control it. If you perform well, you can watch TV," Fang Zhao mentioned. "The TV broadcast here on Hidden Star is synchronized." Upon hearing that, Curls quickly finished the food in the bowl and then pushed the licked-clean dog bowl toward Fang Zhao, as if to say, "See, I didn't gulp down the bowl too. Am I behaving well?" "Alright, go watch TV by yourself." As Fang Zhao spoke, the dog rushed to the room and turned on the television, tuning it to a current affairs news channel, adopting a very serious dog-like posture. After a while, Fang Zhao went to the study. When Curls sneakily took a glance inside and saw that Fang Zhao was busy with his work, it changed the channel to a gaming and esports channel. It then watched a live match with great enthusiasm. Inside the study, Fang Zhao let out a silent sigh. He wasn't unaware of Curls' little actions; he was simply pretending not to notice. It was good as long as he could divert its attention a bit and prevent it from constantly drooling all over the place. After tidying up the musical scores in his hands, Fang Zhao continued refining his plan. For this performance, Fang Zhao was going to rework "Legends" and infuse it with new vitality. The revised musical score had already been shown to and approved by Mo Lang. When it came to understanding the work and the composer's intentions, Mo Lang only trusted Fang Zhao. As a result, Fang Zhao had a lot on his plate. Next, he needed to communicate with the members of the orchestra, supervise their rehearsals, identify flaws in the process, and provide solutions. Just as he was sorting out the plan, the doorbell rang. Fang Zhao hadn't hung a "Do Not Disturb" sign on his door, and he didn't know who could be coming to see him at this hour. The other artists had all gone back to rest by now. When he opened the door, there was a young man and two soldiers standing at the door. His gaze swept over the golden badge that the young man was wearing. Fang Zhao was astonished. Although he had just arrived at Hidden Star, Fang Zhao already knew the corresponding level of the badge. The two soldiers should be protecting this young man. Individuals at the Gold-level rank would have someone responsible for their security when they go out. However, to be able to reach the level of a golden badge at such a young age, he must be an extremely important talent. It was only right for someone to protect him. When the young man in front of him saw Fang Zhao, his expression was both excited and a little reserved. "Hello, F-F-Fang Zhao! My name is Yuan Zheng! I am your hardcore fan!" His words, especially the last three words, were forceful and loud. The two soldiers behind him were speechless. What happened to the "rational fan" the young man said he was just a while ago? They even wondered if he misspoke due to his nerves. However, Yuan Zheng did not realize that he had said something wrong. He did not even remember what he had just said. His mind was only filled with the excitement of seeing his idol. "Fang Zhao, did I disturb you?" Yuan Zheng scratched his head in embarrassment. "Not at all. Please, come in," Fang Zhao offered with a smile. "Aye! Thank you, Fang Zhao!" When Yuan Zheng entered the room, the two soldiers followed him into the room. Yuan Zheng snapped back to reality and hurriedly explained, "Fang Zhao, these two are here to protect me. According to the rules, when we go out, we need at least two soldiers to protect us." "Of course." Fang Zhao poured two cups of water for the two soldiers and handed them over. He then looked at Yuan Zheng. In the presence of his idol, Yuan Zheng tried his best to showcase his achievements. Before coming to Fang Zhao's place, he had adorned all the medals he had received. He even polished and wore the small gold badge symbolizing the engineering level at Hidden Star as he was determined not to embarrass himself in front of his idol. "I was born on Hidden Star and currently hold the Gold-level rank at the Hidden Star Folding Engine Technology Research Institute. Both my parents are folding engine engineers as well. I'm the second generation of engineers in my family. Fang Zhao, you can also call people like us 'Second-Gen Fold!' I've been involved in many significant projects..." "Ahem!" As soon as Yuan Zheng started to speak, a soldier sitting next to him coughed and reminded him that there were some things he could not say. Yuan Zheng, who was interrupted, paused, saving the words related to "important projects." He continued, "In any case, I am very powerful! In terms of geniuses, I am number one in our research institute. Apart from Little Bear who came not long ago, I am the youngest gold-level engineer in our research institute!" When he said this, Yuan Zheng was still a little aggrieved. In the past, he was indeed the number one genius in the research institute. Ever since that child surnamed Bear came over, he had been pushed down the number-one throne. "I knew that you were coming, and I prepared a big gift! I personally made a model of a fleet! Unfortunately, there was only one component left after the inspection... I wasn't able to make it to the meet-and-greet in the afternoon. The more he spoke, the quieter his voice became. He squeezed out an awkward and sad smile on his face and handed over the fingernail-sized component in his hand. After a fleet model went to an inspection, there was only one small component left. Yuan Zheng couldn't do anything about it. This was already the bottom line of the security personnel. There was no exception even for a genius engineer like him. Yuan Zheng did not have any other gifts in his hands. This time, in order to hurry, he did not prepare enough. He could only give out the component first. "Fang Zhao, you and everyone else will still stay on Hidden Star for a while. I'll go back and make another gift that will allow you to smoothly pass security!" "This is good enough." Fang Zhao took over the small, inconspicuous component. "This is a part of the folding engine model, right?" "Yes!" Yuan Zheng still wanted to say something, but he held back when the soldier beside him coughed. Yuan Zheng felt wronged. It was too difficult. It was way too hard for a gold-level engineer to be an avid fan of celebrities. He wasn't allowed to say this and that, and he couldn't even send out the gift he prepared. He was too embarrassed to speak to his idol! Yuan Zheng racked his brains to think of a way to explain himself. When he raised his head, he found Fang Zhao looking at him. Fang Zhao had a benevolent smile on his face. Yuan Zheng met Fang Zhao's gaze and was left confused. Before Yuan Zheng could understand the meaning behind Fang Zhao's gaze, he saw Fang Zhao take out a palm-sized box and hand it over. Inside was the Sea Emperor Dragon's dragon bone frame model. "For...me?" Yuan Zheng was so excited that he stuttered. Fang Zhao nodded. Yuan Zheng stretched out his hands and received it solemnly, looking like he was receiving an imperial edict. "Fang Zhao, can you sign on the base of the model?" "Sure." Fang Zhao found a suitable pen and signed it on the base of the Sea Emperor Dragon skeletal model. Worried that it would affect Fang Zhao's rest, Yuan Zheng did not stay for long and quickly left. When he left, Yuan Zheng held the box containing the Sea Emperor Dragon model in his arms. After he walked some distance, his eyes were red. "I'm so touched! I only sent out an incomplete part, and I actually received Fang Zhao's gift!" However, the two soldiers who were following him could not understand his feelings. "According to the rules, the foreign gift you received must be checked. "Please cooperate." Although the luggage that the invited artists brought had all been checked, Yuan Zheng still had to check again when he received the gift. This was also to protect his personal safety. Yuan Zheng handed over the model box reluctantly. "Be careful. Don't break the bones, especially the base. Don't rub off the signature!" When Yuan Zheng returned to the research institute, Fang Zhao did not continue his previous work. Instead, he looked at the small gift he had just received. Although Yuan Zheng had revealed very little information, Fang Zhao could still speculate some things from it. Combined with the various questions he had before, he had a guess. He remembered the words Barbara had said when he first discovered the Alkaid. "The 'Dream Team' of the veteran exploration teams carries the pinnacle of wisdom from that era!" "The pinnacle of wisdom from that era..." Fang Zhao looked at the small part in his hand and whispered. Alkaid of the "Dream Team" existed 400 years ago. Yuan Zheng had just mentioned "Little Bear." It was very likely that it was the child who seemed to have a mechanical core that he had seen before. It had once existed on the Alkaid. Being able to achieve perfect camouflage within a crowd isn't something an ordinary artificial intelligence could do. During the Period of Destruction, Fang Zhao had also come into contact with many great scientists of that era. He knew that every time humanity's wisdom flashed, the development of the world would experience a leap. However, how high was the possibility of multiple flashes of wisdom within just one hundred years since the establishment of the New Era overlapping with artificial intelligence, energy technology, folding engines, spacefaring vessels, and more? During this period, the world also had to recover from catastrophic devastation, engage in urban planning and reconstruction, and establish a new order across the twelve continents, all after enduring a massive disaster. "Is it a burst of wisdom, or..." Fang Zhao's gaze focused on the small component in his hand. It was as if he was looking at an even older picture through this small component. There was another possibility. "Extraterrestrial beings." There were visitors from outer space. Chapter 468 I'm Just a Baby Fang Zhao was still unable to confirm what the real situation was. However, he understood the situation. If there were from outer space, the most likely "aliens" would be the legendary Father of the Folding Engine and the founder of the Interplanetary Fund, Star Maestro. He had brought too many changes and also created the special status of the Interplanetary Fund. Fang Zhou didn't know what the purpose of the "outsiders" was and how many of them there were, but at least now it seemed that they were not hostile and had cultivated many top talents. However, all of this was just speculation. Fang Zhao recalled the impact of seeing this new world when he had "resurrected" in that small rented apartment on Black Street. Looking at the inconspicuous little part in his hand, Fang Zhao smiled and put it into the box. "The future has come." Hidden Star Folding Engine Technology Research Institute. Inside the security checkpoint, the same security officer was dealing with different individuals to be inspected. A child wearing a golden badge was lying on the table, crying. "Boohoo! You can't detain my Little Riches! My Little Riches! Boohoo!" Alternating between restraint and exuberance, the child had tears pouring down his face. With red eyes and trembling lips, he would let out a hiccup from time to time, making all the security officers sitting on the opposite side of the table feel guilty. The security officer usually had a single expression on his face, but it was rare for him to show a distressed expression. How could he have known that this child would cry when he did not agree? What a headache. The security officer lowered his voice. "That black ball... I mean, your Little Riches is still being examined." When he spoke to this gold engineer who was even more talented than Yuan Zheng, he was afraid that his voice would scare the child. However, as soon as he finished speaking, the engineer burst into tears again. "It has already been 15 minutes and seven seconds! Why is the security inspection so slow?! Has my Little Riches gotten in an accident?" The child on the table did not even raise his head, and his tears poured even more. The security officer looked at the time on the screen on the wall and quietly mused. As expected of an engineer with a golden badge, the child could accurately determine the time without actually looking at the clock. However, the situation was complicated, so it would take a longer time for an inspection. Before this, Yuan Zheng's fleet model had taken a longer time. Only 15 minutes had passed. After another five minutes, a black ball was sent over. Looking at the approval indicator above, the security officer quickly handed the black ball over and pinched it when he handed it over. It felt good in his palms, and it was suitable for reducing stress. It was no wonder the child liked it. After Little Bear took back Little Riches, he cried, "And my Dogball and Leftovers! How did they violate any rules? I would feel lonely and scared without them!" "Those fall under dangerous items. They can't be taken out without permission. "And rest assured about your safety. We will send someone to protect you." "I want them! My Dogball and Leftovers... Those pitiful things..." As he cried, he took out a bottle of water from his backpack and noisily gulped it all down. He continued to cry after he was done drinking. The security officers continued to have a headache. They had already asked their superiors for instructions. How should they deal with the two mechanical dogs? That was indeed Little Bear's personal belongings, but they were also equipped with weapons. They needed to be treated with caution. While painfully waiting for the time, the security officer flipped through the drawer, took out a lollipop, and handed it over. "Come, have some candy. Don't cry." Little Bear sobbed and put the lollipop into his pocket, then continued to sob. The security officer was baffled. "My head hurts." As Little Bear sniffled, a reply finally came. The security officer let out a long breath and pulled out a smile that he thought was friendly. "Alright, it has been approved. You can take your Little Riches, Dogball, and Leftovers and leave. However, you still have to abide by the rules when playing outside." "Okay!" The crying stopped, and Little Bear jumped down from the chair. He held the two mechanical dogs in one hand, the black ball in the other, and left. Everyone else at the security check only quietly watched him. They thought that it was impressive how quickly his mood changed. A drama queen, that was what Little Bear was! Were all the children nowadays this impressive? The security officers felt that they had learned a lesson from what happened today. Little Bear, who had already run out, was very proud. It's great to act like a child. Being young meant being able to be willful! The people at the research institute were quite tolerant toward child prodigies. Currently, the institute was developing the next generation of folding engines, and Little Bear has made significant contributions. In comparison, his occasional tantrums were minor issues, so everyone tended to indulge him. However, when it came to the development of folding engines, Little Bear was quite dissatisfied. He had been driving the Alkaid for four hundred years, but he had only made so little progress. It was too slow! Back in the day, the pace of development was incredible when they had those seven super geniuses and a Star Maestro! Engine upgrades were swift, and their efficiency was remarkable. Now, this current group struggles to keep up even in piloting the spacecraft. It was a pity that after 400 years, the other six super intelligences either turned traitors and were destroyed or went dormant due to malfunctions. Until now, he was the only one capable of getting things done. There were seven super-intelligent beings who had accompanied Star Maestro back then. Now, he was the only one left. This was simply...exhilarating! Ha! No one could bully Little Bear anymore! He was the greatest! The six people who used to walk all over him were finally out of his way! So what if they were the same species? Human beings were much more fun! Especially these weak and harmless ones here. Little Bear loved to play with these emotional species! He could just make a few more playmates whenever he was bored. Little Bear was satisfied with his current life. Ever since he returned from the Alkaid, his days had been carefree. There was just one tiny thing he had an issue with... Why did he have to work?! He was still a baby! He was a baby 400 years ago, and he was still a baby 400 years later! The world was a beautiful place, and he hadn't had enough fun! He wouldn't have come here if not for the sake of repaying a debt. Not only were his actions restricted, but he even needed to pass through security checks when he went out after work. He also almost had Little Riches confiscated! He had to be followed when he went out. Little Bear glanced at the two soldiers behind him and pouted, dissatisfied. He learned how to pout from a child star on TV. It was said that this would make him cuter and more likable. However, Little Bear only pouted and acted like a weak child in front of outsiders. If he deliberately acted cute in front of the great demon Cuihua, he would definitely be beaten up. Although Star Maestro had passed away, the descendants of the stars, such as Cuihua, still had the means to suppress him. To Little Bear, Cuihua was a great devil who always made him work overtime for no reason. Little Bear only borrowed some money to buy music copyrights. Was it necessary to send him to this place filled with workaholics? Fortunately, Little Bear was good at pretending to be a child. Little Bear continued to be pleased with himself. He liked how this bunch of weak humans treated him like a minor. It saved him a lot of trouble. Apart from the upper echelons of Hidden Star City and some core managers of the Inter-planetary Fund, no one here knew his true age. Hehe! When he thought of this, Little Bear was happy again. So be it if he worked overtime, as long as he had something to play with! Little Bear was contemplating how to come up with excuses in the future to take a leave and go have fun. He walked with a swagger, holding the dog and adopting the air of a mischievous delinquent patrolling the streets as he headed toward the reception area. He wanted to play with Fang Zhao. At the research institute, he heard people mention Fang Zhao. The artists invited by Hidden Star Art Show had already arrived today. As Fang Zhao knew his background and had a good temper, Little Bear was willing to interact more with him. At least in front of Fang Zhao, he could act cute as he pleased and did not have to worry about being beaten up by Fang Zhao. The last time Fang Zhao heard Little Bear say that he cried while watching "Genesis," Fang Zhao had even reminded him to drink more water. What a good person Fang Zhao was! The receptionist recognized Little Bear quite easily. There was no mistaking a young child with a gold medal and two mechanical dogs. He was quite a unique figure on the entire Hidden Star. Moreover, Little Bear had lived with them for two days when he first came to the Hidden Star. Everyone had a deep impression of him. However, because of Little Bear's level as an engineer, no one usually called him "Little Bear", "Master Bear", "Master Bear", and "Master Bear."Instead, they called him "Master Bear." Everyone was always tolerant of this kind of high-level technical talent. After all, he was just a child! When the manager of the reception department saw Little Bear come over and heard that he was looking for Fang Zhao, he personally took him upstairs to find Fang Zhao. When he entered the elevator, Little Bear took out a lollipop from his pocket and handed it to the manager. Bribes were not accepted, but a lollipop was a gesture of goodwill. Given that it was from a child, the building manager didn't refuse. After accepting the lollipop and expressing gratitude, he smiled kindly and extended his hand to pat Little Bear's head. But when his gaze swept over the gold medal Little Bear was wearing, he retracted his hand. The head of an engineer was not something that could be touched just because he wanted to. This was a form of respect for high-level talents! In Fang Zhao's room. Curls, who was watching the live broadcast of the gaming channel, licked his nose. He struggled to move his gaze away from the television screen and turned to look at the door. Then, he walked over to the door and lay down, his clear eyes staring at the door. Fang Zhao, who had edited the music score, also looked at the closed door. On the other side of the door. Little Bear approached step by step, but the closer he got to the door, the smaller his steps became, and the slower he became. His ruddy face turned pale as beads of sweat began to appear. He came to a stop. He had been too carried away with himself that he overlooked an important detail. He remembered it now. In Little Bear's hand, Little Riches, which had just been stretched out, once again formed a perfect circle. Seeing Little Bear suddenly stop, the building manager informed, "Fang Zhao's room is just ahead. It is less than five meters away." "No, I don't think it is a good time. It is better not to disturb him." Little Bear shook his head with all his might and did not take a step forward. Seeing that Little Bear was sweating non-stop, the building manager panicked. He could not let anything happen to this kind of genius! "Are you feeling unwell? I'll take you to the infirmary downstairs!" he offered as he was about to contact the medical staff. "No, no. I just thought of an important matter. I'll be leaving first! Bye-bye!" The "delinquent" kid, holding his dogs, turned around and sneaked away. Running out of the reception desk in one breath, Little Bear wiped his sweat and used his employee card to swipe a bottle of water from the self-service water dispenser. He gulped down a whole bottle of water. He was severely dehydrated today; he needed to replenish his fluids. Glancing at the seemingly oblivious Dogball and Leftovers, he lamented, "I can't believe I actually spent my entire salary to create you two idiots!"
