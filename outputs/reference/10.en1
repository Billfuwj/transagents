Chapter 1064 Cross-border Bombing It was impossible for Finnish authorities not to know that a riot had occurred on the tundra in the north, but they remained silent about it. The trouble was brought by the people from the Arrowhead Company. Worse still, it happened within their "private territory". Since the people who died were not Finns, and the Arrowhead Company did not ask for help, why would they meddle? The local police bureau in Partak Town dispatched several mounted policemen to wander around the refugee camp. However, these policemen did not dare to rush in. They showed their faces and then retreated. These policemen could not deal with the armed rioters. The sheriff of Partak immediately made a decision. He mobilized the local militia organizations to establish defense lines in the town and did their best to ensure the safety of the town. It turns out he made the right choice. In less than half an hour, a document was issued to urge the local police to do their utmost to protect the safety of Partak Town. Meanwhile, a special force was sent out to provide support. The refugee camp would be taken over by the Finnish Defence Forces hundreds of kilometers away. Nominally taken over by the Finnish Defence Forces. Through the intelligence from the Federal Security Service of Russia, Jiang Chen learned about this. Finland's official silence surprised Jiang Chen. He had thought that Finland would send a quick counterforce to stabilize the situation, but he had not expected their reaction so calm. It seemed like Carmen probably did evil in this military base again. Or did he think that by relying on the two brigades in the base, it's more than enough to wipe out the mob? No matter how Carmen reacts, Jiang Chen's plan would be executed step by step. Most of the refugees were from the Middle East, and many had served in militia organization or as reservists and received basic military training. It was definitely impossible to count on these people to drive tanks. But  they were capable of operating mortars. At least, they would not throw artillery shells on their own heads. As the second batch of equipment entered Partak from the border of Russia, Sarmi leveraged his rapidly accumulated prestige to establish guerrilla forces with ten thousand people from the refugee camp and used the slogan of "only by completely wiping out the heathen army can the oppression end" to mobilize the entire refugee camp to fight against the Arrowhead Company to the death. Boxes of ammunition were carried onto battered vans and trucks, and workers took welding torches from factories and welded heavy machine guns to the pickup trucks. There was no doubt that the mob had no fighting power at all. Under the same circumstances, it had no chance of winning against trained mercenaries. However, Jiang Chen was full of confidence in winning the war. The reason was quite simple. Firepower is more important than marksmanship! At two o 'clock in the morning, six hours after the riot, only two thousand people were left to defend. The armed soldiers led by Sarmi went on their way again headed to Arrowhead Company to "rescue" those who had gone astray. The vast army arrived at the taiga two kilometers away from Arrowhead Company and then spread out to surround the military base. Under the command of several veterans, the armed militants took iron shovels and hoes to dig out simple emplacements. Hundreds of mortars were placed in dozens of artillery positions. With the launch of a flare, the "whoosh" sound of hundreds of mortars spreading throughout the tundra, and clusters of exploding firelight covered the entire military base, making the armed mercenaries dizzy. The mercenaries stationed in the military base were welltrained. The moment they encountered the bombardment, they rushed to shelters. Meanwhile, the scouts in the military base began counter-attacking the mortar positions of the mob based on the coordinates fed back by the howitzers. However, these mortars were too scattered, and the cannonballs thrown from all directions caused artillerymen in the military base to be exhausted. Although they were all experts in the artillery, there were a dozen times as many on the other side. A mortar shell landed on the roof of the headquarters, blowing up a corner of the concrete fortification. Muddled by the dust from the ceiling, Brigadier Arno steadied himself by holding onto the table and looked out the window angrily. "Shit! Where did these bugs get so many mortars?!" The sudden barrage caught everyone off guard. They had expected that rioters would charge toward their machine gun bunkers with rifles in their hands, but they didn't expect them to use weapons to bombard the ground. "Undoubtedly, it was Star Ring Trade that sent them the mortars," Salders glanced around the table as he returned to the tactical map, "Guys, we can't hold on any longer. Nobody knows how many shells they have. The man who supplied them with the weapons is a real jerk." Arno, take your men out and annihilate them. Show them that modern warfare cannot be solved by numbers alone." ”Yes sir!” Arno saluted at attention, took off the interphone from the arrowhead, and gave orders to the various units in the army. After that, the gate of the military base was opened and a dozen Humvees roared out, followed by four Cougar armored vehicles, rushing toward the mob. Under Jiang Chen's instructions, Sarmi decisively ordered his men to lead the guerrilla forces of two thousand soldiers to block the mob with anti-armor weapons. The front line of the battle was located at the edge of the forest with huge pine trees. Immediately after encountering the mob's guerrillas, Arrowhead's Humvees and armored vehicles slowed down and fired at the mob with the heavy machine guns welded to the roofs of the vehicles. The mercenaries also jumped out of their vehicles one after another and sought cover to shoot the mob. However, they had obviously underestimated the anti-armor  capabilities of the mob. Just as the mercenaries were shooting with machine guns, various high-explosive and armor-piercing RPGs were flying around in the pine forest. Although their accuracy was extremely low, they were large in number. The reactive armour hanging on the four armored vehicles were all destroyed, and only one of them retreated with its armour intact. Of course, it was still not enough to make up for the amateurish performance of these mobsters in the war. Although the sudden RPGs caught Arrowhead's armored units by surprise, these mobsters were no match for the regular armed forces, even without armored vehicles. In less than ten minutes, Sarmi's army lost more than two hundred soldiers, while Arrowhead Company suffered more than fifty casualties. Sarmi was panic and quickly called Jiang Chen to ask for help. "Our troops on the front line starts to collapse. Their marksmanship is so accurate! Many of our soldiers touch guns for the first time. We can't defeat them at all." "Don't worry, it'll be all right soon." Jiang Chen's words stunned Sarmi. All right soon? What are you talking about? Just as Sarmi was stunned, the ground trembled. Then a loud explosion came from afar. The shockwave rippled through the pine forest, swept across the tundra, and even brushed the fringe of his forehead. Before Sarmi figured out what was going on, he saw thick smoke rising from the military base. He could not help but open his mouth in surprise. Standing on the hillside on the other side of the battlefield, Jiang Chen saw the gorgeous fireworks through the binoculars. He couldn't help but smile. It seemed that the Alpha Group had made it. (To be continued.) Chapter 1065 The Doomsday of the Arrowhead Company Under the attack of the mortars, the base was extremely chaotic, and no one noticed that such a special force had infiltrated the camp. Without much effort, Kutepov placed beacons on the designated targets, then led his team out of the base. Upon arriving at the evacuation point, he called for an air attack. Soon, the Russian stealth bombers roared above the clouds, dropping four aerial bombs that accurately hit two ammunition depots and two fuel depots in the base. The shockwave of the explosion swept throughout the entire camp, blowing down the surrounding concrete buildings. The explosive ammunition and burning fireballs flew across the camp, causing a cascade of reactions, with flames, blood and corpses everywhere. Nearly half of the Guard Brigade stationed in the camp were instantly killed, and most of the remaining people were injured, making it almost impossible to find a complete person. Medics carried stretchers across the base, searching for the incapacitated wounded. Sappers wore heavy anti-explosion suits and rushed into the fire to drag out the ammunition that had not yet exploded from the ruins. Alll soldiers who could still move stood up and looked for their own troops to assemble. Salders looked at the fire outside the window. His dull eyes were full of despair. The thick smoke covered the entire base, and the flames dyed the night sky red, almost like the end of the world. "Sh*t." Muttering to himself, he moved his legs that felt like lead weights and slowly left the window. Turning around, he was in line of sight with the staff officer. "Sir, what should we do?" The aftermath of the explosion finally subsided. The sound of explosion in the base disappered. However, no one was able to calm down. The mercenaries who had escaped from the explosion knew very well that their nightmare was approaching. The previous explosion seemed to have ignited some sort of signal, sounding the trumpet for the Sarmi's army to attack. Under Jiang Chen's instructions, Sarmi seized this fleeting opportunity. He stood in front and shouted loudly, leading the remaining rioters to the front line. More than six thousand people ran on the taiga, rushing towards the burning pine forest. Looking from afar, it was such a spectacular scene. Meanwhile, looking at the thick smoke rising from the base behind, all the mercenaries fighting on the front line fell into panic, their originally high morale plummeted to the bottom in an instant. When faced with a tidal wave of mob, even if they had the strength to stabilize their defenses, they had no intention of fighting anymore. Undoubtly, the defense line of Arrowhead Company was broken, and the recalcitrant mercenaries collapsed in the face of the huge-crowd strategy of Sarmi's Army. Some of them fled back to the burning base, but most of them fled into the depths of the woods. Without Jiang Chen's instrctions, even a pi knew what to do at this time. Watching Sarmi lead the rioters to attack the military base, Jiang Chen put down the binoculars and summoned the off-road motorcycle from the storing space he had prepared before. He gently patted Ayesha on the back. "It's time to move. Let's go." "Uh-huh!" Ayesha nodded. After Jiang Chen got on the motorcycle, she nimbly sit behind him. The engine roared and the tires scraped a layer of snow. Jiang Chen rode on the off-road motorcycle and rushed down the hill. He brought Ayesha to the side of the base and parked the motorcycle by the side of the road. He took out a laser sword from the storing space and casually waved it. He effortlessly cut open the defense wall made of steel wire. The entire base was immersed in fire and chaos, with occasional bursts of mortars. All the mercenaries capable of carrying guns stepped up to the front line, fighting with the rioters for control of the main entrance of the base. Apart from a guard squad guarding in front of the headquarters, there was no one else in the rear. For Jiang Chen and Ayesha, it was no different from being defenseless. There were ten guards, two guards stood on the sentry tower, and the other eight stood at the entrances of the first and second floor respectively. Ayesha took out her Ghost Sniper Rifle and silently killed the two guards standing on the sentry tower. She then used dead corner of the vision to kill eight people upstairs and downstairs one by one. After Ayesha killed the guards outside the headquarters, Jiang Chen took out his rifle and walked to the main door. Just as he passed the Hummer at the door, he bumped into Salders, who escaped from the headquarters, and the staff officer. When their gazes met, they were stunned. Staff officer immediately reached into his chest for the gun, but before his hand could touch his chest, Ayesha, who reacted faster, blew his head off. Salders wanted to resist, but Jiang Chen  easily controlled him and pressed his hands against the Hummer. "Salders, female, 43 years old. You're the general manager and the supreme commander Salders. Am I right?" Although it was the first time they met, the holographic helmet connected to the Ghost Agents Database on Jiang Chen's head stored his image and personal information. At a glance, the information about Salders was projected onto the holographic screen. Though his face was pressed against the hood of the car, Salders was quite strong-willed. He was unwilling to surrender. He gnashed his teeth, saying, "I won't say anything. Just kill me..." "Kill you? I haven't asked anything yet." Jiang Chen grinned. He didn't care about his uncooperative attitude. He took out a needle with his right hand and stabbed it into Salders' back shoulder. "Ouch!" A roar of resistance came from his throat. Salders widened his bloodshot eyes, but soon his pupil became dim. Jiang Chen released his hands. There was no precedent for an ordinary person to resist after being injected with truth-telling drug. Jiang Chen turned Salders over and asked him word by word, "Where is Carmen?" "Inside the institute of the underground bunker." "Where is the underground bunker?" "Its entrance is in the middle of the base. You can only enter it through the lift. There are two airfields right next to the entrance. You can see them if you walk over there. In this way, Jiang Chen quickly obtained the information he wanted. "Very good, you will die as wished." Jiang took out a pistol and shot him in the head, then threw his corpse aside. It was a pretty quick way to die, but for Mr. Salders, the famous general manager of Arrowhead Company, dying in obscurity was perhaps more painful than the death itself... If the dead could feel the pain. "Underground bunker?" Looking at the center of the base, Jiang Chen sneered. No matter what Carmen was plotting, his good luck came to an end. The fate of the Rothschild family would be like what they had started. The family rose in a war and disappeared in obscurity because of another war... However, at this time, a shrill scream came from afar. (To be continued.) Chapter 1066 Iblis! A shrill scream pierced through the entire battlefield, even covering the explosive sound of bullet leaving the bores. In the fierce firefight between the mercenaries and the rioters, a black shadow suddenly broke into the battlefield. With the light from the flares, everyone saw the appearance of the monster clearly. Its legs were like bows, and its arms resembled jet-black scimitars. Its long, spindle-shaped mouth was inlaid with sharp teeth the size of rice grains. Besides, it had two pairs of short wings on its back, making it look like a human-shaped mantis. The battle paused for two seconds. Everyone was stunned by what they saw. However, the moment the battle stopped, the "mantis" moved. The bow-shaped legs suddenly bounced off, and the seven-foot tall body shot out unscientifically like a cannonball. Before the rioter closest to him could react, his head was cut off by the interlaced blades, and his arteries gushed with blood as he fell backwards. When the prey fell to the ground, the monster's shuttle-shaped mouth suddenly poked into the broken neck. With a burst of cracking sound, the monster ate the bone marrow and flesh of the prey. The way the monster drank blood was as cruel as a wild beast. Even the red-eyed believers couldn't control the tumbling of their stomachs at this moment, and their legs and stomachs trembled as they retreated. "Iblis..." It was the name of the devil, just like Satan in the Bible. "It's Iblis!" Somebody shouted so loudly, and then the screams rang out one after another. The rioters raised the G36 and fired at the monster. However, the mantis only raised its blades and allowed the bullets to hit the horn armor. It was not afraid of the 5.56mm bullets. Worse still, there was more than one mantis-shaped monster! More than ten black shadows jumped out of the underground bunker one after another, brandishing their blades as they charged towards the mob. Once they got close, the only thing waiting for rioters was the fate of being slaughtered. Apart from the mantises, there was a maggot-shaped fat creature that spewed highly corrosive saliva. Even something as hard as steel and cement had been destroyed by its powerful corrosiveness, let alone humans. Faced with the legendary devil, the believers finally began to fear. Just as they came, the rioters were defeated uncontrollably. However, the cheered excitedly. They came here to help us! Although they looked a bit disgusting. Their cheers did not last long and a similar nightmare soon befell them. Numerous spores floated out of the underground bunker and slowly spread across the entire camp, almost imperceptible in the dark night. The first batch of people who contacted with these spores began to have difficulty breathing, and then the tearing pain began to spread through their chests. They screamed and scratched their skin, letting the blood to flow. Soon, they lose all senses and become something like the walking dead. Except for those who were completely wrapped in kinetic skeletons survived, those who were in the battlefield, regardless of whether they were friends or foes, were all engulfed by the spores. In order to survive, the mercenaries and the rioters turned their guns to face their common enemies. However, from the very beginning, they had no chance of winning. "Holy sh*t! What is that thing?" The monster that looked like a deathclaw pounced over. Jiang Chen pedaled on its chest with cold sweat. Throwing away the empty rifle, he took out the laser sword and waved it twice to cut off one of its arms. Green blood spurted out and was vaporized into mist by the scorching sword. While the monster screamed and retreated, Jiang Chen didn't chase after it. His right hand, holding the sword handle, shook, and a rotating light blade separated from the handle, cutting off half of the monster's face. Fortunately, he did not forgotten the martial arts he had learnt, otherwise he would have been caught off guard. On the other side, Ayesha raised the Ghost Sniper Rifle and coldly shot the heads of the two mutant creatures. "There are so many of them. We'd better leave here," Jiang Chen picked up the PK2000 on the ground and reloaded the gun, "Prepare to retreat." Ayesha nodded but did not move. "I'll cover the rear" "You go first, hurry up!" Jiang Chen patted Ayesha's shoulder and pushed her behind him. He raised his rifle and killed a few zombies staggering toward him. Yes, they are zombies. However, they were different from the zombies he met in Cagayan City. These zombies did not seem to be infected by the virus, and they were somewhat similar to the ones on the wasteland. [Warning: Unknown bacteria detected in the air. The filters have been automatically turned on. If you need to close them, please...] When he saw the two lines projected on the screen of the helmet , Jiang Chen immediately understood what they were. They were too similar to each other. He had seen these creatures in Wanghai City. Without any hesitation, Jiang Chen used his supreme command authority in Star Ring Trade to bypass all the decision-making levels and went straight to the Electric Ray C-1 deployed on the synchronous orbit. He SET the entrance OF underground bunker in the center of the base as a target and called for the air attack. As for diplomatic disputes, let's make concessions in the face of human survival! It's not a big deal to lose some money. This is Electric Ray C-1. The target of air attack has been confirmed. The tungsten-core projectiles exited the synchronized orbit. The air attack is expected to arrive within ten minutes. Please evacuate the soldiers from the target area... Jiang Chen turned off the communication devices in his ears, emptied the magazine in his rifle, and immediately rushed to the protective net. Ayesha, who had already run outside the defensive net, raised his sniper rifle and covered Jiang Chen's retreat. For some reason, the monsters seemed to chase after them consciously, as if they were controlled by someone. Before being surrounded by the army of zombies and mutant creatures, Jiang Chen got out of the protective net. Then he threw a nuclear grenade behind him and pulled Ayesha without looking back. The shockwave of the explosion blew down mutant creatures like wheat. After confirming that the zombies andmutant creatures didn't come out, Jiang Chen took out the off-road motorcycle from his storing space and took Ayesha to a nearby mountain. They were not heading in the direction of the refugee camp, but in the direction of the Russian-Finnish border. When the motorcycle rushed up the hill, Jiang Chen stopped it. He looked at the time on his wristwatch and looked back in the direction of the military base. With the sporadic firelight, Jiang Chen found with his naked eyes that there were no living people in the entire military base. At that moment, specks of white light appeared in the night sky. With a long and narrow tail flame, more than ten tungsten-core projectiles were blasted in the center of the military base, and the dust of the explosion rose up to a height of more than ten meters. "They should have died." Jiang Chen muttered as he took out the binoculars out of his pocket. When the dust disappeared, there was only a deep pit dozens of meters in diameter in the center of the base, just like an abyss leading to hell. The wiggly mutant creatures were crawling out of the deep pit... (To be continued.) Chapter 1067 The Innocent Finland The sky turned white, and it was six o 'clock in the morning. The orange-red civil helicopter hovered high in the sky, with the word "Tye" printed on its side. The moment the black smoke from the ammunition depot explosion rose, Finnish Radio and Television Station sent its helicopter to the scene immediately. Initially, they thought that there was a forest fire. But when they arrived, they found that it was not a forest fire. The fire occured at the military base of the Arrowhead Company that was widely criticized in Finland. It seemed that a war had broken out here, leaving bottomless pit in the middle of the base. "This is Finnish Radio and Television Station. The live broadcast for you is the actual situation of the forest fire in the suburbs of Partak." Although it turned out afterward that it wasn't a fire at all, but a human-caused explosion? We saw a huge pit at the scene... Wait, what is that!" As the camera wobbled, the cameraman adjusted the focus and zoomed in toward the military base. In the burning base, walking corpses wandered around recklessly. From time to time, strange creatures crawled out of the pit. "It seems that we have discovered something incredible." It seemed that the Arrow Company's shady experiments in the military base were true. What were these? Heteroideus? Zombies? Aliens? God..." Just as the helicopter sent first-hand information to the Finnish people and the world, Jiang Chen, standing on the mountain, was worried about the situation in the base. Apparently, Carmen put in a lot of effort when building the underground bunker. The tungsten-core projectiles that fell from the sky did not completely destroy the underground bunker. It only collapsed the elevator that connected the underground bunker. The spores continued to spew from the underground lab spread outside the base Jiang Chen noticed that the terrifying bacteria could not only mutate the animals that strayed into it, but also infect the plants that took root here. "Ayesha." "Hmm?" Ayesha tilted her head and looked at Jiang Chen, her gorgeous long chestnut-colored hair swaying in the wind. "I think ...... we might have stirred up a mess." Jiang Chen bitterly smiled and put down the binoculars. "Stirred up a mess?" Ayesha frowned in confusion. She didn't understand what Jiang Chen siad. Jiang Chen shook his head, without explaining in detail. At this moment, a sense of danger suddenly came into their mind. Jiang Chen and Ayesha turned around almost at the same time and aimed their pistols at the intersection. "Come out on the count of three." Jiang Chen said emotionlessly as he thumbed off the safety catch. With his hands raised above his head, a Russian in polar camouflage stood up and spoke in rather poor Chinese. "Relax, we are friends." Looking at the scarred face, Jiang Chen put away his pistol and sighed in relief, signaling Aisha to put her pistol  away as well. Jiang Chen grinned at him. "I almost shot you." "Thank you for not doing that," Kutepov lowered his raised hands and walked over to Jiang Chen, lifting his chin in the direction of the military base at the bottom of the hill, "What's going on there?" "Special situation. I can't explain it for a while. Let's talk about it after getting back." Jiang Chen shook his head. "Alright, shall we go together?" Kutepov pointed in the direction of the hill, "If you don't intend to return to the refugee camp, you can follow us to the evacuation point, where a helicopter is waiting for us." Jiang Chen certainly couldn't go back to the refugee camp. Not only did he make trouble and direct riots in other country, but he also poked a hole in the map, leaving a lot of mess. As long as the Finnish government was not brain-dead, it wouldn't be calm by now. Without any hesitation, Jiang Chen took Ayesha to the "plane" of Alpha Group and returned to Russia. As if confirming Jiang Chen's suspicions, just as he crossed the Russian-Finnish border, the Finnish Defense Forces had already marched to Partak. When the national security was seriously challenged, the Finnish authorities did not care about the humanitarian crisis. The tanks and armored vehicles forcefully entered the refugee camp. The fully armed soldiers controlled the ammunition factory and warehouse, and disarmed the remnants of the army at lightning speed. In the process of disarming, the Finnish Defense Forces encountered no resistance. Or rather, without hesitation, Sarmi took the lead to throw away the weapon. He obediently walked into the prisoner carriage and squatted in the corner, muttering the name of Iblis and begging for the true God's embrace. As for the rioters that had managed to survive, most of them had the same expression as him. When asked what exactly happened last night, the words they repeated the most in their fragmented language were -- "Iblis", "Devil", "Monster", "Slaughter". What made the commander dumbfounding was that these surrendered rioters seemed to be scared out of their wits, and would do anything to get on the prison wagons and get out of this damn place, More than a thousand rioters claimed to have participated in the execution of prisoners. In fact, however, only ten mercenary captives were executed that night... “What the hell! Iblis? What the hell is that?" "How's it going at the military base?" Toivio threw the report on the table and looked at the map with a frown. "Our helicopter has already reached there, but we can't see anything. The entire military base is surrounded by a shit-colored air mass, and our pilots didn't dare fly too close for fear of possible toxic substances." Toivio's deputy replied. "Send the scouts to check it out and tell them to wear protective clothing." As soon as Toivio's words fell, a non-commissioned officer walked inside the tent of the temporary headquarters. After giving a military salute, he handed a letter to Toivio. "Sir, an order from the Ministry of Defense." Toivio raised his eyebrows and unwrapped the sealed letter. His brows gradually furrowed. After reading the letter, Toivio rubbed his sour brows and tossed the letter aside. "Mission canceled. There is no need to send scouts." The deputy looked at the officer in surprise, wondering what had made Toivio change his mind. Out of duty, he reminded his superior. "If we don't confirm the situation in the base, we can't make an operational plan to rescue." "No need for a plan, no need for a rescue. Thanks to those bureaucrats, the journalists got there before us. They had confirmed that there were no living people there. Toivio shook his head and pointed at the envelope. "This is an order from the Ministry of Defense not to go within one kilometer of the incident." "Our only task now is to guard this place and cooperate with the police to evacuate the townspeople of Partak. Then, we will move the refugees to the two refugee camps on the Norwegian border." After a pause, Toivio frowned and looked out of the tent, cursing in a low voice, "Let the bureaucrats go to Russia and wrangle, if they think they can solve all issues by wrangling." Just as he was complaining, a private plane had taken off from the international airport in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, carrying the Minister of Finnish Defence Forces and the Vice President to Murmansk, Russia's largest city on the Arctic Ocean coast. Meanwhile, the Minister of Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation and the head of Federal Security Service rushed here, ready to seek a solution with Finland... (To be continued.) Chapter 1068 Only Star Ring Trade Can Save You The trouble with the harmonious civilization was that its understanding of living beings had surpassed the imagination of the human civilization, which was in its infancy. While countries around the world are still busy exporting ideologies, they have already begun to spread more dangerous things - their evil genes. Their DNA codes are to biology what computer viruses  to computers. Jiang Chen didn't care whether Carmen was dead or alive. Even if he were still alive, he might only have half his life left at this moment. The greatest benefit that harmonious civilization could promise him was nothing more than a few square kilometers of land, similar to the reservation that the United States of America once promised to the Indians, allowing them to live as a 'sample' of the human civilization. The only thing Jiang Chen was glad about was that the power of the freemasonry begun to decline. If Carmen were to contact harmonious civilization at the height of her power, half of Europe would have fallen into a hotbed of aliens. But, if not for Future People Group forcing him to the dead end, if not for the Golden Apple that he had chased after becoming trash, how could Carmen be crazy enough to take this path? Jiang Chen didn't believe that he had not seen the danger of harmonious civilization, which wrote the invasion gene in the nucleus. Murmansk, the largest strategic town on Russia's Arctic coast, is less than ninety kilometers from the Finland–Russia border. Having realized the seriousness of the problem, the Minister of Finnish Defence Forces immediately went to Russia with the vice president while sending the national defense forces to block the scene. The Finnish President had intended to make the trip himself, but it was too late to handle the diplomatic process and he had to stabilize the situation at home. Due to the close proximity of the incident to the Russian border, if something went wrong, it might cause the evacuation of the entire city of Murmansk. Russia had taken the accident very seriously. The Minister of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, Sergei Shoigu, and the head of Federal Security Service, Balter, rode a special plane from Moscow to Murmansk and met Finland's high-ranking officials. In addition to the high-ranking officials from the two countries, there was a foreigner with a special identity attending this meeting... In the face of these officials, Jiang Chen briefly summarized the intelligence gathered by Star Ring Trade about the secret experiments conducted by the Rothschild family. He repeatedly emphasized that this military operation against the North of Finland was for the safety of Finland and even the entire world. This statement easily won the applause of the Russian officials. After all, Jiang Chen and Balter had colluded it before the meeting. However, officials on the Finnish side were not foolish. The Vice President and Minister of Finnish Defence Forces sneered at them. Seeing that the desired effect had not been achieved, Jiang Chen stopped talking and began to discuss the first focus of the meeting. That's how dangerous X2 bacteria is. "In the center of the military base, the source of infection is called the 'Mother Nest'. As the name implies, it can produce special bacteria similar to spores." "X2 bacteria, that's what our scientists named it. The bacteria are so aggressive that they can easily infect organisms without antibodies, turning them into hotbeds for breeding themselves. Infected creatures will exhibit more aggressive and aggressive behavior than ever before, and will modify their original DNA, which is a sign of specific reinforcement. Something like Spiderman or the Hulk." "That means it won't be long before all citizens of Finland become Spider Man? "Sneered the Finnish Vice President. "Eh..." "Don't worry about that for the time being," said Jiang Chen. He drew a circle on the satellite map and pointed at the circled pine forest with a marker. "Do you see those withered pine trees? Those mutant creatures, for the time being, are so-called mutants. They can't leave the range of spores. Of course, we can't rule out the possibility of them going out to hunt for food or the active range of the spores constantly spreading. There was one thing that Jiang Chen didn't say. What he was most worried about was the mutation of the X2, or the X3 bacteria that he had never heard of. After all, creatures were best at evolving. X2 bacteria had been defeated by combustion missiles four years ago. It was possible that the harmonious civilization that had suffered a loss would evolve into new biological weapons. "Only Star Ring Trade can save you. This kind of thing has to be done by professionals." The head of Federal Security Service, Balter, emphasized. "It's not your fault!" When hearing this, the Minister of Finnish Defence Forces immediately became angry. He knocked on the table and shouted with rage, "Now you tell us that only you can solve it. How can you expect us to believe you?" The head of Federal Security Service squeezed his eyebrows with a wry smile and looked away awkwardly. Jiang Chen touched his nose awkwardly and coughed gently, "The one who caused today's situation was not me, but Carmen. Would this have happened, if you hadn't introduced the Arrowhead Company and rented the northern wasteland to them to build refugee camps? You don't even know that they have researched on your land. Don't you have any responsibility at all? "If I hand it over to you, what are you going to do with it?" The Vice President of Finland stared at Jiang Chen and said seriously. "Send the orbital airborne brigade." Jiang Chen said without hesitation. "Aren't your only two orbital airborne brigades in Ukraine?" The Minister of Finnish Defence Forces asked in confusion. "In fact, we have a secret force that has been trained a long time ago." "I didn't intend to reveal it so early, but the situation is pressing and I can't care so much now." When he said this, Jiang Chen acted as if he had made much concessions. The Vice Presidents of Finland exchanged glances with the Minister of Finnish Defence Forces, then looked at Jiang Chen and the Russian officials. Finally, his gaze stopped on the face of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, Sergei Shoigu. "I am sorry to say that the integrity of your party is questionable. We think that NATO can better solve the current issue, at least they don't send bombers into our airspace without informing us. You're the ones who broke the rules of the game first, so don't blame us for making this tough choice." Finland's membership in NATO has been under discussion since the beginning of the Cold War, but it has not been solved yet. The parliamentary elections essentially finalized the agenda for NATO membership, but one of the biggest resistance was that Finnish citizens were unwilling to give up their status as a neutral country in the final referendum session. But if NATO had solved the trouble of Finland, the toughest part of the referendum would not encounter much resistance. Once Finland joined NATO, it meant that Russia would add more than a thousand kilometers of armed defense, not to mention that behind this line was Peterborough and Murmansk, cities with great strategic significance. This situation is what Russia is most concerned about and unwilling to see in any case. "There is no way Russia will accept NATO troops into Finland, you have better options." Sergei Shoigu immediately stood up and said nervously, "If you insist on making the wrong decision, the situation will only get worse." "Is this a threat?" Sneered the Finnish Vice President. "It is a suggestion." Balter said in a gentle tone. "The Finnish people are facing life-threatening situations, and what could be worse. I thank you for your advice on behalf of President. In fact, two hours ago our President met with the Secretary General of NATO in Helsinki. Goodbye!" As she spoke, the high-ranking officials on the Finnish side stood up one after another. Sergei Shoigu wanted to stop them, but eventually his face froze. "Remember to use incendiary bombs, which are probably more effective than bullets and insecticides combined against those bugs."." Jiang Chen didn't care much about the problem between Russia and NATO. Instead, he reminded them out of good intentions, "If you want NATO to help you solve this problem, remember to make sure they don't use 5.56mm ammunition. The horny armor is naturally resistant to small-caliber bullets. No matter how many soldiers you send over, it will be in vain." "If you can't solve it, remember to call me." The Vice President of Finland waved his hand, not knowing whether he heard or not, and left the table with the Minister of Finnish Defence Forces and other officials without looking back. (To be continued.) Chapter 1069 Bugs Can Evolve The conference room was quiet. The scheduled meeting was only halfway through and the officials on the Finnish side made an early exit. Sergei Shoigu stood up and gave a glance to the secretary behind him, who immediately came forward to help his superior tidy up the things on the table The sound of moving chairs and arranging documents revealed that the minister begun to pack up and prepare to leave. So, the officials on the Russian side also packed up and left the long table. Even half of the expected effect was achieved and the meeting ended. Jiang Chen, standing in front of the satellite map, threw the marker aside and walked to the door. He came with just one person, with nothing to pack. On his way out, he called Ayesha and asked her to make a dinner reservation at the front desk. All he wanted now was a hot dinner, and the last time he'd eaten properly was twenty-four hours ago. He spent the whole night outside yesterday. After arriving in Murmansk by helicopter with Kutpov, the first thing he did was to call the Hilton Hotel to book a room. After returning to the hotel by special car, he fell asleep without taking off his clothes, until the afternoon when Barter, the head of Federal Security Service, called him to attend the meeting. It was now seven o'clock in the evening, and all he'd had to drink before the meeting was a tube of fruit-flavored nutri-vompound, and by now he was getting hungry. Just as he left the government building, Barter beckoned to him. Without waiting for Jiang Chen to go this way, he walked quickly to Jiang Chen and patted him on the shoulder grinning, "Have a meal together? There is a great restaurant nearby. It's my treat." "I've got dinner reservations at the Hilton Hotel. Let me treat you." Then, Jiang Chen called Ayesha and asked her to tell the front desk that they didn't need to send the reserved  dinner to the room. They will eat in the private room of the restaurant and add one seat. "Alright," Hearing that Jiang Chen reserve his seat, Barter didn't refuse, and took out the car keys from the pocket, "Sit in my car?" "Then please." Jiang Chen laughed. Unlike Sergei Shoigu, or maybe because of work, Barter didn't have a driver, and he drove on his own. Jiang Chen couldn't tell the brand of the car. It might be a Russian-made car. Sitting in the passenger seat, Jiang Chen fastened his seatbelt. As soon as the car started, Barter's face turned bitter. "Buddy, you got us in big trouble." Jiang Chen slanted a glance at him and argued in dissatisfaction. "Why are you like those Finns, throwing trouble on me when something goes wrong? If your Alpha Group had killed Carmen, there wouldn't be so much trouble! I heard that you were only 500 meters away from him and you were in a perfect position to shoot him, but you were thinking of blowing up the ammunition depot." Bart froze and frowned. "Can a person really play such a big role?" "You can give him a chance to develop for ten years. Maybe he can turn the entire Russia into that." Jiang Chen laughed coldly and leaned back on the seat with his eyes closed. "What should we do now?" Barter asked. "Just wait." "Wait?" "When NATO stumbles there, they will naturally think of us." Jiang Chen chuckled. "You don't think NATO can solve this mess? It's just a few bugs." Barter frowned. In his opinion, without NATO's help, even Russian border guards would easily crush those little bugs. Hearing such an innocent speech, Jiang Chen derided, "Just bugs?" Holding the steering wheel, Barter was silent for a few moments. Just as Jiang Chen was about to fall asleep, Barter asked, "If I may ask, why are you so confident about it? Don't get me wrong, I don't mean anything by it ... I'm just curious. You seem to know a lot about this situation. It was the same with the T-virus, and it's the same now with X2 bacteria." Intuition from years of intelligence work told Barter that the two seemingly unrelated events were inextricably linked. Jiang Chen's narrowed left eye opened a crack as he looked at Barter a few times. Just as he was about to make up a random excuse to laugh, he suddenly thought of the golden apples that flowed out of the factories controlled by Rothschild. It was those golden apples that forced him to change his mind temporarily. Perhaps the time has already come? After pondering for a moment, Jiang Chen suddenly laughed and said, "That's right, I do know these very well. I also know how Carmen got them. Do you want to know why?" "If it's convenient for you." Although his face showed that he didn't really care much about it, Jiang Chen could clearly feel that his tone was obviously quite concerned. "We will talk about it later at dinner." Jiang Chen didn't reply. Instead, he closed his eyes again and began to rest. It was a half hour's drive from the Hilton Hotel, and he'd need to frame what he was going to say. Germany was in the midst of a domestic revolution, and could not send troops to support its allies at this time when it was preoccupied with its affairs. U.S. aircraft carrier were too far apart, and it seemed unrealistic to move them from the Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea, which would irritate the frayed nerves of the Russians. The last to come to the rescue is the United Kingdom, which has left the European Union but is still a member of NATO. The British, however, apparently underestimated the danger of the "mother nest" and sent only one mechanized brigade, which was rapidly deployed in northern Finland by heavy transport aircraft. He didn't know if they listened to Jiang Chen's opinion, but the Finland government dispatched sappers to cut down trees along the "infected area" and cut out a 50-meter-wide isolation zone. The British Army then fired a full 20 white phosphorus munitions into the Mother Nest to physically sterilize the infected area before entering it. However, the result was beyond their expectation. The white  white phosphorus munitions exploded with brilliant sparks, but the flame was soon extinguished in the air as if it had been "frozen". As for the burnt spores, they floated out from the ground after a while to fill in the lost portion. Realizing that something was wrong, they extracted a portion of the spore suspension from the infected area and tested it. They found out that the single cell would rapidly consume itself in hot environments, secreting a special heat-resistant liquid that would extinguish the fire by wrapping up the burning material! Cells with their fire extinguishers! Such an incredible discovery made biologists invited to conduct tests on spores in the infected area exclaim in disbelief. Even with decades of experience, they couldn't figure out what the hell was going on. This was something Jiang Chen had expected. Bugs can evolve. They can even do the unthinkable like interstellar navigation, let alone extinguishing the fire. (To be continued.) Chapter 1070 Leave it for the professionals! White phosphorus bombs, gasoline bombs, all of these weapons had been tried and nothing worked, even flamethrowers did not work well. The British tried other things besides incendiary bombs. For example, pesticides, insecticides, and even chemical weapons with strong acids and bases, which are absolutely inhumane in normal times, but naturally don't have to be so humane to a swarm of bugs. Unfortunately, the bugs were not afraid of their chemical weapons at all, because the weapons could not hurt them. In addition to these, the British considered dropping larger incendiary bombs, which could theoretically dry up the air in an infected area all at once, but the Finnish government was having none of it. With a larger scale of incendiary bombs, the fifty meters or so of isolation strip would definitely not work. If this caused a forest fire, then the losses would be disastrous! This was the Arctic Circle, the primitive pine forest on the taiga! Every tree was a living fossil! The trees that were cut down to drop the incendiary bombs were enough to make the Finns heartburn. What's more, the British couldn't guarantee that the bigger incendiary bombs wouldn't be "frozen" by the strange spores. That evil stuff could coat even atomized gasoline! If Finland does not want to use it, then don't use it. It's just a chance to show off muscles to Finland, so that it will join the NATO family with peace of mind. The British Ministry of Defense made a decision, and the commanders they sent didn't take it seriously. They sent two mechanized companies with a total of forty AJAX infantry vehicles to clear the way, followed by more than three hundred infantrymen in chemically protected uniforms. The battle plan was quite simple. It was expected to purge all the mutant creatures in the infected area within ten minutes. The entrance would be suppressed within twenty minutes, and then the special forces would enter the underground bunker to clear the source of the infection. The soldiers in chemical protective suits did not realize the danger of the task at all. Instead, they joked in front of the media reporters, claiming that if the Mother Nest appeared in London, they would not need to do anything at all. The firefighters might have solved them. The appearance of the mother nest attracted the attention of the entire world, and this interview was naturally broadcasted live all over the world. In the conference room yesterday, the satellite map on the big screen were replaced with a live interview of Russian TV reporters with British soldiers who are about to perform missions in Partak. Originally, Jiang Chen didn't want to accompany these Russians to watch the news, because he had already roughly guessed what the final result would be. But Sergei Shoigu personally invited him. Jiang Chen couldn't afford not to give him face, so he came here. Honestly, it's a little weird to have a bunch of bigwigs sitting quietly watching the news. "You're sure they can't fix it?" Sergei looked over at Jiang Chen and asked in disbelief, "I don't mean to gloat, but this is important to Russia's defense strategy. If the British makes it, we will have an extra defense line of a thousand kilometers. "Just wait and see." Leaning against the chair,  Jiang Chen swept a glance at the confident British soldier on the screen and bristled. Firefighters from London? It's useless even if you send Chinese urban management officers, Japanese high school students, and American vagrants there! As the troops set off, the television footage shifted, and the reporter took a close-up of forty armored vehicles on the road, then quickly switched from the ground to the sky. The helicopter followed the mechanized army from afar, watching them rush into the infected area covered by the turbid spores. Because commander of the British Army was full of confidence in this "bug removal plan", he made an exception and revealed a portion of sensitive combat communications to the reporters at the behest of the Ministry of Defense to show the strength of the NATO. As for the combat video, it would not be released to the public because it involved military secrets. "This is the 12th Company. We have reached the target area, finding nothing abnormal for now." "We see mutant creatures. Slip the safety catch and fire freely. The heavy gunfire and the roars of mutant creatures lasted for two minutes. The expressions on the faces of the senior Russian officials sitting in front of the screen, especially Sergei, grew exciting. They were all senior officers in the army. Just by listening to the sound, they knew that the situation of the British army was not very optimistic". We're in a firefight with mutant creatures! There are too many of them, but our firepower is superior". "Sh*t! They move so fast! F*ck! Infantry, retreat! I repeat, Infantry, retreat! Chalice! You're crazy! Retreat with your men!" The communication was rudely cut off. It was clear that the British commander had realized that what followed was no longer suitable for broadcasting to the media. The only thing that could describe the gruesomeness of the war for those seated in the conference room was the flickering fire in the fog on the screen. The conference room was silent as the top brass of the Russian military looked at each other. No one expected such a result. No one expected a mechanized force to lose to a group of mutant creatures ... There was only one exception. It was Jiang Chen. If their anti-armor capabilities were overlooked just because they were a swarm of bugs, he wasn't at all surprised that the British army would be defeated. The only thing he was curious about now was how many of these armored vehicles would retreat intact. As for the infantry, their bones might have been gnawed by now. There was a little mishap in the cleaning of the Mother Nest. Here's a newsletter for you... " On the screen, the reporter said with a slightly embarrassed expression. Now even the image is gone. Just then, Jiang Chen's wristwatch vibrated. "I'll answer a call outside." Whispering to Sergei, who was sitting next to him, Jiang Chen got up and walked out of the conference room. The call was from the Finnish presidential office. Don't ask why he knew. It's obvious. When he arrived outside the conference room, Jiang Chen walked to the window in the corridor, opened the holographic screen, and pressed the answer button. The call was answered, but the person on the other end didn't speak right away. The silence lasted for two seconds, with some subtle awkwardness in the atmosphere. Finally, the other party sheepishly spoke first. "... Uh, the British quit." As expected, the regular army was not a mercenary. Every life in peacetime is precious. For some unknown reason, we've lost a battalion in the infected area. They had not even reached the entrance to the underground bunker. It was likely that there was already an uproar in the UK. "Oh." "The Americans said they would observe it for a while, but the spores are spreading and have now covered the 50-meter-wide isolation zone." Hearing the words of the Finnish president, Jiang Chen's face showed the expression I had expected. The British soldiers who were killed provided the mother nest with easily absorbed organic matter. Animal corpses, including humans, were much easier to serve as breeding grounds for spores than wood and insects. Having swallowed up roughly a battalion of troops, and the Mother Nest was eager to expand its spore coverage. Just from this point alone, the Mother Mest really liked Carmen. After his speculation was proved, Jiang Chen had more confidence in solving this trouble. But at this time, he was not in a hurry to speak. It was obvious that the other side was asking for help. If he agreed immediately, it was too good for them! Back then, I planned to help you fix it for free, but you were not willing to do so. Now you are begging for it? What have you been doing! "Yes." Jiang Chen adjusted his tone and said indifferently. "If there's anything you guys want to say, just say it." "Maybe we need your help?" The Finnish president inquired in a soothing tone. Jiang Chen pretended to hesitate. After pondering for a moment, he slowly said, Now, the infected area has expanded a lot. Even the British mechanized brigade can't do anything about it. I'm afraid it will be difficult. How about trying carpet bombing? Even though spores block combustion, it doesn't make sense that they can withstand high-explosive bombs, right? " "We tried it long ago, it didn't work. The spores that were removed could not keep up with the rate at which they were secreted, and they were blown farther away." "Well, let's get straight to the point. You're a businessman. Name your price," the Finnish president said with a wry smile. With a smile on the corner of his mouth, Jiang Chen spoke in a pleasant manner. "300 million NED." Hearing this figure, the President of Finland frowned. "...Can it be cheaper?" The exchange rate of NED was high, and the euro had depreciated recently. Unless he used the procurement budget of the Finnish Defense Force for the whole year, which was obviously impossible. If you can't afford it, we may consider another payment method. For example, pack the Arrowhead Company's assets in Finland and sell them to us. Under the current circumstances, we can only offer a valuation of 300 million NED for their assets. Trust me, this is a very impressive price, definitely much higher than the valuation given by the bank. " Speaking of this, Jiang Chen smiled wickedly in his mind. Although the Arrow Company was his old enemy, the mercenaries who were paid to do the job had no grudge against him. After this incident, Arrowhead Company is bound to go bankrupt as a result of the exorbitant fines issued by the Finnish government. More than 20,000 experienced veterans would be a considerable asset to Star Ring Trade if it acquired Arrowhead Company registered in Finland. With a little training and a decent increase in benefits, these people would soon work for their new boss. Disband all of them, screen the grassroots soldiers and integrate them, pack up the weapons and equipment and sell them to Africa. As for the remaining two refugee camps, they can be kept for the time being. With the right means of utilization, they can be fully used as bargaining chips with the EU. As for the two military bases besides the refugee camps, they were also of great use. The Finnish president nodded reluctantly. "Deal." Jiang Chen nodded with a smile. "Hope we will have a pleasant cooperation." "When will your men arrive? If it's ten days and half a month, we're afraid we can't afford to wait ..." "It won't take that long," Jiang Chen looked at the time on the holographic screen, "Just give me five hours. By the way, tell the British soldiers that they can pack up and go home and leave it for the professionals."  Chapter 1071 Mother Nest The fracture ten meters in diameter, liked a sinkhole, was in the center of a military base. Under this sinkhole, at a depth of about five hundred meters, was the underground bunker designed by the Rothschild Group with experiments as the goal. At the moment, the underground bunker was devoid of the slightest scent of living beings and was completely covered with blood-red bubbles that emitted a strange stench. If one could endure the revulsion and got close  to take a closer look, he would see that the surface of the bubbles were covered with densely impetigos the size of sesame seeds. Every time the impetigo burst, spore gas was released from it. Under the efforts of numerous impetigos, countless spores were born every second and floated down the entrance to the surface, expanding the territory of the Mother Nest. In the center of the Underground Institute, a mountain of flesh, like the roots of a large tree, bulged with fat impetigos. As the core of the Mother Nest, it was the heart and the "hub" of the Mother Nest. The tentacles that spread out from the bottom of its feet and the top of its head were like data lines connecting the host to the sub-machine. In its abdomen, there was a coffin, or a "cultivation chamber", carved from resin. Unlike the flesh-red Mother Nest, this jet-black cultivation chamber seeemed very hard. Through the palm-width semi-transparent membrane, one could vaguely see a person lying inside. He opened his eyes and his gaze stopped on the line of numbers on the semi-transparent membrane. 【14731】 Four thousand of them were refugee recruits brought underground by himself, another three thousand or so came from the Guard Brigade as well as researchers from the underground research institute, and more than seven thousand were mercenaries and mobs that had been fighting in the base, and just now the Brits contributed roughly six or seven hundred of them to him as well. Each person could contribute two units of organic matter, and he had already consumed half of it for strengthening the Mother Nest and hatching the mutant creatures. "Not enough." Carmen, lying in the cultivation chamber, shook his head and began to reflect on whether he was too much. If he didn't destroy them all at once, he might still give Brits the illusion that they were just about to win, so they would send more people to fill in the hole, providing him with more organic matter to strengthen his power. However, now, those Brits seemed to be much more cautious. Except for constantly shelling the area, they didn't send anyone. Half a million units of organic matter were required to upgrade the Level-2 Mother Nest. There were two sources of obtaining organic matter, the most primitive being photosynthesis, which grew slowly. Another was the quickest, the simplest and most brutal method, and that was to eat constantly. By devouring creatures and digesting their flesh, he could strengthen himself. Carmen certainly preferred the latter. If he relied on photosynthesis alone to obtain organic matter from the soil and air, it might take a few centuries for the Mother Nest to expand to the entire world. By relying on continuous devouring, he could complete the transformation that took several centuries to complete in just a few days. Thought of this, Carmen's face showed some resentment. The reason he chose this place as his home base was that there was a refugee camp next to the military base with a population close to half a million. If he devoured the population of the refugee camp and then the nearby town of Paltak, he would complete the first stage of evolution! The Level-2 Mother Nest would be even more terrifying. Not only would the hunting range of the mutant creatures increase to a hundred kilometers, but he would also unlock the new "arm of the services". For example, a monster called Meat Mountain is said to be able to withstand tank shells with its fat alone. However, Jiang Chen, who came out halfway, made all of his plans come to naught. His teeth clenched and cackled at the thought. The spores were his eyes and ears, and he could clearly sense everything that happened within the spore-covered field. He was sure that night, he "saw" Jiang Chen in the military base, but unfortunately failed to retain him. [Reminder, the host is still far away from the organic matter reserve of 500,000. It is recommended to upgrade the early transition period of the arm of the services. ] A thought came to his mind. This was a suggestion from the Mother Nest. There was no need to rely on a cumbersome vocal cords to speak. Naturally, there was no obstruction in language and ability to express. The direct communication of consciousness made Carmen feel much more convenient than ever before. It was one of the reasons why he praised it so much after seeing the greatness of the biological civilization through the Golden Apple. [Upgrade the arm of the services? Sound sense. ] Carmen used his mind to reply. Meanwhile, he closed his eyes and connected his consciousness to the control center of the Mother Nest. A list of simplified upgrades appeared in front of him. After careful screening, he allocated 5,000 organic matter to strengthening the wings of the "Blade Warrior". The name Blade Warrior was given to that mantis-like mutant creature. After being strengthened, the wings of Blade Warrior would be longer and stronger, no longer serving as a supplement to enhance bouncing power, but as true wings capable of flying for short distances. As Carmen allocated the organic matter, a mass of indescribable liquid flowed into the eggs in front of the Mother Nest through the pipe. Under the injection of organic matter, the eggs began to mutate, along with the new "Blade Warriors" who were about to break out of the cocoons. These eggs were warm beds for breeding mutant creatures. As for him, they were like "barracks". At this moment, a violent tremor came from the ceiling. Carmen slightly raised his eyelids as his lips curled into a sneer. The soil above the shelter was reinforced by the Mother Nest, and the fibrous roots woven a layer of "bulletproof vest" up to 500 meters thick in the soil, with explosion-proof and anti-seismic capabilities comparable to reinforced concrete. The British army threw hundreds of shells at his head, only blowing away a layer of cement. The reason why kinetic bombardments could blast open the entrance was because the Mother Nest just formed and he had time to strengthen the entrance... Suddenly, his complexion changed. Meanwhile, the consciousness of the Mother Nest penetrated his mind promptly. [Warning, the protective layer has been attacked by external forces. Part of the organization structure has been broken. Host, please use organic matter to fix it in time. ] "Damn it! It's Star Ring Trade's kinetic bombardment!" Carmen cursed. It seemed that he underestimated the power of Star Ring Trade's kinetic bombardment. Initially, he thought that a few tungsten-cored bombs would at most rub off a layer of cement from the outer protective layer of the Mother Nest. It turns out he was dead wrong. The damage to the protective layer required him to repair it with organic matter. For him, who did not have much organic matter, it was already enough to hurt his muscles and bones! The number of organic matter was consumed at a rate visible to the naked eye. Just as Carmen was anxiously deploying it to fill in the gaps, a series of devastating breaks came from above him. Realizing what had happened, Carmen's expression changed and his facial muscles twisted. "F*ck!" (To be continued.) Chapter 1072 Broke With Force More than forty armored vehicles marched valiantly into the infected area. Just when everyone thought that this was a one-sided British military show, the course of events took a dramatic turn within a minute. No one knew how intense the firefight in the infected zone was, but almost the whole world saw the outcome of that firefight. Only five of the forty armored vehicles returned, and all the infantry died there. The guns and cannons were defeated by a swarm of worms. Colonel Mawston, who commanded the operation, could not accept such an end. He could not accept it, nor the onlookers who were watching the disaster via their mobile phones. From Cagayan to Tokyo, the term "Resident Evil" repeatedly stimulated the fragile nerves of people across the world. Concepts that were thought to be only possible in literature, movies, and television have now been brouand ght to reality, attracting global attention and causing panic... On social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Weibo, debates on the X2 bacteria were fierce. "Last time it was the T-virus, this time it's X2 bacteria? God, are those capitalists insane? "Is it good for them to study such things? The state should legislate against these dangerous researches!" "Unbelievable, was it really British army that just went in? Are all British armored vehicles made of paper? "They're just a group of mutant creatures. Go ahead and run them over with tracks!  Don't tell me that their teeth can chew through armor?" "The Doomsday Survival Handbook. A ten-year doomsday enthusiast teaches you how to survive the doomsday. The quantity is limited, buy it now." "Dispatch the peacekeepers. It's not a national problem, it's a worldwide problem ..." "I'm curious. Does every military base of Arrowhead have one of these institutes?" '"..." What was the situation on the social platform? Colonel Mawston could not see it for now. He was now fuming about how to explain this disastrous fiasco to the Ministry of Defense and Parliament. The entire mechanized battalion had fallen into the enemy's trap without any power to fight back! God, Prime Minister counted on him to fix it and bring Finland into the NATO family. His face turned pale. He didn't even dare to make a battle plan, and he refused to send any more troops inside. A division, not to mention a brigade of mechanized troops, would not be enough! The Finnish government got antsy and threatened to contact the Star Ring Trade for a solution if they couldn't smooth out the trouble at the Mother Nest. Mawston scoffed at what the Finland government said. It was not a matter of combat effectiveness at all. Even armored vehicles can be melted by acid, might Star Ring Trade's kinetic skeleton be stronger than an armored vehicle? It was better to obediently wait for scientists to figure out what the X2 bacterium was. Mawston anticipated that as long as he worked out something that could kill those spores, those mutant creatures would die. "I admit that we underestimated the strength of the Mother Nest, and it was a mistake to hastily send troops into the infected area," Standing in front of the media, Mawston explained stiffly, "A team of researchers from London have been studying the DNA structure of these spores, and I'm sure it won't be long before they can devise a method to inactivate the X2 bacteria." The reporter asked, "Colonel Mawston, may I ask if it means that Britain will give up military aid to Finland?" "NATO will never give up any friendly partner, but now this is not something that the UK can solve alone." "..." "God... Look! What is that!" Just as Colonel Mawston was busy explaining to the media, a sudden exclamation came from the crowd around him. He saw a female reporter looking at the sky with an astonished expression. Her finger pointed at the infected area. Numerous "fireballs" fell from the sky. Even from miles away, the popping sound that pierced the sound barrier could still be clearly heard. The cameras that were originally directed at Colonel Mawston all turned to the sky. Almost at the same time, earth-shaking tremors came from the soles of everyone's feet, shaking everyone's souls. This is the first time that the kinetic bombardments of Star Ring Trade appeared in front of the cameras of media reporters. Mawston was glad that the media had shifted their cameras away. He knew very well that the expression on his face at the moment must be wonderful. ... A hundred kilometers away in Murmansk, inside the presidential suite of the Hilton Hotel, Jiang Chen sat on the sofa with his legs crossed and overlooked the battle between Star Ring Trade and the mutant creatures through the holographic screen. The kinetic bombardments quickly dispersed the spores that shrouded the military base. After a round of bombing, Jiang Chen used the short gap to see the broken ground through the satellite map on the holographic screen. "Eh? Surprisingly, it didn't collapse?" Staring at the holographic screen, Jiang Chen made a strange sound. Theoretically speaking, even if this underground bunker was more than five hundred meters deep, it could not bear the bombardment of tungsten-core bombs. They were tungsten balls falling from the synchronized orbit. Even if the 500-meter thickness was made of reinforced concrete, it should have turned into mud. There was something odd about the Mother Nest. Jiang Chen's eyes moved slightly as he ordered Ivan. "Continue the bombardment! If the first round does not work, then let's start the second round! Let's blast him out!" The recovery ability of mutant creatures was very strong. Ordinary minor injuries can be healed at a rate visible to the naked eye via a few breaths of air with spores. The Brits didn't kill many mutant creatures, despite multiple rounds of bombardment of the military base. Broken arms and legs may be fatal for humans. But for this group of organized mutant creatures, they could be recovered after lying in their Mother Nest for a while. Even if they were killed on the spot, as long as their corpses were dragged back, it would not take long for them to be the organic matter and hatch into new mutant creatures. Moreover, most of the mutants were hiding underground. The battle plan Jiang Chen had formulated was simple and brutal: fatigue tactics and kinetic bombardments! As long as he could break through the defense, she would be able to strike again until Mother Next exposed its true body! The tungsten-core bombs were not aimed at the mutant creatures from the beginning, but to destroy the underground bunker. All the attacks were concentrated in a circle ten meters in diameter. Even though the Mother Nest's resilience was as strong as that of mutant creatures, the tungsten-core bombs of the Star Ring Trade were powerful. In terms of vertical penetration of weapons, no country on this planet can match them! Jiang Chen didn't know that his simple and crude plan had caused Carmen, who was hiding underground, to scream in agony. The first round, the second round... Round after round of tungsten-core bombs slammed down from the synchronized orbit; Jiang Chen consumed money, and Carmen consumed organic matter. Both sides were distressed. But Carmen, who obviously had limited resources, was more distressed. Soon, the Mother Nest could no longer hold on. How did Jiang Chen know? It could be seen from the satellite images. As the dust dispersed, the soil layer completely peeled off, exposing the intertwined roots beneath. Without a doubt, these solid roots ensured the sturdiness of the underground bunker, reinforcing the  concrete-like defense of the soil. The Mother Nest released spore gas in a futile attempt to mask its weakness. However, Jiang Chen did not miss the opportunity and ordered Ivan to wipe it out. The strikes from the synchronous orbit continued. When the Electric Ray C-1, deployed in the synchronous orbit, dropped the last tungsten-core bomb, the tentacles covering the underground bunker broke. The defense of Mother Nest completely collapsed, exposing the flesh bubbles hiding among the underground bunker. Seeing this scene, Jiang Chen knew the opportunity had come and immediately ordered Ivan. "The Mother Nest revealed itself and ceased orbital weapons attacks. Order the 3rd Power Armored Brigade to begin airborne operations!” "Yes sir!" Ivan replied forcefully. Fifteen minutes had passed afeter rounds of orbital bombardment. The journalists, soldiers, and townsfolk standing next to the small town of Paltak were still frozen in a daze. They raised their heads at a 45 degree angle and looked up at the clear sky. Colonel Mawston opened and closed his mouth, failing to say a word. The Finnish Minister of Defense standing next to him was black-faced and remorseful. He should have asked Star Ring Trade to fix it from the beginning. As for those journalists, at this moment, they began to think about what kind of rhetoric should be used to depict this destructive "air attack". None of them got over their surprise. Just when everyone thought it was over, rows of flames fell from the clear sky toward the ground. (To be continued.) Chapter 1073 Steel and Blood For those standing in front of Paltak to watch the show, in the blink of an eye, the roar of steel colliding with the earth came from several kilometers away. The leader of the Finnish Radio and Television Station quickly winked at the journalists. Not long after, the helicopter took off again and headed to the military base. Not only were the media reporters interested in Star Ring Trade's Orbital Airborne Brigade, even the British and Finnish militaries sent two helicopters. Nominally, it is to provide support to the Star Ring Trade when necessary. But in fact, everyone knows what exactly they want to do. Through satellite images, Jiang Chen knew the thoughts of Finland and Britain, but he did not care about them. Since he had sent out the power armors, he had no intention of keeping it a secret. This "mini brigade" with only two hundred soldiers had been established since two years ago. The reason it's been kept secret until now was because the surrounding bad guys were weak. It's not worth it for him to take out his power armors to show off his strengthen, so he might as well hide it as a hole card. Besides, he was worried that it might cause a regional military competition and affect his plan to develop the economy. By now, the two concerns mentioned earlier no longer exist. As for why, let's talk about it until the war is over. The fifty airdrop cabins fell one after another. Before the dust of the explosions dispersed, two hundred fully armed T3 power armors rushed out of the open airdrop cabins with their tactical rifles. They stepped into the battlefield covered with spores and surrounded the fracture that had been blasted by the kinetic bombardments. Sensing the invasion of the uninvited guests, a shrill scream came out from the deep pit. One by one, the "Blade Warriors" flapped their wings and leaped out of the abyss. When the shelling came, these mutant creatures hid underground. Now that they sensed the scent of living creatures, they could no longer restrain their bloodlust and couldn't wait to use their sharp claws to tear the chests of their prey. However, their plan was doomed to fail. The opponents they encountered this time were not as weak as the previous ones. "Roar!" With a sharp roar, a Blade Warrior moved. The bow-shaped legs suddenly bounced off, and the strengthened long wings on its back instantly exerted force. Its two scissor-like serrated scimitars suddenly cut toward the closest power armor. If it cut the right position, even the steel would have to be torn open! At that moment, a transparent shield unfolded from the left arm of the power armor. The Blade Warrior slammed into the shield, but it did not shake the power armor at all. Instead, it broke the two double-edged blades made of horns. The shuttle-shaped mouth opened and closed with a shrill howl. The Blade Warrior covered his head with his arms and retreated. However, before it could take two steps back, the power armor slammed through its defenses with the shield, gripped the small arm-length tactical dagger in its right hand, stabbed it hard through its chest, and used its strength to tear downward, splitting the intestines of the Blade Warrior in half. All happened in an instant. Carmen, lying inside the dormant bin, was dumbfounded. He had never seen such a strong iron lump, which reminded him of the rumors about the Iron Man on Koro Island a long time ago. In fact, as early as the attack in Los Angeles, there were rumors that Star Ring Trade had created the "steel armor". There were even unreliable rumors that Jiang Chen himself was the "Iron Man" who once appeared in Koro City, and his image was too similar to the heir of the Stark Industries. Cold sweat broke out on Carmen's forehead at that thought. Although he didn't scoff at the rumors, he hadn't thought that Jiang Chen to not only create the "steel armor", but also equipped an army with something that looked expensive! Shocked as he was, there were no other options for him The scale of this team was not big. It was probably the trump card of Star Ring Trade. As long as he could survive the early stage of development, the entire forest would be included in the consciousness of Mother Nest. To inflict heavy losses on Star Ring Trade, he had to wipe out this trump card here at all costs! Even if he had to pay a high price. Carmen gritted his teeth and connected his consciousness with the consciousness of Mother Nest. Almost at the same time, the red blood vessels in the Mother Nest surged like mice. The flesh-like bubbles in the shadows expanded violently, and the pustules the size of sesame swelled to the size of green beans. Then they exploded, releasing spores that contained berserk elements. All the dark green eyes were imprinted with blood red in an instant. "Roar!" The roar was accompanied with a layer of tyranny. All of the Blade Warriors went into a frenzy, pouncing on the two hundred of power armors in an overwhelming manner. However, before they could even get close, they ran into a net of oncoming fire. This batch of T3 power armors had been functionally subdivided to adapt to the modern battlefield. The most obvious difference being that their right arms were no longer all equipped with rotary machine guns. Instead, they were designed according to the battlefield needs with mountable accessories such as a grenade launchers, unfolding shields, and plasma cutting daggers. The front row of power armors knelt on one knee and pushed the shield that was as tall as a man, with the right arm faintly emitting a blue arc of light. The power armors at the back stepped forward and raised the triangular gun barrel on their right arms, pouring out violent firepower. Behind them were the power armors holding the 72mm anti-vehicle cannons, using high explosive bombs to tear apart the formation of mutant creatures. In terms of firepower alone, this two-hundred-man Power Armored Brigade was more than twice as strong as the British mechanized force of nearly 1,000 soldiers. Coupled with the comprehensive combat capabilities such as mobility and protection, it was no exaggeration for Jiang Chen to say that if both sides didn't use air attacks or other off-site support firepower, these two hundred people could defeat an infantry division of NATO. The Blade Warriors rushing in the front were torn into pieces by the firepower net, and those who got closer to power armors were chopped into two pieces by the plasma cutting daggers stabbed out behind their shields. The horned armor was always good at defending against bullets, but it was as vulnerable as tofu against the high heat plasma jets. Green blood splattered on the battlefield, mixed with the spewers' acid. Carmen was determined to fight Star Ring Trade to the death, and he would never retreat. At this moment, he made most use of the incubation and digestive ability of the Mother Nest! At the moment of life and death, he no longer cared about frugality. all the organic matter was taken out, to convert into Blade Warriors and Spitters, and then they were pushed to the front line. The only advantage of the swarm was that it was not afraid of death. Under the interference of the will of the Mother Nest, it rushed to the muzzle of the gun without hesitation. As the battle turned white-hot, soon the distance between the two sides was shortened to the extreme, turning from the unilateral suppression of firepower into a short fight at close range. The power armors were strong but not invincible. They gradually began to suffer casualties in the melee. Seeing this, Carmen's face showed a gleam of joy. If this trend continued, the first one to fail must be the Star Ring Trade! At the thought, he eagerly took out all his organic matter. At that moment, however, Carmen's mood instantly fell from the peak to the bottom. His eager face was gradually dyed with a layer of despair. Through the eyes of a Blade Warrior, he saw a series of flashes in the air. The second round of Star CRing Trade's airdrops started. This time the airdrops were not people, but drone cluster. Before the airdrop, the power armors that fighted with the mutant creatures kept firing and retreated in an orderly manner, leaving enough space for the mutant creatures to climb out of the deep pit. When they almost retreated to the corner of the military base, the drone cluster appeared in the rear of the mutant army. Thousands of drones swarmed out and headed to the wound of Mother Nest caused by the kinetic bombardments. 当卡门反应过来，一切都已经来不及了。 The mutant creatures in underground were basically sent to the surface by him, and the ones left in the underground bunker were those that had just crawled out of their eggs. Although the number was still considerable, it was not enough to intercept the drones that were swooping in like a tidal wave. Without fighting the mutant creatures, these drones did not even fire a single shot. They attacked the eggs of mutant creatures without any restraint. Carmen's face turned green. "F*ck!" Jiang Chen, who was a hundred kilometers away, suddenly sat up straight from the sofa and pounded his fist hard on the coffee table. "Wipe them out completely!" (To be continued.) Chapter 1074 Give Him a Quick Death The drones that pounced on the eggs suddenly exploded. Rows of surging eggs were enveloped in a fire light and instantly exploded into pieces. The crimson and dark green plasma melted together, splattering away from the ruptured flesh-like bubbles. Under the high temperature, they were roasted into coke. Part of this blood belonged to the Mother Nest, while the other part belonged to embryos that had not been mature. Carmen, who was lying in the incubation chamber, felt cold from head to toe. If he could still feel the cold now. A hopeless feeling of defeat came over him. This kind of feeling was as if the battle was raging, but the enemy destroyed the barrack. [Warning, extensive damage to hatching area, please fix the host immediately. ] The Mother Next's consciousness echoed in his mind, Carmen peered over the reserve of organic matter. When he saw that he only had hundreds of mutant creatures, his face immediately lost its last trace of blood. Just now, he had allocated all the resources to eggs for hatching Blade Warriors. However, with the suicide attack carried out by drones, most of his organic matter had lost. It was not impossible to digest the residues on the ground. But it took time to turn them into organic matter, depending on the carbon form and the efficiency of photosynthesis of spores. Carmen didn't know exactly how long it would take, but a few hours at least. But would the Star Ring Trade give him time? The increase in the soldiers stopped, and the attacks of mutant creatures had no stamina. Under the command of the headquarters, the Power Armor Brigade in the corner of the base began to counterattack against the mutant creatures that were showing signs of decline! The spitters were torn to pieces by the fire net, and the Blade Warriors had their chests cut open by plasma-cutting daggers. The corrosive dark green blood splattered wildly, even washing away the coating on the power armor. Without supplements, it was only a matter of time before thousands of mutant creatures were annihilated. The collision of flesh and blood and steel, the first clash between a harmonious civilization and a pure civilization, settled as the dust dispersed. The dust dispersed, and no more mutant creatures climbed out of the deep pit. In the front row of the team, a power armor that was kneeling on one knee put away the unfolded shield and slowly stood up from the ground. "Sh*t, finished?" "It's over..." Another soldier shook his mucus-stained arm and replied in a low voice. The battle was over, but no one removed their masks. There was still a high density of spore clusters floating around outside. It was quite dangerous even for those who had been injected with genetic potions. Some stood still and waited for orders, others sit on the ground, ignoring the disgusting corpses of mutant creatures. No cheers, only relief after surviving a disaster. A total of forty T3 power armors were destroyed on the battlefield, and more than thirty soldiers died on the spot. For the newly-built Power Armor Brigade, this loss was undoubtedly huge. But for the results it had achieved, it was undoubtedly epic. Nearly ten thousand mutant creatures were killed by them. It is no exaggeration to say that even if a NATO division could not achieve such fruitful results, and it may nurture more enemies. Walking to the front of the team, the brigadier of the Power Armor Brigade glanced around at his men. "Alright, guys. The mission has not been over yet. Let's go down and kill this bug. Let me see..." As he spoke, he tapped on the touchpad on his arm and controlled a reconnaissance drone to the deep pit. Before the drone was destroyed by the mutant creatures, he saw the situation inside clearly and said, "There are about thirty more." Who has the energy to go down with me? A soldier stood up with a rifle and raised his hand. "I'll go with you. I can still move." "Count me in." The brigadier picked eleven soldiers from the team and brought them to the deep pit. He opened the turbine engine behind him and jumped down. As the twelve power armors landed on the ground, the Blade Warriors who were lurking in the dark immediately rushed up, ready to make a dying struggle. The brigadier raised his arm and casually stuck the neck of a mutant creature. His other hand took out a pistol and shot its head, then threw the limp body to the side. The remaining dozen or so mutant creatures were far away. Before they got close, they were shot into sieves by the soldiers behind them. Stepping over the corpses of the mutant creatures, the soldiers came to the core of the Mother Nest. Here they saw the eggs blown into a mess, as well as dark green and crimson slurry all over the floor. "Sh*t, they are disgusting." "Get it done early and leave here early." The engineer took out the blasting tool from his back and distributed a few aluminum -- heat agents to the soldier. "The red one goes deeper in." Spores could extinguish fire, but the Mother Nest did not have this function. As long as the burning part was stuffed into the core of the Mother Nest, it could effectively eliminate combustion from being affected by the spore gas. Looking at what Celestial Trade soldiers were doing, Carmen's face showed a trace of panic. When the thermite was injected into the Mother Nest, he roared with red eyes. "No!" The soldier nearest to Carmen glanced at him and grinned. He waved the thermite in his hand and then plunged it into the core of the Mother Nest. Gorgeous flames leaked through the cracks, but most of them sprayed on the inside. Under the extreme heat, the core of the Mother Nest disintegrated at a speed visible to the naked eye. Seeing the scene, Carmen was distraught. He sacrificed all the researchers in the research institute, bodyguards loyal to him, and even his confidants for the Mother Nest. But now, Star Ring Trade destroyed all of them in front of him. Resentment, fury, fear... Various negative emotions mixed together, and his face was indescribably distorted. Just then, the Brigadier came over him and tapped his finger on the resin incubation chamber, signaling Carmen to look at him. Then he took out the Future phone from his waist, unfolded it, and put it on the membrane of the incubation chamber. "Here we are again." Sitting in the presidential suite of the Hilton Hotel, Jiang Chen looked at Carmen, who was lying in the incubation chamber, and smiled, "I didn't expect it to be in such a way, it's quite ironic." Staring at Jiang Chen on the phone screen, Carmen's pupils were covered with blood streaks, "You came to laugh at me?" "Nope." Jiang Chen shook his head, looking at the grim-faced Carmen inside the incubation chamber, from whose body he could no longer see any of the elegance and composure of the old aristocrat. His tone couldn't help but be filled with pity. "I'm just a bit curious. What made my opponent be like this?" Carmen did not reply. At the moment, his mind was dominated by hatred. Just then, Jiang Chen noticed the black ball on top of his head. "Is that Golden Apple?" Frowning slightly, he vaguely recalled the history of the Rothschild family, which seemed to be innately susceptible to Klein's particle waves. This family could vaguely perceive external connections without the help of external objects. This was probably an ability that even Tanaka did not possess. The universe was filled with numerous disorderly Klein's particle waves, just like electromagnetic waves. Carmen is not only inherently sensitive to Klein's particle waves, but also has some kind of paranoia about the Golden Apple, and even slept with the "Amplification Device of Klein's Particle Waves" at his bedside. It's like putting a magnet on top of a TV, and it doesn't take long for the color to start going out of whack. To put it bluntly, he was insane. Having realized it, Jiang Chen suddenly lost interest. Initially, he wanted to talk to Carmen, but now he had no interest in it. Jiang Chen sighed and closed the communication window with Carmen and ordered the Brigadier. "Give him a quick death." "Yes, sir." The black muzzle of the gun was pressed against the membrane of the incubation chamber. Carmen stared blankly at the gun which pointed at his head. Bang -! Without even having the chance to make a sound, his consciousness plummeted into the abyss. (To be continued.) Chapter 1075 The Concerns of the Pentagon It wasn't just the Brits and Finns who were watching the battle, but the United States, far across the Atlantic, was also keeping a close eye on what was happening in Finland. When Star Ring Trade showed the kinetic bombardments, everyone's face turned ashen. Then, the Power Armor Brigade and the drone airdrop tactic made the atmosphere in the conference room of the Pentagon dropped to the freezing point. Although the images captured by the Brits were not clear, through the screen, they could still feel the terror of the mutant creatures rushing up like a tide, as well as how powerful the power armor was to withstand the attacks by mutant creatures. If the K1 exoskeleton was compared to a bicycle, then the power armor was undoubtedly a motorcycle. Not only did it provide soldiers with armor with high mobility, but it could also serve as a fulcrum for firepower output, improving the individual combat strength of soldiers to the limit. Although on the side of humanity,  the last thing the U.S. Secretary of Defense wanted to see was that Star Ring Trade defeat the mutant creatures in the final battle. It would be best if they followed the Hollywood script and both the British and Xin Country were defeated by the mutant creatures. In the end, the American Marine Corps launched a war to save mankind as a savior. The Minister of Defense kept praying that the swarm of bugs would overwhelm the two hundred "humanoid armored vehicles". However, reality was not as he wished. The moment the drone cluster rushed into the nest, it indicated the failure of the mutant creatures. When the last Blade Warrior was decapitated by the plasma cutting dagger, the conference room was silent. "These hypocrites, they went back on their word! It was clearly stated that there were only two Orbital Airborne Brigades, how come there's one more?" A senior official from the U.S. Defense Department broke the silence and cursed. The minister, Ashton Carter, glanced at the officer and shook his head. You really believe there are only two Orbital Airborne Brigades? The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has lots of equipment that hasn't been released yet, so it's just a matter of poor intelligence. However, there was nothing he could do about it. The Ghost Agent's native intelligence capacities were too strong. A long time ago, CIA had tried to steal the technology related to space elevators by penetrating into the Star Circle Trade. However, all the agents sent to Xin Country returned in failure. Some of them even disappeared. Just then, Comrade Hillary, who was sitting at the conference table, suddenly spoke up. "I'm more worried about their kinetic bombardments than Orbital Airborne Brigades and power armor. "If they can deliver dozens of tons of tungsten-cored bombs over our heads at any time, it will pose a serious threat to the national security of the United States." Those present nodded. The Outer Space Treaty formulated in 1966 prohibits the development of weapons and the "militarization of space" in outer space. However, it has long been the common strategic goal of all major powers to vigorously develop military aerospace technology and space power, seize absolute control of airspace, and secure the strategic position of safeguarding national security interests. If the treaty were strictly adhered to, all high-orbit missiles should not exist, but is this possible? Glancing around the room, the CIA Director coughed softly and spoke, "Regarding their kinetic bombardments, we managed to get some tungsten-cored bombs from Ukraine. According to CIA technicians, the technology of kinetic bombardments was not advanced. It was just an alloy tungsten ball about the size of a watermelon, and the core of the ball was installed with a guiding component similar to a latrine. "It's easy to imitate their weapons," he paused, with a hint of helplessness on his face, "the key is how to send those tungsten balls into the synchronized orbit." If these tungsten balls could not be sent to the synchronous orbit at a reasonable cost, it would be completely meaningless to develop kinetic bombardments. "Yup." The military advisor of the White House smiled bitterly, "It would be totally redundant to rocket these things up into a synchronized orbit and drop them down. The danger of the Star Circle trade is that there is no international convention to limit the size of private armies. If they continue to expand their scale, we can do nothing to interfere." Hearing this, Hilary tapped her fingers on the arm of the sofa and mused, "What if we make the relevant international convention now?" "I'm afraid we'll become the biggest victim." The Minister of Defense, Carter, said with difficulty, "As you know, a large chunk of our annual defense budget is spent on military contractors every year. It is no exaggeration to say that they have become part of the U.S. Army." The senior officials from the Department of Defense and the White House present in the room, including Hillary, fell silent. If the White House were to crack down on private military contractors, Wall Street will be the first to object. Cracking down on the military industry is tantamount to harming the interests of the entire American consortium. Those notorious private military contractors like Black Water, Triple Canopyand DynCorp were inextricably linked to Wall Street。 Next year will be the 2020 general election. She should please the public and avoid offending the American consortium to retain her position. Now that Goldman Sachs has just collapsed, and WASP consortiums such as Morgan Stanley and First Boston has dominated the entire North American financial circle, no one wants to provoke those capitalist bigwigs at this time. What should I do? Hilary frowned in thought… The war was over. After destroying the Mother Nest, the Power Armor Brigade controlled the military base under Jiang Chen's instructions. The Brigadier of the British mechanized brigade took a car to the entrance of the military base and applied to enter the military base. He had good reasons, such as "recovering the remains of fallen soldiers" and "hauling out the wreckage of scrapped armored vehicles". But he was still rejected by Star Circle Trade. The reason for rejection was very simple. There were no corpses here at all; soldiers captured by the mutant creatures were immediately gobbled up and sent into the Mother Nest as the quality tonic and breeding ground for spores. The Star Circle Trade only promised to send back the name cards engraved with the English letters if they were picked up. Such arguments clearly failed to satisfy the Brits. Recovering the remains was the second priority. Everyone knew that the bones of the dead were probably eaten. They wanted to get a closer look at the power armor of Star Ring Trade and gather as much intelligence as possible about the new equipment. Besides, what they were most worried about was that the X2 bacteria would be taken by Star Ring Trade. Needless to say, those ferocious mutant creatures were so impressive that if someone used them for military purposes, the consequences would be unimaginable. The best way to overcome fear is to get one for yourself, just like nuclear weapons. Brigadier Molston made up his mind that they would not retreat from this military base. Anyway, the Star Circle Trade didn't have the strength to take on the United Kingdom directly. When the scientific research team from London comes here, they must study the formation mechanism of the Mother Nest. Even if they don't use it for military purposes, they have to back up it in their sample repository, in case of emergency. However, Celestial Trade rejected them without giving them any face and made the entire military base a private territory. It's useless for Finnish officials to come up and mediate. When their president asked Star Circle Trade to send in troops, he disposed of the Arrowhead's assets that were nationalized to Star Circle Trade at a discounted price of S$300 million. Jurisprudentially, the treaty between Arrowhead and the Finnish government transferred to Jiang Chen. This military base, for example, is now a private asset of Star Ring Trading, protected by Finnish law. The brigadier of the Power Armor Brigade had no intention of talking to Molston, and the two soldiers guarding the doorway held him back. Even if Molston was extremely reluctant, he could only return to the military camp next to Paltak and report the news to his superior, waiting for the Ministry of Defense to study it before making a decision. (To be continued.) Chapter 1076 It's Around Us A night passed after the fierce war. The next morning, light snow drifted in the sky. It's the end of May, which was close to summer for the northern hemisphere. But it had nothing to do with the tundra in northern Finland. Located in the Arctic Circle, locals can see snow until mid-June if the Arctic monsoon passes through. At this moment, the flag of Star Ring Trade had risen above the military base next to Paltak. After multiple rounds of bombardment, there were no intact buildings in the entire military base.  Star Circle Trade, after consulting with the Finnish side, borrowed a route through Russia to deliver supplies to the base. The logisticians who arrived in Murmansk by plane followed up with the scientific team and set up marching tents outside the military base. Unlike what Jiang Chen had seen in the apocalypse, thesemodified X2 bacteria had a very tenacious survival ability. Even without the Mother Nest, they could survive for a long time. That is why it was so risky to leave them to their own devices. Without the injection of genetic agents, any creature would be "zombie" after inhaling a certain amount of spore gas. Especially for primates, it seemed that the more developed the brain, the more susceptible the creature was to these toxic bacteria. After a logistics team of a thousand people arrived, Jiang Chen ordered them to annihilate the spores floating in the air and eliminate all the infected sources. Although no agents were developed to kill these spores, not everything had to be solved by technology. These spores can extinguish fire. Since they extinguish fire by sacrificing themselves and that there is no Mother Nest to produce spores, the fire-tending properties will hasten their demise. No need for any special antiseptic equipment at all. A flamethrower could generate unexpected results. The entire military base was still covered by spores. In addition to the soldiers in power armor, only the logistics personnel in orange chemical protective suits stayed at the base. The corpses of the mutant creatures were piled up in an open space a kilometer away from the military base, doused in gasoline and burned. The black smoke floated from yesterday to today's morning. Even in Paltak, which was several kilometers away, the smoke could be clearly seen. In the command room next to the military base, Brigadier Kleiman took off his power armor and stood in front of the desk, listening to his subordinates' reports. "..." Columbia Broadcasting System wants to get inside the military base to film the underground bunker and the wreckage of the Mother Nest." "Ask them to ask Star Ring Trade for permission. We are soldiers and have no right to let them in." Kleiman said impatiently. This was already the fifth media that found the entrance to the military camp. Now, the entire world focused on this military base. Almost everyone had the same question. That was, how Star Circle Trade planned to deal with the aftermath. "Additionally, we were contacted this morning by officials of the Finnish Presidency. The President wanted to have a dialog with us regarding the disposal of the corpses of mutant creatures. They hope that we can come up with a more environmentally friendly solution to replace concentrated burning." Hearing the subordinate's report, Kleiman raised his eyebrows, "Then go tell him to either accept our plan or find a way to deal with these sources of infection themselves. If they need it, we can send it to the warehouse in the nearby town for free. "Yes, sir." The officer saluted and then left the command tent. Kleiman sat in his chair, intending to rest with his eyes closed for a while. Before the chair was warmed up by his ass, a non-commissioned officer trotted into command tent and pulled him up from his half-asleep state. The report was only six short words, but it made Kleiman, who had been disturbed in his sleep, with no temper at all. The officer stood at attention and saluted, "Report! The boss is approaching." ... At noon, a helicopter flew over from the mountain and landed steadily on the tarmac inside the military base. Jiang Chen, who was wearing the chemical-proof suit and a gas mask, jumped out off the helicopter. Although he was fine without wearing them, the spore concentration in the military base was high, so it was better not to make it too alarming. Behind him was the head of the Federal Security Service, Balter, who was also wearing a protective suit and looking around at the messy base. Initially, Ayesha was going to come along. But, given that she wouldn't stay in Finland for two days, Jiang Chen let her return to Koro Island first. Wearing the power armor, Kleiman saluted Jiang Chen. Jiang Chen nodded at him approvingly. "Thank you for your hard work." "It's my pleasure!" Kleiman grinned. Jiang Chen asked, "How is the situation underground?" Kleiman replied, "It has been confirmed that the Mother Nest is dead, with no living mutant creatures left. The logistics team is eliminating X2 bacteria. The research team from Koro Island is investigating the body of the Mother Nest." "Take us down to take a look." "Yes, sir!" Kleiman stood at attention and saluted. Following behind Kleiman, Jiang Chen and Balter came to the giant pit in the middle of the base. It used to be the entrance to the underground bunker. A few days ago, it was destroyed by Star Ring Trade's tungsten-cored bombs. To facilitate access for the cleanup crews and the research team, the logistical unit built an elevator here. After stepping into the elevator, the three of them arrived at the entrance of the underground bunker five hundred meters below. "Is this interior of the Mother Nest? The flesh-like bubbles on the wall are disgusting." Balter glanced at the remnants on the wall with a look of disgust on his face. "You can understand it this way. Before the core was destroyed, the Mother Nest had already constructed the entire underground bunker." Jiang Chen explained. Not far away, researchers gathered around the remains of the eggs to take samples. The never-before-seen DNA codes and biological forms subverted the knowledge of these scholars about biology. Everyone poured their passion for science into these precious samples. These are valuable materials for the entire human civilization. With regards to the harmonious civilization, Jiang Chen had merely glimpsed a glimpse from afar. It wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say that he knew nothing about it. He did not expect to find any weaknesses about the harmonious civilization based on the remains of the Mother Nest. but for now, this was the only way for humans to understand them. As Jiang Chen was wearing a chemical-proof suit, no one recognized him along the way. After the soldiers on guard saluted Kleiman, they let him in. In this way, the two men, accompanied by Klayman, went to the wreckages of the core of the Mother Nest. Looking at the miserable remains, Balter glanced at the resinous "coffin" and saw a familiar face through the torn membrane. "Carmen Rothschild?" "That's right." "You did kill him." Balt smacked his lips, "the International Court of Justice should have been his best destination." "Keeping him alive will be a problem." Jiang Chen said indifferently. He did not know what the harmonious civilization had revealed to Carmen. If those bugs told him about Jiang Chen's ability to travel through time, it would be a problem. The Rothschild family had produced at least ten thousand golden apples, which were a hidden threat to him and human civilization. He came here to solve this threat! Jiang Chen gestured to Kleiman, who was standing next to him, and then pointed at the head of this resin coffin. Kleiman understood him immediately. Then, Kleiman took out his tactical dagger and stepped forward, cut open the resin surface, reached in with his steel hand, and pulled out a black ball. Upon seeing the black ball, there was a somewhat subtle expression on Balt's face. "Golden Apple," Jiang Chen took the black ball from Kleiman and weighed it in his hand. "We always thought it was a prop for communicating with the future, but in fact, this is not the case." Communication is only their basic capacity. They are adept at brainwashing, infecting parasitifers imperceptibly and turning them into their lackeys. Whether it was Tanaka or Carmen, they were essentially the same kind of people. With that, Jiang Chen tossed the Golden Apple back to Kleiman in feigned disgust, signaling that he would stuff it back in. He couldn't see Balt's expression through the chemical-proof suit, but years of experience in fooling people told him that he had accomplished his goal. The German Revolution was about to win, and Russia must have obtained the Golden Apple from the Resistance. If they referred to SOME information and repeatedly experiment with these things, they might have some findings. Jiang Chen had to give them a warning before they figured out how to use the Golden Apple. He made them fear the Golden Apple. "The most important thing is that the biological civilization that the Golden Apple communicates with is not from the future." After a pause, Jiang Chen looked at Balter meaningfully. "It's around us." (To be continued.) Chapter 1077 Super Effective Conscription Ads Long before the Munich incident, Carmen had used a series of means to control the power of the entire Rothschild family. After the murder of his brother James in the Pearson Church Massacre through the Star Ring Trade, the whole family basically belonged to him. It was for this reason that, with his death, the Rothschilds came to an end. Jiang Chen foresaw that once the revolution that occurred in Germany was victorious, the first thing the Christian Democratic Union would do to oust the Alternative for Germany was to clear up the "crimes" committed by the Freemasons during the Alternative for Germany's reign. As expected, the Rothschild and several other families' assets in Germany would be auctioned off by the banks to cover the astronomical fines issued to them by the courts. It was foreseeable that for some time to come, even if Jiang Chen did nothing, the Rothschild family would collapse in the frenzy of asset division. They have too much money. Meanwhile, they are too weak. Jiang Chen wasn't worried that they wouldn't die fast enough, the only thing he cared about was the Golden Apples originally held by Rothschild family. It would be ok if they were all in Carmen's hands. Now that Carmen was dead, these Golden Apples were bound to be lost. Not only Russia, Jiang Chen believed that the United States, Britain, France, and even China, far away on the other side of the world, would be interested in these things, and they would try to get one or two back to study. The harmonious civilization has mastered the communication channel of the Golden Apple. If the leaders of various countries fail to realize the dangers involved, it is difficult to predict where the next mother nest would be born. Sitting on the plane back to Moscow, Balter thought about the conversation he had with Jiang Chen in the underground bunker and what he had seen and heard inside the Mother Nest ... "... You mean IT is the product of an extraterrestrial civilization?" Balter still couldn't believe the facts that Jiang Chen had articulated to him, his eyebrows locked tightly as he looked at Carmen lying in the resin coffin, "The Golden Apple is just a tool for brainwashing?" "That's right," Jiang Chen nodded. "Unbelievable." "I know, it sounds a lot like an April Fool's joke, but it is true. On June 15, we will hold an Outer Space Security Summit in Koro City, where we will unveil all the evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations that we have gathered in our space activities. I've told you what I know openly and honestly. As for whether you take it seriously or not, it is up to you." Balter froze on the spot due to the overwhelming amount of information. Extraterrestrial civilization? Are you kidding me? Balter still couldn't believe it, even if Jiang Chen had vaguely mentioned it to him the last time he was in Murmansk. The Golden Apple that the Federal Security Service had managed to obtain with great difficulty was a plot by aliens to invade the Earth. He couldn't believe that this kind of plot, which would only appear in Hollywood movies, would happen in front of his eyes. However, when recalling the serious expression on Jiang Chen's face, he couldn't help but mutter again. If the Golden Apple is truly a brainwashing tool, capable of unknowingly turning the parasitifer into a lackey of an extraterrestrial civilization, then it is dangerous. After all, no one can tell who has been brainwashed, and the person who has been brainwashed is unlikely to admit it. If the brainwashed person secretly created a Mother Nest in Russia... A drop of cold sweat slid across his forehead at the thought. The Golden Apple passed through an unknown number of people along the way from the Resistance to the Federal Security Service. Realizing the severity of the problem, Balter made up his mind. Let's at least wait until June 15 to see what evidence Star Circle Trade would present. Before that, temporarily seal those Golden Apples to prevent anyone from approaching them. If what he said was true, the Golden Apples were dangerous, and it would not be too late to destroy them then. Through the cameras of Finland National Television Station, Star Ring Trade's orbital weapons and cool power armor were known to every corner of the world. Those who had been pessimistic about the mutant creatures because of the crushing defeat of the British army had their hopes rekindled by that complete victory of two hundred against ten thousand. Those devilishly ugly mutant creatures fell one by one in front of the steel armor. The dark green blood was dismembered under the clusters of orange-yellow bullets. The last close combat made people's blood boil. "Aawesome, are they 200 Gundams? Or two hundred Iron Men? I'm wondering if I will have the chance to wear that thing after joining the Star Circle Trade. If so, I will go to the official website to register for a foreign corps. "@Robert Downey Jr, what do you think?" "I very much like the model with the laser blade in the right arm! Look at the way that blade cleaves the mutant creature in half, awesome. Unfortunately, the image was so blurry. It would be nice if the cameras of Finnish TV were more high-definition." Apart from those meaningless messages on social media platforms, there were discussions about the utility of this weapon on some military forums. The military fans were divided between those who thought this weapon called power armor could change the landscape of modern warfare, and those who deemed there was no need to make such a fuss. This kind of armor reminds me of the bulletproof armor during World War I. It is a machine gun inserted in the arm. I don't think there is something special about it. It's just a mechanical exoskeleton with steel skin. Instead of developing an iron lump that wraps the person, it is better to produce a few more tanks or armored vehicles. " "You're too naive. How did the British mechanized brigade get in and out? Practice is the only standard for testing truth! The infantry with defensive power, high mobility, support ability, and even anti-armor capacity would become the omnipotent Rambo on the battlefield. Besides, it can be mass-produced! As for welding steel platesoutside the mechanical exoskeleton, you're talking about Krupp's 'Lightning' series, right? Don't compare it with the products of the Future Military Industry, the two are not in the same level at all!" Of course, not all public opinion favored Star Ring Trade. The second threat of "biochemical crisis" was relieved, and people couldn't help but reflect on another problem. If Star Ring Trade could deploy the Power Armor Brigade that was comparable to the combat power of a division in any corner of the world within a few hours, what was the point of the border? Under the instigation of people with bad intentions, many pacifists spontaneously held demonstrations and rallies in big cities such as New York and Los Angeles to protest against the use of outer space by Star Ring Trade for military purposes. However, these protests did not have a great impact. Even though most of the mainstream media in Western countries, representing the interests of the elites, agreed with the stance of these protesters, public opinions on the Internet was clearly in favor of the Star Circle Trade. Jiang Chen was busy discussing the "remuneration" with the Finnish government these days, and he did not pay attention to the Internet. It was not until he was in transit at the Moscow airport that he realized that the Star Circle Trade's Power Armor Brigade had become unexpectedly famous. Such a result was somewhat unexpected for Jiang Chen. Although he expected that power armor would attract widespread attention from various governments across the world, he did not expect that it would cause such a hot topic among the people. Jiang Chen didn't know what kind of impact it would have, but one thing was certain. The HD video of Finland TV Station made a free conscription advertisement for Star Ring Trade with super effectiveness. (To be continued.) Chapter 1078 Drive Carefully A few days had passed since Star Ring Trade's military operation to eliminate the Mother Nest. The White House and the Pentagon held dozens of big and small meetings centered on Star Ring Trade. "...I don't care what method you use. Within three days, I want to see DARPA develop a plan for power armor separated from the mechanical exoskeleton project. Don't worry about the budget. I will discuss it with Congress. According to the Minister of Defense, this power armor is tentatively designed as the fulcrum of firepower for infantry squads. Apart from an ammunition load of at least fifty kilograms and nuclear, biological, and chemical-proof capabilities, it must have absolute protection against ammunition up to a caliber of 12.7mm..." At this moment, in a small conference room inside the White House, Hillary and the director of DARPA  had a separate meeting. DARPA is the abbreviation for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the United States, and it was known as the real version of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division. DARPA has participated in many defense and aerospace projects, including the Faraday Spray, which restrains EMP weapons, is a product jointly designed by DARPA and Lockheed Martin. Star Circle trade was so far ahead of the US in defense technology that Hillary had to rely on DARPA. Taking careful note of Hilary's request, the director twirled the ballpoint twice, with the tip of the pen nudging the notebook. "We'll get the project underway as soon as possible. Lockheed Martin has made remarkable progress on the mechanical exoskeleton, and we have the technical resources at our disposal. Besides, I suggest we negotiate with Germany to see if we can get information about the modification of 'lightning' exoskeleton from the Krupp Group. They have developed the prototype of power armor, but their design is not perfect. "I'll let Kerry talk about that." Hillary said. After exchanging some opinions with Hillary on the details, the director closed his notebook and got up to leave. There were still a couple of meetings waiting for him after he went back. He had to prepare the proposal within two days to make it in time for the hearing of the House Committee on the Budget on the third day. This R&D project involving hundreds of millions of dollars was not something he could decide alone by signing. When he walked to the door of the conference room and was about to pull it open, the door was pushed open. The assistant of the White House walked in with a document. "First Lady." Hilary looked to her assistant and asked seriously. “What's going on?” "Xin's president sent us an invitation." Walking over to Hillary, the asssitant placed the document on the table, "It says we're invited to attend the Outer Space Security Summit on June 15th." "Outer Space Security Summit?" Hillary sneered, causing the wrinkles at the corners of her eyes to furrow. Star Ring Trade had the nerve to open the Outer Space Security Summit? Who was the one using space resources for weapons development? "Write me a polite letter of rejection, saying that the United States regrets Star Circle Trade's violation of the Outer Space Treaty, and will not initiate high-level bilateral talks with the Xin country until Star Circle Trade and the Xin country explain their stance on the matter." "Yes, madam." The assistant nodded and turned away. Leaning against the chair, Hilary rubbed the corners of her tired eyes. There was another meeting in ten minutes. Just as she was about to take a nap, she suddenly noticed the invitation out of the corner of her eye. After hesitating for a moment, following the principle of diplomatic etiquette, she took out the invitation letter from the document bag. After roughly scanning several lines of the letter, Hillary, who caught a keyword, was stunned. "Extraterrestrial civilization?" Looking down the text on the invitation letter, Hilary's expression kept changing. When she read the last line, she threw the invitation letter on the table, got up immediately and went out. In the early morningof June 1, a plane from Gulfstream Aerospace landed at the Koro Airport. Surrounded by a group of bodyguards, Jiang Chen yawned and crossed the special passageway to his Rulka sedan. After the bodyguards pulled the door, he sat in the passenger seat. Ayesha, who was sitting in the driver's seat, skillfully started the car. When the car reached the initial speed, she pressed the button to activate the magnetic suspension device, and then the car steadily flew up. The major traffic arteries in the downtown of Koro City have been modified with magnetic levitation, almost half of the private cars were floating in the air. The constant flow of traffic and the neon lights on both sides of the street complemented each other. Against the backdrop of skyscrapers and lights, the whole city was like a bright pearl, dreamy and beautiful. It's hard to imagine what it was like four years ago. In the car, Jiang Chen unexpectedly received a call from Warner Bros. Christopher Nolan, with whom Jiang Chen had worked before, contacted him, saying that Warner Bros. was very interested in shooting a film about the battle between humans and mutant creatures, and asked him to see if Star Circle Trade could provide some help in the filming. Given the positive publicity for Star Ring Trade, Jiang Chen gladly accepted the proposal of Warner Bros. He said that as long as Star Ring Trade played a positive image in the movie, it would provide free help in filming. After hanging up, Jiang Chen closed the holographic screen and stretched. After taking two flights in a row, he hadn't quite gotten over his jet lag, and he was groggy. Ayesha looked at Jiang Chen with concern as she asked in a low voice, "How about the situation in Finland?" "Not bad, just a little busy with work." "Have you seen Natasha?" "I saw her before I got on the plane. She invited me for dinner." Jiang Chen turned his face sideway and smiled at Ayesha, who was focused on driving. He lowered his hand down from the top of his head and wrapped it around her slender waist. "Don't always ask me. What about you? Did you miss me during my absence?" Ayesha whispered with a red face, "I miss you every day." Ayesha twisted her body but didn't resist in any way. Jiang Chen was not worried about the traffic accident at all. The magnetic suspension was more than ten times safer than driving on the road. The track at a specific height is restricted by intelligent programs to maintain a specific speed. After entering the highest cruising track, you can transfer the driving rights to the intelligent programs. Initially, Jiang Chen only hugged her waist, but he soon became insatiable. However, she was too docile, so his big hand kept going upwards... Biting her lower lip, she could no longer suppress her feelings. Ayesha, whose face was flushed red, drove the car onto the cruise and completely handed over the driving to the intelligent pilot system. Her hands completely left the steering wheel as she nimbly turned over and sat on Jiang Chen's lap like a loach. With her arms around Jiang Chen's neck, Ayesha blinked her big, clear, sapphire eyes and stared at him. Being gazed at in such a way, on the contrary, Jiang Chen, who had been lewd earlier, was somewhat embarrassed. "Well, drive carefully -" Before he could finish speaking,  Jiang Chen's lips were blocked by her hot and small lips, fragrant and smooth. A tender tongue broke through the teeth and burrowed in, and a pair of small, cool, gentle hands wandered down his strong arms... Behind the black glass, they were surrounded by the radiant street scene. In this situation, everything was as natural as the flow of water. Jiang Chen felt that the fatigue that he had accumulated over the past few days gradually dissipated with the warmth of skin-to-skin contact. In the bright night, a show of speed and excitement started... (To be continued.) Chapter 1079 End of War For the third time, Xia Shiyu looked up at the clock on the wall. She sighed deeply and muttered in a low voice, "Why haven't you come back so late?" Half an hour ago, Ayesha drove to the airport to pick up Jiang Chen, so she went to the bathroom to take a shower. It was summer and the weather was hot, so Xia Shiyu didn't immediately change her clothes immediately after taking a bath. Instead, he wrapped his wet hair with a white towel and sat on the sofa in the living room. Fantasizing about Jiang Chen looking at him with a blushing face and rapid breathing, Xia Shiyu could not help but curl into a faint smile. Realizing that she was thinking about something shameful, Xia Shiyu's face suddenly turned red. She clenched her fists and gently coughed, hurriedly took a few deep breaths, adjusted her state, and reverted back to a serious and innocent appearance. She couldn't help but look out the window, with the glint of love and anticipation in her eyes. Time passes by. It was already one o 'clock. Looking at the wall clock again, Xia Shiyu gradually became restless and began to worry. "Was there a traffic jam?" "Impossible. How can a maglev car get stuck in traffic.? Was there some accident on the road?" Thinking of this, Xia Shiyu couldn't sit still and hurriedly picked up the cell phone on the coffee table and called Jiang Chen. The phone rang for a while with no answer. Then she called Ayesha, but her phone was turned off. Xia Shiyu was anxious. Just as she got up and was about to change her clothes and go out to take a look, the sound of the door opening came from outside the villa. The headlights flashed slightly, and the Rulka car drove into the garage. Soon, the two pushed open the door and stepped into the living room. Seeing that they came back safely, Xia Shiyu sighed in relief and walked up, looking at Jiang Chen with a bit of annoyance. "What took you so long?" "We were delayed on the road for a while, why haven't I slept yet?" Jiang Chen smiled awkwardly. Xia Shiyu glanced at Jiang Chen suspiciously. Something's wrong. Normally, he would have had an unnatural reaction to seeing herself wrapped in a towel. sn't he a little too calm now? She didn't know that Jiang Chen, who had just completed four consecutive ejaculations, was currently in Sage Mode. Not to mention wrapped in a bath towel, even if they soaked together, there wouldn't be any strange reactions! She didn't realize what Xia Shiyu was curious about, but the suspicious gaze made him nervous. Jiang Chen touched his face in embarrassment and whispered. "Is there something on my face?" Xia Shiyu shook her head, then looked at Aisha again. Ayesha blushed and averted her gaze. Seeing this, Jiang Chen suddenly realized what Xia Shiyu was curious about. God damn it! Xia Shiyu immediately understood something. She walked over to Jiang Chen with a smile and held his arm "gently" with her hands. "There is indeed something, let me help you with that." The fragrance of the cloves drilled into the tip of Jiang Chen's nose. Her wet hair was still covered with water vapor. Looking down from her pretty face, it was a stretch of whiteness that led to the depth. Being pressed so close by the beauty, Jiang Chen was painful but joyful. "Indeed, there are quite a few things," Xia Shiyu scrutinized Jiang Chen's side face and nodded seriously. She glared at Ayesha full of jealousy. "Come on. Let's go upstairs. I'll help you clean up carefully." With that, Xia Shiyu grabbed the towel on her chest with one hand and Jiang Chen's arm with the other as she quickly walked upstairs. Jiang Chen's pitiful expression made Ayesha a little heartache. But the little girl only mourned for him for a second in her heart, and then hummed some songs and ran to the bathroom upstairs. The summer of Koro City was very hot. Her body was sticky. She quickly took a shower and then went back to the bedroom to have a good sleep. It wasn't until noon that Jiang Chen sat up from his bed and rubbed his sleepy eyes. The beauty he cuddled with last night had already woken up and left. As the saying goes, there are only cows that die from exhaustion, and there is no ploughing of damaged fields. Last night, he used all his strength to bully Xia Shiyu until she begged for mercy. He didn't anticipate that this dedicated female president could get up on time and go to work the next day. Thinking of this, Jiang Chen shook his head and smiled. He lifted the air conditioner blanket and got out of bed. Hearing the noise in the bedroom, the well-behaved Ayesha came in with clothes in her hands. She gently changed Jiang Chen's clothes and whispered in his ear, "Do you have any plans for today?" "Yes," Jiang Chen rubbed Ayesha's hair, "Stay with you two all day." Enjoying the warm hand, Ayesha smiled gently and said softly, "Spend more time with Shiyu. She always waits for you alone at home. I have the chance to go out with you once in a while." Though she rarely mentions you, I can feel that she loves you no less than I do." Looking at her clear eyes, Jiang Chen suddenly felt a little sorry for her. He opened his mouth and was about to say something, but was lightly tapped by her soft index finger. "Don't say anything." Ayesha murmured as she stood on her tiptoes and gently kissed him on the lips. Looking at him with eyes full of love, she straightened his collar. "Get ready for lunch." Looking at the pretty face in front of him, Jiang Chen was little bit tempted. He couldn't help but reach out to hold her waist and whispered in her ear. "Could I eat you first?" "Nope, you have to go to the company this afternoon." Burying her head and gently touching Jiang Chen's chest with her forehead, Ayesha softly said, "Don't delay your business, or Shiyu will get jealous again." Although Jiang Chen was sure that if he insisted, Ayesha would definitely not reject. However, given Xia Shiyu's jealousy and the "harmony of the harem", he listened to her suggestion. After they had lunch together, Jiang Chen sat on the sofa and rested for a while before driving to the company. He took the elevator to the top floor and stopped by to say hello to Xia Shiyu as he passed her office. Although Xia Shiyu didn't say anything, Jiang Chen could clearly feel that she was very joyful when seeing him come here in the afternoon. What she cared about was not whether Jiang Chen was attentive to the work at hand, she had long been accustomed to handling the heavy workload for Jiang Chen, but whether he was willing to spend more time with her. She didn't require Jiang Chen to devote more affection to her than Ayesha, who went through thick and thin with him. She only hoped that he would not alienate her ... Jiang Chen walked into his office and sat down. He asked the beautiful secretary to make him a cup of coffee and called David Smith, the CEO of Future Man Bank, over from downstairs. Soon, Mr. Smith appeared in front of his desk. Since it was work time, Jiang Chen went straight to the point. "Within three days, I want to see a sum of 150 billion NED on the  account of the Future Bank, at my disposal. In addition, send the research reports of Daimler AG, BMW, and Volkswagen Group to my email. By the way, make a table of the top German companies in the electrical industry and send it to my e-mail as well." After hearing Jiang Chen's words, the word "surprised" was written on Smith's face. As a senior financial practitioner, he grasped the smallest capital-related event in the international arena. Needless to say, Jiang Chen was preparing for the bottom of the European economy. The liquidity was readily available. Now his team was studying the assets with high returns and high success rates. Daimler AG, BMW, and Volkswagen Group are high-quality companies that have technology and market prospects, which are the first choice for investors. However, they were not something one could buy. Even if one paid double the premium, it would depend on whether the German government was willing to sell them. However, Smith never expected that his boss would be so resourceful. and he could even acquired the pillars of German automobile industry such as Daimler AG, BMW, and Volkswagen Group. Would the German government just stand by and let its pillar companies in its pillar industries being bought by foreign investors? "No problem." Although Smith was surprised, he only nodded and did not say anything else. "Then go ahead." "Yes, sir." After Smith left, Jiang Chen took the mocha coffee from the hand of the beautiful secretary and leaned in his chair to sip it. The battle was over, consuming a lot of money and soldiers. The German revolution hovered on the eve of victory, the recalcitrant Carmen had died in Finland, the Freemasons, led by the Rothschilds, were powerless to reverse the situation. Next was the climax of the entire war. It was time to divide the spoils! (To be continued.)  Chapter 1080 Buying Spree In a budget hotel in Bremen, a city in northwestern Germany, a man of German descent was hurriedly packing his luggage. Perhaps he was so panicked that he accidentally touched the mobile phone on the table to the floor. Seeing this, he hurriedly bent down and picked up the phone, cursing and stuffing it into his pocket. "Damn Carmen, you got everything wrong! Why did I cooperate with you then?" Damn it!" As he cursed, he closed his packed suitcase and walked quickly toward the door. Calvert Krupp used to be a renowned name in the upper class of Germany. But now, he was living like a street rat. He wore cheap clothes and lived in budget hotels. When he went out, he had to wear sunglasses and a baseball cap, for fear that someone recognized him. For some reason, he suddenly missed his brother, Turner Krupp, who strongly opposed partnering with the Rothschild family and was once the backbone of the Krupp family. If he hadn't been blinded by power and warned his brother to beware of Carmen that night, perhaps there would be another story for Krupp family. Standing in the elevator, he shook his head vigorously and drove away those unrealistic thoughts. It does no good to think about such questions except to bring more annoyance to him. Adjusting his emotions, a glimmer of hope grew in Calvert's mind as he watched the elevator door gradually descend. As long as he escaped to South America, hid there for a period of time, stayed out of the limelight, and then operated the offshore company to secretlyly transfer the money he had in the Caiman Islands, he could still live as a billionaire in South America. A hundred million dollars was enough for the rest of his life. As for the Krupp Family, he had two younger brothers and a younger sister to deal with the mess. When the elevator reached the first floor, Calvert sighed with relief and walked out the door with his suitcase. Just then, however, four men in black suits noticed him. They got up from their chairs and surrounded him from all directions. Noticing that he was being watched, like a startled bird, a hint of panic flashed across Calvert's face. Just as he wanted to turn around and run away, he realized that his retreat had already been blocked, and he had no way to escape. In just a few seconds, he was surrounded by four men in black. The man standing opposite him took out a certificate from his pocket and said expressionlessly, "Are you Mr. Calvert?" "You've got the wrong person ..." Calvert said nervously, "I am Frances Oudh, the boss of a food processing company in South America. This time, I just came to Germany for inspection.,," However the man simply ignored this words and continued, We are agents of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Mr. Calvert, now that you are faced with at least twenty charges including treason, please leave with us." Calvert panicked and slammed into the man next to him in an attempt to escape. However, his small body was no match for a battle-hardened agent. The man next to him didn't even move and easily controlled his hands. "No! I'm not going anywhere! I have a plane to take! Help!..." While making a final struggle, Calvert screamed shrilly, with snot and saliva flowing everywhere, quite miserable. Seeing that Calvert had no intention of cooperating, the agent from the the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution stoped talking to him and gestured to the assistant beside, "Take him away." "Yes, sir!"... On June 3, the German People's Liberation Front marched into Berlin without bloodshed and was greeted by the citizens of Berlin. The revolution, which had lasted for months, came to a triumphant end with a month of armed struggle. On June 5, Evelyn, the head of the government-in-exile, returned from Russia to the Prime Minister's Residence in Berlin. After years of exile, he stood in front of the German people and took the oath of office as prime minister as the leader of the CDU. In the afternoon of the same day, a total of twenty-seven members of the Alternative for Germany were prosecuted for various crimes, including war crimes and crimes against the federal constitution, with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Meanwhile, many European companies, including the Rothschild Bank and the Krupp Group, suspected of making large political contributions to the Alternative for Germany, were sued by the German government. The Supreme Court immediately froze their assets in Germany and initiated proceedings as quickly as possible. If convicted, Rothschild Bank may be sentenced to a large fine of one trillion euros. There was no doubt that the current Rothschild family definitely could not afford so much money, and Evelyn had no plan to confiscate their money. After the verdict was issued, the shares of many companies held by the Rothschild Bank would be nationalized by Germany and put up for auction through a number of banks. The proceeds of the auction would be collected by the state treasury and used to revive Germany's stagnant economy, which had been brought to a standstill by the revolution. According to the agreement, Jiang Chen purchased the shares of the three top automobile companies, Daimler AG, BMW, and Volkswagen Group from the German government  at a premium of 20%, replacing Rothschild and other European consortiums as the first shareholder of these three major European auto companies. The EU integration was expected to go bankrupt, and the EUR continued to fall. The exchange rate of the EUR to the NED even dropped as low as 1:3, with 150 billion NED converted to EUR and eventually traded in the foreign exchange market at a price of 400 billion EUR. Two billion EUR was the loan from Future Bank to Deutsche Bundesbank. One billion EUR was used to acquire 37% of Volkswagen Group, 41% of Daimler AG, and 39% of BMW's equity. Another 100 billion EUR was a temporary initiative by Jiang Chen to invest in a total of five electrical industry companies, including Siemens and Bosch. In this feast of division against the European consortiums, Future Group led by Jiang Chen became the biggest winner. The two main pillar industries in Germany were stamped with the Future Group's label. Initially, Jiang Chen planned to acquire the Krupp Group, but Evelyn rejected. It was not an exaggeration to say that Krupp was the core of the German industry. Even though they were on the wrong side, the German Supreme Court didn't punish them unduly. Moreover, the Krupp Group was controlled by traditional Prussian nobles instead of Jew. They had never entered the core of the Freemasonry. After the new boss went on stage, the Krupp Group stood firmly on the side of the victor, as if it had already disassociated itself from the Rothschild family and the Freemasonry. Evelyn did not intend to push too hard, and that was the end of the story. The EU integration didn't even last for100 days before the farce ended with Carmen's death ... (To be continued.) Chapter 1081 Another Possibility As the heart of the European Union, the victory of the German revolution inspired the Europeanswho were in a state of turmoil. The collapse of the Rothschild empire accelerated the pace of "annihilating the conservative swing" across Europe, and people began to reflect on whether the choices they made two years ago were the right ones, and whether the far-right parties made their countries when they came to power. In contrast to the turbulent situation in Europe, the Asian economy on the other side of the world was steadily rising. Especially in that country in the Western Pacific, with its vast ocean, the GDP soared like a space elevator. On June 10, a delegation from the Japanese government took the initiative to come to Koro City to lead Chubu Electric Power and Tokyo Electric Power in brokering an agreement to expand the power import, raising the total amount of imported power by 31% in the second half of the year to replace two shuttered nuclear power plants in Japan. Currently, the mining rate of Helium 3 in Guanghan City was far greater than the consumption rate. The second nuclear fusion power station was about to be completed, with considerable surplus capacity. Jiang Chen certainly welcomed such an agreement with open hands. Not only Japan, but the Chinese market that Jiang Chen coveted most released loose policies, and sent lots of delegations from power companies to visit the Xin Country. As the world's No. 1 power user, China's power market is larger than the second-place U.S. and third-place India combined. Even if China eliminated half of its thermal power, it would make Star Ring Trade make a fortune. As of early June, the Global Grid Program had completed its most critical first step. With the efforts of many parties, the submarine cables of Star Ring Trade had covered the entire Australia and 80% of Asian countries and regions. Besides, its the output power accounted for 88% of the total domestic electricity output. Benefiting from the dividend of cheap electricity, industrial costs in countries joining the Global Grid Program fell by a maximum of 1.7% and a minimum of 0.3%, based on the share of imported electricity in the total electricity consumption. Don't underestimate the decline of one or two points, the energy generated based on trillions of GDP is unimaginable! Not to mention the benefits to the ecological environment, the investment environment, the competitiveness of export products, the promotion of electrification, and the reduction of domestic industry's dependence on the energy market. In short, the governments of various countries that had benefited from it released positive signals and sent their entrepreneurs to Xin Country to negotiate and see if they could expand their imports. The New York Times even declared that Xin Country became a country on electric poles. The Washington Post published a highly ironic cartoon of a leash sticking out of the Western Pacific Ocean, tethering neighboring countries, large and small. Regardless of what was reported in the media, the countries that bought the tickets to get on the train were on the high-speed electrification train, and it was natural that they had no reason to jump outside the train when they got some benefits. Through the submarine cables, Jiang Chen obtained a steady stream of cash flow and diplomatic capital. Why could US dollars rule the global market for more than half a century? One of the main reasons was that no country could develop its light and heavy industries without oil, and the US dollar happened to be pegged to oil. If the domestic crude oil production could not meet the domestic demand, it had to reserve more foreign exchange to avoid risk. That was why various countries in Asia were increasing their reserve of NED. The rise and fall of NED could already affect the industrial and electricity costs of many countries. Even if Koro City was not the World Financial Center, the Federal Reserve of Xin Country had the potential to pry the U.S. dollar hegemony. It had nothing to do with finance. This was strength... Five days later, the Outer Space Security Summit, at which Star RingTrade would present evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence and demonstrate its aggressive intentions to world leaders, would be held... So far, these countries all indicated that they would send high-level foreign ministers to attend the meeting. There was no suspense about the holding of the meeting. For Jiang Chen, what kind of evidence should be presented at the meeting became the key issue. Currently, the space telescope shipped from the apocalypse had been installed with a space elevator and sent to the synchronous orbit. Although Jiang Chen was not clear about the specific coordinates of the colonial ship, he knew where it would come from and where its destination was. This was enough. Gliese 581 System, about 2 degrees north of Beta Librae, is 20.5 light-years from Earth. A week before the invitation letters were sent out, the Astronomical Observation Team of the Star Ring Trade's Space Division had been observing and analyzing this system for several days and came to a startling conclusion ...... This was no surprise to Jiang Chen. There was a 90% chance of life on the Gliese 581. "Unbelievable..." Holding a stack of documents filled with astronomical data in his hands, Kerwin walked into Jiang Chen's office and said with disbelief, "You guessed right, there is indeed the possibility of harboring life there. But I'm sure that even if life existed there, it could never have spawned a civilization higher than the civilization of the Stone Age." Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows and asked with a smile, "Oh? Why?" "The first is tidal locking. The only habitable zone on the entire planet is along the twilight zone, which limits their living space." Then, Kerwin took out a spectrogram from the document and placed it in front of Jiang Chen, "Next, this planet contains a large amount of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, but it extremely lacks minerals like iron, aluminum, and other elements." According to the gravitational data we have observed, the biggest possibility of this planet is that there are some arthropods in the twilight zone, and it even does not have mammals!" Hearing this, Jiang Chen nodded approvingly. It's quite remarkable to obtain so much valuable intelligence from limited information, albeit with the help of observation equipment from the 22nd century. "Well, have you considered another possibility." "Another possibility?" Kerwin frowned. "It has always been assumed that the development course of civilization is linear, from the Stone Age to the Iron Age, then from the Feudal Age to the Industrial Revolution, and finally crossed the gate of the Information Age to the future." "Is there anything wrong?" Kerwin said disapprovingly. "Conclusions drawn from the linear human civilization cannot be applied to other forms of civilization." Jiang Chen said. "You're telling me that a bunch of bugs might spawn a civilization? No kidding, they..." Kerwin shook his head and was about to say that they didn't even have hands. Suddenly, he was stunned. He suddenly remembered the Star Ring Trade's military operation against the tundra in northern Finland some time ago. There, the Power Armor Brigade that Star Ring Trade was proud of seemed to encounter a group of mutant creatures that crawled out of the eggs. Why did Jiang Chen let Star Ring Trade's Space Division the Gliese System? Why did Jiang Chen suddenly go to Finland before the X2 bacteria outbreak happened? Why was Jiang Chen so sure of the danger of the Mother Nest from the beginning?... All the clues were connected in Kerwin's mind. He looked at Jiang Chen in shock and squeezed out a few words from his throat in disbelief. "You mean..." "That's right," Jiang Chen nodded and said seriously, "The beginning and end of the X2 bacteria outbreak wasn't just a research accident as advertised by the outside world. From the very beginning, it was a conspiracy by an extraterrestrial civilization." (To be continued.) Chapter 1082 Dysontogenesis? After leaving Jiang Chen's office, Kerwin kept repeating what his boss had just said to him. Five days later, the Outer Space Security Summit, at which Star Ring Trade would present evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence and demonstrate its aggressive intentions to leaders across the world, would be held... In fact, the latter did not require proof at all. The two civilizations with completely different values did not have the option of trading from the very beginning. As both sides were bugs in each other's eyes, there seemed to be only one way to prove who would remain at the top of the food chain. It was war. Kerwin looked at the document in his hand with a complicated expression. He recalled the task his boss had assigned him a minute ago. For the first time in his life, Calvin felt the responsiblity of this job. After getting off work in the evening, Jiang Chen didn't go home immediately. Instead, he took a boat to Coconut Island alone. This island had been completely transformed by him into a supply hub connecting the modern world and the apocalypse. Every month, there would be a ship sailing over, unloading unsalable food, daily necessities, and other supplies. Occasionally, it would deliver a batch of goods that were tightly sealed in containers. Some of these containers were filled with advanced industrial machine tools, some were T3 power armor from the Sixth Street, and some were other high-tech products. Although the entire island was not permanently guarded by human soldiers, there was an drone strike formation stationed there. Some foreign agents had tried to break into this "mysterious island", but none of them succeeded. Arriving at the small island, Jiang Chen parked the boat at the pier and tied it up. After the drone confirmed his identity, he walked toward the warehouse in the center of the island. In the corner of the warehouse, the machine Jiang Chen named "Hamster Killer No. 1" was there alone. Last time, Lin Ling used this machine to teleport a fat hamster from the modern world to the apocalypse, and then teleported it back from the apocalypse, achieving a breakthrough in life trans-dimensional teleportation from 0.1 to 1. Although it has a long way to teleport live people, it's certainly a good start. But Jiang Chen didn't expect the device to come in handy so quickly. Jiang Chen walked to the machine and sat down. He took out a few test tubes filled with dark green liquid from his pocket and placed them in the center of two disks. Then he put on the strapped hands attached to the various tubes and activated the power. Looking at the leaping electric arcs, he stiffly pressed the switch. After a long time, Jiang Chen sent the test tubes to the apocalypse. Then, he quickly untied his hands, turned off the power of the machine, and crossed over. ... One of the test tubes contained the substances extracted from the remains of the Mother Nest, while the other test tubes contained spores and extracts from the eggs. The cells in the test tube had not been inactivated yet,  and the squirming of unknown substances could even be seen through the dark green nutrient solution. After receiving these test tubes from Jiang Chen, Lin Ling immediately worked in the lab. Without waiting for a long time, the door of the lab opened again. Lin Ling waved at Jiang Chen and took him to a special microscope. In addition to the test tubes he brought over, Jiang Chen saw two familiar ones. Judging from the labels attached to them, he quickly figured out they came from. The samples you brought are obviously different from those of Shelter 005 and the Mother Nest we saw in the city center. However, there are many similarities in terms of the DNA codes. The Mother Nest you encountered was obviously an upgraded version. Due to the dysontogenesis, many functions have not been mature." After hearing Lin Ling's introduction, Jiang Chen's eyebrows twitched. "Dysontogenesis?" Hundreds of tungsten-cored bombs and an entire Power Armor Brigade were used to defeat it. You told me that this is still not well developed. Then if we wait for it to be mature, won't it be invincible? Lin Lin nodded seriously. "That's right, if it is supplied with sufficient organic matter and given ample time to photosynthesize, digest and absorb that organic matter into its components, the Mother Nest will gradually mature. According to the simulation of its entire DNA codes, it will become a terrifying creature that cannot be eliminated in any way. " At this point, Lin Ling paused and then continued with a grave expression, "At least with the existing technical means, I can't think of a way to wipe it out. Every spore cell has the potential to grow into a Mother Nest, and the number of times it splits has no limit. Unless we can kill every spore, or one day it might pop up again from somewhere." After listening to Lin Ling's account, the Mother Nest's evolutionary speed made Jiang Chen shiver. Earth is a completely alien planet to them who have completely abandoned their traditions. Whether it was gravity, air composition, or magnetic field environment, even if they understood it, it did not necessarily mean that they could well adapt to it. In the war with them, the humans had the home advantage. Yet on this strange planet, their abilities evolved at an incredible rate after each encounter with humans. If there were a few more Mother Nests, it's hard to say what stance harmony civilization would take to fulfill their invasion plans when colonial ships landed. Having realized the seriousness of the issue, Jiang Chen thought for a moment and immediately gave the order. "Collect the information on the Mother Next and focus on analyzing the similar components of the X2 bacteria and the T-series viruses in terms of genotype. Besides, get me an paper file and an electronic file, and the electronic file should ideally be made into an easy-to-understand hologram." "Hey, am I your secretary? I'm very exhausted!" Lin Lind pouted and protested. "Ten boxes of mango pudding." "Oh..." "Lin Ling pursed her lips for a moment, as if making a great concession, "fifteen boxes of pudding with strawberry flavor." Hearing Lin Ling's words, Jiang Chen smiled and shook his head. Was this a problem for him? "I'll bring them for you on my next visit. By they was, don't you like mango flavor?" Lin Ling spat out her little tongue and looked to the side in embarrassment, "There's too much mango pudding. I haven't eaten what you gave me last time." The amount of work involved in collecting all of the information on the Mother Nest was huge, but it was nothing difficult for Lin Ling, who was a cyborg. After getting promise, Lin Ling patted her small chest and assured Jiang Chen that she could get it done in three days at the latest. After leaving the research institute, Jiang Chen went straight through the backyard door to return to the villa. Before coming to the apocalypse, he had already greeted Ayesha. If nothing went wrong, he would stay here for the next three days until Lin Ling finished sorting out the information on the Mother Nest. This information would be of great use in the upcoming Outer Space Security Summit. Whether or not it will attract enough attention from the international community depends on it. (To be continued.) Chapter 1083 Lurked Like a Tiger In the Morgan Stanley Building, Wall Street, New York, USA, an informal shareholders' meeting of Federal Reserve was taking place. The man sitting next to the door was Daniel Morgan, the current head of the Morgan family. Sitting with him at the conference table was the Rockefeller family, the Loki family representing Boston Consortium... Even the Giannini family, the owner of the California consortium in the west, sent their representative. It was no exaggeration to say that those who were qualified to sit on the conference table were not inferior to Franklin, who was printed on the hundred-dollar bill. Moreover, they could breathe. A casual fart from anyone here could cause a magnitude 3 or 4 quake in the financial world. To put it in an exaggerated manner, at least a third of the world's capital is packed into a few dozen square meters of this room. "To start with, let us raise our cups for a common victory." Daniel Morgan picked up the champagne from the conference table, raised it and looked around, "Victory belongs to 'WASP', and Wall Street belongs to 'WASP'!" WASP is short for White Anglo-Saxon Protestant consortium. Usually, the members of the WASP consortium would also call themselves by this name. Old Rockefeller smiled and raised his glass. Without unnecessary lengthy red tape, twelve glasses were raised high in celebration of the WASP Consortium's common victory, led by the two bigwigs in one gulp. Twelve waiters stepped forward and respectfully handed out towels. After the big shots used towels, waiters took them away with the wine glasses and left the meeting room. Dropping his towel on the tray in the waiter's hand, Daniel looked around at the guests at the conference table with great satisfaction. Among all the big names in the capital world present here, Daniel, who was only forty years old, was undoubtedly the youngest one and the most successful one. After all the waiters left, Daniel clapped his hands lightly,  signaling everyone to look at him. Just yesterday, Morgan Bank had completed the acquisition of the shares of the Rural Flag Bank under the flag of the Rothschild Bank. "Today, I proudly announce to you that we have thoroughly kicked those annoying Jews out of the Wall Street." The conference table resounded with polite applauses, and even old Rockefeller clapped his hands softly, except that his turbid eyes shone with an intriguing gleam. Daniel nodded slightly and humbly accepted the praise the core WASP members presented for him, as well as for the surname behind him. When it comes to the Rothschilds' control of the United States, it is easy to think of the Federal Reserve. As we all know, the Federal Reserve plays the role the central bank of the United States, holding the power of macro-control of "world banknotes". Any arbitrary interest rate hike may result in some weak economies having their factories work for nothing for a month or two, leaving them with a fiscal debt. In some way, it is akin to a nuclear weapon in the financial sector. The worst thing is that this nuclear weapon is in private hands. The members of the Federal Reserve Board are nominated by the President and appointed by the Senate, so it is a government agency. However, under the Owen-Glass Act, the Federal Reserve has divided the U.S. into 12 reserve districts, each of which established a regional reserve bank with a separate legal personality. As for the shares of the various districts, they are purchased by the bank members of the various districts based on the amount of their assets. Taking New York as an example, according to the latest publicly available data, several major shareholders were Citibank (15%), Chase Manhattan (14%), JPMorganChase (9%), Hanovor Bank (8%), Hanover Bank (7%). These banks are often backed by financial families such as the Rockefellers, the Morgan, and the Rothschild. Goldman Sachs collapsed last year, and now the Rothschild family was kicked out of the game, with their holdings in banks such as Citibank and Hanover Bank carved up by the two giants, Rockefeller and JPMorgan. If Wall Street in 2018 was controlled by Jews and Anglo-Saxons, with the buttons of nuclear weapons in the hands of both, then Wall Street in 2019 was completely controlled by the WASP consortium. Old Rockefeller coughed gently, pulling Daniel out of his ecstasy of victory. "We can celebrate our victory late tonight. Now, we have more important things to discuss." "You are right." Daniel said with a smile, without any sign of dissatisfaction on his face. Old Rockefeller didn't say anything. He raised his hand over his shoulder and gently moved his fingers. The secretary standing behind him understood immediately and took two steps forward, placing a document respectfully on the conference table. Old Rockefeller sit upright, put on his golden glasses, and reached out to open the document. "Just yesterday, June 11, Chubu Electric Power, Tokyo Electric Power and Star Ring Trade reached an agreement to expand power imports. According to the electricity consumption data of Japan last year, Star Ring Trade has successfully monopolized 20% of its electricity." With that, those present looked at each other in disbelief, and even Daniel's eyes flashed with a hint of surprise. "These two pieces of news have not been released. You may not have received the news yet. I heard it from a cabinet official." At this point, Old Rockefeller glanced meaningfully at everyone present, "I think you guys might have already sensed something even if I don't tell you." "We are losing control of the situation in Asia." With that, the entire room was in an uproar. Those present were representatives of major consortia, financial giants of Wall Street. With their intelligence and sensitivity, it was obvious that they could see this. A few days ago, everyone attached importance to events in Europe and racked their brains to get more out of Rothschild family, so that no one paid attention to the other side of the earth. "The dollar's supremacy is being shaken. It might be a mistake to let Freemasonry collapse so soon." "Well, what else can we do? Do we pull them out of the grave?" "Perhaps we can prop up the Krupp Consortium, as long as there's a new rival to compete with Future Group." "It is even more unrealistic." Daniel interrupted the discussion. He shook his head and crossed his fingers in front of his chin. The man, who was immersed in the joy of victory, sensed the looming crisis in front of the WASP consortium. "We must constrain Star Ring Trade's continued expansion of their influence." A bad sign has appeared. If we allow their Global Grid Program to move forward, we will become increasingly passive." "Exactly." Rockefeller nodded and looked around, "I know that everyone here has partnered with Future Group in numerous fields. But if they shake the foundation of the US Dollar, I think all of you here know very well what that means." Wall Street's financial empire is built on US dollars. Through the two levers of exchange rate and market, the giants of Wall Street have been plundering the world for nearly a century. If the US dollar lost the halo of the "world currency", all the countries reduced the holding of the US dollar, then every note issued by the Federal Reserve would become scrap paper. Finally, Wall Street's financial empire piled up with scrap paper would become worthless overnight. In the following two hours, everyone, including Daniel, was completely sobered from the joy of victory. The Jewish consortiums had fallen, but the jackals that bit them didn't have their bellies full, and were eyeing the other side of the Pacific. When everyone's interests were threatened, the WASP consortium united as never before, and spent two hours formulating a plan to block Star Circle Trade's "Global Grid Program". After the meeting, the representatives of the major consortiums got up and left the room, hurriedly walking out of the door. Daniel Morgan, who presided over the meeting, did not get up. He leaned in the chair and closed his eyes in contemplation. Just then, he suddenly remembered the phone call Carmen had gotten through to him a month ago. When the Rothschild family, the erstwhile financial overlord, lowered the stance and asked for his help, he rejected Carmen without any hesitation. "....Will I someday in the future be glad of the choices I made today?" Daniel gently tapped the desktop, muttering and repeating the lines he had once said. But his tone took on a hint of hesitation, no longer as decisive as it had been at first. (To be continued.)
