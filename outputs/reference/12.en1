Chapter 1906: Unforgettable Memories (12) Thinking of this, Su Yue couldn't help but feel concerned for Su Yan. She held his arm tightly, unwilling to let go. With a pout, she pleaded, "Brother, I really wish you could find me a sister-in-law soon and have a little nephew for me. You need someone to take care of you as well." "Why are you so concerned about me?" Su Yan said with a smile while gently pinching Su Yue's lips. An indication of affection. It was evident that Su Yan pulled out all the stops to avoid the topic, and Su Yue wasn't foolish enough not to sense his reluctance.  Sitting up straight, she sighed, "Alright, alright, I won't bring it up again. It's just that whenever we talk about it, it weighs on my mind." All the while she was embracing his arm, a display of intimacy. Su Yan smiled and replied," With so many good qualities, I won't stay single for long. "Seriously?" She snapped and rolled her eyes," You are truly a narcissist, and it seems like Third Brother has rubbed off on you. Su Yan gave out a silent smile while raising his shoulders in acknowledgment. As if to say, "That's just the way it is." Su Yue reached out to pick up the cup. The tea inside was lukewarm, just the ideal temperature for a sip. She tested a small sip before taking a gulp. She looked quite thirsty. Su Yan watched her and asked, "Where did you go? How did you end up here at this time?" After gulping down the rest, Su Yue put down the water cup and replied to his inquiry, "I went to see Qiao Chen's mother, and happened to pass by your area." "I see." Su Yan nodded and inquired, "Did you bring Little Qiao with you?" His gaze fell upon Little Qiao, who was happily munching on an apple, her legs swinging freely in an innocent and carefree manner. Seeing this, he couldn't help but feel a strong desire to protect her from any harm. Knowing that her mother hadn't had the joyful childhood she deserved, he was determined to create a warm and colorful childhood for her. There was a moment when he made up his mind to make a difference,  but then Qiao Chen emerged—the guy who put his life on the line to save Su Yue. He had thought Qiao Chen would be heaven-sent to make up for Su Yue's childhood and adolescence. He believed Qiao Chen would be Su Yue's best partner and ultimate destiny. But unexpectedly, he turned out to be the best, yet not the last. Even now, that guy would occasionally appear in his thoughts, even in dreams. So, Little Qiao must not forget him. And he hoped Ming Ansheng's love for Su Yue would be no less than Qiao Chen's. It was a selfish thought, a selfish wish from him as an elder brother. "Yes." Su Yue said with a faint smile on her lips, "But I didn't go inside, just stood at the door for a while. I'm afraid that if I get in, it will remind her of Qiao Chen and make her feel uncomfortable in the heart." Su Yan changed the subject with a subtle smile, "Is Little Qiao adapting well to kindergarten?" Su Yue nodded, "Yes, with Yan Yan and the others taking care of her, she gets along well with the other kids." "That's good." Su Yan smiled faintly, then looked at Su Yue and suggested,"You and Little Qiao should come and join the new product launch event to have some fun." Su Yue was thrilled and exclaimed, "Great! I will bring Ming Ansheng along." "Was it necessary for you to accompany him?" Su Yan raised an eyebrow and replied, "Aren't you the one benefiting from his influence?" Su Yue pouted, "In terms of priority, I am the primary concern from Rongsheng's perspective." While they were talking, the door to Su Yan's office suddenly opened. Hearing the sound, Su Yue looked over in surprise. Who could be so impolite to barge in without knocking? It seems as though Third Brother was the only one who would make such a reckless move, but the person who walked in was a tall and slender woman. Chapter 1907: Unforgettable Memories (13) Su Yue looked at the woman who walked in, isn't this... Isn't this the famous celebrity, Evelyne? Why is she here again？ No... She should say how she came into her brother's office, and most importantly, she didn't even knock on the door. That's so rude. Watching Evelyne stride into the office, Su Yue felt a surge of unexplained sense of negativity in her heart. She couldn't find the right words to describe it, but the feeling was one of discomfort and dissatisfaction. Evelyne slung a light green Hermès handbag on one arm, while her other hand held the sunglasses she had taken off when she entered. She walked into the office, her high heels making a loud noise as they struck the wooden floor, drawing attention to her presence. As she entered, her gaze first glanced towards Su Yan, then fell upon Little Qiao. A fleeting expression of surprise flashed across her beautiful face, followed by a puzzled look as she looked at Little Qiao. However, Little Qiao, completely engrossed in the animated cartoon, didn't notice her presence at all. Her bright, sparkling eyes were fixated on the computer screen, not blinking even once. Evelyne observed Little Qiao for a moment, and just as she was about to shift her gaze, Su Yan suddenly called out, "Miss Evelyne." As he addressed her, he stood up, ready to greet her. Su Yue also stood up with him, her hands hooked onto his arm, displaying an affectionate gesture. Upon hearing Su Yan's voice, Evelyne curved her lips into a slight smile and looked in his direction. When she saw Su Yue by his side, her smile seemed to become rigid for a moment. " "Mr. Su." She greeted him, with a hint of confusion in her eyes as she looked at Su Yue. A hint of complexity flashed in her eyes. Su Yue noticed every reaction Evelyne made after seeing her, and deliberately held onto Su Yan's arm even tighter, leaning her head on his shoulder. With Su Yan's outstanding qualities, even a big celebrity like Evelyne couldn't resist his charm. It was evident that this woman had a liking for her brother. However, for some unknown reason, Su Yue felt a deep aversion towards her. Perhaps she believed that her brother's calm and composed personality wouldn't be compatible with women in the entertainment industry, especially someone who appeared to be dominant like Evelyne. Of course, this was her wishful thinking, and couldn't represent anyone else, including her brother. "Mr. Su, may I ask who is this?" As Su Yue was contemplating in her mind, Evelyne sized her up for a moment and then gestured towards her. Su Yan then introduced her, "This is my younger sister, Su Yue." It was a simple introduction, yet it seemed to lighten Evelyne up with joy, similar to how nature changes from cold winter to vibrant spring, with a feeling of renewed hope. Her reaction was so obvious and unnature, and Su Yue complained within her mind, without voicing it out.  "What kind of award-winning actress is she? She has no acting skills at all." But this also meant that her brother was outstanding, even a top actress like Evelyne had an interest in him. While Su Yue was processing this in her mind with pride, Evelyne smiled and walked over, saying, "Hi, nice to meet you." She approached Su Yue and extended her right hand toward her in a friendly manner. In the past, Su Yue would ignore people she didn't even bother to look at, even if they were standing face to face. But now, things have changed. She had smoothed out her rough edges and had a great understanding of social customs and relationships. She shook hands with Evelyne, wearing a gentle smile. "Hello, Miss Evelyne." After the formalities, she naturally withdrew her hand. Evelyne didn't find it awkward either and smiled as she turned to Su Yan. "I just realized I left my silk scarf here with you." Chapter 1908: Unforgettable Memories (14) As she spoke, Evelyne's gaze scanned the sofa before falling upon the corner where her eyes lit up at the sight of something. Pointing in that direction, she said, "It's over there. How careless am I!" She laughed at herself, walked over and picked up the scarf. Despite its large floral pattern, the colors were refreshing and elegant, exuding a sense of gracefulness. This is the value of a renowned brand and a top designer. Su Yue was lost in her mind while staring at the silk scarf in Evelyne's hands. She suspected that Evelyne purposely misplaced the scarf as an excuse to meet her brother for work. She even didn't bring her assistant along. "Forget about it, Su Yue. You should stop the drama in your mind. Don't be so mean." Su Yue suppressed the drama in her mind. She pouted and looked at Evelyne, feeling a tinge of jealousy in her heart. She didn't know where this feeling came from, but deep down, she wanted her brother to find a girlfriend and get married soon. She kept holding onto Su Yan's arm and did not even show a sign of releasing,  hugging him tightly as if asserting her authority in the relationship, yet at the same time, it seemed like she was telling Evelyne that she didn't like her. Evelyne returned to the place where Su Yan and Su Yue stand with the scarf in her hand. Su Yan looked at her and politely said, "You can make a phone call, and I'll have someone send it down for you." Evelyne smiled gracefully, "It's alright, I can just get it myself." Being able to become a top actress and gain such popularity, Evelyne definitely had remarkable attributes that make her stand out.  Su Yue noticed Evelyne's charming dimples when she smiled, which was truly captivating. Especially her face, seemingly flawless yet with imperfections, which contrast well with the carefully crafted and perfect face of internet celebrities. She had a unique charm. Unconsciously, Su Yue found herself examining Evelyne again. Evelyne suddenly looked back at her, her graceful smile unchanged. She gave Su Yue a quick look, and said with a smile, "Mr Su, your sister is beautiful." Before Su Yan could say anything, Evelyne added, "She looks a lot like you." Su Yan's lips curved slightly, but he remained silent. Upon hearing the words, Su Yue secretly rolled her eyes at Evelyne. "Hmph, she could have just complimented her brother for being handsome directly. Why does she beat around the bush?" In her heart, she had complained about Evelyne countless times.  She acknowledged that Evelyne was popular, elegant, and charming, but... She just couldn't like her. She believed that feelings for someone were inexplicable, and sometimes might come out from nowhere. Evelyne didn't show any sign of leaving and kept looking for topics to chat with Su Yan. As they were chatting about unrelated matters, Su Yue found it boring and she let go of Su Yan's arm, ready to accompany Little Qiao. Knock, knock, knock Suddenly, there was a knocking sound from outside. Before Su Yan could answer the door, the person had already pushed the door open. "Su Yan, I must leave with your third brother now." Wen Xuxu hurriedly entered, carrying her bag, and directly stating her intention to Su Yan. When she saw Evelyne, she was stunned for a brief period, and took a moment to regain her composure. "Sister-in-law." Su Yue saw Wen Xuxu and changed her direction, happily walking towards her. "Yue Yue, you are here." Su Yue curved her mouth into a smile, though it seemed a bit forced. Seeing this, Su Yan became nervous and asked, "What's wrong? What happened?" He walked towards Xuxu while asking. The corners of Xuxu's mouth were lowered, and her lips quivered. “Aheng's grandfather passed away in the cardiovascular hospital, and my husband and I need to go there now." Chapter 1909: Unforgettable Memories ( 15) Her intimate relationship with Jiang Zhuoheng, coupled with the kindness shown to her by Old Master Jiang and the Jiang family, made her feel sad about the fact that the old master had passed away. Although he had lived a long life, her heart still ached. Upon hearing this, Su Yan displayed a sudden reaction of surprise. "Then you should hurry and go." "Alright," Xuxu nodded and turned to Su Yue, saying, "We will be leaving now." Then she hurriedly walked towards the door, but Litlle Qiao suddenly called out, "Auntie." Xuxu stopped and turned around to smile at her," Little Qiao, Auntie has something to do now and can't play with you. Can you be a good girl for me, Little Qiao?" "Okay." Little Qiao nodded obediently, then raised her little hand to say Goodbye," Auntie, take care." "Goodbye!" Xuxu departed hastily, and Su Yan gazed absentmindedly at the office door that automatically closed. "Brother, speaking of Aheng's grandpa, isn't he Xin Yanting's grandfather?" "Yes." "Um, aren't you going to pay your condolence visit?" "Mind your own business." "Oh no, I don't like you being like this." "Mr.Su, I'll take my leave now." "Miss Evelyne, take care." Su Yan nodded slightly at Evelyne, then called out, "Mi Xiao." "Who is Mi Xiao?" Su Yue asked in confusion. Before the words were finished, the office door opened, and a slim young girl entered. She was wearing a white shirt and black trousers, giving off a professional look. The girl also wore a pair of black-framed glasses, and she appeared to be around the same age as Su Yue, or might younger. Judging by the appearance, she seemed quite ordinary. Su Yue sized up the girl who had just entered. The girl adjusted the glasses on her nose and looked at Su Yan. "Mr. Su." Su Yan instructed her, "Show Evelyne the way out." "Okay," Mi Xiao nodded and then turned her gaze to Evelyne. Her expression appeared somewhat nervous or perhaps she was new in the business at hand. "Miss Evelyne, this way, please." Miao Xiao gave a slight bow to Evelyne before following her out and closing the door behind them. "Brother, who is she?" Su Yue shifted her gaze from the doorway to Su Yan. "Isn't it usually the secretary's job to see off guests?" That's exactly how it should be "Yes, she is my secretary." Su Yan replied to Su Yue in a casual tone and then walked towards Little Qiao. His hands naturally slipped into the pockets of his trousers as he walked with a casual gait. "Secretary?" Su Yue's eyes widened in surprise, "Wow!" She looked at Su Yan's tall figure and quickly caught up to him. "Is there something wrong?" Su Yan gave Su Yue a lazy look, pretending to be confused. Su Yue's reaction didn't catch him off guard. He was astute and had anticipated it. Su Yue rapidly nodded her head and said, " There was a big problem." As she walked, she continued, "Don't you usually prefer male secretaries? I remember the last time we went abroad, you had a handsome male secretary." Hearing this, Su Yan smiled and said, "I just haven't found a suitable one yet. Don't make a fuss." After saying that, he playfully flicked Su Yue's forehead with his hand. Her forehead throbbed with sharp pain, leading her to place her hands on the area to alleviate the discomfort. She pouted disapprovingly. "Ouch! It hurts. But that girl just didn't seem that impressive." Then she grinned and chuckled," Brother, you finally have come to your senses. Now you are willing to engage with women. That sets me at ease. Otherwise, every time you go on a business trip, you'll have a handsome guy by your side, and that really worries me. I'm afraid you might turn gay. Chapter 1910: Unforgettable Without Pondering (16) "What?" Su Yan's eyebrows furrowed, and his eyes appeared menacing. The hand that he had just put inside the pockets emerged again. Su Yue quickly craned her neck and raised her hands to protect her head, wearing a smile so flattering. "Ah, my bad. Slip of the tongue." It was going too far to joke like that with her own brother. But even though she had begged for forgiveness, Su Yan's eyes remain fixated on her. Su Yue felt uneasy and looked wary. "What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?" Su Yan smiled and said," If my memory serves me right, you are unemployed at home. Why don't you come to work with me? Then I won't need to hire someone else." It was hard to discern the truth from his tone and attitude. No matter what, Su Yue shook her head and refused, "No, I won't do it.‘ As she spoke, something came to her mind, and she protested, "Who said I am doing nothing at home? I am running my online business." And the business is pretty booming. It was foolish to work in a company from nine to five instead of running her own business online. "Besides, even if I were to work as a secretary, I'd rather be Ming Ansheng's secretary than come to Rongsheng," she added. Su Yan nodded in understanding, "Yes, daughters married away are just like water spilled away. But...," He paused for a moment and then suddenly smiled, "But you haven't gotten married yet." "Cut the nonsense."Su Yue blushed and punched Su Yan's shoulder. Su Yan smiled it off, and said to Su Yue, "I am going to be busy. You take care of Little Qiao." "Okay." Su Yue nodded, "I will take Little Qiao for a stroll nearby and we'll wait for you and have dinner together when you finish work "Okay." ... "As expected, it's so jammed at this time, at six o'clock." Su Yue couldn't help but comment as the car crawled on the ring road at a speed slower than Mr. Sloth's talking pace. "Are you hungry?" Su Yan pointed to the storage compartment in front of Su Yue and said, "There is a bag of cookies in there." Su Yue shook her head, "I am not hungry, but getting a bit impatient." Every traffic light turned red as we drive on this road, but the real problem was the slow driving speed. Watching Su Yue's frustrated expression, Su Yan smiled warmly, "You're still like a child." Just then, Su Yue's phone rang, and she glanced at the caller ID—it was Ming Ansheng. She immediately answered, "Hello." "Okay, then I'll come over too." "Okay." After a brief conversation with Ming Ansheng, Su Yue hung up the phone and looked up at Su Yan, "Brother, I'm afraid I can't go for dinner with you. Aheng's grandfather passed away, and Ming Ansheng is helping out. I should go over there too." Although she had a distant connection with Jiang Zhuoheng, Ming Asheng were closely associated with Jiang Zhouheng, so they were connected at some point. Besides, she was Ming Asheng's.... Wife. Since they were already living together, and they even had a child, she considered herself his wife. Therefore, she felt that she should go. Su Yan didn't say much and calmly responded, "I'll drive you there." "Okay." Su Yue nodded and then looked at Little Qiao, who was still looking out the window at the scenery. After a moment of thought, she turned to Su Yan again, "Can you take care of Little Qiao, or take her back home?" Given the solemn occasion and the late hour, it might be better not to bring a child along. Chapter 1911: Unforgettable Memories (17) Su Yan nodded in agreement, "I'll take her for dinner first."As the car reached the next traffic light, Su Yan took a turn. The Jiang family in the capital had a prominent status, and with Jiang Shaomei's influential connections, the news of Old Master's passing spread quickly. Within a few hours, many people who had decent business relationships with the Jiang family came to pay their respects. As a highly respected figure, the late grandfather's wake was set up at the Jiang family's residence. The Jiang family's front gates looked like a parking lot of a shopping mall, with cars lined up all the way to the intersection, forming a long queue. Fortunately, the roads were cleared.  Su Yan dropped Su Yue off at the entrance of the Jiang family's courtyard. "Little Qiao, go have dinner with your uncle. Mom will come to pick you up later," Su Yue said to her daughter. Su Yue patted Su Xiaoqiao's head in a caring manner before getting off the car and then turning to Su Yan, "Brother, take care." After that,  Su Yue was about to close the car door. She looked up and paused for a moment. A black Cadillac parked behind them, and a woman dressed in simple clothing got out of the driver's seat. The woman had short, shiny black hair tied in ponytail, carrying a black bag, her face free of makeup, and her eyes red and swollen from crying. "Xin Yanting," Su Yue almost blurted out upon seeing her. Xin Yanting froze for a short period when she heard Su Yue calling her name. A trace of surprise flickered in her eyes. She looked in that direction and saw a partial view of Su Yan. Her grip on the bag tightened. Suddenly, she lowered her head and walked past Su Yan's car. "Brother, you should go back first." Su Yue closed the car door and followed Xin Yanting in close pursuit. She wanted to speak to her but didn't know what to say, especially at a time when her grandfather had passed away. Xin Yanting must feel sorrowful. So, thinking it over,  Su Yue decided to forget about it and slowed down her pace. As she approached the entrance, she turned around and saw no sign of Su Yan's car. She pouted with resignation. Like is like, and dislike is dislike. Rather than saying her brother was calm, it was more like he was indifferent. "Darn, Su Yue, stop overthinking. He was your brother." Although she felt sorry for Xin Yanting and considered her innocent Why overcomplicate the matters? Xin Yanting didn't deserve to be treated like this. "What was on your mind?" Just as Su Yue was lost in thought, a familiar voice came from ahead—it was Ming Ansheng. She collected her thoughts and looked up to see him, shaking her head gently, "Nothing." She walked up the stairs, all the way to Ming Asheng... "Little Qiao, do you want anything else to eat?" After finishing dinner, it was already past 8 o'clock. The traffic had finally eased, and Su Yan drove around with Little Qiao in bustling areas. The city was illuminated by red and yellow neon lights, which shimmered and left people feeling a bit disoriented. As the traffic light turned red, Su Yan gently pressed the brakes." "I want to eat ice cream." Little Qiao said from back. Su Yan shifted his gaze back from outside the window, smiled, and turned to Little Qiao, "You want ice cream again?" Little Qiao pouted her mouth with no response, which was taken as a yes answer. I really want to eat ice cream. Isn't it the flavor that people on the earth crave? Chapter 1912: Unforgettable Memories (18) Looking at her adorable appearance, Su Yan couldn't bear to say no. He eased off and said, "We can only get a small portion." Little Qiao took it as a confirmation and happily nodded. Her chubby little face lit up with joy and a smile, her eyes crescent-shaped and adorable. Su Yan drove past two traffic lights, keeping an eye on the stalls along the road. He rarely dined out, let alone went out for shopping. So it took him a while to find one. Finally, they passed by a shopping mall, and the Häagen-Dazs logo caught his eye.  He pointed at it and said to Little Qiao," Do you want to eat Häagen-Dazs?" "Yes, Yes, I want it." Little Qiao nodded repeatedly. As long as it was ice cream, brands were not worth talking about. Her expectations were practical. Su Yan parked the car in a nearby parking space, then carried Su Xiaoqiao towards the Häagen-Dazs store. It was after mealtime, and there were many people strolling and shopping after their meals. The weather was cool, and the kids in the store are mostly teenage girls, sitting in groups of two or three, occupying almost all the available seats. "What flavors would you like, Little Qiao?" Su Yan held her up to the counter and let her look at the flavor options on the large posters. Su Xiaoqiao scanned the posters, saying "I want vanilla and strawberry." "Alright." Su Yan pointed to the two flavors Little Qiao wanted, and said to the cashier, "We'll have vanilla and strawberry, the double scoop." The cashier smiled and said, "Our store is having a promotion today with the cinema in the mall. If you buy three flavors of ice cream, you'll get two free tickets for 'Little Seastar' movie." Her gaze fell upon Little Qiao and she intentionally emphasized the name 'Little Seastar,' knowing that it was a children's movie And hoping to catch the interest of kids. Little Qiao blinked and asked, "Is 'Little Seastar' good?" The promotional poster is over there, and the story is about Little Seastar and its little friends in the ocean." The cashier pointed to the poster and replied. There is a variety of marine creatures on the poster, with vibrant and dreamy colors. Little Qiao immediately got interested, and she shifted her gaze to look at Su Yan, pouting her lips and using an ingratiating tone, "Uncle, I want to watch 'Little Seastar.'" Although Su Yan treated her very well and spoiled her, they didn't spend much time together, so she didn't dare to be too willful around him. He couldn't bear to refuse her wishful demands, let alone her attempts to beg him. He lovingly rubbed her nose and said, "But you can only eat a little ice cream.” Little Qiao nodded her head and perceived it as yes, and she extended her chubby hand to gesture," Just a little bit of ice cream." “Good." ”Smack." "Seeing Su Yan nod his head and agree, Little Qiao happily put her arms around Su Yan's neck and gave him a soft and gentle kiss. The soft and warm lips made Su Yan momentarily lose his mind. He quickly reacted and tightly embraced the little girl, as if he wanted to outpour her with endless affection and care. He felt like his dream in childhood was finally fulfilled, bringing him a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. He remembered watching his little sister being sent to an orphanage, crying and calling out for help. At that time, he had longed to hug her and take her back home. Chapter 1913: Unforgettable Memories (19) The ice cream they got had three little balls of different colors, placed in a paper cup. Su Yan held Little Qiao with one hand and carried the ice cream with the other. Little Qiao held a fork and happily ate while walking, her mouth full. They also got two movie ticket vouchers. The cinema was located on the top floor of the mall, which had a total of ten floors. The mall's escalator, like those in hospitals, stopped on nearly every floor, which drained the patience of adults. However, Little Qiao, enjoying her ice cream, was not in a hurry at all. "Sorry, there are no more seats available for the next showtime. The next one is at 9:40." The ticket attendant informed them when they reached the cinema ticket counter. They have to wait for another hour. Su Yan looked at his watch and said, "The movie would be past 11 when it ends. It was too late." He waited for her reaction, looking at the little girl. Little Qiao, upon hearing his words, looked disappointed, and her mouth drooped as she said, "But I want to watch." "Now her hopes had been raised, and it made her upset to hear that she couldn't watch." "But it's very late, you need to sleep, or else you won't grow taller," Su Yan gently rubbed her head and tried to persuade her. Little Qiao didn't make a scene, and her sad expression tugged at the heartstrings even more than if she had thrown a tantrum. Su Yan felt a bit guilty. He looked around and suddenly noticed a long line of people across the aisle, but he couldn't figure out what they were doing. He  raised his head and saw a sign that read, 'Snowland Ice Skating Rink, National Champion-level Figure Skating Coach...' His eyes lit up, and he pointed in that direction, saying to Little Qiao, "There's an ice skating rink over there. Why don't we go ice skating?" Little Qiao followed Su Yan's pointing direction and saw the long line of people standing outside the railings. It seems bustling. She pouted, and her thoughts were still fixated on the movie. But her uncle said it was too late to watch the movie. So she had to settle for something else. Icre-skating was fine. At least they could do something. Little Qiao calculated in her heart and nodded with a bit of reluctance "Okay, let's go ice-skating." She sounded a bit unhappy. Su Yan felt sorry for her and gently touched her face, saying, "I'll bring you to watch 'Little Starfish' next weekend." Little Qiao's eyes brightened, and she extended her little finger to Su Yan, saying, "Deal?" Su Yan said nothing in response, but he extended his fingers to make a promise to her. With his crisp shirt and good posture, he already stood out in the crowd due to his charm and height. His handsome appearance had a way of winning over women. As people passed by, whether married women or unmarried girls, they couldn't help but take an extra glance at him. Seeing the interaction between them, the girls were captivated. Girls fancied that the handsome guy was embracing them. Despite lacking the equipment, they decided to go ice skating on a whim. But with money, anything is possible. "They purchased two sets of equipment, one for the kid and the other for the adult. After paying the fees, the staff handed over the equipment to them." "Sir, we offer ice-skating instructors of national recognition, some of whom are national champions, specialized in teaching children," The staff then recommended their top-notch coaches to Su Yan. Chapter 1914: Unforgettable Memories (20) Su Yan listened to his recommendation, and politely refused, "Thank you, we might consider it next time." With the equipment in hand, he led Little Qiao to the seating area, where they could change their shoes. " All set, you ready? Are you scared?‘ After putting on the gear, Su Yan stood up to get used to the sensation, and then gently helped Little Qiao to get comfortable. Together, they went to the rink step by step. The ground was covered with ice, and a chilly breeze rose from it, making Little Qiao shiver for a bit. But she toughen herself up and said to Su Yan, "I am not scared." The rink was teeming with kids and their screams and laughter. Little Qiao got a bit carried away. Her chubby face lit up with a radiant smile. "Little Qiao is awesome. Don't be afraid; Uncle will hold your hand and support you all the way, Su Yan encouraged her as he guided her to start skating properly. He held her little hands, face to face, and skated along with her. Even when skating backward, he was stable. Little Qiao was taken aback, "Uncle, are you good at it?" Su Yan winked at her,” Why not see for yourself?" He let go of Little Qiao's hands slowly and then glided backward. Suddenly, he spun around with quick speed. Little Qiao was amazed, her mouth agape, as she looked at Su Yan with admiration, "Uncle, you're so great!" "Do you believe that Uncle won't fall over?" Su Yan returned to Little Qiao and held her hands. Slowly, they glided. He patiently gave her instructions. He was wearing his own clothes without any protection pads. However, when it comes to Little Qiao's safety, he made sure she had knee pads, elbow pads, a helmet, and all the necessary gear. "Yes." Little Qiao showed her uncle with admiration and absolute trust. She trusted her uncle to the point that if he were to sell her for money, she would naively count the money for him. "Teacher, You are so awesome." They had a good level of synchronization, and there were cheers that came from afar. Her eyes searched around, and suddenly she excitedly grabbed Su Yan's hand, pointing to where she had just been looking, "Uncle, that girl is amazing!" Su Yan turned his head and followed her pointed direction, his expression calm. He didn't look out of curiosity but out of instinct. Over there, a group of children was clapping and cheering in a corner across them. A twenty-something girl in white sportswear was surrounded by the children. Su Yan saw the girl performing the spin he had shown Little Qiao, but she did it continuously. The girl wore a high bun hairstyle, spinning quickly, and one could not make out her face. She seemed to be the coach here. It was normal that she knew her skills. Su Yan glanced and was about to look away. Suddenly, the girl's hair tie snapped, and her black hair came loose, forming an elegant arc as she continued to spin. It was like a perfectly arranged shot, yet it appeared so natural, so unexpected. And left many in awe. But the girl did not anticipate the hair to come loose, and she stopped. Perhaps she was using too much strength, her body lurched forward. Chapter 1915: Unforgettable Memories (21) Su Yan reached out his hands instinctively. It was done with the intent to help others. But he was a bit absent-minded just now; otherwise, he wouldn't have forgotten the distance. "Teacher, teacher!" The girl stumbled and lost her balance. She tried hard to maintain the balance. A group of her students rushed over to support her. The girl stood up straight, lowered her head, and playfully stuck her tongue out at the children around her, "How embarrassing, I almost fell." It should have embarrassed herself in front of the students and their parents, but she managed to maintain composure, displaying no signs of emotional disturbance. Such poise... Su Yan was somewhat surprised, and he couldn't help but take another look. The girl lowered her head, and her waist-length hair cascaded down, leaving her face invisible to others. He could only use one word to describe... Poise It turned out to be just as he had longed for. Tranquil, calm, and peaceful. "Teacher, you look stunning." "You are like a fairy from heaven." The little boys who came forward to comfort her were eager to be warm-hearted for the teacher, generously showering her with compliments. The teacher gently patted the heads of the two little boys, saying, "Why are your little mouths so sweet?" Her voice sounded somewhat... Familiar? Suddenly, Su Yan felt that the roller-skating teacher's voice was a bit familiar, but he couldn't recall where he had heard it before. He found himself lost in her thoughts, his eyebrows furrowing with contemplation. Suddenly, Little Qiao tugged at his hand, bringing him back to reality. "Uncle, do you think that lady is beautiful?" Little Qiao asked. Su Yan's thoughts were interrupted, and he withdrew his gaze, smiling down at Little Qiao, "You are beautiful." Although Little Qiao was just a young girl, being praised was something every girl enjoyed. She giggled and said, "Uncle, you have good taste." Su Yan gave her a subtle smile, then turned to look in that direction again. The group of children was still there, but the roller-skating teacher was nowhere to be seen. He pursed his lips and diverted his gaze. The rink closed at 9:30 PM, and they had only played for about fifty minutes. Su Yan packed everything up and carried it in his hands. Then, he held Little Qiao's hand and walked towards the exit, asking as they strolled, "Did you have fun?" "Yes, I had a whale of a time." Little Qiao nodded, but she still seemed unsatisfied, her eyes lingering on the now-empty rink. Su Yan sensed her subtle expression and bent down, asking, "Do you like roller-skating?" "Yes, I like it. Can we come again next time?" Little Qiao looked up with a hopeful expression. Su Yan nodded and replied, "Sure, Uncle will be your teacher." Little Qiao was overjoyed, and she hugged Su Yan, saying, "Uncle, you are amazing." "Shall we go home and sleep now?" Su Yan bent down and lifted her up. They strode out of the rink. Little Qiao was dressed lightly, her hands freezing cold, and her nose turned rosy from the cold. Su Yan held her hands to warm them up and headed towards the elevator. "Goodbye, teacher." "Goodbye." The sound wafted from behind as the children said goodbye to their teacher, and her voice still stirred a feeling of familiarity in him." though not as intense as before. Chapter 1916: Unforgettable Memories (22) Su Yan turned his head, but all he saw was a graceful figure, with silky long hair that almost completely concealed the slender back of the girl. Back in the old streets of City N in Country Y several years ago, he had the same feeling... In this city, there was a girl who could evoke the same sensation within him. This was truly unexpected. The girl had already taken the escalator downstairs and disappeared from Su Yan's sight, yet that serene and comfortable feeling, similar to appreciating a peaceful and harmonious scene of bridges and streams in the mountains, continued to flow gently within his heart. "Uncle, what are you looking at?" Little Qiao gazed up at Su Yan with a puzzled look. Once again, his train of thought was interrupted, and Su Yan withdrew his gaze, smiling down at her, shaking his head gently, "Nothing at all, let's go home." Then, he held her hand and walked towards the elevator... Although birth, aging, illness, and death are normal aspects of life, the death of Old Master dealt a huge blow not only to Jiang Zhuochen but also to the entire family. The human heart is capricious, often requiring time for individuals to process anticipated events. Yan Rusheng and Ming Ansheng had grown up under their grandfather's watchful eye and were busy with Jiang Zhuoheng late into the night. Most of the remaining guests had already retired, leaving only a few male members of the Jiang family, Xin Yanting, and Yan Rusheng with his friends in the mourning hall. Xin Yanting and Jiang Zhuoheng knelt before the mourning hall, and she couldn't help but sob intermittently. She had been raised in the Jiang family since she was little, and her grandfather had spoiled her, showering her with boundless affection and care. Since going abroad four years ago, she had never returned to the country. During those years, she and her grandfather would speak on the phone almost every day. Even in their busiest times, they would still contact each other every other day, at most. Even if it was a brief greeting. When she received news that her grandfather's condition was deteriorating, she immediately rushed back, but in the end, she failed to see him one last time. This was probably the main reason she couldn't bring herself to rise, overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and self-reproach. The Old Master's nephews and Jiang Zhuoheng stayed all night and went vigil in the mourning hall. When Yan Rusheng saw that most guests had left, he decided to leave as well. Xu Xu said farewell before departing, "Aheng, we'll head back first." As she said this, she approached Jiang Zhuoheng. Jiang Zhuoheng stood up and greeted her, "Alright, be careful on the way home." He then glanced at Yan Rusheng and Ming Ansheng, nodding to acknowledge their presence. Xu Xu looked at Jiang Zhuoheng's face, pursed her lips, and offered comforting words, "Take care and I offer my condolences." "Thank you." Jiang Zhuoheng gently nodded, "Go back now; it's getting late." Xu Xu nodded, "We'll come back tomorrow." Then, she glanced again at Xin Yanting, who knelt there with her head lowered, motionless and quiet. The stark contrast with the usual lively and dominant Xin Yanting from before evoked a profound sense of compassion for her, almost as if they were two completely different individuals. "How heartbreaking." Love could change a person, but it could also destroy them. Over the past four years, Xu Xu had no contact with Xin Yanting, and though she had wanted to ask after her several times from Jiang Zhuoheng, she could never bring herself to ask. She still felt guilty deep down, even though Su Yan did what he needed to do, and he had ultimately only taken a 30% stake from her in Rong Sheng. But from a woman's perspective, Xin Yanting was innocent. It was unfair to Xin Yanting. Chapter 1917 Unforgotten Memories (23) However, she viewed it with the compassion of a mother. In the business world, deceit and trickery were the norm. Her mother had used such despicable methods. Xuxu took a deep look at Xin Yanting, but in the end, she didn't take a step forward. She didn't say anything to comfort Xin Yanting. She sighed helplessly and turned around. "Let's go," she said softly to Yan Rusheng and Su Yue. "Okay!" Su Yue replied. When she turned around with Ming Ansheng, her gaze still lingered on Xin Yanting. She and Xuxu shared the same thoughts and feelings in their hearts. They were women. In the end, all she could do was follow Ming Ansheng, and a sense of helplessness rose within her. "I feel a bit sorry for Xin Yanting." The car started and Su Yue, who was sitting in the passenger seat, suddenly said. She leaned back against her seat, feeling a little tired. "You used to dislike her, didn't you?" Ming Ansheng turned to her with a perplexed look, his eyebrows raised. He looked at her, his eyes soft and reassuring. He knew that she had always been so kind-hearted. Only a kind person would have complicated and ambivalent emotions. Since she came here, her attention had always been on Xin Yanting. When she saw her, her gaze often betrayed a sense of guilt. In fact, in their eyes, the matter between Su Yan and Xin Yanting was like a regular or ordinary meal one eats daily. Gaining the other party's trust through dishonesty and deception was a tactic, or a strategy. "Well, not liking someone doesn't mean I can't feel sorry for her, especially as a woman," Su Yue sighed. "Are you sure you're just being sympathetic as a woman?" Ming Ansheng smiled. Looking at her tightly knitted brows and tangled state of mind, he did not know how to comfort her and could only lighten the atmosphere by teasing her. "Come on." Su Yue cast a disdainful glance at Ming Ansheng but then smiled. With her smile, Ming Ansheng felt that the atmosphere was improved. He then joked, "It's all your brother's fault." "But my brother did the right thing.  just wanted to reclaim thirty percent of Rongsheng's shares. Xin Yanting liked him, and he never promised her anything. It was all her wishful thinking that he liked her too." Su Yue defended her brother. It seemed to be the case, but why did she feel conflicted when she saw Xin Yanting? Why did she feel guilty? As Su Yue questioned herself internally, Ming Ansheng asked, "So why are you so conflicted?" I don't know either. "I heard that Xin Yanting once went to get a tattoo for her brother. You must really love someone to get a tattoo for them." Su Yue ran her hand through the hair in frustration. She heard later from her third sister-in-law that Xin Yanting had a rose tattoo on her back with her brother's name on it. Hearing this made Su Yue feel uneasy.  When a woman falls in love with a man, she becomes foolish and naive, wanting to announce to the whole world and give her all. Once she falls, there's no turning back. At that time, Xin Yanting must love her brother so much that she even tattooed his name on her flesh. She definitely did not expect that that she was just a pawn to her brother. Perhaps she had experienced something similar before. When she saw Zeng Tangfei use iron to burn the tattoo on her chest, she felt as if she was experiencing the same piercing pain. "If this tattoo is not related to Ming Ansheng or someone in particular, then it is just physical pain." Chapter 1918 Unforgotten Memories (24) She wondered if Xin Yanting's tattoo was still there. If it was, would she feel pain every time she saw it? And if it was gone, would removing it be as painful as when she got it in the first place? Su Yue frowned and gazed out the window with a solemn expression. Ming Ansheng looked at her and smiled, saying. "Tattoos are actually a form of art. Some people actually want it for artistic reasons." Su Yue knew that Ming Ansheng was teasing her, but she laughed. She smiled and turned to look at him with a mischievous gaze. "Then when you got the tattoo, was it for the sake of art or as a tribute to your unrequited love with Sister Meiduo?" "Let's continue talking about Xin Yanting and your brother." Ming Ansheng pursed his lips. As their conversation continued, Ming Ansheng found himself becoming the focal point of the conversation. He did not want to be the primary topic of interest, so he tried to calmly be there for her. Meiduo was no longer around. Su Yue had never thought of bringing her out to make fun of Ming Ansheng. It was just a casual remark. What was gone was gone. She peered outside. It was very quiet on the road late at night. Most shops had closed in this area, leaving everything cloaked in darkness. Her mood remained heavy, probably still being affected by the visit to the mourning hall. Both of them suddenly fell silent, and the serene atmosphere loomed over the car. The car drove slowly, and Su Yue felt drowsy. When they drove past the residential area, the light in the car suddenly brightened. Su Yue opened her eyes and looked outside. It was a hospital. The lights at the entrance were very bright. It should be a private hospital. The screen on the top was still flashing and playing images. She sighed again, " I also heard that after Xin Yanting found out the truth, she took sleeping pills to commit suicide. Judging from her personality, she seemed like someone who wouldn't tolerate Tang Feiling's relentless pursuit of you. She is someone who dares to love and hate and someone who handles matters with grace. Yet, she ended her life over just a man..." This was something she heard later from Muli, who heard it from someone else, so she wasn't sure if it was true. "Well, so you mean your brother is just an ordinary man." Ming Ansheng nodded, deliberately taking her words out of context. Su Yue knew that he was doing it on purpose. She frowned and complained, "Can you stop twisting my meaning? We should talk about this matter objectively. Putting aside those outstanding conditions, my brother is just a man." Putting aside those outstanding conditions, her brother was just an ordinary man... What kind of logic was this? Ming Ansheng looked at Su Yue in amusement and shook his head. After laughing for a while, he raised his eyebrows and asked her, "But can you come to a conclusion with all this overthinking?" "No." Su Yue shook her vigorously. 'Forget it, I don't want to think about it anymore. No matter how much I struggle, I won't end up with any results. Whether my brother likes her or not, it is what it is." "Are you hungry?" Ming Ansheng changed the topic when he saw how conflicted she was. "I'm not hungry. Let's hurry up and pick up Little Qiao." Su Yue shook her head. "Okay." When they arrived at Su Yan's house, they knocked on his door. Su Yan was wearing smoke-grey pajamas and had just woken up from his sleep. He looked groggy. When he saw Su Yue and Ming Ansheng, he knew that they were here to pick up Little Qiao. "She is asleep. You can leave her here tonight." "She's going to kindergarten tomorrow morning," Su Yue said. She had only been attending the kindergarten for a few days. Today, she had already taken a day off and was still adjusting. She could not take another day off. Chapter 1919 Unforgotten Memories (25) "I'll take her to the kindergarten tomorrow." Su Yan yawned as he spoke. He turned around and pointed at the shoe cabinet. "The shoes are in there. You can get it yourself," he said lazily. He dragged his lazy feet to the sofa, yawning incessantly. Su Yue changed her shoes and entered the room. She looked at Su Yan and asked, "Which room is Little Qiao in?" Su Yan pointed at a room and Su Yue walked towards it. When she reached the door, she stopped. The bedside lamp was on and the lights were dimly lit. She stood at the door and saw Little Qiao lying there. Seeing her sleeping little face, Su Yue didn't want to disturb her at this hour and risk waking her up. After some thought, she turned around and left the room. She looked at Ming Ansheng who was already sitting on the sofa. "Why don't I stay here tonight? You can go back alone." Without waiting for Ming Ansheng to speak, Su Yan interjected, "Both of you should stay here for the night. It's very far from here to your house." Anyway, he had moved to a bigger house now and there were many rooms available. They lived in different parts of the city, one in the north and the other in the south. The distance between their houses was far. Su Yue nodded her head in agreement without hesitation." Sure, that sounds good.” "Let's stay here tonight. We'll take Little Qiao to kindergarten tomorrow morning." Ming Ansheng pouted, hesitated briefly, and then smiled. "You can stay here. I have a company meeting tomorrow morning, so I will go back first." He had never stayed overnight at someone else's house, except the hotel. And tonight, at my brother-in-law's place... He feared it might disrupt his sleep and make him uneasy. He would rather drive a car for thirty to forty minutes and go back to sleep soundly. Su Yue didn't force him when he told her that he had work to do early in the morning. "Then take care on your way back." "I will. And you get some rest early." Ming Ansheng nodded. As he spoke, he stood up and then looked at Su Yan and nodded at him. "I'll be leaving first." Even if he didn't address him as "brother," his tone sounded awkward, which was evident even to Su Yue. Su Yue held back her laughter and sent Ming Ansheng to the door, telling him to be careful on the way until she watched him enter the elevator and the doors closed. "Hahaha..." Back inside, she closed the door and covered her mouth to laugh. He smiled as he walked towards Su Yan. Su Yan looked at her with amusement and asked, "Did you pick up money in the middle of the night?" "I think Ming Ansheng is so hilarious." Su Yue walked over to Su Yan and plopped down. Still giggling. "What's on your mind?" Su Yan frowned. "He wanted to call you brother, but he was embarrassed," Su Yue said. Su Yan rolled his eyes at her. "I'm not the one who teased him. It must be someone else." After saying that, he closed his eyes lazily. "Yes, Third Brother!" "You're so mean. You always find the right moment to tease him." Su Yue couldn't help but laugh. Hearing this, Su Yan opened his eyes again and turned to look at her with a frown. "Why is it teasing? Shouldn't he call me "brother" or "third brother"?" "Sure, all right?" Su Yue stuck out her tongue. Suddenly, she moved closer to Su Yan. The atmosphere suddenly became serious. "What are you doing?" Su Yan glanced at her. "Tell me honestly, did anything happen between you and Xin Yanting?" Su Yue stared at Su Yan without blinking, as if she was afraid that he would lie. Chapter 1920 Unforgotten Memories (26) "What do you mean?" Su Yan asked in return even when the answer was obvious. "You know what I am implying. I don't want you to be a real jerk," Su Yue snorted. "What's going on in that head of yours? Why aren't you taking a shower and going to bed?" Su Yan chuckled. Then he got up and strolled to his room. "Does that mean there's nothing between them?" Su Yue watched his back and smirked. "I am a Virgo." Su Yan said lazily. Su Yue looked up and saw that his tall figure had already entered the room. I am the Virgo... Su Yue's mouth twitched. A Virgo? Apart from his obsession with cleanliness and love to pursue perfection in his relationship and career, she really couldn't tell how he looked like a Virgo. "He didn't demand much from the people around him. He was reserved in speech, and his personality was so indifferent that it gave people the feeling he was invulnerable. He didn't exhibit any typical Virgo characteristics." However, what he meant was that there was nothing substantial between them, so she felt much more relaxed. Su Yue sighed in her heart. She put down the pillow and walked towards the room. Yan Rusheng and Wen Xuxu didn't spend much time in the company these past two days, leaving most of the work on Su Yan's shoulders. As soon as he arrived at the company in the morning, he buried himself in a pile of work. After a long while, the employees in the company came to work one after another. After dealing with a few tricky jobs, he looked at his watch. It was only nine o'clock, just the beginning of work hours. He looked up at the door. Outside the frosted glass door, there were a lot of people. Every morning, everyone was bustling with activity. He withdrew his gaze and picked up the white porcelain cup on the table. He glanced at it and found that it was still the water from yesterday. He got up and walked towards the water dispenser. "Ah.." Su Yan had just stood up when the office door suddenly opened. The person who opened the door was his new secretary, Mi Xiao. When she saw Su Yan, Mi Xiao was stunned, or perhaps she was frightened, and her expression became a little flustered. "I'm sorry, Mr. Su. I didn't know you were here so early," she apologized after a brief moment of daze. As she spoke, she prepared to retreat. Su Yan shook his head and said calmly, "It doesn't matter." Then he continued to walk towards the water dispenser. He often came early, but he had never met this new secretary, so it was not a big deal. Mi Xiao stared at Su Yan for a while. After making sure that he was not angry, she pushed the glasses with her hand and walked into the office. She held two green folders in her hands and walked to Su Yan's desk with caution. Su Yan poured himself a glass of water and walked towards his desk while drinking. If not for the board of directors or important high-level meetings, he didn't like to wear a tie, white shirt, or black suit pants. The simple attire complemented his serene appearance well, creating a pleasing sight for others. Approaching Mi Xiao, he took a sip of water, his gaze slightly lowered as he looked at her, and he asked, "What is it?" The new secretary had only been working for more than two weeks, and this was the first time he was so close to her that he realized that the secretary he recruited was so short. If he wanted to see her clearly, he had to lower his head. The large black-rimmed glasses almost covered half of her face, and her bangs fell evenly above her eyebrows. At a glance like this, she looked ordinary. Su Yan casually sized up his new secretary. Chapter 1921 Unforgotten Memories (27) Then he laughed at himself in his heart. They all said that he had already passed the prime age for marriage. They were all anxious for him and advised him to interact more with women. In fact, he was only twenty-eight years old, but since they were all worried about him, then he purposely hired a female secretary this time, but whom was he trying to fool? Su Yan discreetly sized her up, so Mi Xiao didn't notice it. She handed him the two documents. "Mr. Su, these documents need your signature." Su Yan acknowledged her with a sound and reached out to place the document on the table. He flipped it open and took a look at it before signing the document. When he was signing, Mi Xiao continued, "You will have lunch with Director Wang of the Bai Da Group at noon." "Yes, I got it. Are there any other schedules?" Su Yan nodded and handed the document to Mi Xiao. Mi Xiao took the document and shook her head. Just as she finished answering, she suddenly remembered something. "Oh, Miss Evelyne just called and asked if you have time tonight." When he heard the name "Evelyne", Su Yan's expression froze for a moment. He seemed to be deep in thought. A moment later, he nodded at Mi Xiao. "I got it" But he did not directly answer Mi Xiao whether he had time or not. "Then I'll leave first." Mi Xiao held the document and nodded slightly at Su Yan. Then she turned and walked to the door. She was clad in black flat shoes with a heel height of three to four centimeters, accentuating her already slender legs. Her footsteps on the wooden floor made a soft sound, reflecting her gentle and unassuming demeanor, a complete contrast to Evelyne's high-profile and flamboyant style. Su Yan couldn't help but turn his head and look at the door. He saw Mi Xiao's smaller back and her ponytail swayed gently behind her. To his surprise, he felt at ease. Mi Xiao opened the door and stepped out. Su Yan suddenly said, "Mi Xiao, make me a cup of black tea. "Alright." Mi Xiao stopped, turned to Su Yan, and replied to Su Yan before leaving. Su Yan returned to his seat. There was a knock on the door, and with his consent, Mi Xiao pushed the door open and entered. Once inside, she reached out and pushed the glasses on the bridge of her nose. It should be a habitual action, but in Su Yan's eyes, it felt very awkward, as if she was not used to wearing glasses. However, there was nothing strange about this. Perhaps she had recently gotten the glasses for poor eyesight, or maybe he was mistaken in his perception. Su Yan didn't think too much about it. He just glanced at Mi Xiao and continued to work. "Mr. Su, the black tea is ready." Mi Xiao had prepared the tea and approached Su Yan. "Okay, put it here." Su Yan nodded and did not raise his head. OK. Mi Xiao placed the teacup in front of Su Yan. When she was about to take back her hands, Su Yan lifted his eyelids and his gaze inadvertently swept past her hands. Her hands were very small and fair, but the knuckles of her fingers were a little prominent, like hands that did much labor. During the hiring process, he was not present and handed over the matter to the personnel department to arrange it. So for this new secretary, he only knew her name, the university she graduated form, and that she was a recent graduate who came out early for an internship. He did not know the rest, including where her household was, whether she was a farmer or a city person, or if she had any prior experience, etc. He knew nothing about her. Chapter 1922 Unforgotten Memories (28) As Su Yan pondered, he raised his head and looked at Mi Xiao from a higher angle. Mi Xiao was only a little taller. He was not much shorter than her when he was seated. However, the change in angle brought about a different feeling. She had a small oval face, gentle and quiet. Her skin was white and clean. Even though she had dull bangs and large black-framed glasses, she gave him the same feeling when he saw her from behind earlier. She had a comfortable and refreshing charm. Women looked different from different angles, which might explain why many women preferred specific angles for selfies. So photos they posted on Weibo, and Facebook were carefully selected and were taken from the same angle. Lost in thought, Su Yan chuckled as if he had forgotten that his new secretary was right in front of him. Mi Xiao looked at Su Yan with a puzzled expression. She was probably curious about why Mr. Su suddenly laughed like this. Feeling Mi Xiao's gaze, he raised his head and met her puzzled eyes. The smile on his face naturally faded and he regained his usual composure. It struck him as peculiar that he actually stared at an ordinary secretary. When Mi Xiao saw the smile on Su Yan's face disappear, she quickly asked, "Mr. Su, do you have any other instructions?" Su Yan shook his head. "No more. You can leave now." "Alright." Mi Xiao nodded and turned to leave. Su Yan suddenly thought of something and looked up at her. "Tell Evelyne that I'll be available after work tonight." "Okay." Mi Xiao nodded, her tone sounding a little confused. Anyone in her shoes would probably share her feelings. Miss Evelyne was very familiar with Mr. Su and she could casually enter his office without consent. Their relationship was unusual in the eyes of all colleagues. Why did they have to communicate through the office phone instead of contacting each other privately? Later in the afternoon, Su Yan received a phone call from Mi Xiao saying that Evelyne had already made an appointment to have dinner together. "Mr. Su, if there's nothing else, can I get off work?" It was 5:10 PM, ten minutes past the official end of the workday.  Mi Xiao knocked on Su Yan's office door and stood at the door. She looked at him and asked. Although she always looked cautious, her logic and efficiency were very impressive. She always felt that she would make mistakes rashly, but up until now, she had never made a single mistake. It was like watching a child learn to walk. You always felt that he would fall, but he turned out to be steady, like the Weeble toy. Su Yan thought about it and couldn't help but smile again. This feeling was very strange and he didn't know why he felt it was familiar. Mi Xiao was still waiting for his reply. He collected his thoughts and said to her, "Help me make another cup of coffee." There was still a lot of work to do, and he needed to stay energetic. "Okay." Mi Xiao walked to Su Yan. Her footsteps looked a little hurried. She reached out to pick up his cup and suddenly thought of something. She looked at him and asked uncertainly, "Mr. Su, did you mean brewed coffee?" Her expression seemed to convey annoyance and dissatisfaction as if she were thinking, "It's so late, and you still want brewed coffee? What a hassle." Su Yan found it amusing and couldn't help but smile again. Then he said, "If you have something urgent to do, then instant coffee will do." He felt that Mi Xiao seemed to have an urgent matter. After all, it was already past work hours, and there was no complex work waiting for her to handle. There was no need to delay other people's private affairs. Chapter 1923 Unforgotten Memories (29) I Don't Have Anything Urgent." Mi Xiao shook her head. The bangs on her head also swayed. Under the light, it appeared glossy and smooth. However, the emotions that flowed through her eyes made Su Yan feel that she wasn't saying the truth. It was evident that she was quite anxious... He pretended not to notice and waved at her. "Then go ahead and brew it, without adding any sugar." "OK." Mi Xiao nodded, her small hands tightly grasping the cup. When she turned around, Su Yan noticed that she was frowning. Su Yan smiled and shook his head. He must be very bored after a day's work to amuse himself with a girl like this. The coffee machine was in his office. Mi Xiao was fiddling with it over there. He scrolled through his phone for a while and the aroma drifted over. He put down this phone and looked over. The girl stood by the coffee machine, her back facing him, waiting for the coffee to be brewed. It was unknown whether she was thinking about something. She stood there motionless and quiet. Su Yan was stunned. He yearned for this feeling. When he was working, there was such a person quietly by his side and didn't disrupt his work but still made her existence known. Unlike... Xin Yanting, she always sought attention and made herself presence. "Su Yan, I just bought a bag today. It's the new model of Burberry. It suits my white dress very well." "Su Yan, which color of this lipstick is better than the one I wore yesterday?" "Su Yan, do you want milk tea?" "Su Yan, can you bring me with you to Europe?" "Su Yan..." Thinking of Xin Yanting, her incessant remarks echoed in his ears, and he felt somewhat self-deprecating. He also did not know how he managed to endure it. He seemed to be no different from most men, not particularly noble, unique, or outstanding. "Mr. Su, the coffee is ready." Mi Xiao's words brought him back to the present. She walked over to him after she had finished cooking her coffee. The hot coffee was steaming, and the fragrance entered his nose. Su Yan lowered his eyes and saw Mi Xiao's slightly rough hands. "You should have a drink too," he said casually. He said it casually, but Mi Xiao was surprised. She stared in disbelief for a second or two before she reacted. "No," she said. She shook her head slightly and was only surprised for a moment. She was not flattered by his invitation to drink coffee with her. Very indifferent. "Is there an urgent matter?" Su Yan raised his eyebrows. Mi Xiao shook her head again. Though he could clearly see through her, he asked anyway. How annoying... The impatience was evident on her face, though she probably hadn't noticed it yet. Su Yan smiled. He didn't intend to tease Mi Xiao anymore. He said indifferently, "There's nothing else. You can get off work." With a nod of acknowledgment, he picked up the coffee, took a sip, and prepared to immerse himself in work. There was still a lot of work to do. Mi Xiao was relieved, and the visible impatience on his face disappeared. "Then I'll get off work first." She nodded slightly at Su Yan and reminded him, "Mr. Su, you have dinner with Miss Evelyne at seven in the evening." Su Yan nodded. Seven o'clock... After watching Mi Xiao leave his office, Su Yan looked at the time on the computer. It was already six o'clock. He picked up his phone and was hesitating when there was a sudden knock on the door. He lifted his head and looked over. Through the frosted glass door, he saw a tall figure. Chapter 1924 Unforgotten Memories (30) "Come in." He cleared his mind and responded to the door. Then, he reached out to tidy up the documents and other materials on his desk. The door opened and a fashionable and tall beauty entered his sight. He was not surprised at all. He had a faint smile on his face as he politely called out 'Miss Evelyne'. Evelyne was wearing a light green printed shirt and a pair of white tight pants, perfectly outlining her slender figure. Different from working hours, she had light makeup on her face, revealing her natural beauty. She still wore high heels, no less than ten centimeters high. It was also light in color, complementing her entire outfit. It was so refreshing. She walked gracefully towards Su Yan and smiled at him as she walked. "Mr. Su, I was afraid that you were busy, so I came up to wait for you." Su Yan shook his head. "t's alright, I'm done with work. We can leave." He closed the computer, got up, walked to the coat rack, taking his coat and draping it over his arm. Evelyne looked at the mountainous pile of work on his desk and looked at him sincerely. "Mr. Su, I have nothing to do tonight, and I'm not hungry. It's not urgent to eat." It was not easy to have a chance to be alone with him. Spending time with him alone in his office was more exciting. If they could simply sit together and watch him work, it would bring her pure happiness. Evelyne stared at Su Yan's handsome face, somewhat lost in thought. "Let's go early. I booked a place at seven o'clock." Su Yan said in a calm tone and walked towards the office door. Once he left, Evelyne had no reason to stay, so she quickly followed him. Along the way, she was looking for topics to chat with Su Yan, without showing any signs of effort. Unlike some people who were incessantly chatty, making it obvious that they were looking for a topic to talk about. Su Yan held the steering wheel with both hands and looked at the road ahead. It was already summer. The day had grown longer and it was still bright past 6 PM. However, most of the shops on the side of the road that were still doing business at night had already turned on their lights. The neon lights flashed, and his mood suddenly became complicated and inexplicable. "Mr. Su, red light!" Evelyne's startled voice interrupted his thoughts. Su Yan came back to his senses. The car had already driven into the intersection and crossed the pedestrian crossing.. The vehicles and pedestrians had already begun to move. He could not speed up through the intersection, so he could only brake. The car stopped and the inertia was very strong. But fortunately, both of them were prepared, so they were not injured. When the car stopped, Evelyne calmed her heart and turned to look at Su Yan. She asked with concern, "Mr. Su, what was on your mind just now?" "It's about work." Su Yan replied casually. Then he offered an apologetic smile to Evelyne. "I'm sorry for scaring you," he said. "I'm fine." Evelyne shook her head. The red light ended, and the green came back on. The car started up again and slowly crossed the road. Su Yan tried his best to control his emotions and thoughts, not allowing himself to make any more mistakes. In fact, he did not know what he was thinking just now. He was clearly listening to Evelyne talking about the recent stock problems. He was lost in thought as he listened. At seven o'clock, it was time to eat. In the upscale western restaurant, there were no empty seats at a glance. They had booked seats in advance, so there was no need to worry about. They reserved a private room, separated by beaded curtains. Although it was also in the hall, the environment was much more elegant. Chapter 1925 Unforgotten Memories (31) The dishes arrived promptly. They both wanted classic steaks and the signature delicacies made by the chef in the restaurant. Evelyne also ordered a bottle of red wine. The young tall male attendant served them a meal. Then, he prepared to pour the wine for them. Evelyne raised her head and smiled at him. "Thank you. We can do it ourselves." The waiter put down the bottle, nodded slightly at them, and turned to leave. They were left alone in the room. Su Yan had taken off his suit and was wearing a white shirt, with his sleeves rolled up slightly. With a knife in one hand and a fork in the other, he skillfully and elegantly cut the steak. "Mr. Su, let's have a toast." Evelyne lifted the red wine bottle and extended it to Su Yan's wine glass. The mouth of the bottle slowly lowered. Su Yan glanced at it, seemingly considering stopping her. Evelyne noticed his subtle change and promptly halted the pouring of wine. Then Su Yan lowered his gaze and continued to cut his steak without saying anything. Interpreting his silence as agreement, Evelyne smiled and gracefully poured a glass of wine for Su Yan before filling her own. After pouring the wine, she put down the bottle and raised her glass. She smiled at Su Yan and said, "Mr. Su, let's toast to a pleasant collaboration." Su Yan put down his fork, raised his wine glass, and clinked it with Evelyne's wine glass. Both of them took a graceful sip of the wine. Then, Evelyne looked at Su Yan and said with a smile, "Actually, I am quite surprised." Curious, Su Yan raised his eyebrows, waiting for her to continue. Evelyne continued, "I was surprised that you would agree to come out for dinner today. I remember that you are a busy person. Every time I see you, you are occupied, with no time to talk." Hearing this, Su Yan smiled apologetically. "I'm sorry if I haven't been able to entertain you properly." "It doesn't matter. I know all successful people are like this." Evelyne waved her hand. As she spoke, she picked up her wine glass and took a small sip. Her alluring red lips, painted with seductive lipstick, became stained with red wine, accentuating her allure that men could not resist. Whether she did it intentionally or not, she didn't wipe the corner of her mouth and allowed the wine to stain her lips. Instead, she smiled at Su Yan. However, Su Yan's gaze did not linger on her face. He gave her a polite glance and then resumed cutting the steak. After a busy day, he ate lunch with clients and talked about work. He had no time to eat afternoon tea. Now he was really hungry. Evelyne was a little disappointed as she saw Su Yan engrossed in eating. She picked up a napkin and wiped her mouth. She also picked up the knife and fork, cut the steak, and sent it to her mouth. As a famous actress with millions of fans, even if she was interested in a man, she would not act like a love-struck fool in front of him. The two were silent until the end of the meal. After paying the bill, Su Yan and Evelyne walked out of the restaurant side by side, and Evelyne put on her glasses as she walked. "My cutie, watch out." They passed through the revolving door and a woman next to them entered the revolving door with a little girl. The girl looked to be three or four years old and was chubby. Evelyne thought of something and looked at Su Yan. "Mr. Su, the adorable little girl in your office the other day, is she your niece?"
