Chapter 455 Reversion 3 "This is to let you feel the fluctuation of aura. It's really simple." Another Warlock couldn't help but interrupt with a smile. "Then I'll have to trouble you." Lin Sheng nodded. He needed to find the other fragments as soon as possible. Originally, he had planned to conquer more evil spirits and obtain more pure soul power. But now that he encountered such an opportunity, the most important thing for him was to get it as soon as possible. Soon, the Warlock Commander led Lin Sheng to an Evil Spirit Gate. The two reached out, touched the frame of the Evil Spirit Gate at the same time, and closed their eyes. The Warlock Commander quickly used his ability to build the space base as a coordinate. Then, along with the ritual fluctuations at the Evil Spirit Gate and Lin Sheng's mind, the coordinate was sent out by the ritual fluctuations. "An ordinary portal ritual is a directional teleportation from one place to another." "However, when we explore other secret realms, we change this teleportation into one which is from one place to many others. What we need to do is just modify a few parameters on the teleportation base." The Warlock Commander guided Lin Sheng's mind as he shared these related techniques. "This way, the Evil Spirit Gate will automatically send our mind to many possible places similar to the target space. This is actually using energy to test our luck. If we are lucky, we will be able to bump into the secret realm we want. If we are unlucky, we will have to waste energy to try it a few more times." "It is really random." Lin Sheng was speechless. As soon as his mind entered the Evil Spirit Gate, it was immediately enveloped by the ritual fluctuations and was scattered outwards. At the same time, it was as if his mind had split apart. His mind was split into more than ten parts, and at the same time, he sensed more than ten completely different space auras. "Generally speaking, it is difficult for our mind to stay complete during the transmission process, so we can only try our best to remember the spatial coordinates that our primary mind has come into contact with. As for the memory of the coordinates, we need to leave a simple mark on it..." The Warlock Commander on the outside was still explaining in a low voice. At the same time, he guided Lin Sheng by teaching the latter how to make a simple mark to confirm the coordinates. However, he did not expect that Lin Sheng's mind soul was too strong and tough. After it was split, he could remember all the coordinates of the space that more than ten pieces of his mind came into contact with. It was just using his mind on more than ten occasions. This was nothing to Lin Sheng, who could use his mind soul on several occasions. He had been training his skills of using his mind on multiple occasions every day. He could observe and control every summoned creature through the split mind soul. Therefore, although he could not have many summoned creatures act separately at the same time now. However, it was just memorizing the fluctuation of the aura and then marking the coordinates. In addition, his soul was tougher than that of ordinary people, and it lasted longer. This was very easy. Ten minutes later, his mind was exhausted and dispersed. Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the Warlock Commander and others. "Help me locate the secret realm of this coordinate." He immediately said the coordinate of one of the special secret realms under the astounded gazes of the Warlock Commander and the others. The secret realm of this coordinate was exactly what Lin Sheng had sensed. It possessed a special space that shared the same origin as the Evil Wheel Fragment in his arms. "He succeeded in one try?" The Warlock Commander felt a bit bitter in his heart. It took him more than half a month to make it to sense the aura of space and confirm the coordinate and put it down. "It's a very simple operation. Let's begin, establish the portal. I want to go through it," Lin Sheng ordered. "Yes." "Wait for the main body." Tiangong Xia's soul message made Lin Sheng pause. "What?" As he watched Warlock Commander and the others begin to order Evil Spirits to send the materials over, he walked to the side and waited. At the same time, he communicated with Tiangong Xia in his mind. "There is a problem here. There has been a big change in Bishajia Island!" Tiangong Xia's tone was a little serious. This was a sign that Lin Sheng had never seen before. After all, even when he told Tiangong Xia about the existence of the Night King, he had never seen her being so serious. This made him feel an abnormal sense of nervousness. "Mi Yue should be at an absolute disadvantage, right?" Lin Sheng asked with a frown. "Or is there a new power taking part in the battle?" "No, it is not a new power," Tiangong Xia said solemnly. "The truth is that Mi Yue lied to everyone!" "??? What's going on?" "The Seven Lock Pagoda was successfully summoned long ago. Mi Yue tricked everyone in the Three Great Secret Realms. He has already successfully summoned Farudo! He used himself as a sacrifice and fused with it!" Lin Sheng was instantly stunned. "Using himself as a sacrifice?... This lunatic!" "Therefore, what the Three Great Secret Realms are facing right now is a fused monster, a mixture of Mi Yue and Farrudo." Lin Sheng was speechless. "What should we do now?" Tiangong Xia said solemnly. The mixture of Farrudo and Mi Yue was not an equation like 1+1=2. The consequence was 30 times more serious. "Don't get excited. To Mi Yue and Farrudo, the greatest enemy was still the Three Great Secret Realms and other great forces. Moreover, this world isn't as simple as you think." Lin Sheng thought of the information he had obtained from his previous investigation. "The Great Star Pool and those fellows who possess Destiny Artifacts are not small potatoes. As long as they don't provoke us, we don't care how they develop." "I understand what you mean. However, it is best to prepare early." Tiangong Xia adviced. "I once got the destructive power of that level. It was during the time when I was controlled by the Devil Sword. "So I know very well what kind of result a power of that level will lead to." Lin Sheng was silent. Among all of his commanders, Tiangong Xia was the most special one, because she had once been controlled by some kind of special and powerful existence. At that time, she even found Lin Sheng spying on her in her memory. With just a mark in her memory, she made it to find out Lin Sheng who was spying on her memory. This kind of power was beyond Lin Sheng's understanding. "I got it," Lin Sheng replied again. "I will be prepared. Don't worry." At worst, he would activate his strongest special state and summon all the commanders to fuse with himself. After breaking off the connection with Tiangong Xia, Lin Sheng quietly stared at the newly constructed Evil Spirit Gate. His mind returned to his original thoughts. "It's open, my lord." The Warlock Commander said in a low voice. Lin Sheng stared at the portal and was silent for a moment. "Let the Demon King come over. What's more, Dejar!" "Yes." Dejar, the Devil Hand, had already arrived nearby and waited. Upon hearing the call, he immediately walked in from the door. "My lord, I will listen to your instructions." Lin Sheng nodded. "I want to open multiple portals at the same time to explore several Evil Spirit Spaces." "Select a hundred Great Evil Spirits and split them into different groups to explore separately." "Yes, sir!" Dejar felt a chill in his heart. He knew that his lord might have encountered a turning point. Otherwise, his lord would not have suddenly started such a large-scale exploration in such a hurry. Chapter 456 Moving Forward 1 Following Lin Sheng's instructions, they started to explore the various secret realms. After Dejar, the Devil Hand, received the order, he quickly went down to dispatch the army. On the other side, the Warlocks also sent a message to the Elf Queen and began to gather their forces. Soon, the Elf Queen led several elite messengers and stepped out of one of the Evil Spirit Gates. "My lord, what are your orders?" This contradictory existence, with a perfect figure but only one eye on his face, bowed and stood in front of Lin Sheng. "I want the Elf Empire to send a slave army to explore the new secret realm. You can make the arrangements yourself so that you can explore it in the fastest way. I only care about the result." He couldn't treat the Elf Empire as carelessly as he treated the Evil Spirits. The Elf Empire had already become a race which was a fusion of humans and elves. The friendships and connections between them were deeper. When he threw the target of the task to them, he allowed them to use their own methods to complete the goal, as long as the result was the best. "Yes, my lord." The Elf Queen said calmly. Compared to Dejar, she undoubtedly had more ways to explore the new space as safely as possible. After instructing Elf Queen and Dejar, the Devil Hand, Lin Sheng quickly continued to sense the new space, constantly searching for space that might contain the aura of fragments. He sensed it, confirmed the coordinates, then opened it, established the portal, and sent troops into it for exploration. One portal after another was opened in succession in this wide field. Time slowly passed. A large number of Evil Spirit Army troops and the Elf Empire troops started to move. They were first sent here. Then, they moved to other secret realms. A massive amount of teleportation resources were consumed, and plenty of materials were used as consumables. What followed was more than ten thousand Evil Spirit and Elf soldiers moving into the various open portals. Several days later. Among these portals, some were removed by Lin Sheng because he realized they were valueless during the exploration process, while others were kept because of the rich resources or their research value, etc.. Lin Sheng found a total of three realms that had the aura of the fragments. He had dispatched a large number of troops to enter these three realms and carefully explore and investigate them. The feedback from the army indicated that the space on the other end was relatively vast and comprehensive with intelligent life. Lin Sheng pondered for a moment. If he were to have his subordinates look for this precious artifact, he would not feel at ease. It would be a real loss for him if they found and pocketed it. Therefore, after thinking for a moment, he decided to send someone to investigate the space information environment there first. Then, he would personally enter, find the fragment as quickly as he could, and leave once he obtained it. Bishajia Island. "Soul Breath Gazing." Mi Yue, or Farrudo, raised his head. Dense grey tentacles grew out from his back, weaving into a huge human face. This human face was covered with hundreds of red eyeballs, which stared deeply at the envoys in front of them. Buzz!! An invisible fluctuation followed a mysterious passage and instantly crossed a thousand meters, accurately landing on the bodies of the fleeing envoys. "No!!!" One person shouted in fear. Layers of protection on his body were constantly being destroyed like soap bubbles. When the protection dissipated, his body was rapidly distorted under the effect of a mysterious force field. Bang! In an instant, the body of the clan leader from the Euro Hellfire was twisted into several pieces like a fried dough twist, falling into the sea. When the others saw this, they all fled even faster without saying a word. They could no longer rely on numbers to win. No matter how many people came, they would be sending themselves to their deaths. Farrudo already stood on a higher level than envoys. If they did not have the same level of power, they would be sending themselves to their deaths if they went up. "Black Hand." Farrudo opened his mouth, and a shadow arm as black as ink stretched out from his mouth, grabbing the few people who had escaped. Pu! The two envoys were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered. With two crisp sounds, blood scattered and they fell into the sea below. On Bishajia Island, there were blood and corpses scattered everywhere. The envoys' last power when they were dying destroyed the island beyond recognition. Several layers of land of the entire island had been blown up, and the altitude had dropped by more than ten meters. Farrudo stepped on the white flag of the Heavenly Tower on the ground and looked at the strongest persons of the Heavenly Tower, the man with golden armor and white wings and the Red Angel, who had been turned into dried corpses after their vitality was absorbed. "What a pity. In the end, I won." A strange smile appeared on his face that was about to rot. "Do you think... you... Will definitely win?" On a protruding rock in the distance, an old man, who was nailed to it, said in a low voice. His entire body was covered in blood. "You're not dead yet?" Farrudo raised his eyebrows and looked at the old man. "Xi Ji, in fact, if you hadn't taken the initiative to get involved in this matter, you wouldn't have ended up like this." He had the memories of Mi Yue. In fact, he could be considered as the assembly of Mi Yue and Farrudo in the human world. Naturally, he inherited the character and emotions of Mi Yue. In fact, he was not in the complete form of Farrudo. He was just a spokesperson. "Heh... I lost this time... However, this world is not as simple as you think. Just wait, there will be people who will take revenge for me. Just wait..." The old man said coldly. "I'm looking forward to it." Farrudo reached out his hand and snatched. At the same time, a huge gray arm appeared behind him, grabbed the old man, and clenched. Pu! A ball of blood splashed out of the gray palm. "What a pity. Another old friend was gone..." Farrudo looked up and sighed insincerely. On the ground around him, there wasn't even a complete corpse of the envoys of Euro Hellfire. Just as he sighed insincerely, an invisible silver spike quietly shot out from behind him and stabbed straight at the back of his head. The one holding the spike was the strongest person of White Paper, the Sun Crown Star Kaisha. His face was deathly pale. It was obvious that he had been heavily injured in the earlier battle. Originally, he had successfully hidden himself, but at this moment, the entire area around the Bishajia Island was enveloped by a powerful red circular force field. Once he touched the edge of the force field, his figure would immediately be revealed. With his current strength, if he were at his peak, he would at most be able to take a casual strike from Farrudo. After that, if he could not hide, then he would definitely die. So he had to come back and waited for an opportunity. "Soul Suppressing Spike... As long as someone was stabbed by it, regardless of whether he was injured or not, his soul would be shaken and faint for a day. Star Kaisha was determined. He knew that if he didn't suppress Farrudo in a short period of time, he wouldn't be able to escape safely. He would rather take the initiative to counterattack than wait for death! As an envoy, his special ability was to conceal his aura and life fluctuations. This ability allowed him to hide himself in an invisible dimension. Only in the instant of the attack would an aura fluctuation erupt. This was one of the biggest reasons why he became the strongest person in the Sun Crown. The silver spike slowly approached the back of Farrudo's head. Five meters.  Three meters. Two meters. One meter. Suddenly, the spike accelerated and shot forward. "Spell - Intimidation!" Farrudo suddenly said. Sh!! A circle of pure gray vibration waves immediately spread out from his body in all directions. Chapter 457 Moving Forward 2 The waves carried a strong vibration, and in almost an instant, they pushed away Star behind Farru. "Spell - Endurance." "Spell - Spiritualization Bind." "Spell - Stifle." "Advanced Killing Intent Shackles." "Advanced Death Gaze." "The ultimate Blade of the Flame Fiend." As a series of spells came out from Farrudo's mouth, a dense, multi-colored light flashed on his body. At the same time, the effects of the various kinds of spells exploded on Star. Binding, Soul Suppression, Death Gaze, Flame damage of super high temperature, Air Extraction, Spirit Intimidation, and so on. A series of high-level spells, which cost advanced evil energy users at least a day to prepare, were like ordinary little tricks to Farrudo. He easily cast these spells by just saying them. When Star came back to his senses, he only resisted the effects of the two spells, and he could not do anything to the rest. Layers of spells wrapped him up perfectly, turning him into a large black rice dumpling that could not resist. Pu! Without any redundant words, Farrudo extended his right hand and pierced through the glabella of Star. His hand was like a sharp knife, easily stabbing into Star's skull, smashing his brain apart. Boom!! The moment Star, an envoy, died, the massive amount of energy that gathered in his body suddenly exploded, turning into a ball of blazing fire that enveloped Farrudo. Soon, the red flames dispersed, revealing the unharmed figure of Farrudo inside. He raised his gaze and looked at the warships that were quickly turning around and running away. "Next, as long as I open three different Underworld Passages, my true body will be able to descend completely. At the same time, the Underworld Hand will be able to revive early." "Struggle. Let me feel more surprises. Otherwise, wouldn't it be too boring since I finally come out once after being bored for so many years?" Farrudo stepped forward and read the spells softly. "Spell - Divine Path." Sh! His body instantly turned into a ray of gray light and shot out like a meteor towards the warships. In the world of Unknown Secret Realm. On the vast white snowy plains, tens of thousands of evil spirits were engaged in a fierce battle with the centaur army. The blood of the centaurs dyed the originally pure white snow red. Evil spirits were naturally immune to physical damage, so they could only be injured by a small number of energy weapons. Only one-third of the centaurs had such an energy weapon. And this was already the peak strength in this secret realm world. Lin Sheng was riding a demonic war horse - Blood Demon. He was wearing a set of heavy, pure white armor. He stood quietly on a hill, overlooking the battlefield below. His face was covered by the mask, so it was impossible to see his expression. Only a trace of indifference and coldness was revealed from his eyes. "Have you found what I want?" He suddenly asked in a low voice. "I found it. The Tail Bone Chief secretly hung it on his second son's ankle. I found it and took it off immediately." The Elf Queen suddenly appeared and knelt down on one knee on Lin Sheng's right. At the same time, she held up a strange, white-and-golden bone that looked like a ghost face as well as symbols. The bone was only the size of a palm. It was curved. There were tiny cracks on its surface, as if it had suffered considerable damage before. Lin Sheng reached out and grabbed it. He closed his eyes and felt the heartbeat-like fluctuations on it. "This is it." He grabbed the bone and looked for the last time at the Centaur Tribe that was fighting desperately. The Mizhe Clan, a powerful force that had once dominated this secret realm, was brutally suppressed by the Evil Spirit Army just because they were unwilling to hand over what he wanted. "Have them surrender. Get rid of those who are unwilling to yield." Lin Sheng left the last sentence, turned around and left on his horse. The generals of the Elf Empire who were left behind knelt down on one knee and respectfully sent him off. In just four days. Lin Sheng had consecutively conquered eleven different secret realms. There were big and small realms. The big one was as big as Mijia, a province. The small one was as small as Hengruikala, a city. However, there were many hidden experts among them. Among them, the one with the greatest resistance was the centaur tribe in front of them. This white snow plain was under the command of this powerful tribe. They had been invincible for too long and had long forgotten how to treat those stronger than themselves. They completely lacked the respect they should have. Therefore, when the messengers of Lin Sheng arrived, conflicts began. After the messenger sent by Lin Sheng was mercilessly beheaded, the evil spirit army gathered under Lin Sheng's command and rushed into the White Snow Plains' secret realm. The arrogant Mizhe Clan finally tasted a crushing defeat. And the price was that they were almost exterminated. Two days later, the strongest person of the Mizhe Clan, the Centaur King, Kur Spear, was in pain as he entered the Evil Spirit Palace to meet Evil Spirit King, Lin Sheng, who was sitting on the throne. His clan was slaughtered, leaving only the last branch bloodline. In such a situation, he, who was originally the most obsessed with cultivation and fighting, had to bear the heavy responsibility at the moment of crisis and to yield to a new king. He fell under Lin Sheng's command in exchange for the latter's mercy on the Centaur Race. Just like Elf King, in order to protect the last bloodline and inheritance of the clan, he had to compromise and fall under Lin Sheng's command. He became one of Lin Sheng's minions. From then on, Lin Sheng had the Elf Queen, the Centaur King, and Dajar, the Devil Hand, the three commanders. They represented the great strength of three different clans. Among them, the Elf Queen and the Centaur King were both powerful existences that had truly reached the level of an envoy. Just as Lin Sheng was preparing for the battle and searching for the Evil Wheel Fragment, in reality. Farrudo had also truly committed a great tragedy that shocked the world. After defeating and killing more than half of the envoys, Mi Yue, or Farrudo, even caught up to the World Alliance Fleet and started a horrifying massacre by himself. And he was not simply killing people. Instead, he used a massive range of spells to freeze a total of eighteen warships and over thirty thousand people into ice, sinking them into the vast ocean near the Bishajia Island. These frozen soldiers did not die, but their bodies were imprisoned. Their minds could only sink to the bottom of the sea, and they would gradually fall into madness in the endless silence. Boom!!! On the surface of the blue sea, half of a gray smoke human figure appeared behind Farrudo. The human figure raised his right arm and grabbed the huge, long strip shaped missile that fell from the sky. The white intercontinental missile continued to shoot out orange flames of high temperature, giving out unimaginable strength as it tried to push away the large hand of the gray figure. At the same time, a diamond-shaped green crystal was embedded at the top of the missile. Large amounts of evil energy kept flowing and flashing in the crystal, providing more powerful and terrifying kinetic energy for the missile. But it was in vain. Farrudo exerted force in his palm. Creak. The ten-meter-long white intercontinental missile was twisted into a large lump in his palm like a ball of scrap metal. All kinds of liquid and powder leaked out from the inside and scattered on the surface of the sea. There were no signs of explosion and burning. It was as if there was some kind of strange power restraining the missile explosion. Chapter 458 Moving Forward 3 Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! As the sound of the cannons shook the sky, densely packed artillery shells rained down on Farrudo from afar. "Spell - Rebound." Farrudo raised his hand and pointed. A huge, square-shaped gray barrier suddenly appeared in front of him. On the surface of the barrier, there were many maggot-like patterns, and in the middle was a huge lion head. The ends of all the maggots were connected to the mane of the lion head. Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! In an instant, all the evil energy shells hit the barrier, and then paused for a moment before they suddenly bounced back. All the artillery shells returned in the direction they came from. Boom!! In the distance, the sound of explosions could be heard from the sea, and from far away, angry evil energy users were heard shouting "Abandon the ship". Farrudo looked in the direction where the shells came from. "The nearest place is Redwon. Then I'll go to the Tower of Heaven first.“ With a smile on his face, he stepped lightly. Instantly, the seawater exploded and turned into a huge whirlpool that spun rapidly. The instant the water exploded, Farrudo had already disappeared from where he was. In the Evil Spirit Palace. Crack. Lin Sheng gently placed the white-and-golden bone on the black crystal pillar. A miraculous thing happened. The white-and-golden bone actually changed its shape by itself, sticking closely to the black crystal pillar. The crystal pillar also slowly changed its shape, from thick to thin and wide, and its edges gradually turned into thin blades. In less than ten seconds, this originally rough black crystal pillar had transformed into a two-meter-long, wide-edged black blade. The handle of the giant blade was transformed from the white-and-golden bone. The edge of the blade was dark, dull, and extremely rough. It looked like the most ordinary type of huge chopper. Lin Sheng reached out his hand to gently hold the hilt of the blade and lifted it up. Buzz. The blade trembled violently, giving off a vibration sound like a tuning fork. "After the two fragments were fused, it gradually reveals its true form?" In the dark palace, Lin Sheng stretched out his hand and gently stroked the weapon that was made from the Evil Wheel Fragment. He could sense that this was not the true form of the Evil Wheel. "Judging from the gap of the energy fluctuations, there are at least two fragments needed to re-forge the complete Evil Wheel." Lin Sheng picked up the giant blade and placed it horizontally in front of him, holding it with both hands. "With one more fragment, I believe maybe I can activate its initial power." The Evil Wheel was one of the strongest artifacts. Its story had always been on everyone's lips in the Evil Spirit World. It was said that the one who possessed it could control the entire Evil Spirit World and become a supreme overlord. Although Lin Sheng did not believe in the legend that the owner could dominate everything, he coveted the Evil Wheel for its effect—it was said that the owner could acquire various evil spirit abilities. He sat in his seat, gently stroking the giant blade in his hand, carefully feeling some mysterious and hidden powerful energy flowing inside. "Soon... Soon... The third fragment will be found soon. "I've been sure of the secret realm where the third fragment is located in advance. I just need to go there and get it." Lin Sheng looked calm, but he was looking forward to it. At this time, the Centaur King and the Elf Queen had already gone to the world where the third fragment was to conquer the vast space which was the hardest to take down. Lin Sheng quietly waited for the good news. There shouldn't be much of a problem for the Centaur King and the Elf Queen, the two powerful beings at the envoy level, to conquer a secret realm. But before he could carefully study the giant fused blade in his hand, a messenger led an evil spirit soldier with his body half left and rushed into the hall. "My lord, something is wrong!" The messenger had a serious expression as he handed a black scroll to Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng took the scroll and shook it lightly. In an instant, the scroll exploded and turned into countless green dots of light. "Is this the Elf Queen's Image Preserving Technique?" He frowned slightly. This kind of long-distance Image Preserving Scroll was very precious. It could passively record a lot of important information. Normally, only when its possessor was seriously injured would it automatically activate and record the critical moment at that time. He was not sure what exactly had happened. But since the Image Preserving Scroll was activated, there must be a strong enemy appearing. Soon, the dots of light from the scroll gathered together, forming a triangular screen. The screen began to slowly display the scenes that had happened before. In a large white pillar hall, a tall black giant wearing a golden wristband was roaring and fighting the Elf Queen with all his might. The black giant was wearing a black metal vest with extremely strong defense. Every punch and kick of the black giant exploded with a tremendous force. The ground in the main hall was riddled with holes. The Elf Queen faced the attacks one by one head-on, but as time passed, she slowly fell into a disadvantageous position. On the other side, the Centaur King held a giant spear in his hand as he clashed head-on with a white-skinned giant with a human body and a fish tail. The Centaur King had already entered a berserk state, and this was the state when his combat strength was fully unleashed. He, who was originally two times larger than the human race, had now become five-meter high and three-meter wide after his transformation. From afar, he looked like a tall mountain of meat. But the opponent of the Centaur King was similarly not to be underestimated. The white-skinned giant with a human body and a fish tail was also more than four-meter tall, and every time he waved his trident,  a violent tornado would be brought up. The gray tornado continuously bombarded the Centaur King, interfering with his attack and defense movements, greatly preventing the Centaur King from releasing killing power. "When conquering the secret realm you ordered, the two commanders discovered this giant hall. "There are two Giant Kings inside. They are two top beings who rule the entire secret realm." The messenger was a translucent evil spirit with a snake head and a human body. Now he spoke in a low voice, giving the entire palace a gloomy and cold aura. "Giant King?" Lin Sheng gently stroked the handle of the giant blade and muttered to himself. "Yes, through the translation of the evil spirit language there, the native people there indeed call them the Two Giant Kings." The snake-headed evil spirit replied. "In other words, that place also belongs to the Evil Spirit Realm? And both the two kings are evil spirits?" Lin Sheng immediately understood. "Yes." Lin Sheng was silent for a moment. Then he picked up his giant blade and stood up. He slowly walked out of the palace and arrived at the portal area in front of the gate. Most of the portals had already been guarded by the evil spirits under the hands of the Dejar, the Devil Hand. Only the secret realms that had not been conquered were still guarded by the space warlocks of the Elf Empire. Hiss. Just as they reached the empty ground, a slim figure suddenly rushed out of the portal at the end. It was the Elf Queen who was wearing broken green armor. As soon as she walked out of the portal, her body tilted and she almost fell to the ground. Fortunately, a space warlock quickly supported her. "My queen!" A group of warlocks from the Elf Empire rushed forward and shouted. The Elf Empire was different from the other evil spirits. They had a very high sense of belonging and recognition of their ruler, the Elf Queen. Lin Sheng raised his hand. Suddenly, a ray of pure white holy power turned into a beam of light and enveloped the Elf Queen, rapidly treating her injuries. Only then did he notice that the Elf Queen's right arm had already been cut down to the bone, leaving only a bare, bloody wound. "My Lord... I have failed you..." The Elf Queen expressionlessly knelt down on one knee towards Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng stared at her and did not speak. Regardless of whether or not the Elf Queen had truly contributed, at the very least, she was injured like this. No blame should be attached to her. He shouldn't be harsh on her. After a moment of silence. From the portal at the side, a red-haired figure, Tiangong Xia, suddenly walked out of it. "Come with me." He looked at Tiangong Xia. "OK." The two, one following another, passed by the Elf Queen and stepped into the portal. At the same time, other high-level evil spirits, such as guards of Evil Spirit King and Dejar, the Devil Hand, followed closely behind. Even the Evil Spirit King joined the battle himself. If they, his personal guards, did not follow him, no one could predict what the consequences would be after that. Chapter 459 Chasing 1 In the Giant Evil Spirit Realm. Ah!!! The Centaur King roared and used his spear to smash the weapon in the hands of the Merman Giant. Behind the Merman Giant, an even bigger tornado had already formed. The gray tornado formed a strong traction force, like thin threads, constantly pulling the Centaur King from all directions. "Burning Blood Spear! Kill!" The spear in the Centaur King's hand suddenly turned from pure black to silver. The tip of the spear lit up with a sharp and dazzling white light and stabbed forward. Bang!! This stab was once again blocked by Merman Giant's trident. The strength and speed of the spear were seriously affected by the traction of the tornado, and it became slower and weaker. The Centaur King tried to retreat several times, but the black Giant King's gaze not far away made him not dare to show any signs of retreat. He remembered that the black giant was fighting with the Elf Queen, but he didn't expect that the giant would leave the battle and come here. It was clear that the Elf Queen either was defeated or fled. "Damn it! This damn one-eyed woman!" He waved his giant spear in anger. This was his powerful ability as the Centaur King. The angrier he became, the stronger and faster he would be. Therefore, his actual combat strength could be said to be the most powerful among all the past Centaur Kings. At this moment, the fury in his heart was like a raging flame, and the strength and speed of the Centaur King was almost double that of usual. He had a huge advantage over the Merman Giant in front of him. However, whenever he took a break to launch the ultimate attack, the other black giant would immediately threaten him with a gaze, making him unable to store power. This dilemma continued for two to three minutes. The Centaur King had already felt his anger slowly subsiding. Fury was indeed able to greatly increase his speed and strength, but the price was that it would consume his physical strength and spirit extremely quickly and proportionally. "No! I can't do this! I have to find a way to turn things around!" The Centaur King waved his giant spear to suppress its opponent while secretly looking around, looking for an opportunity to escape. However, the army of evil spirits that he had brought with him had basically been wiped out by the barbarians in the palace hall of the Giant King. These elite barbarians were all dressed in rough-style cloaks and armor. They were carrying either hammers or giant bone blades in their hands. Every time before they brandished their weapons, they would let out a loud roar, releasing a strange vibrating power. It was the same vibrating power as the black giant's. This power was able to destroy the inside of things through the surface, and it was very amazing. The evil spirits were shaken by this power. Then the core weakness in their bodies was found, and thus they were killed one by one. "If this continues, I will die here!" The Centaur King became more and more anxious. But no matter what he did, Merman Giant, who was in front of him, firmly clung to him. He retreated, and the opponent moved forward. He moved forward, and the opponent retreated. These two giants seemed to be consuming his strength, wanting to take him down unscathed. "Damn it! Damn it! Ah!!!" The Centaur King became even more furious. However, although his anger was strong, his body had been burning for so long, and he couldn't stand it any longer. "You bitches!! You think you can kill me like this? You can kill the great Centaur King, Kur Spear?" "I will let you know the price of teasing me!" The Centaur King swung his giant spear with all his might. The thick spear howled and swept up a sharp wind, instantly cutting off all of the traction threads that the tornado had released. He took a step back, panting, his eyes blood red, already planning to use the final Blood Ignition Secret Spell. It was a powerful battle spell that required burning one's lifespan to cast. The spell was able to make him recover to his best state in an extremely short period of time, and at the same time, in every attack and defense of his, a blood shield would be produced to help him resist the damage. But unless this was the last resort, he was absolutely unwilling to use this secret spell. Because every time it was used, one third of his lifespan would be consumed. It wouldn't consume his lifespan in a fixed number but do it proportionately. Just as he was hesitating, Merman Giant seized the opportunity when he was lost in his mind and suddenly waved the trident forward like lightning. Swish! The Centaur King was caught off guard, and a large wound was cut open on his chest. Only then did he come back to his senses. The opponent in front of him was not a person to get along with, but a strong enemy on the same level as him. At least a hundred moves were needed to see who won. "Foreigner, this is not a place you should come to. Since you are here, you can rest in peace and be buried here to be the battle credits of us two. This is a glorious death for you." Merman Giant's style of speaking was particularly weird. It seemed to be archaic, and it also seemed that he suddenly began to speak in a voice after not speaking for a long time. The Centaur King breathed in large mouthfuls of air, and his blood quickly surged and circulated, desperately eliminating the fatigue and decadence in his body. However, waving the giant spear again and again brought a huge burden to his body, making it increasingly difficult for him to recover. "No... How can I fall here!! How can I!!??" The Centaur King finally made up his mind, preparing to use the Blood Ignition Secret Spell to make the final crazy move. "I'll help you!" At this moment, the black giant, who had been watching from the side, also jumped into the battlefield. His right fist suddenly expanded in the air and smashed at the Centaur King with a huge shock. Whoosh! Whoosh! A large number of arm-thick black metal arrows accurately and steadily shot towards the Centaur King with a strange and distorted halo. His huge body was a huge target at this moment. At this moment, even if he wanted to use the Blood Ignition Secret Spell first, it would be too late. The black giant, Merman Giant, and the giant arrows that shot out from all directions all gathered together at this moment. The Centaur King's secret spell required a moment for his body to adapt. But now, he didn't even have this instant of time. "No!!" He opened his eyes wide and could only watch as the black giant's huge fist descended from above. At this time, Merman Giant used all of the strength to block his spear, making it impossible for him to take action to deal with this attack. "Will die!" "I will die!" At this moment, everything seemed to slow down. The arrows that flew over. The fist of the Black Giant King. Merman Giant's trident. And the circles of translucent secret spells around him. Those were Giant King's subordinates' spells to restrain him. Time seemed to have stopped. The Centaur King was unable to move. Except his mind, his body was unable to move. Everything was like an insect frozen in amber. "Am I going to die?" He looked at this strange scene in horror, unwillingness, and anger. This was the first time he had seen such a scene in his life. He had heard that when people were about to die, they would encounter all kinds of incredible things. Perhaps this was the case right now, but what puzzled him was that he seemed to be able to see the fear in the eyes of the black giant other than himself. There was also a twisted and puzzled expression on Merman Giant's face. "Frost Freezing Sword." "Did you see that? "This is one of the most profound mysteries of my swordsmanship. It is known as the freezing sword intent that can destroy everything in an instant." "The so-called sword intent means before the sword is unsheathed, it can make people feel the threat of sharp blades. And my sword intent is already able to force living beings to fall into freeze and instant destruction according to my will." "When a living creature thinks that he is dead, he will wither." Chapter 450 Chasing 2 The Centaur King looked towards the source of the voice, and his pupils suddenly contracted. He saw a red-haired woman standing quietly behind the Merman Giant King and the Black Giant King. She leaned against the palace pillar and watched them quietly. There was no weapon in her hand, and her palm seemed to be holding something. There was clearly nothing in her hand, but it gave people a feeling that she was holding a sharp sword at this time. "Just by sensing my intent, you will feel fear and tremble. This is sword intent." The Centaur King stared at the red-haired woman, watching her slowly raise her hand, gently move forward, and slash downwards. Then, he saw a bloody wound appear on the right shoulder of the Black Giant King. Hiss!! A large amount of blood splashed out and fell to the ground. "So, it is not that time and space have stopped. Rather, it is that we have stopped..." The Black Giant King fell to his knees with a thud, his face filled with fear. "Because you are too weak." The red-haired woman said lightly. Bang! Suddenly, the palace doors were pushed open. A tall and sturdy figure clad in heavy white armor strode into the door, not even looking at the two Giant Kings and the Centaur King. Instead, he passed through them and walked straight to the Throne of Giants in the highest place. He turned around and sat down. His figure clearly didn't match the large Throne of Giants, but at this moment, this figure sitting on top of it gave off an indescribable feeling of suppression and pressure. "I will only give you one chance." "Submit or die." The figure on the throne said calmly. "This palace is built on the peak of the Sakoraymond Mountain Range, the highest point of this Evil Spirit World. It is surrounded by ice and snow. The position is very good. It just so happens that we will take it over for use." The red-haired woman laughed. "What's the point of keeping these two pieces of trash? There's no point in keeping them alive. It's better to kill them all." When the Merman Giant and the Black Giant heard this, they immediately moved their bodies frantically, trying to break free from the weird freezing force. "No... Impossible... !!You want me to submit!??! Don't insult me!! I am the Giant King Boing Hanra!!" The muscles all over the Black Giant's body swelled rapidly as he roared madly. Countless threads, like black smoke, began to grow on his black fists. All the threads wrapped around his fists and quickly put a layer of black metal armor on them. "Ah!" He actually broke free from the blockade of Tiangong Xia's sword intent with one punch and turned around to smash heavily at Tiangong Xia behind him. The huge fist shot out like a missile, and then it stopped in front of Tiangong Xia's face, less than half a meter away. Hu!! A strong gust of wind blew Tiangong Xia's hair back, but the Black Giant's fist could not move an inch closer. "Very good. Now you have proven that you are not trash." A hint of admiration appeared in Tiangong Xia's eyes. "Someone who can break free from my sword intent's seal is definitely not an ordinary person! I admit your strength and bravery." The Black Giant opened his mouth and roared, but he could not make any sound. In this distance, he was even deprived of the right to roar. "Do you feel it?" The corners of Tiangong Xia's mouth curled into a sinister smile. "This is my sword domain, Silent Sound." She stretched out her slender index finger and gently tapped on the Black Giant's forehead. "Your blood." "Is too noisy." Zi... Zi... As her finger pointed, the speed of the blood flowing in the Black Giant's body began to slow down rapidly. Then, it became slower and slower. In less than a few seconds, his blood was forced into a state of stagnation from boiling. "Do you know what never makes a sound?" Tiangong Xia stretched her palms and gently stroked the face of the Black Giant. "Only death will make no sound." "Enough, Tiangong Xia." A cold male voice finally came from the throne. Tiangong Xia smiled and took a step back. "I was just joking with him. After all, he was the one who tore off one of the Elf Sis' arms. I just wanted to teach him a little lesson." "The Elf Queen's arm can be reconnected. Don't worry about it." Lin Sheng, who was sitting above, said calmly. "Alright, I'll follow your orders, Saint Emperor." Tiangong Xia smiled and retreated again. The oppressive and heavy pressure around her slowly dissipated as she retreated. The stagnant sounds returned to the surroundings. The Black Giant fell to the ground. Although it only took a little bit of time, it still caused the Black Giant to completely lose his combat strength. The blood in his entire body was forcefully frozen, the result of which was that many of the skills in his body suffered indescribable negative effects. Lin Sheng sat on the Throne of Giants and looked down. The two Giant Kings froze on the spot after they were intimidated by Tiangong Xia, their bodies stiff. There was also a group of other people who were shocked, too. Those who were able to enter this place from outside were all living beings and evil spirits that were strong enough in terms of vitality and strength. This was also why Lin Sheng intended to give the Giant Two Kings a chance. He needed more troops and powerful beings to conquer more Evil Spirit Realms. "Big brother!" Seeing the Black Giant in a desperate situation, the Merman Giant immediately fell into a state of worry and rage. However, his big brother being able to break free from the sword intent did not mean that he could make it, too. The Merman Giant struggled frantically, trying to break free of the invisible restraints around him. However, his strength was much weaker than his big brother's. If we said that the strength of the Black Giant was equivalent to the strength of envoys of the three great secret realms, who reached the pinnacle in terms of strength. He, the Merman Giant, would only be equivalent to an ordinary folk envoy. Most of the folk envoys studied and practiced on their own, and they were completely incomparable to the envoys of secret realms who received systematic education. Regardless of power or natural force field. The Merman Giant belonged to this level. This was the worst level among the list of envoys. If not for the fact that his elder brother wasn't bad, Lin Sheng wouldn't have bothered to recruit this guy who was weak both in strength and ability. The Merman Giant struggled and roared in pain, causing this hall to gradually sink into a tragic state. "Tiangong Xia, untie him." Lin Sheng ordered coldly. Swoosh. The heavy pressure that enveloped the Giant King suddenly became lighter. The two giants trembled at first, then they jumped up at the same time and rushed toward the palace gate like lightning. The Black Giant threw a punch in Lin Sheng's direction as he was still in the air. The strength of his fist was extremely heavy. When he punched out, the air wailed and screamed. The fist stirred up a large whirl like a ball of water, which smashed towards Lin Sheng. This ball of whirl was a shockwave created purely by his strength. On the surface, it seemed to be a natural shockwave caused by the fist. But in fact, this was a strike that cost all of the Black Giant's power from his cultivation. If one mistook the whirl as an ordinary aftershock, he would surely be killed. Lin Sheng watched the shockwave whirl and fly towards him. He stopped Tiangong Xia, who was about to block it, but stretched out his left hand in front of him. The raised palm was placed right in front of the shockwave whirl. Chapter 461 Chasing 3 Puff! A light sound rang out. The shockwave whirl was forcibly compressed and flattened, trying to break through Lin Sheng's palm. However, that palm was not even one tenth of the whirl's size, yet it was firmly blocking the whirl in midair. Soon, the invisible shockwave whirl had nowhere to be transmitted and was forcibly obliterated in Lin Sheng's left palm. This ball of whirl was casually wiped out by Lin Sheng like a real shockwave. Looking back at this scene, the Black Giant's heart turned cold. This was yet another top-notch powerful being with bottomless strength. When he saw the scene just now, even he began to wonder if the punch he had just thrown was really just a shockwave. If not for the fact that he had lost more than half of the vibrating energy in his body, which meant that the punch just now was indeed effective. He would have doubted his life now. "How... How is this possible!?" The Merman Giant also saw this scene, and he wondered whether his brother had forgotten to use magic power. During this delay, the Centaur King, who had come back to his senses, stood at the entrance of the hall, blocking the way for the two to leave. At this time, in Tiangong Xia's Sword Domain, apart from the force of her side in this palace, the two Giant Kings were the only ones who were free from the restrictions of moving around. As for the rest of the warriors and Warlocks under the Giant Kings, they were still standing in their original positions like amber, not moving at all. "Go back!" The two Giant Kings were blocked by a spear. The Centaur King was pleased this time. Just a second ago, he was like a dying dog, ready to struggle and fight to his death. At this moment, his lord and Tiangong Xia arrived, and the situation instantly reversed. The dying dog just now instantly turned into a powerful being and blocked the entrance, staring down at the two battered and exhausted Giant Kings. "Arrogant? Weren't you guys very arrogant just now? Did you say you were going to kill me? Huh??" At this time, the Centaur King was full of pleasure. At this time, he felt how high-spirited it was to have a big shot as his backer. Especially when he was following a particularly reliable big shot, he saw that the opponent who beat him up like a dying dog just now was about to be beaten like a dying dog by him in the blink of an eye. This pleasant feeling was indescribable! The Centaur King ruthlessly punched the Black Giant King on his right cheek. With a loud bang, the Black Giant King was sent high into the air, tumbling back and falling in the middle of the hall. He happened to land on the ground in front of Lin Sheng. Looking at the Black Giant King who could not even make the right posture to resist, the Centaur King only felt a wave of pleasure rushing straight from his tailbone to his back, and then moving along his spine  all the way up to the back of his head. He was like on cloud nine. "It feels so fucking good!" The Centaur King laughed. At this moment, his loyalty to the Saint Emperor was rising rapidly. He was laughing happily, but on the other hand, the two Giant Kings were so sad that they were about to vomit blood. The Centaur King, who had just been defeated by them, actually showed off in front of them in the blink of an eye, which was like a slap in the face. Just looking at the Centaur King's ugly and smug face, the two Giant Kings felt like the rage in their hearts was about to explode. Just by looking at his face, they had the urge to beat the Centaur King to death, not to mention the great reverse at this moment. "Aren't you going to submit? You guys are stubborn." The Centaur King sneered. "But it doesn't matter. I, Centaur, do like stubborn guys. Haha!" He put away his spear with a sinister smile and rubbed his hands together as he walked towards the two Giant Kings. Centaur... What did the Centaur King learn from you? Lin Sheng stared at Tiangong Xia speechlessly. When he wasn't around, he relied on Tiangong Xia to control the overall situation. The Centaur King only followed people stronger than himself, so he respected Tiangong Xia the most. Originally, Lin Sheng had asked Tiangong Xia to teach some general knowledge in real life to the commanders. It could be considered as teaching them some general knowledge. However, judging from the scene now, the effect... Looking at the two Giant Kings struggling on the ground like frightened girls trying to stay away from the Centaur King who was approaching. Lin Sheng had the urge to cover his forehead. What was this scene like? He was here to recruit two envoys, not to watch a live show that should be banned from underage children. "Do you surrender or not?" The Centaur King's wretched and smug laughter came from the hall. "You'd better kill me! I will never surrender even if I die!!... No!! No... I surrender! I surrender!!!" The Black Giant King hugged his brother in pain as he frantically retreated. If he didn't surrender now, he and his brother would probably be stripped naked by the Centaur King. There were so many subordinates watching, as well as many of their own children. If the Centaur King stripped him naked and hung him up to whip his dick, it would be a great humiliation! Even if he died, he would be remembered for ten thousand years! You have to admit that the Centaur King's action was effective. Looking at the two Giant Kings staring at the Centaur King, who wanted to kill him with their eyes. Lin Sheng couldn't help but think maybe he should let the Centaur King try the torture interrogation. Perhaps, compared to fighting, punishment was the best job for him. The two tough guys, in order to maintain their dignity, finally submitted to Lin Sheng under the humiliation of the Centaur King. They joined the Evil Spirit King army and became Lin Sheng's two great generals. The power under the Evil Spirit King increased again and became stronger. After subduing the Giant Kings, Lin Sheng finally found the third fragment in the palace of the Giant King. The fragment lay quietly in the form of a crystal ball in the depths of the Treasury of Giants. It had been thousands of years. If Lin Sheng hadn't arrived, perhaps the Giant Kings would never have understood that this crystal ball in the treasury was such an important fragment. This was because there were at least a hundred spheres that were exactly the same as this crystal ball in the treasury. Moreover, these crystal balls were all identical in appearance. Even the patterns and texture were exactly the same. Only the first fragment that Lin Sheng held could sense the fluctuations of this fragment and find which crystal ball it was in. After Lin Sheng entered the treasury, he quickly selected a large pile of various treasures. He did not select this crystal ball alone, but hid it in a pile of various treasures and took them out. Gold, crystals, gems, silver, all kinds of rare treasures, all kinds of artifacts with strange abilities. The Giant King's treasure greatly enriched the personal treasury of Lin Sheng, who was also the Evil Spirit King and the Saint Emperor. And just as he found the third fragment in the Evil Spirit Realm and was ready to merge it at any time to grasp the power of Evil Wheel. In real life. Farrudo, who possessed the body of Mi Yue, an existence above the rank of envoys, called the Demon Speech Officer of the Underworld, finally stepped on the land of Redwon that belonged to the Tower of Heaven. And at the same time. In every corner of the world, all the people holding Destiny Artifacts heard the guidance of the Great Sage from the Great Star Pool. They were guided to a small city called De Sheer to gather all the power of the artifacts to take down Farrudo, the Demon Speech Officer of the Underworld... Chapter 462 Power 1 At the western border, in a small wooden house of an abandoned manor. Sunlight passed through the faint black fog and shone on the ground, forming many twisted and strange lines. The wooden door opened with a creak. Adolf walked out of the room with a haggard expression and raised his head to look at the sky. "Has the corruption of the Dust World reached such a serious level?" He sighed. Although the corruption of the Dust World and the Dark Tide was getting more and more serious, these did not have any effect on the wielders of Destiny Artifacts like them. Their power was enough to shield the dust and black fog around them. After learning that sooner or later he would be found by the terrifying enemies of the Dust World since he possessed Destiny Artifacts. Adolf thought about it for a long time, and finally thought of a clumsy lie and decisively left Shumington where he was born. He left his teacher, Lin Sheng, who had treated him with great kindness, and left so many companions and elders who got along well with each other in the temple. After learning that the enemy was strong enough to make him tremble, Adolf knew that he could only travel alone in the future. He couldn't involve the others. That was too dangerous for the others. Adolf reached out his hand and took out a piece of paper that he had just received. The thin words on it clearly recorded the evil deeds of the Demon Speech Officer of the Underworld, Farrudo—how he slaughtered the envoys, how he froze tens of thousands of people and sank them to the bottom of the sea. "By gathering everyone's power, one can summon the strongest power and reshape everything? Destiny Artifact... What exactly is it..." Adolf sighed in his heart. He put away the letter, put on a wide-brimmed hat, lowered the brim of his hat, and quickly walked away. This trip, whether it would lead to death or not, had to come to an end. If he succeeded, everything would return to its original appearance. If he failed, the worst result would be that he died outside. He would not implicate his family and friends. This was the realization that belonged to him, Adolf. Lin Sheng had never thought that he would reach this point. Sitting in the rough stone hall of the Evil Spirit Palace, a cup of tea was placed on the table in front of him, and the hot tea was constantly emitting faint, white steam. The stone palace was not big, only the size of a small basketball court. There were round entrances to get in and out of the palace, and there were some armor and weapons from the treasury of the Giant King placed on both sides. There was a huge crystal chandelier filled with candles hanging on top of his head. A red carpet was laid on the ground, and in the center of it stood a tall statue of him riding the war horse, Blood Demon. Lin Sheng gently stroked the crystal ball. The surface of the ball was smooth and cold, and there seemed to be a silver nebula slowly rotating and shining inside it. The entire ball was silver-blue in color, and the base was made of an unknown light red wood that emitted a fresh fragrance. "The evil energy has basically reached the Suppression Level. It isn't easy to advance further. My purpose is to use the evil energy to increase the holy power and stimulate the holy power. But in fact, I have already stepped into the level of envoys. The effects of the evil energy aren't that great." Lin Sheng thought about the power system he currently possessed. He had mastered a lot of power, but it was mixed and impure. "Evil energy, dragon blood strange ability, holy power, soul power. Now, they hindered me a little bit from improving. If I want to increase the quality and purity of my energy, I must make a choice." Lin Sheng knew well that his body was actually a huge compression machine. Only a single energy with a pure concentration would be able to be compressed faster and reach a higher grade. Ever since he broke through the level of envoys with the help of holy power, he began to feel that his cultivation level was improving more and more slowly. It would take a long time for the evil energy to break through the Suppression Level. He had just used his holy power to make a breakthrough, which had yet to stabilize. Dragon blood strange ability was fixed to be this strong. This depended on the opportunity and purity of his bloodline. His current dragon blood bloodline ratio had reached a rather saturated level. If he wanted to continue improving, he could only increase the purity of his bloodline. However, purity was not something that could be easily increased. This also required compression and purification. "I have too many kinds of power in my body, and there is no environment to purify. I must make a choice." Lin Sheng picked up the cup of hot tea and took a sip. The faint fragrance of the tea refreshed his mind, and he could not help but feel refreshed. "For me, the evil energy can be given up first. I don't have any talent for evil energy. Learning it is just to get a better understanding of other things." He first gave up the evil energy. "Second, the dragon blood strange ability, this depends on the bloodline. Originally, I only used it to increase the strength of my body to preserve more holy power. Right now, I have already broken through the level of envoys. In theory, I can continuously communicate with the Sea Gate and use the chaotic soul power of the Spirit Ultra Sea to turn it into pure holy power." "So, I can put this aside for now." "Third, Chaos Soul Power... This is the power I obtained after accidentally communicating with the Spirit Ultra Sea. Although it is infinite, without the system, it is not easy to advance. Besides, there is no clearer direction." Lin Sheng muttered to himself. "I won't put this down for the time being. After all, the essence of holy power is the soul. I should regard soul as the core and continuously strengthen and purify it." Soul was the core of everything. Lin Sheng thought about this and quickly figured out what the core was. "Soul power is my foundation. When I have soul power, holy power and evil energy are just derivative products." He drank the tea up and stood up. Picking up the crystal ball, Lin Sheng slowly walked into the inner hall. This Evil Spirit Palace was built by all the evil spirits and the craftsmen of the Elf Empire ordered by Dejar, the Devil Hand and the Elf Queen. At first, it was built by the Devil Hand Race. Later, in order to flatter Lin Sheng, the higher-ups of the Elf Empire, except the Elf Queen, took turns to take care of people and things around him. This increasingly gorgeous and exquisite inner palace was one of them. That was why power was always fascinating. "Seize power and everything else will come." This sentence flashed through Lin Sheng's mind. He walked to the plaque in the inner hall, looked up at it, which read Yin Yang Hall, and then strode in. The ones guarding the inner hall were two strong, half-human and half-worm giant evil spirit generals. The upper half of them was a human body while the lower half was a huge worm body, like a centaur. Dozens of pairs of black legs supported them to stand on the ground as steady as Mount Tai. When these powerful warriors with black shiny shells saw Lin Sheng, they all knelt down on one knee and saluted him silently. Lin Sheng ignored them. Instead, he looked straight into the middle of the inner hall, at the strange giant blade that was inserted into the ground. After not seeing it for a long time, this Evil Wheel had undergone some unknown change. The giant blade had shrunk a lot, and its shape had become much thinner. "I have three fragments... Now, let me see what kind of changes will happen after mixing the three fragments..." Lin Sheng stretched out his hand and lightly grasped the handle of the giant blade. Then, with his other hand, he gently pressed the crystal ball on it. Hiss... A miraculous thing happened. Like soft liquid, the crystal ball floated, got gently attracted to the blade and merged with the surface of it. In just a few seconds, the crystal ball completely disappeared from Lin Sheng's hand. Chapter 463 Power 2 Lin Sheng calmly held the giant blade and quickly absorbed the holy power he left on it for safeguard. In order to prevent other creatures from touching this treasure, he condensed his holy power in advance and attached it to the surface of this giant blade, so that it could better isolate aura and fluctuations. At the same time, the highly concentrated holy power could also be used to protect treasures. If anyone wanted to get close to the giant blade, they would be discovered by Lin Sheng and he would follow them. Unless the other party could expel the highly concentrated holy power he had left on it. But if such an opponent appeared, there would be no need for him to come in and steal things. Wouldn't it be easier to directly fight all the way to the inside and snatch it away? Lin Sheng dispersed the holy power attached to the surface and quietly watched the Evil Wheel which came into being after three fragments merged into one. Patter. Suddenly, a crisp sound rang out. The giant blade in his hand suddenly broke and fell to the ground, beginning to melt. It was like an ice cream that was dissolved by sunlight, but the process of dissolving was instantly accelerated by countless times. Before Lin Sheng could even react, he saw the giant blade in his hand break and fall to the ground, which silently dissolved into a pool of black viscous liquid. In a daze, he seemed to hear the faint buzzing of insects, as well as the rustling of raindrops hitting the leaves. The sound quickly turned into the sound of waves crashing against the rocks. It was as if there were people whispering in his ears as well as countless images were flashing before his eyes. Large amounts of knowledge and information turned into black smoke, rising from the black viscous liquid beneath Lin Sheng's feet. He was entirely enveloped by the black smoke that contained countless sounds, knowledge and information. Time seemed to slow down at this moment. Countless knowledge about the evil spirit ability quickly flooded into Lin Sheng's brain. This was a fantastic feeling. It wasn't simply stuffing a huge amount of knowledge into Lin Sheng's brain but through putting up the scene, which was a vaguer but more complete method that allowed him to understand what the root of the evil spirit ability was. "Evil Wh..." A hazy female voice whispered in Lin Sheng's ear. "Evil Wh..." "Evil Wh..." The voice kept repeating. It was as if she was hypnotizing him, causing Lin Sheng to feel like he was falling into deep sleep. He slowly closed his eyes. In the darkness in front of him, an enormous gray wheel slowly emerged from the darkness. The giant wheel was like a huge gear, with four slots on the edges. Soon, many embedded objects began to appear. One embedded object was a black crystal pillar. One embedded object was a piece of white bone. One was a crystal ball. And the last one was empty. Click... The giant wheel slowly rotated, but because there was one empty slot, it let out a cracking sound as if it could not bear the burden. It was as if the giant wheel could not revolve smoothly due to the lack of an embedded object. Lin Sheng stared at this giant wheel and saw that there were countless exquisite patterns of flowers, plants, insects, fish, mountains and rivers on the edge of it. There were countless insect-like characters crawling around on the surface. This giant wheel was more like a circular mysterious treasure than a wheel. He opened his mouth and wanted to speak. But before he came back to his senses, a small mouth suddenly opened at the center of the giant wheel. Three streams of water that looked like dark red blood silently flowed out. With a whoosh, the blood water quickly flew closer, revolving around Lin Sheng, and then drilled into his chest. A total of three streams of blood water left three different patterns on Lin Sheng's chest. The three patterns formed a huge, complicated wheel. Lin Sheng opened his eyes and removed his armor. He tore off his clothes and looked down at his chest. Three blood red marks appeared on his chest as expected. When the three marks were combined together, they were like a jigsaw puzzle with one last piece missing. After it was completely pieced together, it was a red wheel that would cover his whole chest. At the center of the wheel was a pattern that looked like an eye. The pattern seemed to be alive as it continuously emitted a faint gray halo in all directions. In the halo, countless symbols and patterns could be seen flowing. Lin Sheng looked at his hand. The giant blade was no longer there, and the pool of black liquid was no longer under his feet. The so-called Evil Wheel seemed to have completely run over to him. He closed his eyes and felt the large amount of information that had just entered his brain. "So this is the so-called Evil Wheel. I would rather call it the Forbidden Book than call it the Evil Wheel." The Evil Wheel was jointly forged by eighty-eight super evil spirits that were strongest in the Evil Spirit Realm. Evil spirits at that time did not have innate abilities. The evil spirits only had a special body structure, and there were not many other differences. But ever since the super evil spirits forged this treasure, they used this treasure to forcibly raise the evil spirits to become a race with natural abilities through a mysterious and special method. Rather than calling this treasure a treasure, it was more accurate to say it was the essence that the evil spirits had once used to break through the limits of their race and improve their bloodline. It was a great creation forged by the most powerful evil spirits in the past in order to break through the limits of their bloodline and race. Correspondingly, mastering the Evil Wheel did not mean one completely understood how to release all the evil spirit abilities. Instead, he would automatically receive the protection of eighty-eight super evil spirits. "Eighty-eight types of additional protection..." Lin Sheng opened his eyes wide, extended his hand, and lightly clenched it. He could feel a strange power, like a force field, surrounding his body. There were dozens of different powers with various aura fluctuations flowing in it. These powers were like giant snakes lurking in his shadow, only showing their claws when needed. "Eighty-eight types of protection, eighty-eight types of abilities. All of them can be classified into four categories." Lin Sheng began to classify them according to the information in his brain. "First, the Wheel of Existence to strengthen oneself." "Second, the Wheel of Tribulation to weaken the opponent." "Third, the Wheel of Wandering that enables one to walk freely." "Fourth..." Lin Sheng suddenly frowned. "The fourth one is empty... As I've anticipated, I still need the final fragment to obtain the final complete power." "There are eighty-eight types of protection. I have already obtained the first three categories, a total of over seventy types. Only a few are not here. In this light, these missing protections are very likely to be the most important ones." Lin Sheng understood. He looked around and did not immediately try to increase the power of protection here. Instead, he quickly walked out of the inner hall, walked past the bowing evil spirits and got out of the Evil Spirit Palace. He then stepped into the Evil Spirit Gate from which he had obtained the black crystal pillar. Hiss... As the world spun, Lin Sheng had just recovered from the teleportation when he saw a pale white flame surging towards him. Before he could even react, a layer of gray light naturally rose from his body, firmly blocking the flame. Lin Sheng felt a little hot in his chest. He looked down at the collar that was pulled open. The red circular pattern on his chest became even clearer and the color red was darker. Chapter 464 Power 3 "Is this because of the help of Wheel of Existence?" Lin Sheng was deep in thought. Just like that, he walked forward against the flames. This terrifying Freezing Earth Fire, which was equivalent to the strength of Five Wings, could not even touch his skin. He didn't use any of his power such as evil energy, holy power, or dragon blood abilities. It was the newly obtained defensive power that was automatically protecting him. In the thick white flame pillar, Lin Sheng slowly descended from the sky. "There was a slight deviation in the teleportation just now. It actually directly teleported me into the flame." He stepped out of the fire pillar, looked around, and took a step. He leaped up easily and flew into the distance. After flying a few kilometers in one direction, Lin Sheng stopped at the top of a slightly raised hill and quietly looked down at the vast terrain around him. The flat ground was covered in streams of greyish-white Earth Fire. This space was like a heavily wounded soldier who was on the verge of death after the great war, still struggling to survive. "Let me test it here." Lin Sheng wanted to try out the power of protection. He stretched out his hand and pointed his index finger towards a pillar of Earth Fire that was shooting out in the distance. Then, he tried to activate the power of the Wheel of Tribulation. Swoosh! An invisible fluctuation shot out from Lin Sheng's index finger and accurately landed on the surface of the pillar of Earth Fire. Without a sound. The pillar of Earth Fire first rapidly became transparent. Then, after a few seconds, the color became lighter and lighter, and finally completely disappeared from its original place, as if it had never appeared. Lin Sheng put down his finger and waited quietly. In the end, after waiting for a long time, he did not see Earth Fire shoot again. "So, the Wheel of Tribulation in the protection is to completely erase the existence of the opponent?" Lin Sheng was deep in thought. The divine artifacts forged by evil spirit's top beings naturally contained their ideas of what kind of method was the ultimate goal to weaken the enemy. In the world of evil spirit, the ultimate evil spirit believed that the answer was to completely get rid of the opponent's soul. "So the power of the Wheel of Tribulation is that it can gather dozens of different abilities to completely erase the opponent?" Lin Sheng understood. "Then, it's the Wheel of Existence that strengthens oneself." He looked down at the blood wheel pattern on his chest again. Then, he stretched out his hands again. According to the information and knowledge in his memory, he gently raised a finger in front of him and made a hand seal that looked like a circular wheel. "Open!" He suddenly opened his eyes, and a large amount of blood-red light gushed out from his chest, enveloping his entire body. Swoosh!!! A blood-colored light, which was five- to six-meter thick, shot into the sky, stirring up the clouds above. A large amount of grayish-white clouds were dyed red by the blood light, and they gave off bursts of rumbling thunder. Soon, the blinding red light turned into a huge flame on the ground. In the flames, a clear figure slowly opened his arms. "For evil spirit, what kind of power is the best way to strengthen himself?" "I didn't expect that the answer would be this." Under the blood-colored light, Lin Sheng's face and figure could no longer be seen. There was only a pair of light golden eyes that gave out a golden light like a whirl. "Too strong... I have... Even I am afraid of myself..." "I am afraid that I will destroy everything by accident." Lin Sheng raised his eyes to look into the distance. For the time being, he was intoxicated by this infinitely powerful special state. With this kind of power, no one could stop him from doing anything. No one! In real life, in Tower of Heaven in Redwon. "Hahahahaha!!" In the grayish-white sky, Farrudo wore a black robe, and his white hair flew wildly in the wind. He laughed wildly and released circles of gray energy shockwaves from his body. Huge shockwaves spread out in all directions, destroying everything in the surroundings. Evil spirits from the Tower of Heaven below formed an army, firing one round after another. But the attacks were as if they were separated by a thick quilt, and they did not even make it to touch Farrudo. The cannonballs and evil energy spells were like weak insects, constantly trying to break through the layer of gray shockwave. However, they were all in vain. They would only turn back powerlessly. "Do you feel despair?" Farrudo laughed. "I am so disappointed... A thousand years ago, humans were not so weak as you are now. At that time, there were lots of heroes and powerful beings. Even Officers of the Underworld, like me, need to be careful." "But now? Look at you?" There was boredom in Farrudo's deep eyes. "How contradictory... I hope that you can be stronger to let me enjoy the battle, but I don't want you to be so strong that my energy will be wasted. Which will cost me too much. "Farrudo, must you wipe out the people of the Tower of Heaven?" Among the many evil spirits on the ground, a tall and sturdy old man with white hair and beard and an eagle on his shoulder was staring coldly at the Demon Speech Officer of the Underworld in the sky. "You are the officer of the Underworld in charge of spells. But you come to the earth instead of serving the Lord of the Underworld. Aren't you afraid that the Underworld will be in chaos?" The old man's tone was calm, but his words showed that he knew the Underworld like the back of his hand. "Oh?" Farrudo was slightly surprised. "It seems that there are still people on the earth who remember me, Farrudo." He looked down at the old man. This was the first time he had looked at a human so seriously after leaving Bishajia Island. "A mere human actually knows about the situation of the great Underworld. It seems that my view of the Tower of Heaven has to be updated." He laughed. "So what if you destroy this land? We will hide in the secret realm and come out again in a few decades. We just need to restart from scratch. But what about you? Farrudo, Demon Speech Officer of the Underworld who is absent without leave. When you return, what kind of price will you have to pay to survive this calamity?" The old man said with a cold face, as if the extinction of most of the human beings was not a big deal in his eyes. "You are really cruel... The number of people that the secret realm could accommodate, compared with that of people outside, was like a drop in the ocean. And you actually dare to give up everything with a single word?" Farrudo was also somewhat surprised by the other party's decisiveness. "Isn't this what Mi Yue wanted?" The end of the old era, and the beginning of the new era." The old man said coldly. Beside him, other evil spirits of the Tower of Heaven all had angry looks in their eyes and flushed faces. Obviously, many of them had thought of this terrifying future. At this time, when they looked at Farrudo, they all wanted to rush up and fight him to the death. After all, most of evil spirits' friends and relatives were living in real life. The secret realm could not accommodate so many people. Therefore, destroying reality was equivalent to having them lose their descendants and all their loved ones. No one could accept such a result. "Is that so?" Farrudo raised his eyebrows. "Since that's the case, why don't you show me how many of you are willing to hide in the secret realm?" He looked meaningfully at the evil spirits behind the old man. "Since words don't work, then give it a try. Let me see how much you are willing to pay to destroy the Tower of Heaven!!" The old man's eyes turned cold, and a thick ice cane appeared in his hand. "Form up!!" He poked his cane. In an instant, a huge silvery-white array lit up on the ground, placing Farrudo, who was in the sky, in the middle. Chapter 465 The Last Fragment - Part 1 Amidst melodious harp music, a bard clad in an androgynous robe, resembling a butterfly, delicately strummed a ballad belonging to the style of the Fairy Empire. The mellifluous androgynous voice matched the beauty, and the soothing and gentle tone garnered approving nods from all the commanders present. The ballad had been composed by ancient nobles of the Fairy Empire. The song was evocative, the melody enchanting, and the verses resplendent and philosophical. "However, isn't it somewhat embarrassing to praise me in my presence?" Lin Sheng said, seated on the Evil Spirit King's throne, glancing at the Centaur King and the Elf Queen to his right. The Centaur King was shaking his head with an intoxicated expression, seemingly immersed in the song. The Elf Queen, on the other hand, lowered her head to drink her wine, her demeanor unchanged. Yet, one of her eyes dominated her entire visage, making it impossible to discern any expression on her face. In this grand hall where where power held sway, Dejar, the Devil Hand, occupied the lower end. Though this roused indignation among the evil spirits of the Devil Hand Clan, the reality was that his power was too feeble. The two Giant Kings had recently arrived and were seated at the far end of the table, their faces emotionless, partaking in wine and meat in silence. Thud. Thud. Thud. Suddenly, heavy footsteps resounded from outside the door. "Sin Dragon Mother of The Dragon Tomb has arrived!" Only then did the herald's voice reverberate. "The Sin Dragon Mother?" The commanders present were all slightly taken aback. They were aware of the Dragon Tomb's existence from Lin Sheng and Tiangong Xia, yet they remained ignorant of the details and had never encountered its formidable members. And now, the time had come to meet this unfamiliar newcomer. As the footsteps rapidly approached, a woman garbed in black with striking blonde hair and an enchanting figure entered the hall with a composed smile. Amid the harmonious singing, she positioned herself in the hall's center and offered a slight bow to Lin Sheng. "All-mighty Evil Spirit King, I, the Sin Dragon Mother, along with numerous Dragon Spirits from the Dragon Tomb, have come awaiting your orders." The Sin Dragon Mother's voice, thin and hoarse, carried a touch of allure. One could envision her past as a captivating beauty of irresistible charm. Were it not for the distinct features of an undead spirit on her countenance, the commanders present, much like the Centaur King and Giant Kings, would undoubtedly be vying for her affections. "I wish to marry her!" The Centaur King's gaze went vacant upon seeing the Sin Dragon Mother. He swallowed repeatedly, his blood surging throughout his body like boiling liquid. His eyes reddened swiftly, revealing an indefinable yearning and anticipation. "Very well." Lin Sheng couldn't help but chuckle. "Assuming you don't mind her being ten times larger than you, she might well appreciate your advances." "That is, as long as you survive your wedding night without being crushed." "Eh." A sudden cold splash doused the Centaur King's fiery enthusiasm, the fervor in his eyes swiftly extinguished. He scratched his head sheepishly. Endowed with remarkable control over his blood and qi, he surpassed ordinary Envoys. If one saw his blood boiling, they would undoubtedly expect impulsive actions. Yet, it was an act, or that his mind has already been made. The Centaur King was certainly capable of channeling his potent qi and blood, boasting a naturally robust constitution. However, impulsive behavior was not his style. Thus, he promptly pulled away from the brink of temptation and returned to his composed demeanor. "Then let it be. We shall leave the privilege to enjoy her to someone of His Majesty's stature." "One should remain humble to those more powerful!" The Sin Dragon Mother was furious for being objectified and subjected to such lewd words. A fierce look flashed across her eyes as she stood in the hall. Dark energy coalesced and streaked towards the Centaur King. Pu! The Centaur King reacted promptly, stomping on the dark energy. "Impudent!!" "In the presence of His Majesty, you dare to incite violence within this hall?" "Do you hold any respect for His Majesty? Or is your Dragon Tomb plotting rebellion?" He rose from his seat, his voice booming with authority. The Sin Dragon Mother's cherry lips parted slightly, utterly astonished by the Centaur King's words. She hadn't expected such an airhead and impulsive individual to transition to sly and cunning so deftly. His speed in accusing her was truly remarkable. "I am merely returning the lack of respect you've shown to those stronger than you. As a weaker individual, humility should be your lesson!" The Sin Dragon Mother, an age-old fox with millennia of wisdom, countered swiftly. "Had His Majesty not been present, I would no doubt have turned you into fertilizer for the Dragon Tomb!" Her voice was frigid and eerie, exuding an aura of death. "Hehe, I can beat you even handicapped." The Centaur King showed no signs of fear. "You court death!" The Sin Dragon Mother seethed, her anger ignited, ready to strike. "Silence!" Tiangong Xia, seated beside them, interjected impatiently. "I can't hear the music! If you're determined to fight, go outside, don't disrupt my enjoyment!" As she spoke, the Sin Dragon Mother and the Centaur King were left with no option but to stifle their bickering and fall silent. Both were well aware of Tiangong Xia's power. Apart from the Venerable Evil Spirit King, none present could stand up to Tiangong Xia. "Very well, take your seats, Mother Sin." Lin Sheng interjected in a timely manner. "Musicians, withdraw." He turned his gaze to the fairy music officer by the stone pillar on the right. The officer promptly signaled the bards to cease, then they quickly exited. In no time, fairy attendants glided into the hall with emerald glimmers. They arranged chilled plates laden with fruits, wine, and tea upon the small table before the commanders. The stone doors of the hall closed gradually, the array's effect taking hold. Lin Sheng surveyed the experts gathered. On the left sat Tiangong Xia, the Elf Queen, and the Giant King siblings. To the right were the Centaur King, the Sin Dragon Mother, and Dejar, the Devil Hand. In the blink of an eye, he had subjugated five other Envoys as his subordinates. The Evil Spirit Palace's influence burgeoned at an inconceivable pace, rapidly expanding into an imposing entity. The commander held the rank of Envoy, while the Evil Spirit Marshal rank rested beneath it. Several other individuals of this rank existed in the Elf Queen's Fairy Kingdom, and a handful were under the Centaur King. The Dragon Spirits within the Dragon Tomb possessed Envoy level power, yet they were only subject to the Sin Dragon Mother's authority and not him. Being just beneath that of Envoy, the Evil Spirit Marshal rank represented the pinnacle at six wings. Those with such rank belonging to the Evil Spirit Palace totals to the double digits. The third echelon comprised the Evil Spirit General rank. Spirits of this level was numerous. The Evil Spirit Palace already had hundreds initially, Lin Sheng's experiments had elevated numerous more to this level. Furthermore, the Fairy Empire and the Centaur King also possess hundreds of subordinates of this caliber. This level was equivalent to a three-winged evil spirit. As for lower-tier evil spirits, they numbered in the tens of thousands. Presently, the Evil Spirit Palace is more than capable of rivaling the Three Great Secret Realms in the real world, all that was left was to see who was the victor. Yet, this wasn't enough. Lin Sheng desired far more. "I'm delighted that all of you could assemble punctually." Lin Sheng exclaimed, arms outstretched. "This is the Evil Spirit Palace, the preeminent bastion of the Evil Spirit World, the foundation for our unification." His voice emanated from afar, resonating like thunder both within and outside the hall. Audible to not just the assembled commanders, his words also reached the nearby evil spirit generals. "I've summoned you here to impart a path to even greater power," Lin Sheng proclaimed. Chapter 466 The Last Fragment 2 "A greater power?" The eyes of the Sin Dragon Mother flashed, and a strong sense of vigilance rose in her heart. She had lived for so many years, but she had never seen an idiot who gave away power for no reason. Was the Evil Spirit King an idiot? Of course not. She glanced at Tiangong Xia from the other side of her eye. There was no expression on the red-haired woman's face. There was only a look of boredom. Not only was the Sin Dragon Mother like this, the remaining people were even more restless. But the Centaur King didn't care about hidden traps. He had already decided to follow Lin Sheng without question, so if it was Lin Sheng who made the decision, he would definitely comply! "We're still too weak in His Majesty's eyes! Hahahaha! But that's dependent on who we're compared with." "However, since it is a benefit bestowed by His Majesty, I will be the first to accept it!" He laughed loudly and immediately expressed his loyalty. He had to support his boss's words. It would be very embarrassing if things turned silent. "I am looking forward to it." The Elf Queen replied softly. Her severed arm had already been attached back, and it looked like it had returned to its original state safe and sound.  "His Majesty's decision is our will." Dejar, the Devil Hand's flattery was even more direct. The Giant King brothers did not say a word and did not display any expression. They had just been defeated and their treasury plundered. It would be strange if they were in a good mood. Lin Sheng did not mind. "As a matter of fact, I find you guys a bit too weak." He stated calmly. "The times are changing." "Strength cannot stagnate, either." He stretched out his hand and slowly released a white ball of pure holy power from his palm. "Zap" The light ball came out of his palm and floated in the air a few centimeters away from his palm. It slowly floated up and down. "This power is called holy power." Lin Sheng explained. "The quality of the holy power is higher than soul power. It is higher than all the powers you have mastered." "If you don't believe me, you can try it yourself." Lin Sheng gently pinched the ball of light. The ball shattered and immediately shot out several holy power rays that accurately landed in front of the commanders. The rays turned back into a small ball of holy power and floated in front of the commanders. "You can use your own power to touch this holy sphere and see who is stronger." "If you are sure you want to master this new power, you can come to me later." "I will give you the Seed of Origin." Before the commanders could ask any questions, he continued, "That's all on this topic for now. Next, we will move on to the official topic." Lin Sheng stretched out his hand, and the Elf Queen at the side immediately condensed a blue ball of water and floated in front of Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng pointed at the ball of water, and it immediately spread out, turning into a huge transparent multi-faceted body several meters in diameter, displayed for all to see. The multi-faceted body was like a crystal, and a clear picture of a black desert slowly began to appear inside. In the picture, the desert connected to the sky and the ground, stretching to the end of the field of vision. Endless sand dunes, the strange purple sun in the sky, and the one-horned camels that struggled to walk on the sand dunes. This was a region where even the air was heated to the point of vaporization. "This is the Evil Spirit World that you are about to conquer." Lin Sheng introduced, "Generally speaking, a secret realm's classification as Evil Spirit World or other types depends on whether it can produce a pure spirit form like an evil spirit." He pointed to the one-horned camel in the painting. "Any place that can naturally evolve soul creatures will become one of the lower realms under the command of my Evil Spirit Palace." "The world in front of you is larger than average. As for whether it is the Evil Spirit World, you will have to personally inspect it." "Within three days, I want a complete evaluation of this secret realm. I need to know how long it will take to completely conquer this small world." "I will listen to your will." The commanders below bowed in response. They did not know why Lin Sheng wanted to conquer so many Evil Spirit Worlds, but since it was a request from His Majesty, they had to complete it. Lin Sheng did not mention the last fragment in the Secret Realm nor his main intent to find it. He did not intend to tell anyone about the Yin Transformation Evil Wheel. Only by keeping his true strength secret could he ensure his safety. Keeping his cards a mystery ensures others do not plot against him. When others were unsure of your strength and weakness, they naturally did not dare to act rashly. If they happened to target your strength, then they were simply courting death. Next, Lin Sheng asked about the development of the Evil Spirit Palace one by one. These were all managed by Dejar, the Devil Hand. He was equivalent to the general manager of the Evil Spirit Palace. Although he was weak, he represented Lin Sheng's will. As such, none of the people present dared to look down on him. Dejar, the Devil Hand went forward to report on the recent developments and changes. He also reported on the preliminary exploration of the Evil Spirit cave within the black desert. After learning that there were many humanoid races and cities living in this desert, all the commanders present immediately became interested. The gathering lasted for more than an hour before it ended. The commanders returned to their holdings and began to prepare and mobilize troops for the black desert conquest. Lin Sheng took advantage of his previous train of thought and returned to the Yin Yang Hall and began to sort out his current cards. To completely purify his body and improve the foundation for future training, he needed a perfect sealed environment without any contaminants. In this regard, the Yin Transformation Evil Wheel held the perfect solution with its Eighty-Eight Protections. Eighty-Eight Protections generally produced four major results together. But, Lin Sheng could use any of these Eighty-Eight Protections singly if he so wished. Although several main Protections were still unusable because of the lack of fragments, there were still many that he could use to achieve the same goal.= After dealing with the matters in the Evil Spirit World, Lin Sheng followed the portal and returned to Hengruikala. He had not come back for a long time, and he almost forgot the difference in the flow of time. Sometimes, he would be disoriented into thinking that many days had already passed. Prompting him to call his family in greeting. Only to find that he had just called the day before. In reality, Hengruikala was the same as ever. Under the cover of the Twilight Tower, it continued to operate in an orderly manner, like a giant precision instrument. Now, Hengruikala had formed a social system with the temple at the core, and the clergy as the main hierarchical ladder. Clergy gradually became a new profession. They trained in holy power and participated in various industries, using supernatural power to heal and help others. Because of the visual appeal of holy power, as well as the positive benefits of the Purification field, such as relieving fatigue, the Temple and the Clergy gained more social standing and became the main road to power. Justice and stature, but also kindness and the ability to heal others. This was most people's understanding of holy power. Chapter 467 The Last Fragment Lin Sheng calculated the time he had spent in the Evil Spirit World. He had been in the Evil Spirit World for more than a month, but in the outside world, less than a week had passed. He was somewhat disoriented with the date and time. He walked on the streets of the city. In the safe zone of the city, buildings that had been abandoned were once again bustling because of the influx of a large number of people. A lot of gasoline vehicles on the streets had been cleaned up, and they were replaced with cleaner electric cars. Most of the electric cars had been modified, making them sturdier and more compact. The area in the safe zone was limited. To accommodate more people and improve congested traffic, the workshops of Benen University introduced this new model. They were half the size of an ordinary vehicle and could fly at a low altitude for a short period of time, greatly relieving traffic pressure in the safe zone. Lin Sheng walked on the avenue and saw vehicles passing by on the ground and shuttling through the air between buildings. This marvel, a scene that fitted more into a future time period, was clearly presented in front of him at this time. "Hengruikala is coming along well. The upgrade of the Twilight Temple was halted earlier because of the Hand of the Underworld." "I should deal with them now." Lin Sheng walked leisurely from the research center and soon arrived at the temple branch. The holy power accumulated by the Twilight Temple was already very large. The Holy Power Pool had been overflowing for a long time. The scattered holy power even caused the air around the temple to faintly emit white light. Those were holy crystals. As long as they needed to use holy power in the temple, they would automatically transform back into pure holy power. Lin Sheng walked into the temple without alarming anyone and quietly came to the prayer hall. At this time, the prayer hall was empty, and the door was locked. Normally, no one was allowed to enter or leave this place unless it was prayer time. Lin Sheng walked to the prayer table and slowly closed his eyes. Hiss. In the darkness in front of him, a huge map of Hengruikala appeared. The map was like a sand table, and Lin Sheng gently turned it clockwise with his mind. Crack. Suddenly, there was a slight noise in the map. The sand table-shaped terrain slowly sank and then separated from the middle. The entire Hengruikala topographic map was divided into two, and a grayish-black stone pillar rose from the split mouth. There was a clear palm print on the black stone pillar. [Please complete biometric verification.] [Advancing to the next page requires biometric verification.] The gentle female voice sounded again. Lin Sheng walked forward, stretched out his hand, and gently pressed his right hand on the palm print of the stone pillar. [Biometrics confirmed.] [Welcome to the selection interface.] In an instant, a new tree diagram suddenly appeared in front of Lin Sheng. Starting from the words "Twilight Temple," it extended upwards, forming six different branches. [Available Divine Arts] 1: Temple of Hope. Can absorb the power of the wishes of living beings and create the Spirits of Void and Light. Spirits of Void and Light: Level 8 energy creature, good at long-distance control of spells and attacks.

Please note, only three individuals may hold the key to authorize the Light of Judgement. After releasing the Light of Judgement, all the holy power stored in the holy pool will be used. Please use it with caution. Required holy power: 1 million. Cannot be upgraded. 6: Holy Crystal Pool. Capacity can be upgraded to ten million.

Lin Sheng noticed that there were small words at the bottom of the screen. [These six divine arts are the final ones that may be selected. After the divine arts are upgraded, the Twilight Temple becomes fully constructed. This guiding program will self-destruct.] "So this is its final form?" Lin Sheng was a little disappointed. However, on second thought, the ritual array used in this temple was created by the masters of Black Feather City. They were not of a very high level. This level was probably the limit of what they could achieve and understand. He looked at the capacity of the Holy Power Pool. There was one million units of holy power inside. As such, he did not hesitate in selecting the Holy Crystal Pool. Zoom. There seemed to be something vibrating in the dark, and then it quickly ended. The total amount of holy power instantly dropped to zero, but then it quickly returned to around 200,000. "Was it the holy crystals that had been converted?" Lin Sheng guessed. Two hundred thousand holy power wasn't much, but it wasn't a small amount either. So, he placed all of it in the Ring of Protection and raised it to level two. After making the selection, all upgrades would be completed in the next few days. Lin Sheng left the operation space. After confirming that there were no problems with the temple headquarters of Hengruikala or West Wheel, he returned to the research center. He informed the little girl, Peach, of some things to take note of in the hall below before returning to the Evil Spirit Palace through the Evil Spirit Gate. Currently, they were at a critical juncture, about to find the last fragment. He had to monitor it constantly and go there in person when necessary. As soon as he stepped into the Evil Spirit Palace, the Evil Spirit Guards immediately sent him military intelligence. Dejar, the Devil Hand, quickly presented the emergency report. Lin Sheng stood in front of the Evil Spirit Gate, took the report, and rapidly scanned it. [A powerful opponent has appeared in the Black Desert. The vanguard army has been defeated, and the Centaur King has been severely injured.] "Hm? We just entered and already encountered a strong enemy?" Lin Sheng was a little surprised. The Centaur King wasn't weak; he was stronger than Dejar, the Devil Hand, and the Elf Queen. It was a surprise that he was heavily injured. "What's the situation now?" "Connect me with the Centaur King." He casually handed the military report to Dejar, the Devil Hand. "The Giant Kings and the Sin Dragon Mother have already gone to provide support." "They should be able to be back very soon." Dejar, the Devil Hand, replied. "Do you have any information about the opponent?" Lin Sheng asked again. "I do." Dejar handed the second piece of information to Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng took and scanned it. He suddenly looked surprised. "Interesting." "Interesting!" The corners of his mouth curled up, and he couldn't help but reveal an inexplicable smile. Dejar, the Devil Hand quickly added, "The person who defeated the Centaur King was a tall man with a transparent round gem embedded in his chest. "He called himself the Envoy of Lunar Hope and claimed to have received a prophecy to come and defeat foreign enemies." "After confirming the identity of the Centaur King and the Evil Spirit Army, he immediately launched an attack." "How did he defeat the Centaur King?" Lin Sheng had already roughly guessed the other party's identity and said indifferently. "The enemy is extremely strong, highly skilled in martial arts. Most importantly, his resistance is terrifyingly strong. Regardless of whether it is a soul attack or other elemental spells, they are all ineffective against him." "Moreover, even if someone were to behead him or remove his heart, it was still not enough to kill him." "In the blink of an eye, he would immediately recover." "The Centaur King was caught off guard and was heavily injured by a sneak attack." Lin Sheng nodded. "Have the Elf Queen, the Giant King brothers, and the Sin Dragon Mother bring their subordinates." "I want to capture that man alive." If he was not mistaken, the last fragment should have self-consciousness, so it controlled the man and came to lie in wait. Because back when Lin Sheng sensed it, it also sensed him in return and retreated immediately. At that time, Lin Sheng thought that it was the reactive response of the last fragment. But he did not expect that it was due to the last fragment possessing self-consciousness. Chapter 468 Fierce Battle 1 Ancient verses echoed through the sky along with the melodies of a mysterious tune. At the entrance of the Tower of Heaven in Redon, massive three-dimensional arrays of white, red, and blue colors rotated incessantly, containing an abundance of runes and evil energies. Countless streams of energy surged out from within the Tower of Heaven, guiding various particles of energy from the surrounding cosmos to converge here. Myriads of arrays coalesced into a colossal sealing array. When dealing with formidable individuals like Farrudo, sealing was indeed the optimal method. If Lin Sheng could come up with the idea in the beginning, the Tower of Heaven was naturally able to think of it too and could execute it even better. Years ago, they had already gathered a considerable number of blood descendants with the blood of sealing. Now that they suddenly employed it, it was an unimaginable ambush for Farrudo. At this moment, he hovered in mid-air, his expression solemn as he surveyed below. The massive array, with a diameter spanning over a thousand meters, perfectly enclosed him at its center. Countless strands of energy, like innumerable threads, converged at the periphery of the array and bound him. Even fragile spider silk, when gathered in sufficient quantity, could surpass steel cables. Not to mention these evil energy threads were coalesced by the arrays. Countless threads of evil energy, with the condensation of the Tower of Heaven and led by the remaining envoys, were now faintly revealing many translucent angels with twin wings on their backs. "Angels, huh? Heh, it's been so many years since I've witnessed such a sight..." Farrudo gazed upon the scene before him and was suddenly overcome with a sense of melancholy. "However, you want to seal me by summoning angels? Don't you think you are underestimating me? A thousand years ago, I could slaughter angels with a single hand, let alone now!" Farrudo lowered his head, observing the growing web of transparent threads that were entwining and ensnaring his legs. The threads multiplied and grew denser with each passing moment. "Nevertheless, being able to make even this form of mine feel somewhat challenged, you do have enough reason to be proud." He raised his right hand. "Incantation: Stoneforce." "Incantation: Divine Swiftness." "Incantation: Radiance of Fear." "Incantation: Psychic Assassination." "Advanced Enhancement: Ambrolo's Divine Card." "Advanced Enchantment: Light of the Underworld." His lips moved slightly, and in just two seconds, a vast array of arcane kotodama incantations surged into effect. His body crackled with all kinds of energy like a frenzy of electric currents. Hiss... Simultaneously, four slender and sharp spears materialized in the surrounding void, centered around him. These spears were semi-transparent, with ribbon-like runes swirling around their tips. Chirp!! In an instant, the four spears vanished from their original positions and reappeared within the crowds stationed in the four directions of the ground's central magic array. Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!!! Sudden transparent shockwaves erupted among the scattered crowd. "This is an attack against the spiritual soul. It cannot be blocked, nor evaded. It can only be endured." Farrudo smiled. As the crowd below began to disperse, many were even dazed and stunned by the spiritual explosion. The operation of the arrays momentarily slowed down. "I'll intercept his attacks. The rest of you, continue!" The elderly member of the Tower of Heaven raised his hand and said loudly. Stepping forward, his upper garments suddenly burst apart, revealing the silver-white close-fitting armor underneath. "Ice and Snow Dragon Armor Technique!" He extended both hands, and behind him, a vast evil green light shimmered. A gray-black vortex suddenly appeared above his head. Within the vortex, a massive influx of pale green evil energy poured out, akin to a sea raging and pouring out. As the evil energy descended, it underwent a peculiar transformation with a certain force, solidifying into rigid, frigid white ice that enveloped the elderly man. Soon, his entire body was covered with grotesque, rough white ice spikes, which, when densely clustered, formed his ultimate defense unique—the Ice and Snow Dragon Armor Technique! "Intercept me?" Farrudo laughed. "Since you know that I am the Demon Speech Officer of the Underworld, then you should also know that my expertise lies not in direct combat..." He raised his head, and his white hair behind him rapidly lengthened and thickened, weaving a colossal gray-black half-body giant in the sky. This gray-black giant had a horn on its head, muscles intertwined like tree roots, and faint hints of flesh wings emerging from its back. It also held a massive black pillar in its hands. "Guardian of the Underworld Pillars. Go forth and bring destruction upon this place!" Farrudo calmly commanded. Hmmm... The gray-black giant behind him responded with a gentle hum. Its five-meter-tall form shot forward, its speed dramatically increasing after Farrudo's hair split, hurtling towards the magical array on the ground like a falling meteor. However, soon after, one of the envoys from below leaped into the sky, using an exquisitely ancient and enormous tower shield to accurately block the Guardian of the Underworld Pillars. Seeing his summoned entity was thwarted, Farrudo paid no heed. This was just a minor character he had casually summoned. The reason he called forth this minor character was to buy time for his subsequent actions. Maradolun, Lurker of the Deep River, Leader of the Ambush, Fluid Shadow Beast, my most loyal First Lieutenant. In the name of Farrudo, I summon you to descend upon this place!!" He loudly recited the full titles and true name of another powerful entity. True names were not easy to recite. These were imprints etched deep within the soul, representing unique identities across time and space. While reciting, one needed to imagine the complete image of the entity and recite the majority of their powers, deeds, history, traits, and so on. Finally, with the entity's consent and permission, it could be summoned using its true name. And what Farrudo was currently doing was this very process. But there was one thing different. What originally required extensive preparation, a substantial allocation of resources, and manpower for the formation of arrays and rituals was significantly diminished and truncated by his immensely potent incantation abilities. Ultimately, it resulted in the seemingly effortless usage of these kotodama summonings. As Farrudo recited the summoning kotodama incantations, gradually, in the empty space behind him, a peculiar male warrior with a height of two meters emerged. The warrior possessed thirteen pairs of arms on his back. Adorned in crude leather armor and barefooted, the warrior had an attire that appeared worn and tattered, as if it hadn't been repaired for a long time. The most eye-catching thing was the man's back, where two slender, slightly curved blades of pale purple were strapped. The summoned man seemed devoid of consciousness, his eyes blood-red. The moment he appeared, he let out a furious roar and swung his blades downward in a reverse grip. Chirp!! Two intersecting silver blade lights formed an X shape ad plummeted to the ground like shooting stars. Initially, there were simply two blade glints, but as the distance increased, they rapidly expanded, as if duplicating themselves, instantaneously transforming into hundreds of blade glints. And with each blade glint that landed, it materialized into a substantial metallic silver-colored creature. These metallic creatures had sharp, blade-like heads and slender, snake-like bodies. They moved at incredible speeds, like serpents, darting around within the array and colliding with anyone they encountered. "Attack!" A large group of Tower of Heaven evil spirits knew that they had reached a critical moment and charged forward. The fact that the sealing array had endured for such a long time and maintained a stalemate with Farrudo up until now indicated its effectiveness. If they pushed a little harder, perhaps they could truly seal Farrudo back into the Underworld.  Chapter 469 Fierce Battle 2 Near a low pit on the battlefield, the air seemed to twist invisibly. At the same time, a group of people of all ages, dressed in various styles, suddenly appeared in the midst of this chaotic battlefield. Their clothing varied, some looked like they had just come out of their homes and hadn't even changed out of their pajamas, some wore racing suits like they were on a motorcycle race. And some had a bewildered expression and held kitchen utensils. "This is the place..." Among the crowd, a young man with a handsome face and a white cloak draped over his shoulders looked up at Farrudo in the sky. "So quickly? Did we just run from the border to the river in an instant?" The person with the kitchen utensil said in astonishment. "It's just targeted teleportation through the array," a venerable voice resonated in everyone's ears. "Now, with Farrudo ahead, holders of the Destiny Relics, how you decide and act are all to be decided by yourselves with a single thought. Fate is now in your hands." "Heh, that sounds nice. They've forcibly brought us here, do you think we can just leave?" A woman in pajamas retorted coldly. "Well, now that we're here, I'm sure everyone knows the purpose of this mission. In truth, the souls of heroes exist within the Destiny Relics. What we need to do is get close to Farrudo and activate their abilities. Then, we can entrust everything to these heroic souls." A burly old man wearing sunglasses spoke solemnly. "Regardless, since you're here, it means you've all made your resolutions." Adolf glanced at them but remained silent. He gazed at Farrudo in the sky and suddenly felt a pang of homesickness. He thought of the elders in the Holy Temple, the comrades who prayed together, and even Lord Noctis, who stubbornly refused to get out of bed... "Let's go. "As for how to summon the heroic souls from within us, the relics will guide us to the answer." The man with sunglasses spoke with a deep voice, taking the lead towards Farrudo. The others fell silent and quickly followed suit. However, what confused Adolf was that these people claimed to possess the Destiny Relics. As someone who carried a relic himself, he should have been able to resonate with them. Yet, he didn't sense even a trace of their presence. Only the aura of the Destiny Treasures remained. Although Adolf was puzzled, he believed however muddle-headed they were, they wouldn't joke about their lives like that. So, he speculated that there might be some unknown means they were using to conceal their presence.... Rumble!!!  In the desert sky, thunderous roars resonated like rolling boulders, shaking the thick clouds overhead. Within the black desert, the atmosphere was heavy and stifling. Across the sandy terrain, legions of evil spirits ran or flew, followed closely by the elf warriors, charging towards the desert camp's massive army on the opposite side. The desert legion was predominantly clad in white. They wore special armor imbued with some kind of otherworldly power. The evil spirit army, on the other hand, was a mix of black and red, a fusion of pure ethereal life and flesh-and-blood existence, creating a unique and formidable multidimensional assault pattern. The evil spirits attacked from a distance, while the elf warriors engaged in close-quarters combat. The soldiers in the desert, aside from their armor, were only slightly stronger than regular common folk, both in body and soul. Facing the multidimensional assault, casualties mounted, and they were gradually forced to retreat. Lin Sheng rode his Blood Fiend, slowly and steadily advancing onto the battlefield. No evil spirits or soldiers from the opposing army could approach within ten meters of him. On a sand dune straight ahead, the Giant King brothers were teaming up to battle against the enigmatic desert powerhouse. The battle had been raging for a long time. After learning some details about their opponent, the Giant King brothers had become much more cautious this time. The man with the gem-encrusted chest had reappeared, and several strong powerhouses had emerged from the rear ranks of the enemy army, all seemingly with considerable strength. These powerhouses all bore small, slender green wings on their backs that looked like willow leaves. The wings hung down motionless beneath them, making it almost impossible to tell that they were attached to their bodies when not in use. Lin Sheng silently observed the battle. The Elf Queen and the Sin Dragon Mother stood beside him, both calmly gazing at the Giant King brothers. Among the opposing camp, several powerful souls swept their stares across Lin Sheng and others and faced them directly. However, the moment their gazes came into contact with Lin Sheng's, they recoiled as if shocked, swiftly retracting their probing. None dared to investigate further. "Too slow." Lin Sheng looked at the Sin Dragon Mother beside him, who immediately understood him. As a member of the Fate Corpse Dragon Clan skilled in magical rituals and formations, the Sin Dragon Mother had instinctively used enchantment-type spells when she first saw Lin Sheng. Although she hadn't succeeded, it had left a lasting impression on Lin Sheng. Stepping forward, the Sin Dragon Mother activated a purple array beneath her feet, and in an instant, she was transported to the middle of the opposing battlefield. She appeared right behind the desert powerhouse, catching him off guard and lightly tapping the back of his head. A burst of purple radiance exploded and formed intricate patterns, sealing the real of the man's head. The man immediately became dizzy. His eyes rolled back, and he collapsed to the ground. "Doesn't it seem so easy?" She grinned playfully at the Giant King brothers. Pfft! In an instant, an axe was swung from behind her. The slender waist of the Sin Dragon Mother was struck, sending her flying more than ten meters away to another sand dune. "You idiot!" The Black Giant King sneered, raising his fist once more and charging towards the now-awakened desert man. The formidable clash of the two envoy-level forces distorted the air, raising massive waves of sand. Ah!!! The Sin Dragon Mother had been smashed into the sand dune, and even her skirt had been smashed. She was truly embarrassed in public. This triggered her immediate fury. She burst out of the sand dune, her body swelling and growing larger. In an instant, she transformed into a colossal dragon over ten meters long. Her limbs touched the ground, and she let out a ferocious roar towards the desert man. Buzz!!! The dragon was entirely black, with a massive reptilian body. Two wings on her back seemed to have degenerated, leaving only bone-like protrusions. She opened her mouth and a dense mist of gray fog poured out. The gray mist sprayed out and as soon as it touched the ground, the sandy terrain immediately turned into gray stones. Corpses on the ground were also instantly transformed into stone sculptures. The desert man once again had two individuals fly up from behind him, and with a solemn expression, they charged at the Sin Dragon Mother. A golden radiance appeared in their hands, countering the petrifying breath. The two of them joined forces to block her. "So many powerhouses... it seems they are well-prepared," Lin Sheng remarked in a low voice, his words muffled by his thick faceplate. "You should go too," he turned to face Tiangong Xia, who had been following closely. "Hopefully, I'll get a chance to land a few more strikes." Tiangong Xia licked her lips and strode towards the battlefield. Lin Sheng, however, didn't focus on the ongoing battle. He shifted his gaze to the northwest. In that direction, a power fluctuation similar to his own was subtly observing the fight from a distance. "The final fragment, huh?" Lin Sheng smirked. "Initiate the final assault, Elf Queen," he ordered. Demon King. "But the outcome over there hasn't been determined yet. Launching the final assault now might lead to friendly fire." The Elf Queen advised him in a hushed tone. "Do as I say." Lin Sheng remained resolute. Chirp! Suddenly, a sharp sound exploded behind him. Lin Sheng immediately felt a chill piercing through his back. His force field was instantly breached, and an assassin's weapon had managed to slip through the gaps in his Dawnbreaker Heavy Armor, stabbing into his skin. Chapter 470 Fierce Battle 3 Boom! Following a sound resembling wood being chopped, the sharp blade of the assassin precisely stabbed at Lin Sheng's back with high precision. But it didn't pierce through. He instantly froze in place. His blade was forcefully stuck within the gap of the armor, unable to move a bit. At the same moment, an immense, dense-to-the-limit field of natural energy abruptly replaced the previously tranquil and somewhat ordinary natural energy field. Without even turning his head, Lin Sheng thrust out his palm. His palm was incredibly swift, almost as if it had pierced through the assassin's chest the moment it was raised. "This assassin is quite capable." With a flick of his hand, he discarded the corpse, and a white trace of holy energy swept over, instantly purifying the blood and stain from his hand. Woo~~~! Amidst the resounding horn calls, the entire army of the Evil Spirit Palace surged forward. The reserve legion in the rear began to swim forward in an eerily quiet but rapid manner. Glancing ahead, an endless expanse of troops stretched out to the point where no boundaries could be discerned. At this very moment, they resembled a tide that suddenly engulfed and scattered the opposing desert legion. Lin Sheng paid no attention to the outcome. Instead, he rode the Blood Fiend and proceeded step by step towards the direction from which the fluctuation in aura emanated. With each step the Blood Fiend took, its pace appeared slow, yet it was extremely swift. This burly and robust Evil Spirit powerhouse, which looked unlike a horse at all, carried Lin Sheng toward that direction. Soon, he traversed over numerous sand dunes, leaving everyone else far behind. The Blood Fiend automatically came to a halt at the edge of a verdant oasis, its gaze fixed upon the three figures standing by the oasis's border. Those were three formidable desert warriors, each with a crimson gemstone embedded in their chests. The trio gazed intently at Lin Sheng. This adversary for whom they had set up the ambush was clad in heavy armor and rode atop a black warhorse, a steed that appeared almost unbelievably strong. The horse itself was adorned with thick armor as well. Before Lin Huai approached them, they had sensed an oppressive aura that nearly constricted their breathing. "Evil fiend! It's him!" The only woman among the three spoke coldly. "The Lunar Stone has successfully lured him to us! Attack!!" She unsheathed a curved blade from her back, blue electrical currents flickering and jumping across her body. She led the charge and dashed toward Lin Sheng. Simultaneously, the other two men also drew their blades and advanced from two other directions to besiege him. Their coordination was so seamless, as if they had been fighting like this for many years. Three purplish lightning bolts surged forth from the three long blades, transforming into three thunderous dragons that charged at Lin Sheng. In the distant oasis, several robed women swiftly emerged from the bushes. Chanting incantations under their breath, a wave of mysterious power fluctuation suddenly descended from the air, instantly suppressing most of the Yin Transformation Evil Wheel's protective aura enveloping Lin Sheng. "Oh?" Lin Sheng raised an eyebrow. "So that's why you dared to lure me out. Turned out you really have a way to suppress the protective aura on me." Facing multiple attacks on his horse, he suddenly reached out with his hand. Chirp!! The highly condensed holy energy in his hand transformed into a gigantic sword over three meters long. Whoosh! The holy energy great sword swung down at the charging trio. Before the sword even made contact with their blades, an invisible field of terror tightly suppressed the thunderous dragons they had unleashed. Puff! Puff! Puff!! The three thunderous dragons disintegrated in the blink of an eye. The massive sword carried a terrifying force and thunderously descended in front of the first woman who was leading her peers. Boom!!! A pitch-black crack, spanning more than ten meters, materialized out of thin air before Lin Sheng. He lifted the massive sword, looking down upon the female swordswoman who had just narrowly evaded the strike. "The power that allowed you to dodge my attack just now, what is it?" "Answer me!" His eyes widened, and he swung his sword in a backhanded strike into the air on his right. Bang!!! An invisible ripple was instantly shattered and exploded. Several robed figures in the distance who were casting spells immediately spat out blood, collapsing to the ground with pallid faces. "Evil fiend!! This is the birthplace of the Lunar Stone, the original source known as the 'Land of Purity's Primordial Pool'! Regret it now, for daring to come here alone. On this day next year, it will be your death anniversary!!" From deep within the oasis emerged a burly and robust elderly man, gripping a massive war hammer in each hand. Each war hammer was nearly the size of an adult. Just from the appearance of the two war hammers, one could tell they were anything but ordinary in weight. The elderly man's hair was entirely braided into fine strands, and his unkempt beard hung down to his chest. He wore a menacing black armor that seemed somewhat ancient and worn, creating a stark contrast with the pure white armor Lin Sheng wore. "At such an old age, instead of enjoying peace at home, you've come here to meet your doom." Lin Sheng's eyes flickered as he curiously observed the elderly man. "I'm 504 years old and have just celebrated my birthday not long ago. I have never thought that at my advanced age, the heavens would bestow upon me a grand battle." The elderly man burst into hearty laughter, looking up at the sky. "Let me see if you're capable of killing me!!" Behind him, a roar echoed, and a towering, muscular jet-black tiger materialized out of thin air. The giant tiger seemed to have already donned armor and weapons. Mounting it swiftly, the elderly man gripped his war hammers and crashed them against each other fiercely. "Here's my head, come and take it!!" With a mighty roar, the elderly man's tiger leaped forward, soaring high into the air and spanning over ten meters in a single leap, pouncing toward Lin Sheng. Narrowing his eyes, Lin Sheng distinctly sensed a powerful fluctuation of fragments resonating and spreading from the old man's body. "Did they place all their bets on this old man?" He sneered, raising his sword with both hands! Swish!! Boom!!!! The sword's edge carried a white radiance as it clashed head-on with the descending war hammers. A transparent ripple burst forth explosively between the two of them, scattering in all directions. Wherever the ripple went, gravel was sent flying from the ground, and the oasis shrubs were torn and severed. It was as if an invisible blade was slicing through everything in the blink of an eye. The elderly man's strength was simply astonishing. He was able to contend with Lin Sheng in a direct clash without falling into a disadvantage. Lin Sheng was also taken aback. Having broken through his limits, he had almost forsaken half of his human bloodline and replaced it with the blood of the Rock Dragon. With the blood of the Rock Dragon coursing through him, he essentially possessed the strength of half a Rock Dragon. Under these circumstances, this old man was actually able to match him blow for blow? Surprised, yet without hesitation, his massive holy sword fluctuated between rapid and slow movements, continuously clashing against the war hammers. From their first exchange of attack, they both recognized each other as an unparalleled adversary in their lifetimes. The elderly man, a peerless war god within this realm of evil spirits, had been undefeated for centuries, with no one ever surpassing him. In terms of combat skills, physical capabilities, and strength, he had pushed himself to the limits attainable by humans. However, he had never expected the person before him to be able to stand firm against him in direct combat, and even faintly suppress him a little bit. Lin Sheng had assimilated countless memories of life-and-death battles from various powerhouses, accumulating an incredibly rich combat experience. Additionally, due to his fusion with the fragments of souls, he had mastered numerous sword techniques for lethal strikes. In the past, he could easily end battles using other abilities, so he rarely had the chance to unleash this exaggerated level of martial prowess. However, his entire body's protective aura was being suppressed, and he didn't want to reveal his trump cards just yet. He decided to first figure out his opponent's strengths and weaknesses. For now, he only employed his innate combat skills. To his surprise, his attacks had been blocked by this old man! The two fought each other at lightning speed with their heavy weapons. The giant sword and the war hammers met, each collision generating terrifying shockwaves. Within a radius of several dozen meters, the entire area had become a zone of death. Chapter 471 Conflict 1 Adolf gazed at Farrudo, who had been sealed in mid-air all this time. His sense of impending doom grew stronger with each passing moment. However, he couldn't share this uneasy feeling with others. At this point, they had already been entangled in the so-called grand cause of humanity. Whether they wanted it or not, they had been forced to this point. If he were to suddenly express his discomfort and desire to withdraw, nobody knew what consequences that might bring about. The group quietly advanced under the concealment of a person skilled in the use of Destiny Relics' hidden abilities, getting closer to the sealed battlefield. From a distance, it didn't appear overly dangerous. But as they drew nearer, they began to realize the true peril of this battlefield. The fluctuations of evil energy were like chaotic undercurrents, colliding and squeezing against each other. The evil energies of different individuals harbored distinct intentions. These varying intentions resulted in the evil energies acting like soldiers engaged in a tumultuous battle. Even while standing a hundred meters away from the battlefield, they could feel the ground trembling with each intense explosion. Battle cries and the roars of monsters echoed like the ebb and flow of ocean waves, one after another. Just being near the edge of the battlefield made Adolf's scalp tingle. And it wasn't just him—his companions also felt their legs grow weak, their faces pale. Having lived their lives in peaceful environments devoid of the horrors of war, they were abruptly confronted with the gruesome spectacle of this supernatural battle. They were now observing the battlefield's edge littered with severed limbs, gore, and the corpses of grotesque and sharp-toothed monsters. The woman dressed in sleepwear couldn't help but bend over and retch. "All right, let's not dawdle any longer. As long as we activate the abilities of the Destiny Relics and gather together, that should suffice, right?" The leading elder spoke solemnly. "Yes. Afterward, the Spirit of Valor will take over everything." The voice of the Great Sage echoed in the ears of everyone once more. "Very well, then let's begin." The elder turned back and looked at the others. Everyone heard the voice of the Great Sage, and they all knew what they should and had to do next. Adolf stood amidst the group, nodding slightly. Together with everyone else, he began to release the power within him. However, as this release occurred, the sense of impending doom in his heart grew even clearer. "Kill!!" Within the black desert, two towering figures clashed fiercely once again, brandishing their weapons. As their weapons collided, a sharp and intense ringing echoed out. Lin Sheng continued to exert his full force bullishly and pressed down. Bang!!!! The black tiger beneath the elder suddenly couldn't bear the weight anymore. Emitting a mournful cry, it dropped to its front knees and sank into the sand. The elder's expression changed. They had been locked in combat for at least three hours already. Yet, the evil fiend across from them not only showed no signs of physical fatigue, but seemed to be growing stronger, becoming more powerful with each passing blow. No matter what injuries were inflicted upon the evil fiend, they were healed and disappeared within a matter of moments. And clad in the heavy white armor, the evil fiend possessed defensive capabilities that were incredibly hard to breach. Even though he was a war god, he had never encountered a formidable opponent capable of sustaining such intense combat for such an extended period. In his younger days, perhaps he could have lasted twice as long. But things were different now. He was already old. "Too bad the power of the Lunar Stone suddenly vanished. Otherwise, I, at this moment, would possess far more than just this level of strength." He used his strength to force Lin Sheng back and retreated dozens of meters with the giant tiger. "Lunar Stone? Where do you think the power of the Lunar Stone went? And if it were not for the Lunar Stone, do you think I would only exert this level of strength?" Lin Sheng coldly retorted. "Very well. By now, you should understand why you were brought here by the Lunar Stone." He added with a meaningful tone. The elder's expression slightly faltered. Following Lin Sheng's gaze, he looked around. He saw that many of the companions who had previously been alive and well were now caught in the aftermath and suffered severe injuries and casualties. He suddenly felt that something was amiss. "Or perhaps, do you really think it wanted you to come here to eliminate me? In other words, do you truly believe that with just a few people, you guys can kill me?" Lin Sheng proclaimed loudly. The elder suddenly noticed a small detail. Several bodies on the ground had lost their Lunar Stones that were originally on their chests. The stones had mysteriously disappeared. "Could it be...!?" He suddenly thought of the most dreadful possibility. "Your guess is correct. It's reclaiming the power it once bestowed upon you. If I'm not mistaken, this power should have already merged with you. And the only way to retrieve that power is by killing you." Lin Sheng explained with a trace of pity. The elder had also considered this possibility. However, having possessed the Lunar Stone for hundreds of years, he had no inclination to think in that direction. "Your strength is impressive. Even without the Lunar Stone, you are still extraordinary. By my side, there's only one other person who can be mentioned in the same breath as you." Lin Sheng admitted frankly. "So, would you like to join me? I can grant you a longer lifespan, and in return, you fight for me." Indeed, the strength of this old man was formidable. By Lin Sheng's side, only Tiangong Xia could be mentioned in the same breath as him. The elder's weapon carried an indescribably tremendous impact. This impact was different from the shockwaves of the Giant King. He was able to maximize the power of moves such as smashes, strikes, and hammer blows. In addition, the old man seemed to have cultivated a resistance ability against various energies. Therefore, this guy was simply a formidable berserker with exceptional resistance to high-level magic. His strength was so overwhelming that envoys' force fields were like fragile bubbles to him and would be shattered upon contact. "And besides... What happened earlier was just a warm-up with you." Lin Sheng swung the slightly cracked Holy Light Colossal Sword, reconstituting and renewing it in an instant. Numerous dragon scales gradually emerged on his body, while two sharp spiral horns extended from his head. His body quickly expanded and grew, increasing in size by at least half from his true body. "Now, enjoy the battle!!" With a dragon's roar, he spurred his horse toward the elder, his colossal sword gleaming like a white flash as it thunderously struck the elder's shoulder. The speed of this strike was so swift that the elder hadn't even fully recovered from his previous astonishment before being struck. In reality, his strength had nearly reached the level of Tiangong Xia. Yet, even at this level, he was insufficient before the current Lin Sheng. After gaining the Yin Transformation Evil Wheel, his power had surged to an unimaginable level. Although most of the blessings from the 88 Protections were suppressed by the Lunar Stone, the fundamental changes and enhancements to Lin Sheng himself still remained. The speed and power of this strike had reached the utmost limit that the air could accommodate. As the light sword swung, the rapid speed generated a tremendous thunderous sound, accompanied by flames and lightning produced by friction. It wasn't until the elder was struck that he heard the sound of Lin Sheng's sword slashing down. The elder, along with the giant tiger, exploded with loud cracks as they were forcefully slammed into the sandy ground by the colossal sword. They were immobilized. He couldn't help but spew a mouthful of blood. Actually, he had already lost his will to fight due to the sinister intentions of the Lunar Stone earlier. Now, after being hit by the sword, he found it even harder to carry on. "So, you're not an evil fiend? The Lunar Stone is?" He wiped the blood from his mouth with a wry smile. "Indeed, I am the Holy Spirit King. The vast holy power within me originates from the strength that heals and saves lives, nurtures and supports life. How could I possibly be an evil fiend?" Lin Sheng said with seriousness. Chapter 472 Conflict 2 "Holy Spirit King..." The elder still had doubts in his heart. However, the Lunar Stone on his chest that kept trying to detach itself from him forced him to make a decision at this moment. Should he die meaningless in battle for the Lunar Stone, or temporarily leave the doubts behind and surrender to the opponent? The answer was self-evident. "Have you made up your mind?" Lin Sheng could see the elder's decision in his eyes. "Can you give me some time?" The old man smiled bitterly. "Of course. Those who are outstanding and capable deserve special treatment." Lin Sheng said with a smile. There was no longer a reason for them to fight. The old man was no longer hostile either. After Lin Sheng healed the elder's injuries with his holy power, the elder experienced firsthand the powerful healing ability of holy power. He began to believe more in Lin Sheng's claim to be the Holy Spirit King. The elder's name was Ning Jia. He carefully described the situation of this desert to Lin Sheng. Long ago, a divine stone called the Lunar Stone fell from the sky here and taught countless people a cultivation method called Lunar Power. Lin Sheng inquired about the cultivation method of Lunar Power in detail. He also obtained something called Lunar Stone Crystal from Ning Jia, which was the red gem embedded in his chest. As he had expected, the so-called Lunar Stone Crystal was actually a part of the Lunar Stone itself. It was a parasitic entity that it used to absorb the life force cultivated by these people. Holding the crystal in his hand, Lin Sheng had Ning Jia lead the way to the original landing site of the Lunar Stone. There, Ning Jia finally saw the numerous practitioners of Lunar Power lying dead on the ground without any signs of battle. The Lunar Stone not only absorbed their Lunar Stone Crystals but also their entire life force. This allowed Ning Jia to truly see the true nature of the Lunar Stone. After being healed by Lin Sheng's holy power, he finally made up his mind to lead the forces of the Evil Spirit Palace to launch a counter-offensive against the Lunar Stone. This campaign did not last long. After Ning Jia turned traitor, with his great reputation and connections, and with numerous bodies whose Lunar Stone Crystals had been extracted continuously appearing, this desert secret realm quickly became a guide for the Evil Spirit Palace at an exaggerated pace. Although Ning Jia lost his Lunar Stone Crystal, Lin Sheng bestowed him with Holy Power Seed. His soul was so resilient that even the Lunar Stone couldn't absorb his life force through space, which ensured that his cultivation of holy power would progress at an astonishing rate. Moreover, the effects of holy power reversed the aging process of his physical body. Although he had lost the accumulated cultivation he had built over many years, the nature of holy power allowed him to be compensated in terms of pure strength and physical vitality. Thus, his power did not decline significantly. There was still no problem for him to crash the other envoys except Tiangong Xia, and he was even slightly stronger than the Sin Dragon Mother. After cultivating holy power, he genuinely became one of Lin Sheng's top-tier elites. With no more reason to fight, the forces of the Evil Spirit Palace slowly began to withdraw. Under the support of the war god elder Ning Jia, the power of the black desert was fully harnessed. There were numerous weaker individuals who were ineligible to cultivate Lunar Stone Crystals, along with those envoy-level powerhouses like Ning Jia who were so powerful that the Lunar Stone couldn't absorb their life force through space. All of them gathered under Ning Jia's banner out of fear and a shared goal. They became affiliated with the Evil Spirit Palace. They led Lin Sheng straight to the location of the Lunar Stone in this secret realm—the Black Gold City. Their determination to destroy the Lunar Stone was now even stronger than Lin Sheng's. After all, this was a matter of life and death for them. Meanwhile, in the real world, the sealing battle of Redon came to an end after several days of stalemate. Redon formally attached himself to the Underworld, severing his previous ties. The entrance to Tower of Heaven remained tightly shut, and the plains outside were strewn with wreckage and debris. There were no bones or remnants of the previous formations. Everything had turned into a massive change. The land appeared to be covered by a thick layer of red soil. This entire area seemed to have been thoroughly blanketed by the red soil, burying away every trace and sign. Some powerful evil spirits attempted to bypass the Black Tide Monster Clan and investigate the Tower of Heaven. However, the entrance was sealed off by the secret realm, no aura fluctuations could enter. As for the unparalleled great demon Farrudo, his whereabouts remained unknown. Some people guessed that the seal might have succeeded, while some guessed that Farrudo might have killed his way into the secret realm. Regardless, the world had temporarily regained its tranquility. Inside the secret realm of the Tower of Heaven. The Snow Council Hall was located in the deepest part of the Tower of Heaven amid of a myriad of colossal white towers featuring spires. At this time, the Snow Council Hall had transformed into Nether Prison shrouded in gray-black smoke and Nether Energy. Stone pillars pierced from the ground, each with a dark red chain, binding wailing and naked figures. They used to be evil spirit powerhouses of the Tower of Heaven. These individuals were unwilling to submit to Farrudo, and Farrudo cared not for these wretches, as subduing them would only waste his time. So, he decided to transform them into Nether Energy Pillars so as to accumulate energy for himself to open the passage to the Underworld. This war made him realize clearly that attacking a secret realm was still somewhat troublesome. Therefore, he decided to open a passage immediately, hoping to project a part of his true body to enhance his power to some extent. But before that, he needed to deal with some unexpected surprises he had captured. He briskly entered the back of the council hall where there was a small resting area, a temporary place for those awaiting an audience. He had now transformed it into a special experimental ground. There were a total of six individuals, who were ordinary humans with unique powers within their bodies and captured by him on the outskirts of the battlefield. At that time, he had just crushed the entire forces of the Tower of Heaven before encountering this group of sneaky kids on the side, emitting a faint sense of malice towards him. For his age, these individuals could indeed be called kids. After all, their ages didn't even add up to a fraction of his. The peculiar powers emanating from this group of people piqued his interest. Thus, once he confirmed they posed no threat, he easily defeated them all, brought them into the Tower of Heaven, and left them here. Farrudo activated the Eye of Annihilation. This was a unique ability that allowed him to partially discern the essence and origin of energies, one of his special abilities as a Demon Speech Officer of the Underworld. The Eye of Annihilation swept over the several people in turn. Soon, the unique power emanating from one of them caught his attention. "What is this? Light? White energy?" Farrudo's Eye of Annihilation suddenly fixated on Adolf. He was drawn to the somewhat dazzling light emitted by Adolf. In the dim palace, he walked slowly to the holder of Destiny Relics he had captured long before. "Tell me, what is this?" He grasped Adolf's chin and sent a surge of Nether Energy into him to wake him up. Nether Energy was a special power possessed only by high-ranking powerhouses of the Underworld. It could stimulate people's potential and temporarily restore clarity to their mind. Chapter 473 Conflict 3 Adolf was already severely injured, and now he had been starving for a long time, not drinking even a drop of water for days. At this point, his vitality was nearly extinguished. He wasn't sure why, in the end, despite gathering all the powers, the so-called Heavenly Mandate Soul still hadn't appeared. But regardless, this was his own choice. He had no regrets. "Heh..." He managed to force a smile, not really wanting to respond. "Resolute." Farrudo praised with a sigh. "However, it's a pity. The stronger someone's will is, the quicker they tend to die in reality." "Then... go ahead and kill me," Adolf said calmly. He had initially left to avoid causing trouble for anyone. Now that everything had unfolded as he had foreseen, nothing really mattered anymore. He would die. And all consequences would be borne by himself, not getting anyone else into trouble or involving anybody. "Poor thing." Farrudo understood this man's thoughts. He released his grip and looked at the six holders of Destiny Relics. "Underworld Curse." He raised his right hand. "All order shall dissolve into chaos. In the radiant shadow, within the realm of decay, in the name of Farrudo, I summon." From his palm, a significant amount of pitch-black hair slowly emerged. Countless strands of hair, as dark as the deepest night, flowed out and covered the ground around the hall. "As the master of the Underworld's demonic language, my voice is the voice of the Underworld. With flesh and blood as sacrifice, I summon my true body slumbering within the Great Divine Pillar. Let our covenant be formed here." Farrudo lowered his hand, and the hair in his palm snapped off at their roots, scattering like living creatures and crawling in all directions. He walked slowly toward the six individuals. "Evil Soul Eye." He activated another type of ocular technique. This was a special ritualistic eye used specifically to capture and absorb the souls of living beings. It could amplify the effects by nearly double when using the captured souls as offerings. He walked up to the first person, his eyes shining with triangular purple-black patterns. He stared at the center of the person's eyebrows. Hiss... Soon, a faint bluish humanoid shape, like a bubble, drifted out from the person and transformed into a long, thin thread that quickly shot into Farrudo's right eye. "First one." He continued toward the second person. Soon, another humanoid soul was slowly drawn out and flew into his right eye, disappearing from view. Then came the third person. Xie Qiaoyue was leaning against Adolf in a daze. She watched as Farrudo absorbed one soul after another, her entire body bristling with fear, and her spirit surging restlessly. She had been summoned inexplicably for this occasion, but unfortunately, she was captured before she could succeed in her mission. Due to the prolonged lack of food and drink, she was already weak and powerless, unable to resist. Quickly, Farrudo approached her. His soul-captivating eyes locked onto her. Suddenly, he hesitated slightly, his gaze drawn to Adolf beside her. After seemingly contemplating for a moment, he walked over to Adolf first and stood in front of him. He decided to absorb this somewhat suspicious guy first to prevent any unexpected occurrences. An invisible force of absorption slowly activated as Farrudo's eyes emitted a strange and eerie energy field to envelope Adolf. This force began to rapidly erode Adolf's body and draw his soul out from within. Just at this moment, something happened. Chirp!! Suddenly, a beam of white light burst forth from Adolf's body. The light was incredibly pure, yet it carried an aura of authority and sanctity. In an instant, it created a barrier that blocked the soul-absorbing force. Sensing how formidable the soul-absorbing force was, the white light seemed to ripple and immediately covered Adolf's entire body. "Hmm!?" Farrudo was slightly taken aback. There was actually a power capable of resisting his Evil Soul Eye? He activated his Evil Soul Eye once more, increasing its power as he directed it towards Adolf. "Absorb!!" The power intensified, causing immediate feedback from the radiant white light. A vague yet immensely strong and resolute will was gradually awakening from within the beam of light. "So, you're the one who defeated my disciple?" The will within the light vibrated slowly, emitting its consciousness. "Who are you?" Farrudo's focused his gaze. The fact that this entity could manifest its own will from pure energy was not something an ordinary being could achieve. Clearly, the individual within this white light was no ordinary person. "Me? Just an insignificant figure." The consciousness within the white light responded. "However, I have been awakened. My true bod will also sense it." "Therefore, you can defeat my disciple, but you can't kill him. In a person's lifetime, there will be many failures. But as long as he is alive, I can give him another chance." "Can't kill him?" Farrudo's face twisted into a cold smile. "This is my sincere advice to you," the consciousness within the white light stated calmly. "In the lives of others, there will be numerous opportunities even after failure. But you are different. Since you have encountered me, you have only one chance to answer me." "Very well. Let me show you my answer." Farrudo suddenly extended his finger. Puff. His fingertip accurately touched Adolf's forehead between his eyebrows. A surge of dark Nether Energy rushed into his head, instantly obliterating Adolf's brain into a mush. "This is my answer." He withdrew his hand. "Soul Absorption!!" Suddenly, the invisible soul-absorbing force beside him intensified and rapidly grew stronger. It forcibly began to pull Adolf's pale blue transparent soul out from within him. As the Demon Speech Officer of the Underworld, Farrudo cared little for such threats. He didn't even care about the entire human world, let alone the consciousness hidden in a mere energy. Amidst the piercing screams, the blue soul seemed to be torn apart by two opposing forces. The power of the Holy Light was pulling him back into his body, while the power of the Evil Soul Eye was pulling him into Farrudo's eye. "Good! Very good!!" The consciousness within the white light was so angry that it laughed. "We will meet again soon." He cast a deep gaze at Farrudo as the power of the Holy Light began to rapidly dissipate. This power, which remained on Adolf's body to protect him, was naturally no match for Farrudo's personal intervention. "I'll be waiting here for you." Farrudo smiled, grasping Adolf's soul in his hand, his pupils gleaming with intricate deep purple rune patterns. In the Evil Spirit Palace. Lin Sheng sat upright on the throne. His hair hung low, and he sat in complete stillness. Boom!!! Suddenly, he swept aside the low table in front of him. The furious dragon power caused the drinks and pastries on the table to fly along with the table itself, crashing into the palace wall with a resounding thud. A dragon-shaped creature carved into the wall was shattered at its neck and tumbled to the ground, causing debris to scatter around. Demon Speech Officer of the Underworld Farrudo??! Heh..." He stood up, and as the trembling attendants knelt before him, he strode toward the inner chamber at the rear, the Yin-Yang Hall. Since gaining control of the Yin Transformation Evil Wheel, he had been enjoying an uninterrupted streak of success, never encountering significant setbacks. This had somewhat inflated his sense of self. But at this moment, that single gesture from Farrudo reminded him of a feeling he hadn't experienced in a long time—defeat. It also made him permanently lose his closest disciple. It was his fault. If he hadn't shown himself, perhaps Adolf wouldn't have been so easily killed... Rage burned and boiled within his chest. Lin Sheng entered the Yin-Yang Hall and activated the scene-setting ritual left by the Elf Queen here. This ritual allowed communication with all the commanders of the legions, a special form of transmission. He had just thought about initiating the ritual to notify all the commanders to gather here and formally step into reality. However, a crazier idea rapidly formed in his mind. "Translocational Blessing." He pointed at the ground, and immediately a faint red vortex gate began to slowly take form. He didn't lose a second. Lin Sheng immediately took a step into it, and his figure quickly disappeared in the vortex gate. Chapter 475 Rescue 1 Legend was born here. History was destroyed here. The vast, ashen-black vortex rotated eternally in the sky. On the land, one can see massive, pitch-black twisted columns of smoke everywhere, within which the painful faces of individuals occasionally emerged and submerged. These were the countless souls extracted from other worlds. Among them, some were humans, and some were non-humans. Regardless of their race, once their souls arrived here after death, they were fated to become food, unable to escape this destiny. Gigantic pillars of black smoke extended from the ground to the sky, resembling columns that upheld the heavens and earth, transforming the entire world into a cavern. The Underworld was also known as the Dust World. It was a massive world that exists on the backside of the human world, persisting by consuming numerous souls as nourishment. For this realm, the souls of the world, whether good or evil, were the finest delicacies that replenished the Underworld. Countless dark smoke columns covered the ground that was densely dotted with black cracks. Among them, one column of smoke was thicker than all the others. Crash! A massive jet-black claw slowly emerged from the column of smoke. The claw had three sharp and thick claws. Following closely was a robust and muscular gray arm, upper body, and a gigantic crocodile head. Walking out from the column of smoke was a giant crocodile-like being standing over a hundred meters tall. Its green eyes shimmered with ferocious and ruthless light, and it followed a faint call from its consciousness. With one claw, it teared open the space in front of it, creating a pitch-black rift, and walked into it with a leisurely stride. "Is Farrudo summoning more true bodies so soon?? Ridiculous. I, Silvus, the Demon Blade Officer, shall heed your call." A massive voice resonated in an inexplicable language, spreading through the surroundings. Just as it was about to close the spatial rift, a pure white pillar of light descended from the sky out of nowhere, precisely landing beside the massive column of smoke. Right at the edge of the rift it had torn open. Compared with the column of smoke, the pillar of light was slender and sharp, resembling a white spike driven into the ground. Although its size was much smaller, its power fluctuations were not weak at all. "Is this the Underworld?" Just as Silvus, the Demon Blade Officer, was bewildered, a deep voice resonated from within the pillar of light. Hiss!!! In an instant, as if ink dropped into clear water, the pillar of white light dispersed a multitude of white light patterns in the blink of an eye. Among the countless light patterns, a fully armored pure white knight hovered silently within the pillar of light, floating up and down slowly. "This is the Great Divine Pillar, a resting place for many demon officers of the Underworld. Who are you?" The Demon Blade Officer sensed a hint of overbearing dominance in the pure white light and spoke first to inquire. "I am the Holy Spirit King!" The pure white knight's body suddenly swelled and grew larger, with two sharp spiral horns sprouting from his head. A more terrifying and boundless blend of chaotic soul force and holy light was spread in all directions. Once these holy lights and chaotic soul forces entered the Underworld, they were like a pack of wolves rushing into a sheepfold, leaving behind complete devastation, burning, killing, and plundering, with no forces capable of resisting it at all. Boom!!! A huge amount of holy power and chaotic soul power formed a tyrannical power that surpassed the envoy level. It instantly exploded and radiated to a few hundred meters around it, covering the area within a radius of several hundred meters in white. This made the Demon Blade Officer, who initially underestimated the knight for his stature, suddenly become more cautious. His intuition told him that the nature of the opponent's power seemed to be highly effective against him. If a fight were to break out, even if he was stronger than this opponent, the outcome might not be favorable. "Holy Spirit King? I am Silvus, the Demon Blade Officer and vanguard of the Underworld!" Emerging from the spatial rift, the crocodile-like being stepped back into its original position and gazed down at Lin Sheng from above. Lin Sheng also raised his head to look at this colossal creature standing over a hundred meters tall. Despite the vast difference in sizes, their imposing auras were evenly matched. "I've never heard of the title 'Holy Spirit King,' but I do know of a group that called themselves evil spirits, who once existed in a nearby space." With a long lifespan, Silvus naturally has heard of the evil spirits. "Before my power was fully awakened, Farrudo, Demon Speech Officer of the Underworld, took advantage of my unpreparedness to kill my disciple and seize his soul!" Lin Sheng spoke coldly, not directly answering the other's speculation. "Demon Speech Officer, Farrudo?" Silvus, the Demon Blade Officer, burst into laughter. "It seems you're also planning to settle scores with that guy. Demon Speech Officer Farrudo has really made quite a few enemies in the Underworld. Listen: do you want to join forces with me and take him down?" "Another opponent of Farrudo?" Lin Sheng had been prepared to engage in a great battle after entering the Underworld. He didn't expect to receive this kind of intelligence immediately after his arrival. Fortunately, they were both top experts in manipulating soul force, so they could communicate directly using soul power without worrying about language barriers. Otherwise, he might have really missed out on this crucial information.   "That's right," the Demon Blade Officer chuckled. "Otherwise, why do you think out of so many demon officers, only Farrudo managed to slip out so quickly? Inside the Great Divine Pillar, Farrudo has offended quite a few demon officers. He has so many enemies here that it's getting harder and harder for him to survive here. If those demon officers found out he sneaked out, they wouldn't let him off easily." "Is that so?" Lin Sheng's thoughts raced. "Then, you should know where the true body of Demon Speech Officer Farrudo is, right?" "I don't know. If other demon officers easily found out his true body, Farrudo wouldn't have been able to survive for so many years." Silvus sneered, "Judging from your aura fluctuations when you arrived, I assume you didn't come from the human realm, right? We need to find another gateway to the human realm..." "I can open a gateway to the human realm." Lin Sheng stated calmly. "However, since both of us want to kill Farrudo, what's your plan?" "I have a plan. Farrudo has too many enemies in the Underworld, so he has to find every opportunity to escape from here. This time, he found his chance, and we must kill him with a single blow, completely erasing his soul. So, I can't easily tell you the plan." Silvus stated frankly. "I understand." Lin Sheng nodded, "However, if I help you open the gateway to the human realm, that should prove that I'm not a spy working for Farrudo, right?" "That's acceptable," the Demon Blade Officer readily agreed, "As long as you can open a gateway to the human realm and locate Farrudo's true body. I've already obtained the help of another demon officer. We'll strike together when the time comes." "It would be best to wait until Farrudo fully summons his true body before we make our move. I want his soul obliterated, leaving nothing behind!" Lin Sheng said hatefully. "But in that case, you must first bring us into the human realm. Otherwise, if we descend in a haste, our strength might not be enough to completely kill Farrudo. Even if he is no rival for us, as a Devil Speech Officer, he has a strong ability to escape. There must be no room for negligence." Silvus said in a hushed tone. "Understood." Lin Sheng appeared angry on the surface, but his heart remained unaffected. This massive being seemed to want to kill Farrudo and also use this as an excuse to enter the human realm to have a good time. However, what he didn't realize was that for the current human realm, the most critical concern wasn't the Underworld' invasion. The most dangerous threat was the Black Tide. The Underworld and the Black Tide were threats of completely different levels. It was just that on the surface, the Nether Energy and death aura of the Underworld and the Black Tide were quite similar. But in reality, they were two different types of forces.
