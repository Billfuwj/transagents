Chapter 368: Out of Danger The situation was one-sided, and both sides fired all-out, and the entire sky over the ocean was filled with smoke and gunpowder. In Bai Ye's hands, the high-speed magnetic wave scanning gun fired once again, obliterating another aircraft. This weapon was incredibly effective, and he was becoming addicted to using it. Little Cutie commanded calmly by his side. The air force of the First Terrorist Organization formed an indomitable attack and defense team, and they launched the final fierce assault. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Nikla couldn't care about etiquette anymore and raised his voice, "Master, we should retreat. If we keep fighting like this, we'll be completely wiped out." Louis clenched his fists tightly, his face clouded with anger, and his entire body exuding a strong aura of resentment. He was well aware of the current situation. However, he was unwilling to accept defeat. They were so close, and he could have captured them. It was truly annoying to fail at the last moment. The man's jade-green eyes flashed with killing intent. Then, he concealed back into his deep and melancholic eyes. He nodded at Nikla and immediately ordered a retreat. Louis gazed at the two figures floating above the sea, snorting coldly. They were lucky this time, but he wouldn't let them off so easily. "Darling, they're retreating. Should we pursue them?" Bai Ye chuckled lightly. He was deeply fond of the magnetic wave scanning gun and holding it as if cradling a child. The corners of his lips curled into an indifferent and dangerous smile. Little Cutie also smiled elegantly and he ordered the cessation of the attack. A serene calmness filled his dark eyes as he calmly said, "If we don't pursue, it would be a pity to let him die just like that. The game of cat and mouse has just begun." This game had already turned the tide. It was the last thing for Louis to have provoked him. Nuonuo died, and he had to find someone to accompany her in the afterlife. Otherwise, he would not be able to swallow his anger. It was up to Louis to decide when the game began, but... Little Cutie's smile turned icy, chilling and oppressive. He had the final say when the game would end. Smiling casually, Bai Ye swept his sleeves elegantly. "Alright, no pursuit. We have everything needed to play with him. Maybe they won't even get the chance to make a move before someone deals with Louis." Little Cutie looked in the direction they had fled and sneered silently. "Chu Li, it's over. There's no need for reinforcements. We'll head back immediately." After contacting Chu Li over the phone, Bai Ye ordered his subordinates to turn back to Rome.  It took tremendous effort for Black Hawk and the others to pull Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya up. They knew Cheng Anya carried the virus, so they had taken precautions. Third Young Master Ye had also warned them about the virus on his body, and Black Hawk and the others were even more careful. Third Young Master Ye lay down, panting heavily like an ox. He couldn't help but kick Cheng Anya lightly. "Little Anya, you need to lose some weight, you're too heavy." His both shoulders were somewhat numb from swimming in the sea for so long. He had consumed quite a bit of his physical strength, and now carrying Cheng Anya like this, it was quite a strain on his arms. He had almost failed to hold onto her and almost dropped her into the sea. Just thinking about that scene sent shivers down his spine. Black Hawk and the others cheered because they were safe now. They handed out towels and poured hot water, and all of them were busy. Someone took the opportunity to tease Third Young Master Ye about how he had been doing these days. The atmosphere on the plane was lively. When men got together, it was inevitable to have a sense of heroism. Cheng Anya wiped her hair with the towel given by Black Hawk, wrapping herself in a blanket to keep warm. She automatically tuned deaf ears to Third Young Master Ye's words, feeling relieved that they were finally safe. She sneezed and couldn't help but wrap the blanket tighter around herself. Black Hawk laughed and said, "Third Young Master, if Madam gets any thinner, you might complain that she's nothing but bones." "I already find her skinny now." Third Young Master Ye also got up, wiping off the seawater from his body. "That's why she is so heavy: nothing but bones." Cheng Anya continued to embrace the virtue of silence as Black Hawk found two sets of clothes for them to change into. As they were men's clothes, they looked rather comical on Miss Cheng. She simply wrapped herself in the blanket. As soon as they changed their clothes, Black Hawk told her that Ningning wanted to talk to her. Cheng Anya excitedly grabbed the microphone, "Darling, it's Mommy." "Hi, Mommy. Missed your baby?" Little Cutie sat on the sofa, his face full of smiles as he chatted with Cheng Anya. It had been a long time since he heard his mommy's voice, and he missed her a lot. "Not at all." Cheng Anya coldly snorted, revealing a fierce tone. "You're so clueless. You only managed to find Mommy now. You deserve to be beaten up." Thinking of Xu Nuo, Ningning felt his heart skip a beat. He then smiled and said, "Alright, baby is willing to be beaten up. When you are back in Rome, you can beat me however you like. I really miss Mommy too. Mommy, you don't care about me, I despise you." "Despise you back." Cheng Anya burst into laughter and asked with concern, "Are you hurt in any way?" "No, I'm fine. Nothing happened to me. Don't worry." Ningning smiled and said, "Mommy, the plane is about to land. Talk to you later." "Okay." Little Cutie turned off the communication device, and Cheng Anya warmed herself with hot water. Third Young Master Ye had been eagerly waiting for a chance to chat with his son, but the call got cut before he could say anything. He was very displeased and glared at Cheng Anya with accusing eyes. Miss Cheng calmly ignored him, and Black Hawk laughed, "Third Young Master, the plane is about to land. You'll get to see the Little Master in a while." Third Young Master Ye felt that he had been completely ignored. He couldn't help but pinch Miss Cheng. "You heartless little thing." "Narrow-minded." Cheng Anya playfully scolded, handing him the hot water. Third Young Master Ye held Miss Cheng's cup and drank the remaining hot water. It would have been wonderful if he had some alcohol to warm his body. The plane soon landed in the castle. Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, and others were all there. Upon seeing that Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya were safe, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. "Third brother, third sister-in-law, you look quite a scene..." Ye Wei laughed so hard that she was trembling. "Third brother, I should have taken a picture to commemorate this moment." "Naughty girl." Third Young Master Ye laughed and scolded, feeling relieved that Weiwei, Eleven, and Little Cutie were all fine. He finally felt relieved after all the trouble they went through. After spending so much effort, how could anything else happen again? Little Cutie happily wanted to hug Cheng Anya but was sternly stopped by strict order. Only then did Little Cutie remember that his Mommy had a virus on her, as Black Hawk had already mentioned. He then looked at his Daddy and Mommy holding each other's hands. His heart sank slightly. "Daddy, Mommy, you are... Bai Ye, hurry up and take a look at them." Little Cutie's first reaction was to seek Bai Ye's help. He was a genius doctor, and there was no disease he couldn't treat. "I know, I know. Don't worry." Bai Ye laughed. "A virus?" A handsome man with blond hair and blue eyes blinked. "Little Bai, this is not your strong point, right?" Little Bai? Bai Ye twisted his wrists, and his smile was cool and gentle. "Jason, try calling me Little Bai again?" "F*ck, what's wrong with me calling you Little Bai? You have been known to everyone as Little Bai, and you guys also address Black Jack as Little Tie." Jason, who was known as the Flame-spitting Dragon, was furious on the spot, just like a golden lion king, yet he was outrageously handsome. Especially that pair of sky-blue eyes, which were as dazzling as sapphire. When he got angry, there was a terrifying aura that made people tremble, as if a volcano was erupting. He had a very domineering presence. On the other side, Black Jack was a young man in his twenties with refined features. He was of Chinese and British descent, having an air of mystery in his Eastern features and a profoundness in his Western ones. He had a pair of grey-blue eyes that always seemed hazy, giving off an illusion of deep emotions. But upon closer inspection, people would discover his extreme acumen and his well-concealed restraint. The two leaders of the First Terrorist Organization were both young and had different personalities. However, their auras were both very strong. Each of them exuded a sense of dominance, not to mention that the three top leaders of the organization were all present. A look at this row of people gave off a strong visual impact. "Jason, you really need to be taught a lesson." Eleven snorted, "Couldn't he find a better name than Little Bai? Little Bai, beat him up." Everyone was speechless.... Ye Wei glanced at them and shook her head. "Third brother, third sister-in-law, don't mind them. You should take a hot bath first before having a medical check to prevent getting sick." She called a maid to take Ye Chen and Cheng Anya downstairs to freshen up. Little Cutie really wanted to go with them, but he stayed behind as Bai Ye seemed ready to start fighting someone, so Little Cutie quickly grabbed his sleeve. "Bai Ye, can you save my Mommy and Daddy?" The child's eyes were bright, like two black grapes embedded in his fair face, full of expectation. It seemed that if Bai Ye shook his head, the light in his eyes would dim. Jason grabbed Little Cutie and hugged him fiercely, feeling quite confident. "Darling, don't worry. Little Bai can save even the dead, not to mention living people. Stop worrying about them and come help me take down the Mafia's line of defense when you have time." "Who was questioning Bai Ye's medical skills just now?" Black Jack expressed doubt about this. Jason threw a punch at him, but he agilely dodged it. Being carried by the tall man, Little Cutie felt extremely conflicted and kicked Jason. "Put me down." "I also want a son like you. Ningning, will you be my son? I've been coveting you for a long time." Jason's azure eyes burst with enthusiasm as if Little Cutie was a rare piece of jewelry. Everyone was speechless.... Bai Ye smiled and said, "Jason, let your mother help you improve your Chinese. Don't always complain that the commander doesn't know how to use words. You're not much better." "I'm not on the same level as the commander, okay?" Jason was very dissatisfied that someone had compared him to the commander. It was a matter of principle that officials and bandits were not on the same side. Little Cutie struggled a little, and Jason put him down. Little Cutie asked, "Bai Ye...." "Ningning, don't worry. I'll check them up before making a conclusion." Bai Ye said, rubbing the head of Little Cutie, "I promise I will do my best." Little Cutie Bun had just lost Xu Nuo, and his parents' life and death were hanging in the wind. No matter how calm he was, he felt uneasy. He could not lose them again. Bai Ye understood his current mentality very well. "Don't worry too much." Bai Ye said. Ye Wei said, "It's done. Leave it to Bai Ye. There is no problem in this world that cannot be solved. Since Louis can develop the virus, there must be an antidote. It can't be incurable. If Bai Ye can't cure it, we will remove his signboard." "I agree," Chu Li smiled. "Xiao Bai, do you have a signboard?" Jason was puzzled. He had never known what kind of signboard he had. Eleven wanted to punch him. "Speaking of which, why didn't the two of you bring Louis back?" Black Jack asked, "The sooner this guy died, the earlier we would feel relieved." "I've been wanting to kill him for a long time. Recently, the Mafia has been making trouble all over the world. This guy's headquarters has been destroyed, and he still has the mood to play with women. He's really a stupid ass." "Louis, don't be in a hurry." Little Cutie said slowly with a dangerous smile on his face. His pitch-black eyes were full of shrewdness. "Winning without fighting is the highest level of victory. He does have a personal grudge with us, but the battle between the Mafia and the terrorist organization is another matter. If we want to annihilate the Mafia, it will definitely take us a lot of money and resources. After this fight, his position in the Mafia is on the verge of collapse. I have always suspected that the Mafia still has a force hidden in places we can't see. Otherwise, they wouldn't have turned blind eyes to Louis' suicidal act. Since that's the case, let's have Lewis lead the way for us, uncover this force, and annihilate them in one fell swoop." How scheming.... This was the unanimous thought of everyone. Although they knew he was always cunning and crafty, they couldn't help but dote on him because he was young. Coupled with his delicate appearance, it made people overlook his true nature. "How cunning!" Jason gave him a thumbs-up. He was an action-oriented person and didn't think too much like the others. However, most of the time, he would agree with Black Jack and Chu Li's plans. He was even more obedient when it came to Little Cutie's plans. With an absolute action-oriented figure supported by a powerful think tank, this combination of forces was quite terrifying. "I agree with Ningning's plan," Chu Li said, and he and Bai Ye had always supported his ideas. "It's great to settle things once and for all, so no one dares to provoke us recklessly."  "When have you ever refuted Ningning? You are birds of a feather." Black Jack laughed, "But this time, it is indeed time to teach the Mafia a lesson so that he will take a detour when he sees us within fifty years." Bai Ye nodded. He did not have any objections. His first priority was to cure the virus in Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya. This was the key. As for the rest, he would leave it to Chu Li. Ye Wei and Eleven looked at each other. Another force? In their hearts, they both pictured the same faces—Mo Ye and Mo Jue. Within the Mafia, only they had enough influence and were mysterious and unpredictable. Besides them, they couldn't think of anyone else who would have such charisma. As a man superior to Louis, it was unreasonable for him to take orders from Louis. Everyone moved to the living room. Little Cutie went to look for Cheng Anya. She had just finished taking a bath and had a cup of hot tea. Her body was warm and her cheeks were pink. She was now on the bed, looking thoughtfully at her fingers. "Mommy..." Little Cutie pushed open the door and entered, smiling as he approached. Cheng Anya came to her senses. She squinted her eyes and praised, "Darling, you look really classy." With this outfit, he didn't have a single trace of childlike charm. He looked like every inch a dangerous person. "Thank you for your praise, Mommy." "Don't go near me. Stay away from me. I'm afraid I can't help but beat you up." "Sit there," Cheng Anya said, pointing to the sofa opposite her. "Mommy, you look down on me." Little Cutie glared at Cheng Anya, "Mommy, you like me no more." "Correct." Cheng Anya laughed. She glanced at Little Cutie. She always felt that there was something different about this child. Although he looked no different from the past, a mother understood her child the best. She could more or less sense some changes in his body. No matter how well he managed to hide them, she could more or less sense the changes. "Mommy, why are you looking at me like that? Do you think that your baby has become more handsome?" Little Cutie blinked mischievously, looking extremely cute. Cheng Anya looked at him with a half-smile. "You've learned eighty to nighty percent of your Daddy's narcissism. Are you okay recently? Tell Mommy the truth. Have you been bullied?" "No," Little Cutie shook his head. "Nonsense, Louis showed me the photos. You have clearly been beaten and covered in blood." Cheng Anya clearly didn't believe it. Gritting her teeth, she said, "Even if he was tortured to death, I won't be satisfied." Recalling everything that had happened to her before, Cheng Anya hated Louis to the core. Her bright and beautiful face was covered with a layer of coldness. When she thought of what Little Cutie had experienced, she had a bad feeling. "Mommy, I'm really fine. He probably faked the photo." Little Cutie smiled gracefully and rolled up his sleeve, revealing a white and tender arm. "Look, there is no scar at all." The gunshot wound on his arm had healed almost entirely in a short time. He wouldn't be afraid of Cheng Anya finding it out. As for the whip injures he had once suffered, they were all left by Xu Nuo. Since they were inflicted by Xu Nuo, he didn't feel like he had been bullied. Instead, he somewhat missed the pain of being beaten by her back then. If Nuonuo could live, he would rather be beaten by her in this life. "Ningning, are you really alright?" Cheng Anya's brows furrowed, not missing the trace of pain that flashed through her son's eyes. Little Cutie nodded. "I'm really fine. Mommy, it's you and Daddy who are in trouble. Uncle Black Hawk said that you have a virus on you. Why is Daddy also infected?" Cheng Anya was speechless.... Cheng Anya remembered Third Young Master Ye, who was obsessed with sex at that time, and her cheeks turned red again. She no longer had the desire and passion to speak about it. "Let's not talk about it. We jumped from an airplane together in the desert and again in the sea. How could we not have bodily contact?" Miss Cheng spoke very calmly, and Little Cutie did not suspect her. "Mommy, nothing will happen. Bai Ye's medical skills are so brilliant that he will definitely be able to save you." Chapter 399 Be Self-dependent and Self-sufficient After conducting a detailed examination, Bai Ye took blood samples from both of them for a more comprehensive analysis. A rare seriousness appeared on his face, and Little Cutie had a bad premonition. In the past, when Cheng Anya was hit and infected with bacteria, the doctors concluded that she would have to undergo amputation to survive. However, Bai Ye didn't even spare a glance and left a sarcastic remark before elegantly entering the laboratory. It seemed that there was no illness in the world that could defeat the genius doctor Bai Ye. Last year, even when Chu Li was hit by 23 bullets, Bai Ye remained composed and calm. This was a kind of super-confidence in himself. In this field, he was like a mythical existence, and there shouldn't be any illness that he would find challenging. However, this time, as Jason predicted, the virus was not Bai Ye's strong suit. Once he showed a serious expression, it indicated that the situation wasn't looking favorable. Jason even patted Bai Ye's shoulder in a friendly manner to express his sympathy. "So, you finally encountered a difficult case. Quite rare, huh? It's like Little Cutie being a mythical figure in the field of computer technology but yet being surpassed by the Mo brothers, Mo Ye and Mo Jue." Bai Ye contacted over a dozen virus experts from Rome to come to the castle for joint research, and the entire castle was shrouded in a solemn atmosphere. The parties involved, however, remained calm. Cheng Anya had long accepted her fate. While fleeing, she had already felt that even if she had to die, it was not a big deal for her. She had experienced love, both passionate and devoted. She had Ye Chen, whom she loved with all her heart. She had a happy family, and her career was also thriving. She had experienced almost everything a woman should experience in her lifetime. Being able to have this exciting and tumultuous journey was more than enough for her, and she was quite content. Her only regret was not being able to see Ningning one last time. Now that this wish had been fulfilled, life and death no longer mattered to her. Third Young Master Ye didn't care either. Neither of them feared death, and they appeared much calmer than expected by the others. Chu Li said, "This is what we call guts." At this moment, everyone was in the conference hall discussing the virus, saying that there were only five days left for Third Young Master Ye. Cheng Anya suddenly remembered something, "Rong Yan gave us a reagent to delay the onset of the virus. It might buy us a few more days." She had almost forgotten the matter about Rong Yan and Chu Li amidst all the chaos. Although Rong Yan didn't explicitly ask them to pass a message to Chu Li, it was an unspoken understanding. Even if Rong Yan didn't say anything, Cheng Anya and Third Young Master Ye would still inform Chu Li. Chu Li opened his eyes wide and fixed them on Cheng Anya. His gaze was steady but filled with urgency, which startled Cheng Anya. Jason, Black Jack, and the others who were laughing and talking, also fell silent. "You have news from Rong Yan." Chu Li asked calmly, his tone normal, but heavily suppressed. It was apparent to everyone that he was tense and rigid. Little Cutie was also surprised, and Third Young Master Ye explained the situation. Chu Li got up with a swish, "Thanks!" He only uttered those two words and hurriedly left. Jason and Black Jack quickly followed him. Ye Wei chuckled, "The dark-hearted Chu Li is overjoyed this time. See how anxious he is; it's a rare sight in a century." The First Terrorist Organization was about to launch a large-scale military operation, with the three major powerhouses joining forces. It would undoubtedly be a ferocious event, and Ye Wei mourned in her heart for Prince William. Ye Wei silently mourned for Prince William in her heart. Someone's existence and possession would definitely suffer severe losses, and maybe even the whole thing would be wiped out. Since Rong Yan could make it, Bai Ye should be able to make it too. Little Cutie pondered, realizing that Bai Ye's entire focus was on curing his parents' virus, and he was still thinking about it when a man approached him, "Little Master, Brother Chu wants you to go to the study." Little Cutie pursed his lips, "Daddy, Mommy, I'll be back with you later." Cheng Anya and Third Young Master Ye exchanged a glance, both feeling that their son had grown up. Judging by the fact that he was addressed as "Little Master", he was poised to be a part of the First Terrorist Organization. Little Cutie's presence had transformed dramatically, and he was completely different from the obedient son he used to be in front of her. Well, since their son had made his choice, they would support him unconditionally. Third Young Master Ye was quite pleased; his son was truly outstanding, and he felt proud and happy about it. Cheng Anya thoughtfully watched his back disappear into the corridor. When she came back to her senses, she asked Ye Wei, "Weiwei, has something happened to Ningning?" A mother knew her child the best. When she asked about it, Little Cutie didn't say anything, but it didn't mean she truly believed that he was fine. Ye Wei admired her third sister-in-law's acuity. She and Eleven looked at each other, considering if they should tell them about what happened to Xu Nuo. Third Young Master Ye knew at a glance that there must be something hidden from them. "Weiwei, speak." Ye Wei glanced at them and then gave an account of what happened to Ningning and Xu Nuo, including Xu Nuo's death and Little Cutie's temporary loss of sight, and she did not hide anything. The more Cheng Anya listened, the gloomier she felt in her heart. No wonder she felt that her son's gaze had changed. It wasn't as clear and innocent as it used to be. Even with his unusually powerful background, he used to be just a child, still somewhat naive. But experiencing certain things and setback could alter one's gaze, making them look different. It wasn't her being overly sensitive. Third Young Master Ye also furrowed his brows, feeling a bit distressed for his son's experience. He also felt extremely guilty in his heart. If Cheng Anya had died for him in this situation, perhaps he would have gone crazy rather than simply losing his sight. This was quite similar to his past experience of self-seclusion. "Are you sure the girl is dead?" Cheng Anya asked. Ye Wei nodded, "Our people searched and confirmed that she is dead. Speaking of Nuonuo, I'm furious..." Ye Wei slammed the table and explained Xu Nuo's background, "This Nuonuo was to blame for every bit of misfortune. The heavens are truly cruel."   Third Young Master Ye paused for a moment, "Xu Mingyang and I have some business dealings, and he seems quite righteous. I couldn't tell that he would be so superstitious. Is there something else behind this?" "It's not like that," Eleven said. "I checked the Miao family's information, and there is indeed such a horoscope. Although it's about fortune-telling, it's surprisingly accurate. The Miao family indeed has such a curse, but there are countless methods, and abandoning Xu Nuo and letting others raise her is understandable and acceptable. However, this pair of parents are too cruel." Both Cheng Anya and Third Young Master Ye fell silent. If this were true, their son's future would be worrisome. Especially Cheng Anya. She wasn't being over-worried for nothing, because she knew her son best. It seemed like he hadn't changed in the eyes of others, but this was only an illusion, a deceptive superficial phenomenon. Once the heart became desolate, the person was like a walking corpse. "Third sister-in-law, don't worry too much. Ningning is still young. Maybe things will get better as he grows up," Ye Wei said. After all, they were just kids. Even if they had deep feelings now, it would gradually fade with time. In this world, even the deepest love couldn't withstand the destruction of time. Cheng Anya smiled lightly and responded with a soft "mm." Ye Wei's words were meant to ease their worries, and even Third Young Master Ye knew that it was harder to forget than to remember. Falling in love with someone takes only a second. Forgetting someone, however, might take a lifetime. Third Young Master Ye asked about the situation in Dragon Sector, and Ye Wei didn't hide anything, providing a detailed account. The situation was not optimistic; the three bigshots in Dragon Sector were all in trouble, especially Lin Yixuan, who was currently facing numerous issues. "Brother, don't worry about this matter. Your priority should be to resolve the virus in your body. Longmen has plenty of capable people to take charge when needed," Ye Wei said coquettishly, "Louis is making trouble recently, but he'll definitely take a break. You don't know that last night, the commander scolded us to death. That battle in the sea was quite sensational." Fighting with advanced weapons with the world's largest illegal arms dealer involved, how could it not be sensational? Eleven coldly smiled, "According to Jason's statistics last night, thirteen countries have paid a fortune to purchase this firearm, and all of them are heavyweight countries. They have been issuing joint statements about combating terrorists and exterminating terrorist organizations. Yet, behind the scenes, they are buying our weapons." "So, the truth, the truth is nothing but floating clouds!" Ye Wei smiled even more alluringly. Miss Cheng didn't express her opinion, and Third Young Master Ye just smiled and passed it over. The arms market was controlled by Jason, Black Jack, and Chu Li, so they indeed had a lot of control over the international chokepoints. They were too powerful for anyone to ignore. The next successor in line was their son, Ningning, so their influence was bound to be even more substantial. Third Young Master Ye chatted for a while before going to find Black Hawk to understand the current situation in Dragon Secor. Ye Wei approached Cheng Anya, "Third sister-in-law, don't mention the matter we just talked about to Ningning." "Why?" "This child hasn't mentioned Nuonuo since regaining his sight." "I understand," Cheng Anya said, "Thank you all. Without you, Ningning would probably be in grave danger." "We should thank Nuonuo as well. Ningning's life was exchanged with hers." At noon, five fighter jets took off from the castle, along with three helicopters, all flying towards Mesillia. Chu Li, Jason, and Black Jack were all on board. In fact, Chu Li could handle this alone. There was no need for all three major terrorist leaders to take action in unison. Jason was just bored, and so was Black Jack. Since the Mafia was not causing any trouble at the moment and was in a phase of recuperation, they wanted to do something to keep themselves busy. In the research lab, chaos reigned as more than a dozen virus experts were in a state of panic. Bai Ye's face grew even graver, and for the first time, he seemed at a loss. His typically detached eyebrows were tightly furrowed together. The leader of the virus expert team asked, "Mr. Bai, who exactly developed this virus?" "I've been in this field for almost 40 years and have never seen such a vicious virus." "It was developed by the Mafia," Bai Ye replied, his eyes fixed on the large LCD screen displaying the molecular decomposition of the virus. Although viruses were not his specialty, Bai Ye had some knowledge in the area, and his achievements were usually remarkable. However, he had never encountered such a complex virus before. "That's bad," the team leader pondered. "In June of the year before last, over a hundred virus experts from all over the world gathered in Rome. One of them was my good friend. We met, and he mentioned that he was researching a virus for the Mafia, most probably this one." "Can you still find him?" Bai Ye asked in a deep voice. Over a hundred virus experts; they were probably all top talents. "He has passed away," the team leader said solemnly, and Bai Ye immediately understood. These virus experts were directly affiliated with the terrorists and were Rome's finest experts, and if they said they couldn't do it, it was probably.... Hope was slim. "Mr. Bai, do you have no clues either?" Bai Ye shook his head, "This is the most challenging disease I've encountered." This virus was far too complex. "I'll have you prepare the best relievers. We should buy as much time as possible." Bai Ye said in a deep voice, and the team leader left to give the order. Even if they couldn't find the antidote, they could still prepare relievers. However, the relievers would only be effective for about 20 days at most. Bai Ye thought of Little Cutie's anxious expression, and his heart sank. "Mr. Bai, I checked all the records of past viruses, and this is a new virus that has never appeared before." A middle-aged man handed him a report. "But in 1934, a similar virus spread in Siberia. It was also contagious and a cell virus, and the symptoms of the carriers were similar to Miss Cheng's. The only difference was that there was no second wave of infection. Infected individuals had a lifespan of only one month, but the principles should be similar." The government announced that it was a nuclear leak resulting from wars, but the real reason was the virus." Bai Ye's eyes lit up. He immediately grabbed the report and greedily read the information on it. This virus was named Su-1934 and was extremely terrifying. It had spread in a small town in Siberia back then. Later, the government closed all exits from the town to prevent the virus from spreading and cleared the entire town. Nearly 50 thousand people died. This was also a cell virus, and it was the most similar case they could find. "Check all the information from 1934. I want all the data." Bai Ye ordered in a deep voice, and the man nodded before immediately going to gather the information. Bai Ye leaned on the computer with his white coat and narrowed his eyes. In the research lab, people were busy studying the virus, and various reagents were being combined for research. "Mr. Bai, how about this? Since the Mafia developed this, they should know the antidote." The team leader said, "Researching a new virus takes a long time, and Third Young Master Ye and Miss Cheng probably can't wait." Even with the relievers, they could only have 20 additional days at most, and they probably wouldn't have any clues within those 20 days. Moreover, this virus was highly unstable and was a cell virus. If it had a sudden outbreak, the relievers would be useless, and they would undoubtedly die. "We need to be self-dependent and self-sufficient." Bai Ye said with a calm expression, uttering a great maxim. The team leader was speechless.... Louis had dared to heartlessly open fire at Cheng Anya and Third Young Master Ye. It was impossible for him to provide an antidote. He had long expected that they would try to detoxify Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya and knew they wouldn't succeed. They would definitely look for him for help then. At that time, he would surely stay away from them. By the time they found him, Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya would probably be dead. He couldn't afford such a risk. He was certain that Louis wouldn't show himself anytime soon, so why bother wasting time and effort? Cheng Anya and Third Young Master Ye went to sleep immediately after having lunch and. After returning last night, they had been busy with medical check and blood sampling. They hadn't slept well, and the virus was gradually devouring their bodies, leaving them both fatigued. Mo Jue had been ignored by Ye Wei all day, and he was very displeased. He grabbed Ye Wei's sleeve and kept complaining with a resentful stare. Ye Wei really wanted to kick him into the swimming pool. Little Cutie was very curious about this version of Mo Jue. "Aunt, how long has he been like this?" "Five days," Ye Wei said. "He's possessed." Little Cutie was very curious about this kind of Mo Jue. The pure and innocent Mo Jue, with his captivating purple eyes, was as pure as a flower untouched by pollution. He had lost every trace of his previous sly and sinister nature. For someone who had seen the Mo Jue from the past and then witnessed him calling Ye Wei "darling", it was really impactful. "Darling, you're talking behind my back." Mo Jue's purple eyes were filled with grievances as he pouted and bit Ye Wei's cheek. Little Cutie shivered. This tone was something he wasn't accustomed to. Even when he was three years old, he didn't act like this when he played the role of a spoiled child with his mother. Ye Wei had long been accustomed to him being handsy with her. She patted him in the head. "Silly, your darling admires ghosts the most. She talks behind the person's back whom she likes the most. This is praise for you, you know?" "Really?" Mo Jue, with pure eyes, looked at her with innocence. Ye Wei's face didn't blush and her heart didn't beat faster at all. "Of course, when has your darling ever lied to you?" Little Cutie was speechless. This was way too.... Too calm. He couldn't help but marvel at Ye Wei's calmness and boldness, something that ordinary people couldn't possess the slightest bit. "Aunt, can he find Mo Ye?" Little Cutie didn't care if Mo Jue could understand or not and asked directly. "He said he can't find him," Ye Wei said. "Mo Jue, as a block of ice, seems to be very powerful. After all, he is the second-in-command." Little Cutie was speechless.... Mo Jue looked aggrieved again and hugged Ye Wei while biting her. Little Cutie felt this wasn't suitable for children and got up to go to the research lab. "Ningning, why are you here?" "No clue yet?" At the sight of Ba Ye's grave expression, Little Cutie knew things weren't going well. He was mentally prepared. Just then, someone brought the 1934 virus data, and Bai Ye said, "I'll tell you in a moment." He focused on the information, and Little Cutie was curious, so he went over to take a look. Su-1934 was well-documented in the files, including its danger, the number of deaths, and the government's stern measures. What Bai Ye was most concerned about was its designer. "Su Jinxiao?" "Su Jinxiao?" Bai Ye mumbled. The name sounded very unfamiliar. It was the first time he heard about it. The key was that it was claimed to be an accidental nuclear leakage that resulted in cruel deaths. Only a few people knew about the virus's harm. Little Cutie had a sudden realization, "Su Man's grandfather." Chapter 370: Heading to Riyadh Upon learning that the designer of the 1934 virus was Su Man's grandfather, Little Cutie immediately contacted Su Man. On the side, Ye Wei was in great distress, her heart was filled with anger and resentment while she stared intensely at Little Cutie. Her long, slender fingers made her seem as if a ghost ready to strangle Little Cutie's throat and bring him to justice on the spot. Eleven naturally knew why and remained calm. Mo Jue pursed his rosy lips, looked at his wife, and weakly commented, "Darling, you're so scary!" Everyone agreed. Indeed, she was terrifying. Even Third Young Master Ye feared that his own sister would devour his son. Her expression was extraordinarily terrifying, and everyone felt extremely horrified. Bai Ye touched his own nose, and only Eleven knew the reason. While waiting for Su Man to answer the call, Little Cutie raised an eyebrow at his aunt, "Aunt, what are you doing?" "I hate you, I hate you..." Ye Wei's previously charming face turned into that of a resentful ghost. Her eyes even sent chills down Ningning's spine. Before he could say anything, Su Man responded from the other end of the line. "Ningning?" Su Man's voice was extremely pleasant, like the morning breeze blowing over a mountain top—chilly but refreshing, untainted by the mundane world. It made people feel that she was far from their reach, unattainable, and not to be profaned. "Yes, Beauty Su, I need to talk to you. Can you get online? I'll send you something." Ningning sounded urgent and, in his haste, forgot to exchange greetings or pay attention to his aunt's resentful gaze. "Something happened?" "Yes, a life-threatening situation." Ningning was not hiding anything. "Go ahead, I'm online." Su Man didn't ask further but calmly responded. As soon as Ningning said yes, Ye Wei grabbed the phone, "Beauty Su, long time no see, have you missed me?" There was a moment of silence from the other side... "Ye Wei?" "Why are you calling me in such a formal manner? Just call me Weiwei. We've been honest with each other before, so there is no need to be so distant." Ye Wei held the phone, smiling enchantingly, with a voice as alluring as she could sound. Mo Jue pursed his lips, and it was now his turn to gaze at Ye Wei with resentment. His wife's demeanor, tone, and smile were all blatantly suggestive. It was as if she intended to have an affair with Su Man. Mo Jue's little universe burned brightly; he wanted to dismember Su Man and tear him apart into five pieces. A cold killing intent instantly filled the air. Eleven, Bai Ye, and Ye Chen shuddered at the same time. Ye Wei only raised her eyebrows and glanced at Mo Jue. She then gracefully ignored him. The killing intent around Mo Jue grew stronger. In that moment, everyone felt that he was about to revert to his previous self. But despite his furious demeanor, his eyes remained pure, filled with killing intent but not viciousness. Clenching his fists with deep distress, he didn't seem to have any intention of taking concrete action. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. "Busy, hanging up," Su Man said with finality and promptly ended the call. Ye Wei's beauty is not something every man can be fortunate enough to enjoy. It's a true test of one's endurance, as even someone as composed as Su Man chose to keep his distance from her. Ye Wei naturally possessed a formidable charm that set her apart from most women. If she wanted to tangle with a man, no matter who the other party was, he could only choose to evade her. There was absolutely no way for the man to counteract and resist her charm. "Beauty Su is too mean. He just dismissed me with three words." Ye Wei held the phone, full of sorrow and indignation. "What a waste of feelings, considering how much I daydreamed about him." Cheng Anya and Ye Chen smiled. Bai Ye went to Little Cutie's side, and Ningning sent Su Man the information Bai Ye had prepared. Eleven pointed at the ghost-like Mo Jue. Ye Wei restrained her smile and asked innocently, "Big Bai, who bullied you? Tell me and I will beat him up for you."  Mo Jue was also quite interesting. He pointed his index finger straight at Ye Wei and complained in grief and indignation, "Darling, you bullied me." Everyone was speechless.... Ye Chen pursed his lips and smiled, not wanting to make Ye Wei embarrassed. It was evident that this innocent Mo Jue was undoubtedly Ye Wei's nemesis. All her twists and turns in mind were of no use; he was like a child, expressing his dissatisfaction with the most direct actions. He had no understanding of facial expressions whatsoever. Ye Wei smiled elegantly, "So, you mean to say I should beat myself up?" Mo Jue, unwilling and dissatisfied, widened his eyes and swiftly rushed to Ye Wei's side. Grabbing her sleeve, he howled, "Darling, who is he? Who is he? Why are you so nice to him? You're enticing him!" Eleven was a little startled. Enticing him? Even innocent Mo Jue knew what enticing meant; it was truly a miracle. Just a few days ago, when he turned into Big Bai, he was like a blank piece of paper, understanding nothing except his darling. But now, he understood everything. Ye Wei's ability to contaminate people was truly formidable. She managed to change such a pure child like him into a dirty-minded person. She was really impressive and deserved to be praised with the single word "formidable". If Mo Jue returned to his former self, he would remember the days when he was Big Bai. Uh... Even if Weiwei had ten heads, they would not be enough for him to pluck. This man was so ruthless. How could he let her go? She was now a little worried about Weiwei's future. Ye Wei gently patted Mo Jue in the face, smiling charmingly and beguilingly, "Big Bai, how can you wrong your wife like this? He's hundreds of kilometers away from me; there's no way I could entice him. If I want to entice anyone, it'll be you." "Darling, you don't love me anymore. Darling, don't transfer your affections elsewhere. Da Bai will be very obedient, very obedient." Mo Jue showed a pitiful expression, clinging to Ye Wei's arm as if he was afraid she would dump him. Ye Wei was speechless. What kind of language did this child use? Speaking of transferring her affections elsewhere, one is in the past tense, and the other is in the present tense. Even if she did, she was transferring her affections from Su Man to Ye Jue! Beauty Ye was truly embarrassed. "Darling..." Mo Jue wasn't that easy to brush off. Ye Wei punched him in the abdomen, "Stop fooling around. Otherwise, I'll beat you until you can't even recognize your brother." Everyone was speechless.... Miss Cheng and Third Young Master Ye watched the spectacle with great amusement, exchanging a smile. They found the way these two interacted with each other very interesting. Miss Cheng also secretly mused that this man's two extremes were truly challenging. She had witnessed the scars on Ye Wei's body before, the result of being beaten to a pitiful state. Her wrist was almost crippled by the iron lotus. From those scars, one could tell how ruthless this man was with her. Now, he had turned into such an innocent guy, allowing her to casually squish and mold him. It was indeed quite a challenge. Only someone as fierce as Ye Wei could handle him. Mo Jue was exceptionally aggrieved, his purple eyes brimming with tears of grievance. His rosy lips trembled like autumn leaves falling to the ground, and everyone around was quite startled. Little Cutie witnessed this unusual scene for the first time. Thinking of the extremely vicious character he had seen at the supermarket, his lips curved cunningly, "Uncle Big Bai, do you know who Beauty Su is? He was my aunt's ex-boyfriend, oh. My aunt was very enthusiastic about him, and she pursued him for a whole year. This time, she must be jealous of me having Su Man's contact information while she doesn't." Upon hearing this, Mo Jue's gaze turned even more resentful as he looked at Ye Wei. He stood up abruptly, his anger raging, which surprisingly made him look handsome and resolute as he left, sweeping away in a huff. Ye Wei was dumbfounded... She was truly embarrassed! F**k, Mo Jue! You are rebelling! He actually showed her his back, throwing a tantrum. What a promising kid, she thought sarcastically. Miss Cheng calmly smiled and said, "Weiwei, you should go and appease him. He's genuinely annoyed." "Weiwei, it seems like it's the first time he's been angry with you?" Eleven asked curiously, feeling it seemed to be true. From that day on, Mo Jue had always treated Ye Wei with the utmost respect. Whatever Ye Wei said, he wouldn't dare to disagree; if Ye Wei wanted someone dead, he wouldn't let them live. In short, Ye Wei's words were like royal decrees, and her words were the ultimate truth. He obeyed her every command and was obedient to the extreme. How would he dare to make Ye Wei angry? He was afraid she would abandon him at the slightest dissatisfaction. This was truly a spectacle. Eleven's explanation was that Ye Wei not only changed Mo Jue's appearance but also his temperament. Having caused the trouble, Little Cutie smiled elegantly, and Bai Ye raised his thumb. It was rare to see Ye Wei in an embarrassed situation, and with someone offering it for free, it was naturally enjoyable to watch. "How outrageous!" Beauty Ye slammed the table and stood up, walking out with large strides, looking angry as if she wanted to start a fight with someone. "Auntie, Su Man sent a message over." Little Cutie shouted from behind, but Ye Wei seemed not to hear him and disappeared in the blink of an eye. Everyone burst into laughter. Indeed, one thing came after another. However, Ye Wei's nemesis was a bit too extreme. It was a bit too unexpected. It is said that an innocent and a cunning are a perfect match, and that's absolutely correct. Though this one was thorough in being "innocent." Su Man had clearly already gone through the data. There were materials from 1934 and also an analysis of this new virus. Being a virus expert himself, he could digest the professional content quickly. Su Man: "Bring the persons here." Mommy Greater than Sky and Earth: "Is there a cure?" Su Man: "70% chance." Mommy Greater than Sky and Earth: "Good, I'll head there immediately." Su Man sent an address to Little Cutie, and Bai Ye noted it down. He was somewhat curious, "70% chance, is he sure? We have so many experts, and none of us have a clue. Can he really handle it?" His tone was quite confident, stating that there was a 70% chance just after reading the data. "If Su Man says so, then there must be a chance. Mommy and Daddy, let's go there. It will only take a few hours to reach Riyadh, and we'll be back soon." Little Cutie said. This was an opportunity, and he wouldn't let go of any chance that could cure his Mommy and Daddy. Miss Cheng and Third Young Master Ye exchanged glances and nodded in agreement. "I'll go too," Bai Ye said, his face calm, showing no emotions. But only he knew how curious and excited he himself was inside. Chapter 371 Beauty Su, an Ethereal Existence (Part I) Among men, there is always a habitual comparison in strength. Bai Ye was known as a genius doctor and had some involvement in virus research. Right now, he was puzzled by a virus that even many experts found difficult. That man confidently claimed to have a seventy percent chance of success. Generally, when people like them said they had a seventy percent chance, it implied that they could save the patients. Bai Ye was curious about the extent of this person's abilities. Moreover, a high-speed magnetic scanning gun was enough to impress him. The name Su Man was well-known to everyone. Both Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya had no objections. It wouldn't take much time to go, and since someone claimed there was hope for a cure, they were ecstatic. With Ningning and Bai Ye's arrangements, the plane was quickly ready. The matters regarding the First Terrorist Organization were temporarily left to Claude. Bai Ye instructed the experts in the research room to continue studying the virus and send the analysis report as soon as they had it, so that Su Man didn't have to repeat the same research. Everything was arranged in an orderly manner. Originally, they hadn't considered Ye Wei and Mo Jue. However, when it was time for the plane to take off, Ye Wei dragged Mo Jue onto the plane, and naturally, Eleven followed. She and Ye Wei were always inseparable. Moreover, only with Mo Jue around was there a chance of encountering Mo Ye. "Aunt, why are you also going?" Little Cutie was very puzzled. Everyone knew about the affair between Ye Wei and Su Man. Now, with Mo Jue, who was extremely jealous, on board, wouldn't it be a chaotic situation? He was counting on Su Man to focus on treating his Mommy and Daddy's virus. "Why can't I come? It's been a long time since I chatted with Su Man." Ye Wei answered confidently, smiling in a way that could charm anyone. Unfortunately, there were only three men on the plane: Bai Ye, Third Young Master Ye, and Mo Jue. Otherwise, she would surely captivate an army of men. Were you really just chatting? Everyone was very doubtful; chatting should not be so suggestive and exciting. Did she dream of seducing Su Man? In fact, even with Mo Jue, an extremely submissive beauty, by her side, Ye Wei was still so enamored with Su Man that everyone was wondering who this mysterious man was that have such overwhelming charm. Even Little Cutie, who always had exceptionally high standards, was impressed with Su Man. And there was this Mo Jue, who had just left with an indifferent face. At that time, everyone thought he had guts and was full of integrity. But in a blink of an eye, he became the kind of devoted and submissive husband who would agree with anything Ye Wei said. Holding Ye Wei tightly, he displayed the appearance of a wife-centric slave who would accept anything his wife said. The change was just too drastic! Both Third Young Master Ye and Bai Ye gave a thumbs up to Ye Wei and expressed disdain for Mo Jue's submissive behavior. Bai Ye asked, "Brother Big Bai, are you jealous?" Mo Jue hugged Ye Wei tightly and nodded vigorously, his innocent face showing a very pure expression, indicating that he was not jealous. Third Young Master Ye expressed his disdain once again. It was rare to see someone so submissive. He had never behaved so obediently to Miss Cheng. Sometimes it was quite satisfying to play with Miss Cheng and watch her willingly walk into his trap. Cheng Anya also gave a thumbs up. "You are quite skilled at taming your husband, Weiwei. Teach me a few tricks when you have time." "Sure, no problem. I guarantee that Third Brother will be obedient." Third Young Master Ye pulled Cheng Anya close and smiled cunningly. "Little Anya, am I not good enough with you? What husband-taming tricks are you going to learn? What part of me makes you dissatisfied with me? I'll change immediately." Little Cutie shivered. He and Bai Ye each huddled into a ball. Eleven raised an eyebrow, and Ye Wei smiled, "That's too sour, brother. What did you eat for lunch? You don't have to be so threatening. You should behave like Big Bai to call yourself obedient and sister-in-law will treat you better and be gentler." Third Young Master Ye secretly gave Ye Wei a side-eye. He thought that if he acted like Mo Jue, Miss Cheng might treat him even "better" than Ye Wei did to Mo Jue. He didn't want that. As a man, he still needed some face. Moreover, he couldn't fake innocence and purity like Mo Jue. It was better not to try. "That's right, I think the same way." Miss Cheng found it very reasonable. Witnessing Mo Jue's behavior, she was a little curious to see if Third Young Master Ye could also change his ways. It would surely be exciting. "Come on, be a good boy and show me a smile." Miss Cheng hooked Third Young Master Ye's chin and mocked him playfully. Third Young Master Ye's lips twitched violently. The flirty taste was just like Ye Wei's. They were totally alike; he felt that they must be of the same kind. He thought that his wife must be kept at least two hundred meters away from his younger sister to in case she was corrupted. Ye Wei burst into laughter in Mo Jue's arms, and even Eleven's lips couldn't help but curl up with a hint of amusement. Little Cutie covered his eyes innocently and said, "Mommy, please don't be so suggestive. It's not suitable for children. You should take care of Cutie's pure heart." You should also take care of such a pure heart like Baby. Everyone was speechless.... Pure? If you were pure, will there be anybody who wasn't? Bai Ye laughed elegantly and gave a few words of comment, "Women are terrifying." "I sympathize with you." Little Cutie patted Bai Ye's shoulder and said with a deep voice to express his condolences, "Indeed, they are terrifying. I mourn for your future life." Bai Ye and Chu Li had long been oppressed by Ye Wei and Eleven, so they felt the same way. Now that they experienced Miss Cheng's sadistic side, they couldn't help but feel that women were truly terrifying. Bai Ye also patted Little Cutie's shoulder in return to show his sympathy. "I mourn for you twenty years from now as well." "No need. I don't need it." Little Cutie smiled. The person by whom he wanted to be tormented was no longer around, and everything else was meaningless to him. He only wanted to have a happy life with Nuonuo, and he didn't need any other women. So, nobody could torment him. Miss Cheng was originally joking with Third Young Master Ye, but when she heard Little Cutie's words, her heart sank, and she didn't know what to say to him for a while. She could only give a deep look at him. The others didn't think about Nuonuo and continued joking. Third Young Master Ye and Bai Ye were already like a family, and Bai Ye cared about Little Cutie, so even though he was emotionally cold, he still got along well with them because he grew up with Ye Wei and Eleven. Naturally, he was on good terms with Young Master Ye, and the atmosphere was still very lively. He wasn't worried about the virus at all. Everyone was free-spirited, and there was no need to deliberately stir up emotions. Eleven was very curious, "Big Bai, why did you let Weiwei go to Riyadh? Aren't you afraid that your wife will be taken away by Su Man?" Ye Wei kicked her, wondering when this ice block had learned to make fun of her. She deserved a slap. Eleven, with her usual cold demeanor, ignored Ye Wei's protest. In fact, she felt that it would be a waste not to make fun of the two. Not only she was curious, but Bai Ye, Miss Cheng, Third Young Master Ye, and Little Cutie were all curious too. Their eyes were fixed on Mo Jue. Mo Jue blinked his eyes and answered very honestly, "My wife said Su Man doesn't look as handsome as me, so she dumped Su Man, not me. I am her real darling." Everyone was speechless.... Even Eleven, who was usually so composed, choked for a moment, not to mention Cheng Anya and the others. Weiwei, how could you say that? You were truly.... Fearless! "Big Bai, Weiwei is fooling you. I can guarantee with my reputation that she is just pretending," Cheng Anya spoke up, trying to create some doubt. Big Bai had been oppressed for so long, and now that he had a chance to retaliate, he naturally wanted to stir things up. Little Cutie expressed the same doubts. Mo Jue's purple eyes were blank. He looked at everyone nodding in agreement. Then, he looked at Ye Wei, pulled her sleeve and asked, "Darling, will you lie to me?" "No." Beauty Ye Wei was calm and composed, her expression unchanging. Mo Jue was content. "My wife said she wouldn't lie to me. Don't try to drive a wedge between us." The corners of Eleven's eyes twitched. It was truly rare for such an innocent Mo Jue to be trained into such a state by Ye Wei. Little Cutie laughed happily. As a fellow male, Bai Ye had a hundred percent respect for Mo Jue. Third Young Master Ye heartlessly placed his head on Cheng Anya's shoulder, laughing and trembling. This man was too cute. Miss Cheng was very calm. When Mo Jue asked others not to drive a wedge between the two of them, his expressions were really extraordinary. He was really a typical innocent white rabbit. "Weiwei, you really know how to do it." "Third sister-in-law, you flatter me." The two women looked at each other and smiled. Miss Cheng glanced at Third Young Master Ye. Immediately, the latter felt his back numb and his hair stood on end. Little Anya also had quite a few wicked tastes. If she set her eyes on him, he would definitely die. "Little Anya, stop the strange images in your mind. He and I are not the same type of vegetable." Third Young Master Ye immediately made a statement. Mo Jue was the most typical image of a wife-centric slave. No man would be willing to be like him. Ye Wei chuckled, "Third Brother, Mo Jue is younger than you and much tastier. He's pure inside and out." And that was a hundred percent true. Cheng Anya's smile became even gentler, "Your brother doesn't even know how to spell 'pure'." Little Cutie joined in, "Mommy, if you're not satisfied, you can try having an affair. Su Man is not bad. He's a great beauty." "Be careful, or I'll beat you up." If Third Young Master Ye was able to hit someone right now, he would have smacked Little Cutie on the back of his head. Ye Wei wanted to say "Beauty Su is my woman," but considering Mo Jue's innocent face, she smartly swallowed the words back. Watching the two oppressed male companions, Bai Ye felt that being single was indeed a good thing, blessed with bright days and a beautiful life. "Darling, what are you talking about?" Mo Jue asked innocently. Cheng Anya suddenly said, "Weiwei, I suddenly agree with what you just said. Mo Jue is definitely better looking than Su Man. With such a handsome face, he could easily be considered the world's number one." He had truly unrivaled beauty. Cheng Anya had never seen anyone as handsome as Mo Jue. If he were a woman, he would give the impression of a celestial maiden descending to earth. Especially those purple eyes that shimmered like water, adding a touch of charm to him. Even though he was as pure as a blank sheet of paper at the moment, every frown and smile of his was unparalleled, with no one to match him. Ye Wei did not express any opinion on this and just chuckled. "Little Anya, you dare praise another man? Are you tired of living?" Third Young Master Ye narrowed his eyes and reached out to grab her hair, crazily expressing his jealousy. "Ah Chen, you have to be honest," Miss Cheng said as she patted his head. You really can't compare with Mo Jue in terms of appearance. Just accept it. Little Cutie touched his chin in thought, "I'm also curious about Su Man's appearance. Auntie, is he really ethereal?" "Ask Eleven." Ye Wei waved her hand casually. With Mo Jue around, she should shut up. Eleven glanced at Mo Jue and offered a fair opinion, "Each has its own merits." "Then he must be ethereal." Little Cutie smiled and said. Cheng Anya suddenly noticed the jade pendant on Little Cutie's chest and became curious, "Sweetie, what are you wearing? A jade pendant?" Isn't this something girls wore? Her son never wore such things. Little Cutie's smile faded, and a trace of pain flashed but quickly returned to calm. Just as he was about to answer, Mo Jue answered for him, "It's my Nuonuo's." The atmosphere became a bit heavy. Ye Wei and the others knew the truth, but Cheng Anya and Third Young Master Ye did not. Little Cutie nonchalantly put the exposed jade pendant back, looking calm, without a hint of sorrow or despair. But many years later, when Cheng Anya recalled this scene again, she realized how her son felt. There was a kind of tranquility called still waters with slight ripples. "Very pretty." Cheng Anya said indifferently. Third Young Master Ye clenched his hands. Little Cutie put on a smiling face, "Yes, I think it's pretty too." Seeing them happily chatting, he missed Nuonuo a lot. He didn't dare to sleep at night, afraid that he would dream of her. When he woke up, he could only grasp the lingering regret in the air, sleepless all night. He experienced these feelings too early in life, making them even more unforgettable. With the passage of time, this memory became clearer and firmly imprinted in his heart. By and by, a mark was left that could never be erased. He spent his whole life cherishing this memory, without regrets. Bai Ye patted Little Cutie in the shoulder, and everyone fell silent for a while, but Third Young Master Ye tapped the table and said, "Ningning, didn't I tell you to bring an idiot home? If you met a formidable one, you should keep your distance, right? You didn't listen, so now you are suffering, right?" Miss Cheng remained silent. Bai Ye laughed, thinking this love initiation was a bit early. Little Cutie clasped his hands together and made a gesture of admiration with a smile, "Wise and valiant father, your baby will definitely heed your advice and won't dare again." Everyone burst into laughter. The atmosphere became lively again. Cheng Anya smiled and didn't say much, but her heart ached for her son. His appearance of forcibly holding back the laughter was distressing to her. They continued talking and laughing until they arrived at Riyadh. The plane landed on a private airstrip. There was a spacious manor like an oasis with vast date and palm tree groves, and in the center of the courtyard, there was a delicate fountain. The elegant villa courtyard was lush with various exotic flowers and plants. The manor was quite old, exuding a sense of profound history. Crystal lotus petal chandeliers hung in the curved corridors, looking exceptionally beautiful. Ivy climbed the walls, giving off a touch of greenery. Black-clad maids, with their heads covered and faces covered in the typical Arab veil, received them and led them to the hall. They brought them all the way to the hall. Ye Wei greeted them happily, causing them to chuckle. One of them laughed in English, "Master should have a headache again." The summer in Riyadh was extremely hot, but in the hall, it was cold everywhere. Bai Ye, with his keen observation, noticed that the walls were made of icy jade, which felt cold to the touch despite its ordinary appearance. This unique design was to alleviate the heat during the hot summer. It was unique. "The walls of their house are made of ice jade. They are rich people." Ye Wei and Eleven used to live here for a long time and were extremely familiar with it. Ye Wei automatically picked up the fruit on the table to quench her thirst. The summer in Riyadh was so hot that it was unbearable, and when they got off the plane, the hot air blew on their faces and their mouths were dry. After a while, the maids brought ice drinks, fruit, and snacks. Because they were familiar with Ye Wei and Eleven's taste preference, they also carefully prepared two cups of blue-green fruit drinks for the two of them. Ye Wei said in Arabic, "Sister Diana, I didn't expect you to still remember my favorite drink. It's so touching." Diana smiled and said, "Master is currently receiving Her Highness the Seventh Princess. He will be here soon." "Is she good-looking?" Ye Wei like gossiping. Whoever came to the door must be offering themselves, and she had seen even more astonishing scenes last year.   Diana's big eyes were full of smiles, "Not as beautiful as you." Ye Wei was satisfied. Diana, you really knew how to flatter me. Bai Ye shook his head, poking her in the shoulder. "Does your darling understand Arabic?" Before trying to seduce someone, you should first appease your own man. That would ensure that there wouldn't be trouble back home. Ye Wei forgot about this and said to Mo Jue in Arabic, "Big Bai, my drink doesn't taste good, let's switch." Mo Jue obediently offered to exchange their drinks, but Ye Wei stopped him, "Never mind, I suddenly find it very delicious." This guy understood Arabic, and Ye Wei was in a dilemma. Little Cutie laughed and explained to Cheng Anya. Among them, only Cheng Anya couldn't understand Arabic. She wasn't as impressive as these people, and she only understood English, Japanese, and French. Not long after, someone outside greeted the master. A tall figure slowly walked into their view, with his back to the sun, dressed in a white robe, exuding a faint and serene halo. His entire body exuded an untouchable sanctity. Cheng Anya's first impression was that Beauty Su really deserved the name! Everyone's thoughts were the same. Beauty Su was really an ethereal existence. Chapter 371 Beauty Su, an Ethereal Existence (Part II) Su Man, around twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, stood tall and straight. His attire was unlike that of ordinary Arab men who wore a white robe with a black headband and a white turban. He only had the white robe on, with his long silver hair tied back with a silver ribbon. His willow-leaf-shaped eyebrows were slender and long, akin to distant mountains' dusk, and his pair of jet-black, lively eyes resembled mountain springs, cold and clear, with a hint of purity. On closer inspection, they were like the cold wind blowing across an ice field, chilling and imposing. His nose was straight and high, and he had beautifully colored lips and a delicate chin, each feature a masterpiece of God's creation. His entire presence exuded an arrogant, cold, and unattainable aura, one that could not be desecrated. With such exceptional features, there was no mistaking him for a woman. He was undoubtedly a supremely confident and powerful man. How could any woman possess such a compelling aura and an air of unmatched arrogance? Clad in white, with ink-black hair tied with a silver ribbon, he was peerlessly elegant. The moment he appeared, he was undoubtedly the man who could absolutely captivate the eyes and heart of the audience. Standing there, he seemed to outshine the whole world, and everyone else in the hall, both men and women, who were all well-informed and calm figures, became mere background figures. But the moment he came out, there was silence. Everyone was shocked by his beauty. Even Ye Wei and Eleven, who had become used to seeing to his beauty, were shocked. Some people were just never tiresome to look at him. No matter how they enjoyed the sight of him, he was still as dazzling as when they first met. Su Man's gaze swept across the men and women in the hall, accustomed to the admiring looks of others. His eyes fell on Little Cutie, and his seldom smiling lips curved slightly. In an instant, his splendor could eclipse all. "Beauty Su, I missed you so much." Ye Wei was the first to react and, without minding Mo Jue's jealousy, she rushed over, taking the initiative to embrace him. Ye Wei was the number one assassin, and her movements were lightning-fast, but there was someone even faster than her. Mo Jue followed closely behind and firmly held her waist and pulled her to the side. His exquisitely chiseled features were filled with protest, "Darling..." This "darling" sounded quite prolonged. Su Man's eyebrows raised slightly, and his cold gaze fell on Ye Wei and Mo Jue. Having failed to pounce on Su Man, Ye Wei felt full of grievances. But she couldn't let Mo Jue fly into a rage, which made her quite distressing. "I don't want you at all," Su Man's gaze remained cold and his voice carried a clean tone. He respected Mo Jue tremendously. Since this man could control Ye Wei, he was indeed worthy of his admiration. Otherwise, how many people in the world would have been devastated by her? "Beauty Su, you're unfair." Ye Wei protested, patting the Big Bai's hand and gesturing that he could let go. Bringing him here was a very unwise decision. If it weren't for the fact that no one was able to control him back home in the castle, she wouldn't have brought him along. "Su Man." Little Cutie took a small step forward, touching his own chin and generously complimenting him, "You're really quite unexpected." Although he had heard that he was an extraordinary ethereal existence, seeing him in person made him truly realize what real beauty was. He was indeed extraordinary, elegant and awe-inspiring, exuding unparalleled charm. "Little one, you're quite surprising as well." Su Man patted him in the shoulder, his demeanor softening slightly, "Why did Ye Wei come too?" Upon hearing this, Ye Wei was not pleased, "Beauty Su, what do you mean by that?" Eleven stated plainly, "He finds you annoying." Little Cutie smiled, "She's my aunt." "The world is indeed small." Even Su Man's cold gaze showed a hint of helplessness as he turned around to have befriended the same group of people. Little Cutie introduced them to each other. Because Cheng Anya and Third Young Master Ye had viruses in their bodies, both of them just nodded in acknowledgment. Su Man had never liked interacting with others, and it suited his preferences just fine. Nodding in greeting was enough. It was the same with Bai Ye. "Ningning, why are there so many people here since I am just having two patients?" Su Man's cold gaze swept over them, and everyone felt an invisible pressure spreading. Some people naturally possessed such an imposing aura that even a seemingly ordinary sentence could have a deterrent effect. Third Young Master Ye remained silent, and Miss Cheng also kept quiet. It seemed that people with extraordinary talents always had some strange temperaments. Of course, their precious child was an exception, and she was sure she and Third Young Master Ye must be here for treatment. As for the others, it was none of their concern. "I miss you, don't I? Eleven and I are inseparable; you know that." Ye Wei retorted. "Yes, and you even brought your whole family," another person added. "Oh my, do you regret not accepting me back then?" Ye Wei teased. "Beauty, you really don't miss me at all?" Ye Wei smiled as she held Su Man's arm. "No." Su Man cherished words like gold. His cold eyes turned. Mo Jue had already grabbed Ye Wei by his side. His purple eyes were filled with jealousy. "Darling, please don't act like this. You can hug me instead if you want." Everyone was speechless.... The rest of the people now found excuses. Bai Ye calmly said, "I handled their viruses previously. Maybe I can be of help." "Not needed," Su Man's tone was cold, exuding a restrained arrogance, extremely compelling. Bai Ye remained composed, but a layer of frost seemed to settle between his brows, revealing a hint of domineering aura. "Believe me, you will need it." Their gazes met, one aloof and distant, the other cold and proud. They exuded equally formidable auras, making everyone feel an overwhelming pressure. Gracefully standing in the middle, Little Cutie smiled to divert their attention. Both Su Man and Bai Ye averted the other's gaze. One remained calm, the other coldly snorted. Little Cutie chuckled, "Beauty Su, Bai Ye also has some research on the viruses. Although he is not as thorough as you, his medical skills are undoubtedly superior to yours." Su Man raised an eyebrow, "I want the latest analysis data." Bai Ye nodded, "No problem." Su Man scanned the room and instructed Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya to follow him to the study. The rest were not allowed to keep company. Everyone complied and stayed in the hall. Bai Ye remarked, "He's quite arrogant." "He has the right to be." Eleven commented, "Back then, he knew Weiwei's and my identity but had never been nice to us." "Ah, Weiwei, so you're into him. But..."  Bai Ye smiled and looked at Mo Jue, "Your taste has changed a lot." Mo Jue didn't understand what Bai Ye meant, and Little Cutie smiled. Eleven couldn't help laughing either, and Ye Wei lazily waved her hand, feeling speechless. "It's absolutely unexpected, totally unexpected..." "Is he Arabian?" Bai Ye asked curiously. Su Man's features had the profound delicacy of an Arab and the refinement of an Easterner. Overall, he looked more like an Easterner. "He is mixed-blood: his mother is an Arabian, and his father is a Chinese." Everyone nodded, and indeed, mixed-blood people often looked stunning. They had seen several such examples, but none as extraordinary as Su Man. Ye Wei leisurely leaned against her chair. Sipping her iced drink, she slowly said, "So now you know why I care about him. Su Man is captivating both inside and out. You'll understand once you spend enough time with him. He's a rare true man." Unfortunately, he did not like her. According to the insider information, Su Man doesn't like women, only men. So, she was naturally out of the arena from the start. It was quite a tragedy. "Auntie, you are running out of charm." "You're just talking nonsense, look at how this one is mesmerized. How come I am running out of charm?" Ye Wei pointed at Mo Jue, smiling charmingly. She was satisfied as long as her charm extended to Mo Jue. Mo Jue grabbed Ye Wei's hand and asked, "Darling, didn't you say he's not as good-looking as me and you have long dumped him? Why did you get close to him? You're lying to me." "When friends haven't seen each other in a while, it's normal for them to miss and embrace each other. Do you understand?" Mo Jue shook his head, pointing at Eleven, "She didn't hug him." Bai Ye and Little Cutie pursed their lips and smiled. Eleven snorted coldly, and Ye Wei said in a very compatible manner said, "Have you ever seen Eleven hug anybody? Only those who want to die will let her hug them. How can you compare your darling to Eleven?" Fire and ice cannot be mentioned in the same breath. "Darling, just be like Eleven, not too enthusiastic. Big Bai doesn't like it." Mo Jue said with a sullen face. Lowering his head, he felt depressed, his purple eyes exuding a melancholy air, lacking their usual luster. Ye Wei's heart skipped a beat, finding this side of Mo Jue a bit... displeasing. She had no intention of changing her behavior for anyone, and besides, Su Man had no interest in her. So, she just played with him for fun, and there was nothing serious about it. "Weiwei, have you noticed? He seems to have become smarter." Eleven suddenly said. Especially these days, the difference was quite apparent. He wasn't as naive and obedient as when they first met. He no longer believed everything she said. Ye Wei nodded, but Eleven had another concern. Was he about to recover? Or was it just... "Big Bai, have you remembered something?" Ye Wei asked gently. Mo Jue shook his head. Eleven and Ye Wei exchanged glances but didn't say anything. Perhaps, it was just an illusion! "Darling, if you continue to treat him like this, I'll kill him," Mo Jue said with a deep voice, his purple eyes exuding a killing intent. "Big Bai, come, I'll take you to enjoy the scenery of Riyadh." Ye Wei pulled Mo Jue and walked outside. Mo Jue's melancholic expression immediately brightened, and sunlight beamed. This was a small research room. As Su Man was a virus expert, his home laboratory boasted the most complete research equipment in the world. Though small, it had everything: test tubes, reagents, automated equipment, computer-aided analysis, and massive LCD screens. Su Man took samples of their blood and injected them with two different-colored reagents. There were only the three of them, and Third Young Master Ye didn't overthink. He asked in a low voice, "Mr. Su, can this virus really be cured?" Su Man was conducting a comprehensive examination on Cheng Anya and calmly said, "Maybe yes, maybe no. I'm not one hundred percent sure. It depends on the stability of the virus." Third Young Master Ye had been mentally prepared, and he looked at Cheng Anya, giving her a slight smile. She returned the smile. At their stage, life and death didn't seem as important anymore. Su Man glanced at the couple. Perhaps due to his good relationship with Ningning, he had a favorable impression of them. His attitude softened as well. After all, being able to raise a child like Little Cutie, the parents couldn't be ordinary people. Moreover, a few months ago, Third Young Master Ye's deeds had caused a global sensation, which was quite dramatic. Su Man knew they were Ningning's parents, and naturally, he paid attention to them. It seemed quite interesting to him. He was quite impressed in his hearts to see that they could remain so composed in the face of life and death. "Just call me Su Man." Su Man's voice was consistently clear, showing no emotional fluctuations. Cheng Anya smiled and allowed Su Man to examine her as she asked, "Su Man, how did you get to know Ningning?" "It was by chance. He wanted a weapon design, and I happened to be able to provide it. At first, I didn't want to give it to him. Who knew he would hack into my computer? I had no choice but to compromise. If I didn't agree, I was afraid he would change my nationality for free overnight. I would wake up as a stateless person, and maybe even find a name in the spouse column of my ID." Su Man recounted the story. As parents of Little Cutie, Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya were extremely embarrassed... Their son's behavior was really like... A bandit! Indeed, Little Cutie deserved to be his son. Third Young Master Ye felt pleased in his heart, thinking that these methods might be sneaky and cunning, but they were the most effective. "...You really are unlucky." Cheng Anya said after struggling to find the words, but as soon as the words were out, she regretted it. In normal circumstances, shouldn't the parents of the perpetrator apologize? Cheng Anya was truly embarrassed! "Mm, I admit I am." Su Man calmly agreed, not a bit thinking the parents' education of their son was a bit twisted and that Cheng Anya's indulgence towards Little Cutie had reached a certain level. "Occasionally being unlucky is quite good. My son has useful in many aspects." Third Young Master Ye added, feeling like his son's behavior was quite glorious and not shameful at all. Su Man nodded in agreement, "Indeed." Cheng Anya and Third Young Master Ye felt satisfied. Su Man was indeed very magnanimous. It didn't matter how they came to know each other; what mattered was that he now had a good relationship with Ningning, who was much younger than him. Wasn't that great? Su Man completed Cheng Anya's examination and raised an eyebrow with a cold, piercing gaze. "I finally understand that Ningning's personality is not something that was cultivated; it's genetic." Third Young Master Ye was speechless... Miss Cheng was speechless... Su Man asked Cheng Anya to sit up and then had Third Young Master Ye lie down. He said, "But what you said is correct." As Su Man examined Third Young Master Ye, he looked at the images and data displayed on the screen, his gaze becoming serious. Although it was written in Arabic and Cheng Anya couldn't understand it, she could see the images. It was the liver. "It's a bit troublesome." Su Man said pensively. Cheng Anya's heart skipped a beat, feeling an ominous premonition. "What's going on? Is there no hope?" "The virus has invaded his liver. His situation is more serious than yours." Su Man spoke honestly. He believed that they were strong enough to bear this news, so he didn't hide anything. "This is a type of cell virus. Once it invades the liver, the body's functions will severely decline. At most, he will have less than a day before he can't move freely and can only lie in the lab, relying on tranquilizers and oxygen masks to survive." Cheng Anya's pupils dilated, and the blood drained from her face. She felt a sharp pain in her heart, and her head also began to throb. Her brain went completely blank. She couldn't care about anything. She only felt numbness and coldness in her limbs, and waves of fear washed over her. She had a strong feeling that she was about to lose Third Young Master Ye. "Su Man, what should we do?" Cheng Anya struggled to stay calm, but she couldn't achieve it. Her voice trembled as she spoke, and her thin body had become rigid. Third Young Master Ye reached out and held Cheng Anya's hand, the icy touch making her heart ache. Although they had become indifferent to life and death, when the moment of separation came, it was still difficult to hide the pain and despair. "Don't worry, Little Anya. It's not like there is no hope at all." Third Young Master Ye said softly, "Didn't we agree on this?" "The consequences are worse than I thought, but it doesn't mean there's no hope. Don't worry, I will do my best." Su Man said in a solemn tone. His cold eyes were firm. "Ningning rarely asks me for anything, and I will make sure he gets what he wants, no matter what." Cheng Anya felt a little relieved hearing Su Man's words. For some reason, Su Man's words were always convincing. "What about her?" Su Man looked at Cheng Anya. "She is doing well. Her situation is still under control. She is the first victim of infection, and the stability of the virus in her body is higher than yours. So, her condition is good." "Why is it like this? I was infected earlier than him." "It doesn't have much to do with the timing of infection." Su Man explained. "This particular cell virus is inherently not very stable. Moreover, he is the victim of infection, which amplifies the instability. So, it is more likely to mutate." Cheng Anya didn't understand much about viruses, but seeing Su Man's serious expression, she also felt heavy-hearted. On the other hand, Third Young Master Ye didn't show any anxious or grieving emotions. He calmly accepted this bad news. "By the way, Su Man, the designer of 1934 was your grandfather. Bai Ye said the principle is similar to this virus. Is there an antidote?" Cheng Anya asked Su Man. Su Man nodded, and a hint of pain flickered through his cold gaze. It appeared briefly and was almost intangible. "1934 was researched by my grandfather when he was young. At that time, my grandmother had liver cancer, so my grandfather studied cell viruses for the purpose of treating liver cancer. He locked himself in the lab, and no one knew about it because he knew how dangerous virus research could be. But his apprentice stole it and it fell into the hands of illegal groups, causing the death of tens of thousands of people in a town in Siberia. He regretted it a lot. Later, he dedicated himself to researching an antidote for 1934 and only succeeded in his old age. However, when he moved home, some of the materials were left behind, and a few pages of the antidote records were missing. I must spend some time to make them up. Although the principles are similar, this virus is obviously more complex. At the moment, I only have a rough idea and need to confirm it before I can experiment on the two of you." Third Young Master Ye looked at Su Man, smiled gently, and said calmly, "Go ahead and do it. I trust you." Chapter 373 Darling, I Don't Like Him After conducting a detailed examination on Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya, Su Man came out of the examination room as the evening approached. He stayed in the laboratory to prepare some data while the housemaid led the two of them to their rooms. Little Cutie had been waiting in the room for them. The examination took longer than the one in Rome, making Little Cutie anxious. He was afraid that something might go wrong. If even Su Man couldn't find a solution, then perhaps there truly was no way to save them. When they returned, Third Young Master Ye's face appeared quite pale. Little Cutie's heart sank, and he hurriedly approached. Cheng Anya warned him not to get too close, urging him to keep some distance. Little Cutie reluctantly stepped back a safe distance. "Daddy, Mommy, are you both alright? What did Su Man say?" Little Cutie was very worried, having waited the entire afternoon, his patience wearing thin. All he wanted now was to hear some good news, even though he understood how unlikely it was. Cheng Anya didn't hide anything from him and truthfully explained the situation. Little Cutie felt fear and concern deep inside, but he didn't show it. He pursed his lips and said, "We have the world's best doctor and top virus expert here. Daddy and Mommy will definitely be fine." Third Young Master Ye chuckled lightly. The calm demeanor Little Cutie displayed had the air of a great leader. Not only did he recall how calmly the child had acted when Cheng Anya was injured and needed amputation after a car accident, but he was also comforting Cheng Anya now. However... "Baby, don't worry too much. Just do what needs to be done. Since we believe in them, then we should believe in them completely. At this point, no matter what the outcome is, your Mommy and I will accept it." Third Young Master Ye spoke calmly. "Don't make such a gloomy face. It's not auspicious at all. Even if your Daddy and Mommy haven't died, you'll give them bad luck by looking so glum. Cheer up a bit." Cheng Anya waved her hand, feeling uncomfortable upon seeing her son with a stern expression. In her impression, her son had to be smiling elegantly and adorably, and a gloomy face didn't suit him. She couldn't bear to see him like that. "I know, I know." Little Cutie pouted, his rosy lips showing his displeasure. "In any case, you're not allowed to leave me." Cheng Anya smiled, playfully kicking his foot. "Who was the one saying that the best doctor and top virus expert are here? There won't be any problem for sure. Why did you change your tune so quickly? Lost your confidence?" "Mommy, don't ruin baby's mood like this," Little Cutie said with his eyes wide open, portraying his dissatisfaction like a little gentleman. Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya exchanged a smile. "Anya, Ningning, how about we go out for a stroll later as a family? You haven't been to Riyadh before, and the night view is beautiful." Third Young Master Ye suggested, explaining that due to business reasons, he had been to Riyadh twice before, but each time was rushed and he didn't have a chance to appreciate the city's beauty, except for the night view that had left a deep impression on him. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it breathtakingly beautiful. Going on a trip as a family of three would surely be wonderful. Apart from the beach trip they had taken previously, they hadn't traveled as a family yet. They didn't know if they would ever have the chance to enjoy such warm family time in the future. Therefore, Third Young Master Ye cherished it deeply. "Baby agrees." Little Cutie revealed an elegant smile and happily gave his approval. His pitch-black eyes were full of childlike innocence. "Su Man said the local specialties here are famous." Third Young Master Ye nodded and gestured for a thumbs-up to his son. Father and son exchanged a smile. Cheng Anya hesitated for a moment, her bright eyes showing a hint of worry and apprehension. The incident involving Zhang Bo was etched deeply into her heart, and the pain was indescribable. She felt extremely distressed. "With our current condition, it's not suitable for us to go out. It wouldn't be good if we unintentionally cause harm to others." Cheng Anya expressed her concerns. She also wanted to go out and see, but the situation didn't allow it. There would definitely be physical contact with others on the streets. If the virus was spread elsewhere, the consequences would be unimaginable. "That's true." Third Young Master Ye also felt it wasn't appropriate. Despite the spacious streets of Riyadh, accidents could still happen. "Damn it, I'll end up lying down all day tomorrow and not even get a good night's pleasure. The damn heavens are playing tricks on me." Miss Cheng was speechless.... Little Cutie was speechless....  "Daddy, use civilized language. Don't set a bad example for baby." Third Young Master Ye raised an eyebrow with a smile that seemed to say, "Save it" and said, "Fine, you even gave Louis the middle finger, how civilized can you be? Anyway, there's no one in our family who cares about being civilized. Might as well not bother." Little Cutie touched his own nose, suppressed his smile, and said seriously, "Daddy, you shouldn't say things like that. Image is still important." Cheng Anya looked at the father and son, unable to contain her laughter. They were so adorable. "Well, how about this? We'll drive there and not get out of the car. If you want to buy something, let baby do it for you." Cheng Anya suggested, "Baby, since your Daddy is about to start a difficult period tomorrow, you can be a temporary coolie for him." "Yes, ma'am!" Little Cutie saluted smartly. Ye Wei and Mo Jue, on the other hand, were clearly in high spirits. They had disappeared for the entire afternoon. When it was time for dinner, Su Man had already come out of the lab, and only then did they return with a flourish. Mo Jue was exuberantly calling Ye Wei "darling," which made everyone feel that the food was especially delicious. Seats were reserved for them, and when they finally returned, they didn't hesitate to sit down. The housemaid brought them food and drinks. Big Bai, who had left at noon with an unhappy face then, was in high spirits now. His cheeks were even slightly flushed, making him look incredibly cute. Eleven pulled Ye Wei and whispered to her, "Did you succeed with him? Did he find anything?" When it came to understanding each other, Ye Wei and Eleven were the best couple. They could know what the other had done in a short period of time without exchanging glances. Ye Wei shook her head, "Everything's normal." Due to her special identity, no matter how she felt about Mo Jue, whether she had fallen in love with him or not, she had to be cautious. No matter what, she couldn't let it interfere with the big issue. That was why they needed to be careful. But as for whether their actions were real or just a show, and as for how much was true and how much was fake, even Ye Wei herself probably wasn't sure. Not to mention others. Her thoughts were always hard to decipher, and no matter how others saw her, she always appeared as carefree and enchanting as before. Her demeanor hadn't changed by a single degree. That was why Third Young Master Ye and Bai Ye felt at ease letting her keep an eye on Mo Jue. "Beauty Su, how's my brother and sister-in-law?" Ye Wei and Mo Jue happened to be sitting across from Su Man. When she lifted her eyes, she saw the stunning beauty. Ye Wei's mood instantly soared. "They're doing well," Su Man replied calmly. Little Cutie said, "Auntie, you're so carefree, do you still remember my daddy and mommy?" "Kids should eat more and talk less." "Uncle Big Bai, is Auntie bullying you?" Mo Jue shook his head innocently, staunchly defending his darling, "No, my darling treats me well." Everyone mourned together for Brother Big Bai, anyone with eyes could see that she is really not treating him well at all. Su Man played with the food on her plate, his cold eyebrows raised slightly, his gaze occasionally falling on Mo Jue. Since they were sitting directly across from each other, it didn't seem strange. But the strange thing was that Su Man looked many times at Mo Jue, and everyone present was astute. Except for the insensitive Mo Jue, the others felt it. Su Man's sexual orientation was known by Ye Wei and Eleven, and it was mentioned once on the plane. Eleven's consistently icy demeanor and Miss Cheng's usually composed expression were both on the verge of collapse, because the scene before their eyes was really too suggestive. Mo Jue's appearance could truly capture both genders, especially now with his innocent look, his purple eyes shimmering, and his delicate pink lips. He looked like a "pet" that was very suitable for keeping. Seeing Ye Wei tirelessly teasing him, it was obvious that she found it amusing. So, immediately a very complicated love triangle image flashed in everyone's minds: Mo Jue developed feelings for Ye Wei, Ye Wei developed feelings for Su Man, Su Man developed feelings for Mo Jue. Ye Wei had been pursuing Su Man for over a year, and this time she had specially came for Su Man. She didn't expect that by bringing Mo Jue here, she would somehow have a love rival and this love rival would keep calling her "darling". Everyone was thinking about how sad and angered Ye Wei must be. Little Cutie sipped his icy coconut milk, his pitch-black eyes darting around. He kept glancing at his aunt, Uncle Big Bai, and Su Man, with a cunning and mischievous expression that was as tricky as it could be. Ye Wei slowly put down her knife and fork, smiling in a captivating manner. She got straight to the point, "Beauty Su, have you taken a fancy to my Big Bai?" Su Man remained calm, not even a flicker in his eyebrows. "Nonsense." Mo Jue innocently looked at Ye Wei, afraid that she might get angry. He hurriedly waved his hands, "Darling, don't be mad. Rest assured, I love you the most. I won't be interested in him." Silence... Eleven awkwardly turned her face to the side, her shoulders shaking a few times, seemingly on the brink of a wild laughter. Miss Cheng calmly gripped the tablecloth, nearly collapsing in laughter on the table. Third Young Master Ye's eye twitched and twitched, wanting to laugh but feeling quite inappropriate. After all, Su Man was the host, and they were the guests. Little Cutie was drinking his coconut milk, choked for a moment, turned in another direction, and sprayed it all out. He kept coughing. "Haha..." In a strangely silent moment, only Bai Ye burst into laughter and applause. He was naturally carefree and aloof, and this was the first time he had lost his composure like this. Su Man's eyebrows lifted coldly, as if in slow motion. His icy gaze swept over Bai Ye. Then, he casually sipped his tea with an air of indifference. Mo Jue, seemingly unaware of the consequences he had caused, innocently looked around. "What's wrong with all of you?" Ye Wei patted Mo Jue in the head, quite comforting. She had been bullied by Su Man many times and hadn't won once. Unexpectedly, Mo Jue's debut resulted in a brilliant moment of embarrassment for Su Man. Very good, very nice. This kid has great potential. Watching Su Man change expression is quite satisfying, even though he's still carefree and nonchalant. "No worries, Big Bai. You did well, worthy of praise." Ye Wei praised generously, and Mo Jue, hearing his darling's praise, couldn't help but smile broadly. "Weiwei, you've raised a masterpiece," Bai Ye laughed heartily. Ye Wei gave a seductive smile, a smile that was as sly as it was charming. "Beauty Su, don't be embarrassed. If you consider giving me a kiss, I might consider letting you hold Big Bai in your arms." Everyone was speechless.... Little Cutie felt lucky he hadn't been drinking. Auntie, you're awesome. Third Young Master Ye also couldn't help but sigh. With a sister like this, his life was truly a perfect one. Miss Cheng, however, thought to herself that those with the surname Ye are truly eccentric. She had realized this long ago. Su Man's gaze remained icy and stern, with a slight upward curve at the corner of his lips that couldn't really be called a smile. His tone was flat, like a touch of autumn frost sweeping by leaves. "In terms of character, he has a fractured personality. In terms of age, he's a dual-age tier. In terms of soul, he's not a complete individual." Another silence swept over the group. Ye Wei suppressed her smile and glanced at Mo Jue. "Have you encountered a case like him before?" "A few years ago, I did." "Why would a person be like this?" "How would I know?" Su Man replied, neither cold nor warm. Ye Wei's face turned mournful. "Beauty Su, please don't be so heartless." "I've always been this heartless." Ye Wei fell silent. Even if you were telling the truth, Beauty Su, you don't have to state it so proudly. It was truly embarrassing. Little Cutie was very curious. "Su Man, Mo Jue wasn't like this before. I've met him once before, and the difference is like heaven and earth. He's been like this for many days now. When will he recover?" Mo Jue was still very confused, not knowing what they were talking about. Su Man raised an eyebrow and glanced at Mo Jue. "I don't know." "But you said you've encountered cases like this before." Third Young Master Ye was curious too. Su Man said, "This isn't an illness. It varies from person to person, and I naturally can't be certain." Eleven, however, was most concerned about something else. "Can it be cured?" "I don't know." "Why do you seem so clueless when we ask?" Bai Ye chimed in. Ye Wei nodded, agreeing. Being clueless when asked is what makes a quack doctor. Su Man's icy gaze swept over Bai Ye. "If I were to ask you the question, I'm afraid you wouldn't know better." Everyone fell silent. Beauty Su, you're quite sharp. Bai Ye chuckled carefreely, completely unconcerned. "This isn't an illness. It is normal for me not to know better. Different professional fields shouldn't be compared." Su Man sipped her tea and looked quite composed. "Clever argument." Bai Ye smiled calmly, taking a sip of red wine. Everyone remained silent. The atmosphere was truly eerie. Ye Wei glanced at Mo Jue but didn't say anything. Fractured personality? She had never heard of it. Not a complete individual? It was really nonsense. He was clearly a living and breathing person. Chapter 374 Beauty Mo Jue Was Back After dinner, Third Young Master Ye took Cheng Anya and Little Cutie for a drive. Su Man wanted to act as their tour guide, but Third Young Master Ye declined. He had an all-knowing son, so there was no chance of getting lost. He didn't want anyone to disturb their cozy family time. The evening scenery of Riyadh was indeed breathtaking. It had shed its desert city appearance from over a decade ago, with towering skyscrapers, wide and bright streets, and city lights illuminating the entire landscape. Looking ahead, the streets were adorned with rows of streetlights, making people feel as if they were in a sea of lights. The car moved slowly, and Cheng Anya noticed that the city seemed to have a lot of fountain pools. Along a single street, there were two fountain pools, each uniquely designed, adding a touch of coolness to the scorching summer days. The city's greenery was quite well-maintained. Third Young Master Ye smiled and explained, "Most of the Sahara Desert is within Saudi Arabia's borders. The greenery in Riyadh's city requires constant human intervention and comes at a significant cost. These fountain pools help regulate the city's temperature." Cheng Anya nodded in understanding and respect. She realized that Riyadh was indeed too hot. During the daytime at Su Man's mansion, there was ice jade everywhere, providing cool relief. However, once outside, the heat was overwhelming. Ye Wei had cheerfully informed her that 40 degrees Celsius was considered normal, and it could even reach 45 degrees at the hottest times. She finally understood why Riyadh's streets were so empty. Normal people wouldn't go for walks or shopping during the day when the temperature was over 40 degrees, and the temperature was more than 30 in the evening. It was definitely asking for trouble to go shopping. The streets were deserted, and whenever they found a spot without people, they would get out of the car to take photos. Despite sweating from the heat, Cheng Anya was enjoying herself. Little did they know that a storm was brewing back at Su Man's mansion. After dinner, Su Man returned to his research lab to continue researching the antidote for 1934 and studying the virus. The entire spacious research lab was occupied solely by him, so he wasn't surprised when Ye Wei showed up. "Beauty Su, how about spending the night together with me?" Ye Wei smiled seductively, her soft and fragrant body pressing against Su Man's as if she had no bones. With one hand hooking around his neck and smiling charmingly, she planted a generous kiss on his cheek. Su Man didn't even blink. First, he was no match for Ye Wei in terms of agility, and second, he had grown accustomed to these situations. With black hair, a silver belt and a refined yet icy demeanor, the man set aside the documents in his hand and coldly swept his gaze over Ye Wei. "If you're trying to seduce someone, at least dress the part." Ye Wei burst into laughter. She used her fingers to hook Su Man's chin in a perverted manner. Her expression was as suggestive as it could be. "I've been naked under your blanket before, and you didn't even bat an eyelid." "Good for you to know that." Su Man brushed her hand away. Beauty Ye Wei openly assaulted Su Man's chest, a firm and flat expanse. With mocked sadness, she asked, "When will I be able to touch something soft? Beauty Su, it's really unfair of you to treat me like this. Why do you like men without telling me? You made me chase you for a year in vain." "You never asked." Su Man furrowed his brows, signaling for her to move away. He disliked being in such close contact with women. But Ye Wei wouldn't budge. She leaned against Su Man's neck and giggled, "Su Man, if you had told me you liked men, I would have changed my gender for you. We'd be a perfect immortal couple now. Yet you've ruined a beautiful marriage. Are you worthy of my devotion?" Su Man wasn't affected by Ye Wei whimsical thinking and persistent argument. "Even if you became a man, I still wouldn't like you." "... Beauty, stop being so gender-biased," Ye Wei said in frustration. Why was she never able to seduce Beauty Su? She was incredibly conflicted. She was going to be crazy! "Enough with the theatrics. Spit it out. I'm busy." Su Man cast a cold glance, filling the entire room with an imposing and majestic aura that would have left an ordinary person trembling in fear. However, for Ye Wei, it was pointless. She had experienced even more intimidating auras. "Do you know why I'm here, or are you pretending?" "Just say it plainly. Your attempts at subtlety can't hide your affection for him." Su Man hit the nail on the head. Despite Ye Wei's year-long pursuit, she had been in jest most of the time. How could he not understand that? In a way, he had tacitly accepted the friendship between Ye Wei and Eleven, evidenced by how he had let them stay at his house for such a long time. Even though they were formidable, he could find ways to send them away as long as he wanted. "What's wrong with me liking him?" Ye Wei admitted unabashedly, unfazed by having her thoughts exposed. She openly acknowledged it, patting Su Man in the chest. "Should he be considered two people or one?" "What do you think?" Su Man retorted, "What do you care about?" "He's a member of the Mafia, possibly the mastermind behind Louis. So, what if I like him?" Ye Wei replied, with a smile that carried a hint of self-mockery. "Who knows, it might just be a scheme." Su Man raised an eyebrow, the night's hues emphasizing his snow-white attire. His eyes were piercing, and his entire demeanor exuded an air of nobility and arrogance, yet it was imbued with profound wisdom. "Are you worried that he might scheme against you?" "That's a reasonable deduction," Ye Wei said, pulling over a nearby chair and sitting down. "I've spent my whole life scheming against others; I never intended to be schemed against by others." "Ye Wei, you're in trouble," Su Man said in a soft tone, his voice carrying a warmth akin to spring water. "You've really fallen for him." Ye Wei's smile faded, replaced by a sneer that held a tinge of cruelty and dominance. "Su Man, do you think I should kill him to eradicate any future trouble?" Su Man smiled, his air noble and distant. "I'm certain you can't bring yourself to do it." "What a joke. Is there anyone I can't kill in this world?" Ye Wei laughed as well, her demeanor exuding an elegant dominance. Her demeanor was audacious, embodying her usual wild and arrogant character. "I am certain." Su Man's voice turned deep, his expression serious as he asked, "Ye Wei, you take what you want, plunder what you desire, destroy what you don't want. You've always been like this. Let me give you a word of advice: whatever is too tough is easier to break." "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. You're no better," Ye Wei waved her hand. "Aren't you the same? Me, you, Eleven, Bai Ye. Among people like us, who isn't like this?" "Just think of Mo Jue before. He was the same." Su Man just looked at her and did not say anything; his jet-black eyes exuding a chilling and penetrating aura that could instill fear in others. Ye Wei grew annoyed by his gaze, feeling somewhat flustered, "Do you really have no idea when he'll recover?" "I don't know. People like him are extremely rare. There's simply no precedent to refer to. Even if I've encountered similar cases before, their situations can't compare to Mo Jue's." Su Man spoke truthfully. "Is there a way to keep him in his current 'Big Bai' persona forever?"+ "What do you mean?" "To make him stay like this forever." "Ye Wei, this is impossible." Su Man's tone grew icy, and he continued, "You're pushing it too far. His current temperament is temporary; it won't last long. His original self is the true one. Don't confuse the two. Just like in the case of reality and virtuality, his current personality is virtual." "I don't care. I just want to know if there's a way to keep him like this forever," Ye Wei asked in a solemn tone. It wasn't that she preferred Mo Jue's current state over his previous one. She knew that the original Mo Jue was the real one. However, her concern was that once Mo Jue reverted to his former self, their relationship might come to an end. In that case, it would be better to keep him like this. If that's the case, it would be better to maintain the status quo. "Would you rather cling to an empty shell?" Su Man was puzzled; this wasn't Ye Wei's usual character. He knew the Ye Wei he was familiar with was carefree and unrestrained, not someone who would go to such extremes for one person. "It's not exactly an empty shell; he's quite adorable this way," Ye Wei smiled, her expression turning cold. "So, can you do it or not?" "I can't," Su Man said resolutely. "If the virtual soul remains in his body for too long, it will devour his true self. In the end, he'll die." Ye Wei furrowed her brows. Would he die? Her breathing stopped for a moment, and she felt a heavy weight in her chest, vexing and unsettling. There was always a sense of foreboding. "Su Man, I have a very ominous feeling. Either he dies or I die. Tell me, what should I do?" "Do you want him to die, or do you want to die yourself?" "Don't talk nonsense. I'm just in my early twenties; I don't want to die." "Well, there you have it." Su Man replied, and Ye Wei was momentarily stunned. "Alright!" Ye Wei's lips curved into a smile, a trace of killing intent flashing through her eyes. "Understood." She turned and left the research lab. As soon as she left, Bai Ye entered. Su Man's gaze turned sharp, cold as the sharpest iron. "What are you doing here?" "There's the latest virus analysis data from Rome." Bai Ye answered calmly, glancing at the direction Ye Wei had left. "Are you sure you're not deliberately breaking a couple of lovebirds apart?" "Lovebirds are meant to be broken apart." Bai Ye was speechless.... Ye Wei sat alone in the courtyard, silent and contemplative. She regretted going to find Su Man earlier. Her mood was incredibly heavy. She had never been so hesitant in her life. She raised her gaze to the bright moon in the sky, her heart feeling even more restless. Mo Jue, Mo Jue... What should she do about him? Ye Wei was unclear about her own feelings at the moment. If Mo Jue reverted to his previous self, their conflicting interests would probably lead to an inevitable showdown. She couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement when she thought about the intense battles they had fought in the past, but there was also a hint of helplessness. If he remained as "Big Bai" forever, it wouldn't be fair to him. As Su Man had said, even life itself would become illusory. This was something Ye Wei was unwilling to accept. What she was even more unwilling to accept was the possibility that Mo Jue's current demeanor was just an act. But what did that mean? She knew herself well. She wouldn't show mercy to an enemy, even if that enemy was Mo Jue. Should she kill him? Or should she spare him? Su Man was right; his piercing eyes saw everything clearly. If she were to fight against Mo Jue, she would give it her all. But could she really bring herself to kill him? The incident at the beach was a vivid example. If she were to kill him, now was the time. She was worried about his recent behavior. If he returned to his former self, she might not be able to kill him. To kill or not to kill? Ye Wei slapped her own forehead in frustration. It was truly a dilemma. "On such a hot day, why are you trying to be so profound here?" Eleven patted Ye Wei in the shoulder and sat down beside her. "Thinking about killing Mo Jue?" "You're like a mind-reader." Ye Wei chuckled. "I'm just struggling with the decision of whether or not to kill him." The incident of releasing a tiger back into the mountains had nearly cost the lives of her third brother's entire family. Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya were still infected with the virus, and she wasn't sure if there was a cure. While Little Cutie was safe, Nuonuo had died, and Little Cutie's heart also withered. If she had listened to Eleven's advice at the beach and killed the Mo brothers, none of these events would have unfolded. It wouldn't have been so easy for Louis to take them away. Now, she clearly sensed that something was amiss. The ominous feeling grew stronger, and all signs pointed toward the Mo brothers. With Mo Jue right by her side, it was a perfect opportunity. If she missed it, she might never have another chance to kill Mo Jue in her lifetime. They had created their own tragedy, and they should be the ones to end it. "Eleven, if it were Boss Mo acting like this, would you kill him?" Ye Wei suddenly asked. Eleven's voice was cold as she replied, "It doesn't matter what I say. You have to decide for yourself. I don't want to mislead you." "Then that means you would." Ye Wei smiled, understanding her meaning. "It's truly a dilemma. How can I bring myself to kill someone as innocent as Mo Jue?" '"..." Ye Wei, you've really fallen too deep into the pit.    "Boss Mo has been missing for so many days. Where did he go?" Ye Wei muttered to herself. It was truly unusual and worrisome. "You know, back on the beach, he almost lost his gun for the sake of Mo Jue. He was willing to risk his life. But now that we have Mo Jue in our hands, he's nowhere to be found. It's strange. He cares so much for Mo Jue, so why is he suddenly so indifferent?" "I find it strange too." Eleven's eyes narrowed coldly. "And you are not the only one. I have a bad feeling about this, too." As assassins, their senses were keenly attuned. Ye Wei and Eleven exchanged glances without saying much. They sat there for a while longer before Ye Wei returned to her room. Mo Jue was on the bed, playing on his computer. Ye Wei furrowed her brows; she hadn't seen Mo Jue play games for days. When Mo Jue noticed Ye Wei enter, he brightened up and greeted her with a cheerful smile. "Darling, you're back. Come here for a kiss." Ye Wei smiled and leaned over to give him a peck on the lips. "What are you playing?" "A game." Mo Jue said, showing her his progress eagerly. "I just defeated a monster." "Amazing," Ye Wei chuckled, relieved to see the game screen. Her tense heart finally relaxed. This little fool, she thought, gazing at Mo Jue and enjoying his extraordinary beauty and the innocence in his smile. He was just like a child. Who could bring themselves to harm a child? "Darling, why are you looking at me like that?" Mo Jue sensed Ye Wei's gaze, paused the game, and curiously asked, his gaze somewhat vacant. What had happened to his darling? "Nothing," Ye Wei replied absentmindedly, letting out a sigh and collapsing onto the bed. This little fool, why did he have to be so innocent? "Darling, are you feeling sad?" Mo Jue lay down beside Ye Wei, his gaze turning fierce. "Did someone bully you? Tell Big Bai, and I'll tear them to pieces." The angel instantly transformed into a demon. "Only my darling can bully others, but no one can bully her." Ye Wei waved her hand dismissively. "Do I look sad to you?" Damn it, you little fool. Do you even know what it meant to be sad? How could a person without a heart be sad? "You look sad." Mo Jue stubbornly insisted, "Darling, do you really like that Su Man?" "Yes." "What about me? What about Big Bai?" "You are different." Ye Wei smiled and responded. She patted his pouting cheek. "Stop pouting. Why do you mind Su Man? "I don't want you to like him." "I also like third brother, I also like Eleventh, I like third sister-in-law, I like Ningning. I like too many people." Ye Wei raised her hand and looked into Mo Jue's angry eyes, feeling funny. "Darling, you didn't mention me." Mo Jue looked pitifully wronged, grabbing the sleeve of Ye Wei's shirt as if he were a spoiled puppy. "Alright, I'll wash my face and talk to you later." Ye Wei jumped up from the bed and headed to the bathroom. Mo Jue grumbled unhappily, his fingers tapping a few keys on the keyboard. The game screen immediately switched to a different three-dimensional view. Drinking alcohol? Why did his brother ask him to drink alcohol? Mo Ye typed on the keyboard: After drinking, your darling will love you more. Mo Jue felt puzzled: Really? Boss Mo: Be good, believe your brother. Mo Jue's gaze shifted to the side, where there were two glasses of red wine that the maids had just brought in. His darling had never let him drink alcohol before, so he curiously picked up one of the glasses... Ye Wei emerged from the bathroom, immediately sensing a change in the atmosphere. The room was constructed from icy jade, giving it an exceptionally cool ambiance, yet she felt as though half of her heart had turned cold. Mo Jue sat on the edge of the bed, slowly setting down the wine glasses... When did they get wine here? Ye Wei was taken aback, only to see Mo Jue lift his gaze. His mesmerizing purple eyes were cold, chilling, and a strange aura emanated from his entire being. Ye Wei remained silent for three seconds before she conjured up her usual charming smile. "Hey, Beauty Mo Jue, are you awake?" Chapter 375 Virus Attacked in Advance Mo Jue slowly stood up, his tall and slender figure looked as if immersed in a layer of night, exuding a compelling pressure that turned the already cool room into an icy realm, permeated with danger. It was a tense and sharp aura, as if it could slice a person into pieces inch by inch. Ye Wei's smile grew increasingly seductive, yet a fierce killing intent lurked in her eyes, revealing an indescribable cold ruthlessness and malevolence. There was also a kind of complex determination, which was accompanied by that smile to produce an effect that made Ye Wei seemed like a poppy flower swaying atop a cliff. She looked beautiful but dangerous. The two confronted each other, neither uttering a word. It was as if they were competing in a battle of aura, testing whose presence was stronger. Their equally beautiful and dangerous gazes clashed fiercely in the air, igniting sparks of intense heat. This feeling was all too familiar. It was reminiscent of their encounter in the sewer, both relentless and showing no mercy, each trying to bring the other to their demise. Mo Jue, you also want to kill me, right? They were of the same kind, and since Ye Wei had harbored the intention to kill Mo Jue, she understood that the real Mo Jue wouldn't spare her life either. They were of the same genre. "Where am I now?" Mo Jue asked, each word sounding icy. His memories were stuck on the island with the scene of Ye Wei smashing a bottle of rum against him. Over the past seven days, all memories had become blank to him. He couldn't recall what had happened when he was Big Bai. But based on his keen observation and astonishing deduction ability, he knew that Ye Wei had escaped danger and that he had helped her. Otherwise, even if Eleven were completely unharmed, the two of them wouldn't have escaped that island. He knew that whenever he drank, he would unquestioningly follow the orders of the first person he saw. That's why Mo Ye never allowed him to touch alcohol. He had become an idiot only five times before: three times when Boss Mo thought he looked innocently cute and made him drink, and one time when he was very young and the two of them caused trouble, after which Boss Mo made him drink and then acted cute in front of their master. This was the sixth time. Mo Jue was well aware of Ye Wei's character. She would undoubtedly use him to her advantage without reservation. And his big brother would likely temporarily spare Ye Wei and Eleven to protect him. "Saudi Arabia, Riyadh." Ye Wei's voice carried a seductive laughter, like tinkling silver bells. "Beauty Mo Jue, have you forgotten everything?" This was an affirmative sentence. Even if he tried to hide it, his words hinted at the truth the instant he spoke. Forgotten everything? It truly was... Ye Wei felt a mix of sorrow and anger. Although she thought she had been quite oppressive towards Mo Jue, over these past seven days, she had been exceedingly kind to him, hugging and kissing him to his heart's content, and they were almost about to roll on the bed. She rarely acted this kind-heartedly and was scarcely this gentle. He actually couldn't remember anything? Ye Wei was far from calm, and Mo Jue's voice was icy as he said, "No need."  "No need?" Ye Wei raised an eyebrow. Had she misheard? The smile on her face turned even colder, a hint of anger simmering from within. Mo Jue gazed at her with a heavy expression. "I don't need this memory." A cold light flickered in Ye Wei's eyes, and the flames within seemed to grow brighter. She chuckled, her laughter carrying a hint of mockery. "Indeed, there is no need. You merely had a dream and woke up without a trace of nostalgia. To me, this doesn't even qualify as a dream, so there's naturally no need for me to remember it." Mo Jue's gaze grew even colder, the curtains rustling as a fierce killing intent filled the entire spacious room. Tension permeated the air, like a taut string. In an instant, Mo Jue moved, his figure as swift as a ghost. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of Ye Wei, his fingers spread wide as he aimed directly for her throat. His speed was as astonishing as a gust of wind that swept through, and Ye Wei retreated repeatedly. She pushed off the wall with her right foot, propelling herself in mid-air, her body somersaulting. When she landed behind Mo Jue, she immediately twisted her body and swept her leg toward his spine. Spotting her movement by listing to the wind, Mo Jue didn't even turn his head. He caught her foot with a swift grab, yanking it forcefully in the same way an eagle dropped its prey, slamming Ye Wei hard against the wall. Damn, he's ruthless! Ye Wei spun in mid-air, but Mo Jue didn't even spare her time to catch her breath. His palm swiftly approached her, and Ye Wei pushed against the wall with her hand, using her feet to kick the wall to spring upward. She evaded Mo Jue's follow-up strike, reached out, and grabbed the iron handle of a crystal lamp. With a graceful twist, she kicked toward Mo Jue, forcing him to step back. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Ye Wei landed on the ground, kicking a wooden chair in the room toward Mo Jue. She lunged forward with it, not giving him a chance to react. But to her surprise, Mo Jue's fist met the chair, and the collision's tremendous force shattered it into fragments. Debris scattered everywhere. Her fist clashed with Mo Jue's incoming fist, and Ye Wei felt her wrist went numb for a moment. Her knuckles stung, and she opened her other hand, driving her fingers firmly into the acupoints along Mo Jue's arm. She tried to twist and immobilize him, but Mo Jue effortlessly turned his body, pulling her close into his embrace. "You can't defeat me." "Mo Jue's voice grew heavy as he stated a fact without mercy. His scorching breath sprayed between Ye Wei's neck, the most familiar scent she had experienced in these seven days. Ye Wei smiled faintly and said, "Then let's see who has the more ruthless heart." With that, she elbowed backward, and Mo Jue caught her arm. Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his other wrist. Ye Wei twisted his arm and turned her body, launching a powerful kick toward his head. Caught off guard, Mo Jue took the kick head-on, his body slamming against the wall. Beauty Ye tapped her foot and the chair flew up. She took it and smashed it fiercely at Mo Jue. He shielded his head with his arms, and the chair crashed against both his and shattered into pieces. Only one leg of the chair remained. Metal skin and bronze bones! "Damn it, Beauty Su, with all your wealth, you're still using knockoffs." This chair was just too fragile. It fell apart so easily. It must be a knockoff. Ye Wei threw away the broken wooden stick in her hand and swung her fist fiercely at Mo Jue's face. After she only threw a couple of punches without feeling content, Mo Jue caught her wrist, pulled her forward forcefully, and they instantly switched positions. Ye Wei was now pressed against the wall by Mo Jue, receiving a brutal round of beating without mercy. Punch after punch landed on her chest and abdomen, about four or five in total in each part. "Playing tough?" Mo Jue's voice was dark, ignoring the fact that Ye Wei was coughing up blood from his blows. He swung another punch, landing heavily on her abdomen. Ye Wei coughed up a mouthful of blood, her face turning paper-white in an instant. She felt as though her organs had changed places, burning in intense pain. The agony was unbearable... Compared with their first fight in the sewer, this time Mo Jue's attacks were harsher and faster. His actions proved he could be more ruthless than her. It was as if he was saying, "I'm tougher than you, so don't play tough with me." Ye Wei wiped away the blood from the corner of her lips and summoned a seductive smile, resembling a rose that had lost its luster. Yet, she stubbornly exuded her beauty, her alluring charm shining brilliantly. Even if she was on the verge of withering, she emanated an arrogant pride within her brilliance. "Why stop fighting now?" Beauty Ye smiled radiantly, raising her hand and striking hard at Mo Jue. He turned his head to dodge, and Ye Wei took advantage of the situation. Her other hand swung around and landed her bloody palm fiercely on Mo Jue's face. Mo Jue's gaze darkened, and Ye Wei's smile widened. "This punch, this slap—is in exchange for the past seven days, and we wipe the slate clean on everything between us. No debts owed." He hesitated, and Ye Wei smiled, her beauty otherworldly. Only then did Mo Jue realize that the two of them were in the midst of their battle, Ye Wei's palm force had reached his chest, slamming heavily into it. Mo Jue staggered back several steps. A trace of blood appeared at the corner of his lips. He raised his gaze, his expression turning cold and fierce. Ye Wei's palm force came again, and she struck him in the chest multiple times, each blow merciless, as if she was determined to beat him to death right then and there. She was cold and ruthless to the extreme. Although she wore a smile, it was a suffocatingly dangerous smile. "Ye Wei!" Mo Jue was usually sparing with his words, but now he was furious. Swift as a dart, he shot forward, and the two formidable figures were engaged in a fierce brawl. It was a rather clumsy brawl, as if both had forgotten their extraordinary martial arts skills. They fought like street brawlers, only attacking but not defending. Punch for punch, blow for blow. The two grappled like wild beasts, roaring and struggling. The furniture in the room was scattered and smashed, reduced to a state of disarray as if an earthquake had struck the place. Both of them were far from unscathed. Bruises dotted their bodies, creating a ghastly sight to behold. Ye Wei, in particular, looked like a blood-stained broken doll. Yet, she seemed to possess an endless well of strength, stubbornly facing off against Mo Jue without showing any signs of weakness. The commotion had already alerted Bai Ye, Su Man, and Eleven. Third Young Master Ye, Cheng Anya, and Little Cutie all rushed over as well. When they arrived, Ye Wei was riding on Mo Jue, pummeling him relentlessly. The fierceness of her blows sent shivers down the spines of Bai Ye and Third Young Master Ye. Suddenly, Mo Jue kicked forcefully at her abdomen. Ye Wei's body flipped backward. Just as she was about to fall on a piece of broken glass, Eleven was going to rush forward to catch her, but Mo Jue was quicker. He grabbed her hand and expertly exerted force, both of them managing to stand up from the ground. Just as they steadied themselves, they simultaneously threw punches at each other, their fists colliding intensely before they both staggered back. Eleven hurriedly reached out to support Ye Wei by the waist, helping her stand upright. Both of them were panting heavily, and they were in a sorry state. Mo Jue's once handsome face was now a hideous sight, battered and bruised. Ye Wei was in no better condition. Seeing Mo Jue's expression, everyone knew he had reverted to his original state. Truly, the difference was like heaven and earth. "You guys are quite fierce," Bai Ye's voice was calm. It was the first time he had seen Ye Wei in such a battered state, and he couldn't help but find it rather extraordinary. Although he was initially just spectating, his fists were clenched, ready to join the combat at any moment. Ye Wei smiled alluringly, like a rose stained with blood, "Beauty Mo Jue, I can't beat you one-on-one, how about a group fight?" Mo Jue snorted coldly, "You want to give it a try?" "Brother Big Bai, no... Mo Jue, you're so arrogant. Even if you disregard Weiwei, with just me and Eleven, you won't escape this estate." Bai Ye chuckled coldly, "As long as Weiwei is willing to give him up." Eleven snorted, "He's not going anywhere." After beating Weiwei like this, there was no chance for him to leave. Suddenly, Cheng Anya suggested, "Ah Chen, go fight him. Even if you can't beat him, he'll die." Virus, what a powerful weapon. Bai Ye gave a thumbs-up, "Great idea." However, Third Young Master Ye looked at Ye Wei. Suddenly, a tear gas grenade broke through the window, flying into the room. The glass shattered instantly, and white smoke filled the room. Everyone hurriedly exited the room and closed the door. When they entered again, no one was inside. "Boss Mo was here," Little Cutie said. Since Mo Jue had disappeared, it would be futile to chase after him. Eleven's brow furrowed, and Ye Wei clutched her abdomen, coughing up another mouthful of blood before fainting in Eleven's arms. "Weiwei..." Both Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya rushed forward, but they didn't dare to touch her. They were extremely anxious. Third Young Master Ye looked at Bai Ye, "Bai Ye..." "To my room first," Eleven said. Bai Ye carried her horizontally, heading toward Eleven's room. Third Young Master Ye was worried and wanted to follow, but Little Cutie entered Ye Wei's room. Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya were concerned about their son's safety, so they had no choice but to stay behind. Little Cutie avoided the debris on the floor and hopped onto the bed. "Ningning, what are you doing?" Third Young Master Ye asked in a deep voice, curiously moving closer. Everyone looked at the computer screen. Mo Jue: Drinking alcohol? Boss Mo: After drinking, your darling will love you more. Mo Jue: Really? Boss Mo: Be good, believe your brother. Third Young Master Ye's eye twitched, and Cheng Anya was speechless. Was this what they called abduction? "Damn, Boss Mo is really clever. Did he just summon Mo Jue back like that?" This was clearly blatant abduction. It was a game between the Big Bad Wolf and the Little White Rabbit. Surely, the Little White Rabbit lost. "Boss Mo is indeed something." Little Cutie rubbed his chin and rapidly tapped a few keys on the keyboard. Suddenly, the screen seemed to crash, and a stream of English texts scrolled rapidly. Finally, they stopped at a certain point. "Daddy, do you remember when we came back, we saw a car parked outside?" Little Cutie suddenly asked. Third Young Master Ye nodded. "Boss Mo was in it." Third Young Master Ye was about to say something when suddenly his arm was wracked with intense pain. It then spread to his liver, sharp and piercing, as if thin needles were stabbing into his organ. His limbs began to ache intensely too. He went into spasms, collapsing onto the bed, convulsing uncontrollably. "Ah Chen." "Daddy..." "Go get Su Man quickly!" Cheng Anya urgently instructed. Little Cutie jumped off the bed and hurried out. "Ah Chen, hold on. Everything will be alright." Cheng Anya didn't know if she was saying those words for him to hear or for herself. The uneasiness in her heart intensified, and she felt an overwhelming fear of losing him. Cheng Anya's hands trembled in fear, and her face turned pale. Didn't Su Man say the virus wouldn't attack until tomorrow? Had it attacked earlier than expected? "Ah..." Third Young Master Ye suddenly let out a miserable scream. Veins popped on his forehead, and his exquisite features contorted, as if he was enduring unbearable agony that gradually surpassed his limits... Then, he fell into unconsciousness. Chapter 376 Untitled The virus on Third Young Master Ye erupted prematurely, and Cheng Anya was panicked and restless. She felt like sitting on pins and needles. She had originally wanted to accompany Third Young Master Ye, but Su Man advised her not to go to the lab. Beauty Su's words always carried an irresistible authority, and even though Cheng Anya was anxious and panicked, she still followed his advice and didn't rush to the lab. "Mommy, don't worry. Daddy will be fine." Little Cutie comforted Cheng Anya, his small pink face displaying a calm and firmness beyond his age. He elegantly smiled, as if nothing had happened, displaying an admirable composure. "Darling, mommy isn't that bad off. It's surprising that you're the one comforting me at a time like this." Miss Cheng understood her son the best. She smiled and told him not to worry. She admitted that she was genuinely worried. However, no matter how worried she was, she would consider her son's emotions. She wouldn't be flustered to the extent of ignoring her son's well-being. If she fell in a state of panic and had to be soothed by Little Cutie, who was also full of fear and worry, how embarrassing would that be? After all, she had always been Little Cutie's fierce Mommy, right? The mother and son went to see Ye Wei together. She was severely injured and unconscious. Bai Ye had already examined her and instructed someone to prepare herbal medicine and administered painkillers to her. Cheng Anya looked at Ye Wei and felt a bit distressed. The injury was so serious, yet Bai Ye's expression was calm. "The injury is serious for ordinary people, but for Ye Wei, it's nothing. She just needs to recuperate for a few days." "This isn't serious?" Cheng Anya was amazed. Did he mean only being beaten to death could be considered serious? In Ye Wei's room, there was drips of blood everywhere, and her clothes were also stained with blood. At a glance, it was obvious that she had been beaten to the point of vomiting blood. For Ye Wei to be severely injured to the point of unconsciousness, it was already a grave injury. "It's alright. She'll be better after a few days of rest." Bai Ye lightly chuckled and carefully applied some medicine to her. "Why do you think they have such a deep-seated grudge? They're fighting as if they wanted to kill each other. Isn't it a bit too much?" Bai Ye stroked his chin, seriously pondering. The situation seemed really off. Was Mo Jue embarrassedly angry? "They've fought each other to near-death on numerous occasions." Eleven said with a cold sneer. She was curious about how Mo Jue suddenly recovered. It was too sudden. "Bai Ye, when do you think she'll wake up?" "Probably tomorrow morning." Bai Ye said, poking Eleven's shoulder, asking, "Eleven, is Weiwei really trapped?" "What do you think?" "Did she fall in love with Big Bai or Beauty Mo Jue?" Bai Ye was quite curious about this question. Little Cutie tilted his head, pondered for a moment, and said, "Probably with Beauty Mo Jue?" "Why do you think so?" Eleven and Bai Ye asked in unison. Bai Ye secretly thought, "Ningning darling, you even understand what falling in love means. Times have changed really too fast." "Just a feeling." "Mo Jue's personality is more agreeable to Ye Wei instead of that of Big Bai, right? Because it's Mo Jue, Ye Wei had been willing to allow him to follow her after he became an idiot. If it were someone else, she would have long shaken them off. All in all, it's because it's Mo Jue. "Poor Weiwei." Bai Ye looked at the wounds on her body and sighed pretentiously.  He crossed his arms on his chest and smiled, unrestrained and carefree. "I'm a little looking forward to how Weiwei can conquer such a formidable Beauty Mo Jue." Miss Cheng, who had been silent all along, couldn't help but speak up, "I've never understood. Is there a difference between Big Bai and Mo Jue? Aren't they the same person?"    "Mommy, they aren't the same, but they are way too different," Little Cutie countered. Bai Ye and Eleven both agreed with him. They practically treated them as two persons. One was a devil, the other an angel. They were from different races and different factions. They couldn't be put on a par with each other at all. "Not really. Think about it. Even your daddy sometimes behaves seriously and sometimes acts extremely foolishly. People have many facets to their personalities. Why can't Mo Jue be multi-faceted?" Cheng Anya smiled and presented her point of view, "They are the same person." "It's different." "Same." "Mommy, three against one. Minority obeys the majority. You lost. Stop struggling." Little Cutie said with a smiling face, looking like a cute British young gentleman from the upper class. Cheng Anya was speechless. Seriously, this wasn't very democratic at all. As if sensing Cheng Anya's thoughts, Little Cutie smiled again, "Mommy, speaking of democratic choices, have you ever seen true democracy? You talk about social harmony, but when has society ever been harmonious?" Bai Ye and Eleven gave a thumbs-up. Little Cutie was awesome! He deserved the compliment. Cheng Anya was frustrated, "You, as a grown man, shouldn't bully weaker women like this." Little Cutie, "...uh..." The group laughed and left Eleven's room. Bai Ye chuckled, "You are truly an extraordinary pair of mother and son." "The entire family is extraordinary." Eleven succinctly added her comment. They were all extraordinary and eccentric. "Mr. Bai, the master invites you to the lab." The maid hurriedly came to invite Bai Ye. Everyone was taken aback. Bai Ye nodded and followed her to the lab. "Ningning, what's going on?" "Su Man asked Bai Ye to come to the lab." Little Cutie explained, and Cheng Anya's heart sank. Could it be that Ah Chen's condition had worsened? Her heart pounded, and her face instantly turned very ugly. She sat alone in the courtyard. Little Cutie had wanted to keep her company, but it was already late, and Cheng Anya asked him to go to bed. Little Cutie could only return to his room to rest. The night in Riyadh was also hot. There was hardly any breeze, and the outdoor temperature was unbearably high. Even if people wore a short-sleeved shirt, they would feel extremely hot. However, Cheng Anya unexpectedly felt cold all over her body, and a thin layer of cold sweat formed on her forehead. She couldn't feel any warmth. Cold. A coldness emanated from the inside out, making her feel extremely uncomfortable. It felt just like when Louis told her she had a virus, and they were waiting for Third Young Master Ye to arrive. She was very afraid. The night was getting darker and darker. It was already the latter half of the night. Cheng Anya had wanted to go to the lab several times to take a look, but she couldn't bring herself to approach it. She knew exactly how one felt when the virus acted up; she had experienced it herself. When it happened to her, the pain was unbearable. She felt like she was enduring immense hardship. However, she didn't have to endure it for long. Louis would administer a reagent to alleviate her suffering. But she had seen Zhang Bo smashing his head against the wall in that small house until he bled because of the excruciating pain, ultimately choosing death to end his suffering. The more she recalled Zhang Bo's gruesome state before his death, the colder Cheng Anya felt, and her heartbeat raced. That ominous premonition once again loomed over her. The night was quiet, with only the sound of water splashing from the courtyard's fountain. While the sound used to be soothing to the ears, tonight it felt agitating. She paced around the courtyard for a while before sitting down again. She crossed her arms and pondered, exuding an unusual tranquility, as if blending into the darkness of the night. She was so quiet that she appeared not to exist at all. After a while, she suddenly stood up and walked towards the lab as if she had made up her mind. The closer she got, the more terrifying she felt. She was afraid of hearing Third Young Master Ye's screams, but unexpectedly, it was quiet. Cheng Anya reassured herself that maybe it was nothing to worry about. Bai Ye was highly skilled in medicine, and Su Man was a virus expert. It was different from Zhang Bo's situation back then. Perhaps there would be a turning point. She shouldn't scare herself unnecessarily. With determination, she pushed open the door to the lab and walked in. Bai Ye was recording and analyzing data on a research screen. He was the first to notice Cheng Anya's presence. He raised an eyebrow and asked, "Anya, why are you here?" Su Man was conducting experiments with two reagents. He didn't even lift his head. He was focused on analyzing the compound under a microscope, completely absorbed in his work. Cheng Anya whispered, "You guys continue with your work. I won't disturb you. I'll just stay here with him." Bai Ye glanced at Third Young Master Ye on the operating table and nodded. The lab wasn't very large, but it was well-equipped. Cheng Anya felt like she was in a modern research center, as if she had stepped into a scene from a movie. Third Young Master Ye lay on the operating table, clad in isolation clothing and wearing an oxygen mask. His limbs were shackled with handcuffs and ankle cuffs. Needles were inserted into his arms, chest, thighs, calves, and even his head. Several bottles of unfamiliar liquids were suspended above him, dripping slowly into his body. Cheng Anya lowered her gaze, holding his hand, but she unexpectedly noticed a bloodstain on the floor. Following her gaze, she saw a large patch of fresh blood on the floor beneath her feet. Cheng Anya looked at his wrists, which were tightly secured by the handcuffs. Due to struggling, there were two clear wounds in his wrists, bleeding profusely. She bit her lips abruptly, suppressing the sourness in her eyes. She could imagine how he had struggled and hurt himself. Without even looking, she could guess that his ankles also bore injuries. He must have tried to free himself. Ah Chen... Through the isolation clothing, she held his hand. Cheng Anya looked at Third Young Master Ye, who was sleeping unconsciously, her heart throbbing with a dull ache. She wanted to cry, but the tears wouldn't come. She couldn't cry; he would definitely get better. "Evil begets evil, and good begets good. The one who deserves retribution is Louis, not Ye Chen, who has endured torment and a life full of hardships. Ah Chen, don't be afraid. I'll be by your side, always with you." Even if it means going to hell, I'll be with you. I won't let you be alone. Cheng Anya remembered the oath she had made before, vowing that she would be Ye Chen's guardian for the rest of her life. But she hadn't fulfilled her promise. Instead, because of her, he had almost lost his life. What kind of guardian was she? She was more like a harbinger of disaster. Cheng Anya felt a bit regretful. She tightly held Third Young Master Ye's hand, biting her lips to hold back the tears that were about to fall, quietly keeping him company. Third Young Master Ye was in a deep sleep, his pale face looking peaceful. His breath was weak, his heartbeat faint, and his hand was slightly warm. Cheng Anya's heart felt somewhat reassured. He was still alive, and that was good. For every second he lived, she would be there with him for that second. For every day he lived, she would be right by his side. Chapter 377 Untitled Cheng Anya remained in the lab accompanying Third Young Master Ye until late at night. Third Young Master Ye had taken a sedative and was soundly asleep. The only sounds in the lab were the blinking of electronic instruments and the sounds of test tubes clinking and reagents reacting, creating a serene ambiance. True to her promise, Cheng Anya refrained from disturbing Bai Ye and Su Man despite her inner fear and anxiety, fearing that she might affect their work.  The two men were engaged in their tasks—one conducting experiments, the other analyzing data. They worked seamlessly in cooperation, exchanging information before focusing on their individual tasks, hardly engaging in conversation. She sat quietly by the side, keeping Third Young Master Ye company. Exhausted as she was, she felt no trace of sleepiness. Her eyes were fixed on his face, occasionally glancing at Bai Ye and Su Man to gauge the progress from their expressions. Later, Bai Ye couldn't bear it any longer. "Anya, you should go back and rest. Third Young Master Ye won't wake up while he's under the sedative. Even if you stay here, it won't help him until we have finished preparing the antidote." "It's fine. I'm not tired." Cheng Anya replied, determined to stay by Third Young Master Ye's side. Bai Ye chuckled, "I'm not worried about you being tired. I'm concerned that the instability of the virus in your body might worsen and attack earlier than expected." Cheng Anya opened her mouth trying to respond but didn't say anything. She continued to hold Third Young Master Ye's hand, unwilling to let go. She knew Bai Ye was right, but she didn't want to leave. "You can't stay here without eating or sleeping for days." Bai Ye advised, realizing that Ningning's Mommy was even more stubborn than Weiwei. Seeing her expressionless determination, he felt his efforts were likely in vain. "Just a little while longer." Cheng Anya said, hoping to stay a bit longer as much as she could. After all, she had nothing to do back at her place. Bai Ye shook his head, conceding to her wishes. Tiredness would eventually lead her to leave. He really didn't understand love. Why would intelligent people behave foolishly and choose such futile actions? He couldn't see any benefits from what they did. Bai Ye handed Su Man the data that had been analyzed, while Su Man handed over his experimental data. Su Man slapped the information onto the nearby table, with a chilling glint in his eyes that seemed to bring a cold breeze into the room. He coldly said, "Having a woman around annoys me and hampers the progress." Bai Ye was speechless.... "Beauty Su, you are truly ruthless!" The fact that he could utter such words, with a tone so icy and an attitude so aloof and irritable, really seemed to hint at something. It led Bai Ye to ponder his sexual orientation, and he fell into silence. Perhaps, the rumor about him was real. Otherwise, he wouldn't avoid beauties like Weiwei. Cheng Anya stood up slowly, her lips twitching in a mixture of anger and frustration to the extent that she wanted to pound the table. "Su Man, don't be so blatantly sexist!" Su Man's expression remained emotionless, exuding an air of "I am gender-biased, so what?" His demeanor was unapologetically domineering, lacking the slightest bit of self-awareness of the need for being tender towards the fairer sex. Miss Cheng ghosted out of the lab. She knew better than stay.  Since Su Man had made it clear that he didn't like women around to annoy him, Cheng Anya naturally couldn't stay. She didn't mind his progress, but failing to develop the antidote was a big issue. Regardless of the true meaning of his words, she couldn't continue staying in the lab. Bai Ye gave him a thumbs up. "Impressive." Su Man raised an eyebrow slightly. With a cold snort, he resumed working. Due to the urgency of time, Bai Ye also couldn't afford to be distracted. He returned to the screen to analyze the data. This was the most puzzling medical case he had encountered since becoming a doctor. He had to devote full attention to it, or else he wouldn't be able to keep up with Su Man's pace. Competition existed as well, and it was inevitable. Su Man had displayed an arrogant and overbearing attitude from the very beginning. His seemingly disdainful demeanor towards everyone was quite infuriating. Bai Ye was proud and renowned as a genius doctor. He couldn't tolerate such contempt. At the moment, he made it his goal to earn his acknowledgment. His title as a genius doctor wasn't just a casual label. "Su Man, I curse that you'll fall into the hands of a woman in the future." Cheng Anya muttered under her breath. Would tanbis shun women? It was the first time she had heard of such a thing. He was probably intentionally saying that to drive her away. If tanbis exhibited gender bias, then fujoshis and tanbi enthusiasts would be truly heartbroken. The Earth was on the verge of being conquered by fujoshis. She herself had dominated the internet for years and knew countless tanbi enthusiasts and fujoshis. Each one of them would turn ecstatic at the mention of tanbis, exhibiting a fervor akin to a facing wolves and tigers. And she herself was a bona fide tanbi aficionado. The feeling of being looked down upon was truly unpleasant. Suddenly, an image flashed through her mind. They often said that when a man and a woman were left alone in a room, a passionate fire was inevitable. But what if it was a man with another man? Especially when one of those men was gay, especially considering Bai Ye's character, exceptional abilities, and handsome, elegant appearance—the imagery was really... In her mind, scenes of their affectionate interactions arose, and Miss Cheng was left feeling utterly disoriented. Ah ah ah... There had to be something wrong with her to have such thoughts. Su Man's appearance was the embodiment of deathly coldness towards anyone who dared to offend him, and his gaze was as if he ruled over heaven and earth, an arrogant and domineering attitude that made him seem untouchable and exquisitely noble. Even a glimpse of him would be considered profane. How could he possibly be involved with Bai Ye in any romantic entanglement? It was all because he provoked her with gender bias, leading her thoughts astray into wild and baseless speculations. It was truly embarrassing.. Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, seven days had gone by. Ye Wei's injuries had healed, and there were no traces of bruises on her face. She had completely returned to her original state. Little Cutie teased that his aunt was like an indestructible cockroach, recovering remarkably fast. After nearly losing the use of her wrist when almost defeated by Mo Jue last time, she had also recovered astonishingly quickly again this time. They had expected her to feel some sense of loss, but ever since she woke up, Ye Wei had been smiling like a blossoming flower. Her actions and behavior were just like before, showing no sign of having encountered Mo Jue at all. She never mentioned Beauty Mo Jue or Brother Big Bai. It felt as if that person had permanently disappeared from her world, so there was really nothing worth mentioning. The matter concerning the First Terrorist Organization was being handled by someone else. Neither Ye Wei nor Eleven was management personnel, so they stayed in Riyadh. During this period, the outside world remained calm and quiet. The only sign of disturbance was Melillia. Chu Li, infuriated for the beauty's sake, led the elite air force of the First Terrorist Organization in a siege-style bombardment of Prince William of Country R in the desert. After all, Rong Yan was in the castle. He didn't dare to conduct a sweeping bombardment. He could only rely on the advanced weaponry to keep up the siege. What was even more malicious was that Chu Li, without hesitation, sent people to poison the water source near the castle, directly severing their supply of vital water. Every day, the air force circled above the castle, projecting an image of having an abundance of time to waste, challenging anyone to outlast the other. Such a brutal and domineering act could only be done by terrorists. Given Chu Li's level of cunning, cutting off the water source was already the lightest action he could take. If it weren't for his concern about Rong Yan's safety, this battle would have been even more distorted and gruesome. On the other hand, Lin Yixuan won his case related to Dragon Sector. He was released, and the higher-ups in City A personally confirmed it was a misunderstanding. Tang Si's situation gradually improved as well. Dragon Sector also had someone overseeing their affairs. Little Cutie, on behalf of Third Young Master Ye, was simultaneously involved in Dragon Sector's affairs in North America and maintaining contact with terrorists, preparing to provide reinforcements to Chu Li. They also had to deal with the encirclement and suppression from several major government forces, including the Spanish and Italian governments. Little Cutie suggested transferring the forces from the Middle East as much as possible to temporarily avoid confrontation. Chu Li's significant actions were clearly a provocation towards Country R. Regardless of whether neighboring countries were willing or not to offer help, they all had to come to its aid. If not physically, they would at least raise their voices in condemnation. Furthermore, the recent conflicts with the Mafia had alarmed quite a number of people. In short, all countries were aggressively looking to weaken the First Terrorist Organization's power by making use of this opportunity. Chu Li remained unruffled and continued with his usual ways. He circled in the desert every day, toying with Prince William of Country R. He completely disregarded the government forces' attempts to encircle him. He even spoke arrogantly, stating that his conflict with Prince William was a personal grudge, and anyone who intervened would be unlucky. Based on his consistent behavior, most of the smaller countries only dared to voice their opinions but not to intervene. While the chaotic battle between the First Terrorist Organization and the various government forces went on, it should have been a perfect time for the Mafia to act. Little Cutie had initially believed that Louis would definitely mobilize the Mafia to ruthlessly suppress the First Terrorist Organization, taking advantage of the situation to unify the entire dark force. Who would have thought that the Mafia seemed to have vanished into thin air? Aside from a few small-scale military activities in the Middle East in cooperation with the government forces, there were no signs of the Mafia's activities anymore. Little Cutie was thoroughly perplexed. After investigating, he discovered that Louis had tried to influence the authorities to create a situation for others to do the dirty work. That was why this chaotic battle had ensued. He had distanced himself from the conflict, merely watching as the others fought. Eleven spoke solemnly to point out, "This doesn't align with Louis' usual style." Ye Wei nodded in agreement. While their interactions with the Mafia had been limited, Louis' consistent style didn't align with such low-profile actions. Even when using others as a tool, he wouldn't be this discreet. "Could it be the Mo brothers?" Cheng Anya suddenly asked. Over the past few days, she had been discussing and learning about these matters with them. She had gained a rough understanding of the situation. "But what would they be up to?" Ye Wei pointed out sharply, a question that even Little Cutie couldn't immediately answer. "It won't be long before the allied government armies gave up." Ye Wei said with a seductive smile. "The commander mentioned last night that the counter-terrorism organization has started to intervene. The government forces will soon disband. They mustn't have expected this. Chaos is the mortal enemy of counterterrorism." Chapter 378 A Scandalous Affair! Little Cutie fell silent for a moment, recalling the scene from last night when the commander had berated them in the group chat. Reluctantly, he asked them to quickly retreat, unwilling to see them collide with danger. The feeling was beyond description, leaving them quite delighted. This time marked the largest and most far-reaching military operation in the history of the First Terrorist Organization. The anti-terrorism organization had long been itching for action. Back on Lethal Island, they were on the brink of making arrests. This time, the threat extended to Country R, and given the strong relations between Country R and various countries in South America and Europe, interference was inevitable.  The most likely outcome was the dissolution of the coalition forces of the governments this time. If they intervened, the most probable result would be mutual destruction. To save Country R and maintain peace, the best course of action was to dissolve the coalition forces and frame the conflict as a personal feud between Chu Li and Prince William who were in a rivalry over a woman. Only by letting it go could peace be preserved. "Judging from the situation, it'll probably take half a month. If the commander can leverage his connections to shake up the Mafia, things would be more fantastic." Little Cutie said slyly, rubbing his chin and waning to sit and watch the fight unfold to his benefits. However, despite the commander's irritable temperament, he was still quite intelligent. It wouldn't be so easy to scheme against him. Eleven nodded in agreement, "If you want the commander to do things for you, you need to offer a similar price. Figure out if he's after any specific targets or cases. Otherwise, it won't be easy to get his help." "The commander just likes to make things complicated, insisting on these formalities to look nice. If you need any information, just let Ningning know." Ye Wei chimed in with a laugh. "Chu Li, you should just hurry up and claim your lady. Otherwise, if the Mafia launches an attack, we might be caught unprepared. Ningning, haven't you found any information on the Mafia?" Little Cutie scratched his own nose, smiled, and said, "It'll probably take a few more days." Ye Wei nodded. Little Cutie's lips curled into a mischievous grin, his eyes sparkling playfully. "Auntie, are you looking for news about Uncle Big Bai?" "Yes, your aunt is eagerly awaiting his news to make her move," Ye Wei said with a coquettish smile, playing with the luminous glass in her hand. She seemed completely nonchalant. As if Mo Jue or Big Bai had no impact on her whatsoever. Cheng Anya chuckled, "Weiwei, don't push yourself too hard. You can't defeat him." That was an undeniable truth. She was still nursing her injuries from the last beating. She probably wanted to dismember Mo Jue by now, but the difference in strength was too glaring. She had to admit, Mo Jue was simply too formidable. Ye Wei raised an eyebrow, her smile radiant like a rose. She hooked her arm around Eleven's shoulder. "But I have a great partner. If I can't defeat him alone, I will start a group fight. Right, Eleven?" Eleven's response was cold as ice, with a mere shake of the head. "Sure, fine, we'll cooperate next time." Cheng Anya smiled, radiating a refreshing aura akin to a spring breeze. She resembled a blooming lily, pure and immaculate, with a hint of mischief hiding in her bright and sparkling eyes. She innocently asked, "Weiwei, didn't you have a gun on you? Why did you have to fight him with your hands?" Little Cutie pursed his lips and smiled. "Mommy, you nailed it. You're way too sharp. Yet, your innocent smile makes you look harmless." Eleven couldn't help but glance sideways at Ye Wei. Anya's point made sense. Ye Wei was renowned as a sharpshooter, able to wield guns with both hands in an incredibly agile manner. Even in combat, she could quickly draw her gun. That day, Mo Jue had no hidden weapons or firearms on him. If Ye Wei wanted to kill him, it would've been a piece of cake. Eleven had witnessed it with her own eyes: Ye Wei's hand was almost on the gun's handle. But in the end, she didn't pull it out. This lightning-fast motion might have seemed abrupt, but their years of understanding were genuine. Eleven knew Ye Wei's every move and intention in a fight. If she didn't shoot even when she was beaten up like that, what else could it mean? The Ye Wei they knew would rather chop someone to death than let herself get one punch from others. Yet, she was battered to near-death by Mo Jue. Ye Wei's expression remained unchanged, her smile becoming even more enchanting. "Third Sister-in-law, you don't understand. I prefer close combat to keep my muscles active. Fighting up close allows me to identify the opponent's weaknesses faster. It's tactical." Little Cutie fell silent and thought to himself, "Auntie. It's impressive that you can even come up with such remarks. What's the point of understanding someone else's tactics when you are beaten to death?" Cheng Anya nodded knowingly. "You're right. Back when you went to kill Ah Chen, you shouldn't have shot from above. You should've gotten up closer and found his weaknesses. Right?" "Third Sister-in-law, you're so evil-tongued. If Third Brother fights with me, I bet you won't even recognize his face." Ye Wei playfully said, feigning innocence. Cheng Anya laughed and didn't press further. Ye Wei lowered her gaze, swaying the luminous glass in her hand. The wine inside sloshed, and from the side, it looked like a brilliant light had pierced through the liquid. Truly, it was a splendid wine goblet that illuminated the night. Such enjoyment in life! So, who cared about Mo Jue or Big Bai? To hell with them! The clear liquid reflected a pair of serene eyes. "Is Third Brother still showing no signs of waking up?" Ye Wei suddenly asked. She hadn't been to the lab because she had been focusing on her own recovery over the past few days. Cheng Anya had similarly refrained from going to the lab. Ever since Su Man said that he was annoyed by the presence of women and couldn't concentrate, Cheng Anya had waited patiently for news, leaving the two of them busy in the lab. But she knew that Third Young Master Ye hadn't awakened yet. This virus was incredibly formidable. "Not yet. Su Man said that he'll continue like this until the antidote is developed. He's relying on nutritional supplements and sedatives, as well as various reagents which I don't really understand," Cheng Anya said with a smile, her worries replaced by calm. "Third Brother really has a rough time of it." Ye Wei felt a pang of heartache. If anyone were to ask her whom she loved the most in the world, it was in no case Big Bai or Mo Jue. It was Third Young Master Ye instead. It was the same with Cheng Anya. Everyone knew that Third Young Master Ye's life was hanging by a thread, with each passing day taking him closer to his end. The seven-day deadline had long passed, and he could only rely on medication to keep his heart beating. Though she felt pained, she was helpless. Why was it that she was perfectly fine, while Third Young Master Ye's life was on the line? "Mommy, Auntie, I believe Daddy will be okay. I'm sure of it." Little Cutie chuckled gracefully, "With Mommy and me around, Daddy won't bear to leave. Otherwise, if Mommy marries someone else, he'll jump out of the coffin even if he has become a ghost." Ye Wei and Cheng Anya held back their laughter, and Eleven's lips curved with a slight smile. It really matched Third Young Master Ye's style. Initially, Cheng Anya wanted Eleven and Ye Wei to leave Riyadh, considering they surely had many tasks to handle. But Ye Wei insisted on staying. Despite the turmoil outside, Riyadh remained calm, making it impractical to have too many people guarding the place. Thus, the two of them were responsible for the safety of the three members of the Ye family. Their negligence had led to the previous series of events. This time, Ye Wei and Eleven wouldn't leave. History wouldn't repeat itself with them. Eleven suddenly asked, "Anya, if Luis could touch you without getting infected, could his blood be used as an antidote?" "Bai Ye has also raised this question. Analyzing his blood might expedite the process, but Luis has undoubtedly considered this too. He's nowhere to be found, completely untraceable," Cheng Anya replied. The mention of Luis still sent shivers down her spine. "Where did he go? I feel like this is the calm before the storm. Something is bound to happen." "Don't overthink it, Mommy. The previous incident won't repeat itself. Don't worry." Although there weren't many people here, Su Man's mansion was unbreakable. Even Mo Ye could only observe from the outskirts and was unable to approach it. Others would have no chance of entering at all. This place was a sturdy estate, impenetrable and safe. "I'm not worried about that. I can't explain it anyway." "Third Sister-in-law, I'm curious about something. Why hasn't the virus in your body been triggered yet?" Ye Wei squinted, "Calculating the days, there's only a few days left before the one-month deadline. Even if it's not the time for death, the virus should have already been triggered." "I don't know either." Cheng Anya was puzzled as well. She had been fine for the past few days. Su Man and Bai Ye were fully invested in saving Third Young Master Ye and had temporarily left her alone. Even if the virus did attack, she would end up like Third Young Master Ye, lying on the operating table, either waiting for death or waiting to wake up. "Actually, I also feel puzzled." Little Cutie said with a smile and then cutely raised a finger. "Of course, Mommy, I'm not hoping for the virus to be triggered on you." "Third Sister-in-law, you must be a mutant." Everyone laughed. Amidst the laughter, footsteps were heard, and Bai Ye and Su Man emerged. They had spent the past two days in the lab. Both of them looked a little tired. Cheng Anya and the others immediately surrounded them. Su Man's face looked quite unwell. Despite looking tired, there was a faint rosy hue on Su Man's cheeks.  A burning flame flickered in his cold and fierce eyes. Ye Wei couldn't help but pinch her own arm. Huh, no fantastical elements? Even Beauty Su changed colors. What was going on? She vaguely felt like she had missed something intriguing. "Beauty Su, has the antidote been developed?" "Bai Ye, how's Ah Chen?" "Tomorrow." Su Man replied succinctly. Bai Ye waved his hand and sat down. After taking a sip of tea, he said, "Only the final ingredient is not ready. We will see whether it succeeds or not tomorrow." The heart that Cheng Anya had been holding in her throat finally fell. Judging from their expressions, she had thought hope was bleak, not knowing how long she would have to wait. She had no idea that she would hear good news. Her pale face flushed with a rosy hue, almost to the point of shedding tears. Even though she acted no differently in front of Little Cutie over these past few days, only she herself knew she hadn't been able to sleep due to worry. She had been staring in the direction of the lab all night. She had prayed to heaven over a hundred times, hoping for his safety. "That's great." Little Cutie's expression brightened, and the tension in the room eased. Su Man rubbed Little Cutie's head, his expression softening slightly, and his tone became gentler. "You were really worried, huh?" Ye Wei couldn't help but feel conflicted. Indeed, kids were favored. Beauty Su had never spoken to her so tenderly. She looked down on Little Cutie, who had suddenly outshined her in the eyes of Su Man. Ye Wei was quite vexed. "I'm worried." Little Cutie smiled, glanced at Su Man and then at the composed Bai Ye beside him. Sensing something amiss, Little Cutie's sharp intuition kicked in. "Su Man, Bai Ye, if it's good news, why did you both have such grave expressions when you first arrived?" Something was off. Bai Ye was about to say something, but Su Man's intense gaze swept over. Bai Ye raised his hand, smiled, and made a gesture to zip his lips before continuing to sip his tea. Everyone felt puzzled, and Ye Wei's eyes rolled and switched between Bai Ye's and Su Man's faces. The others all failed to notice the palmprint on Bai Ye's face, even Little Cutie. A moment of silence fell over the hall. Su Man snorted coldly, his eyebrows sharp like knives. His fierce aura was truly intimidating. Bai Ye raised his lips in a smile. Everyone thought that Su Man's next move was to kill him. However, after sweeping his cold and stern gaze over Bai Ye, Su Man turned and left with a flick of his sleeve. Everyone stared at his departing figure and then eyed each other at a loss. What happened? Little Cutie hopped into Bai Ye's arms, his small palm touching the palmprint on Bai Ye's face. His pitch-black eyes blinked, "Bai Ye, what happened to your face?" "I was trying to swat mosquitoes. Riyadh has too many mosquitoes during the summer." Bai Ye smiled calmly, set down his teacup, and ruffled Little Cutie's head. Little Cutie felt incredibly frustrated. Why did everyone like patting his head? Ye Wei squinted and snorted. Little Cutie then compared his own fingers to the palmprint on Bai Ye's face, seeking confirmation with a practical tone, "Bai Ye, your fingers don't seem that slender." Everyone nodded in agreement, their eyes fixed on Bai Ye's face. They put on an expression of a truth-seeker, as if saying, "Bai Ye, reveal the truth." As Cheng Anya knew that the antidote for the virus was close to being developed, she also felt a sense of relief. Out of curiosity, she also turned her attention to the beautiful palm print on Bai Ye's face. It seemed to be the result of a quite forceful and precise slap. It was evident that the owner of that hand had beautiful and slender fingers. "Don't pretend, was it Su Man who did this?" Ye Wei smiled with a hint of danger. Her expression seemed to show clenched teeth and bitterness, giving off a vibe of intense conflict. "Why did he hit you?" "Bai Ye, what did you do?" "You didn't harass him, did you?" Almost everyone voiced their doubts unanimously. Bai Ye calmly set down his teacup, saying, "I'm quite tired. I'm going to sleep." Everyone watched Bai Ye's graceful back as he left. Thinking about Su Man's intimidating, icy, and glaring beauty, a hint of a scandalous affair seemed to linger in the air. Ye Wei felt both frustrated and indignant, clenching her fists. "Bai Ye, don't bend it over like this... Ahhh!" Chapter 379 She Was Pregnant Beauty Ye Wei bared her fangs and brandished her claws. She really wanted to rush up and tear Bai Ye into pieces. Her beautiful facial features were all twisted. Her appearance looked very terrifying, like a ghost that was going to make his kill. Little Cutie seemed to have seen the terrifying scene of beauty Ye Wei's long hair fluttering in the air. "Weiwei, calm down, calm down. Don't go crazy." Miss Cheng smiled faintly, but there was a teasing look in her eyes. Everyone could see that Weiwei had gone berserk. Eleven was speechless. In terms of geniuses, Weiwei was the strongest. Fortunately, Bai Ye hadn't turned his head when he heard those words. He was really calm and no ordinary people could compare with him. Little Cutie raised his hand weakly and asked, "Aunt, I have a question. What does 'bend it over' mean?" Miss Cheng's smile twisted and stiffened for a moment. Eleven looked down at her own nose and remained motionless like a log. Ye Wei turned her head and patted Ningning in the head gently. She said earnestly, "Good child, you are definitely not going to bend it over. You don't need to know." Little Cutie cutely tilted his head and smiled. His face was pure. Although he didn't know the specific meaning of bending it over, he knew that it was definitely not a nice phrase for children. He could tell from the reactions of the women present. "Didn't Mommy say that there is no end to learning?" "Ningning, baby, you have to know that the education of elders is not 100 correct. Otherwise, there won't be so many murderers in the world." Ye Wei said in all seriousness. Ah, she was no longer calm. Eleven shook her head in confusion. "Does Mo Jue really have no effect on you? So much so that you actually have the mind to compete with Su Man?" This woman was becoming more and more secretive. "Who does he think he is? How can he compare to Beauty Su? "I was really heartbroken." Ye Wei cried and begged for sympathy, "None of you sympathize with me. That's too much." "Do you need other people's sympathy?" Cheng Anya, on the other hand, really wanted to watch the show, "It's normal for you to go berserk." Indeed! Thinking about it, Ye Wei had been chasing Su Man for so long but received no active response at all. However, it had only been a few days since Bai Ye and Su Man got together before they seemed to have developed a scandalous affair, which was still floating in front of her eyes. Naturally, she would feel heartbroken. Although Beauty Su's response to Bai Ye was not very nice, at least there was a response. And it was so intense. If it was a passerby, would Su Man, noted for being super-calm, be angered by him? Absolutely impossible. "Third sister-in-law, Eleven, did Beauty Su blush just now?" Ye Wei asked with a tangled expression, and her smile became even more twisted. "Probably, yes." Miss Cheng was more tactful and Eleven directly nodded. The two of them looked at Ye Wei in unison. Ye Wei blinked, but she didn't go berserk as the two ladies had expected. Instead, she rubbed her chin and asked, "Why?" "What why?" Ye Wei rolled her eyes. "Bai Ye likes women, right? Su Man likes men, right? Then if the two of them were left alone, the one who was in danger should be Bai Ye. So, if there's a bit of an affair, Bai Ye should be the one to get angry while Beauty Su remained calm. How come Bai Ye was calm, whereas Beauty Su was angry?"  "You had a point." Miss Cheng thought about it and was enlightened. She didn't find it fishy until Ye Wei pointed it out. "Did Bai Ye tease Beauty Su? Otherwise, how would he be slapped?" "No." Ye Wei and Eleven denied in unison. Bai Ye could not do this, and he did not like men. Although Beauty Su's stunning appearance could entice all living beings, so much so that many men would even pounce on him. However, Bai Ye was not such a superficial person. They had known each other for more than ten years, and they had seen all kinds of scenes. They understood Bai Ye's personality pretty well. It was absolutely impossible for Bai Ye to do this kind of things. He didn't even know how to tease women, let alone men. "So, why did it happen?" Cheng Anya thought about it and agreed. Although Bai Ye looked very gentle and elegant, he was actually very indifferent to others, making people feel he was quite estranged from them, like a floating cloud. He shouldn't have done this kind of things. If it were Ye Chen instead, he would definitely be capable of such flirtatious behavior, but Bai Ye probably wouldn't. "Then why did Bai Ye get slapped?" Cheng Anya asked again. The three ladies looked at each other with doubt in their eyes. "He probably got slapped for taking advantage of Beauty Su," Eleven said, "But Bai Ye isn't that kind of person, so I dismiss that assumption." "In that case, there is no plausible explanation." Miss Cheng also tilted her head, very puzzled. "Could it be that Bai Ye directly rape Beauty Su on the spot?" Ye Wei's words were startling, leaving everyone shocked. Bai Ye didn't know how to tease women, so how could he be so bold? It must be a glitch in the system." "If Su Man was raped, it would definitely end up with Su Man raping Bai Ye and then killing him. Do you really think he would have settled the issue for just a slap?" Eleven said coldly, deeply dissecting the distorted character of Beauty Su. "Moreover, Ah Chen was in the lab." The three ladies fell silent again. Little Cutie raised his hand weakly, "Shouldn't you consider my presence here?" "Why are you still here? You should leave immediately if you hear us discussing such inappropriate matters." Miss Cheng stared at him with a self-righteous look, as if it were his fault for not leaving. "Exactly." "I agree." Little Cutie was speechless.... Women, indeed, were quite formidable creatures. After all, his Nuonuo was the best. "Ah, I'm not calm anymore. Why is my love rival a man..." Ye Wei completely lost her cool and headed towards the courtyard. Her figure appeared as if she were gliding, giving off an eerie vibe. Dinner time arrived. Everyone gathered, Miss Cheng, Ye Wei, Eleven, and Little Cutie. Four pairs of eyes drifted between Bai Ye and Su Man, their expressions tinged with a hint of confusion. Miss Cheng was an experienced tanbi fan and, knowing there was hope for the antidote, she felt exceedingly relieved. Naturally, she had the leisure to make fun of others. In her expert eyes, Bai Ye and Su Man were undoubtedly a well-matched pair. Su Man appeared cold and proud in white, and Bai Ye was elegant and graceful like a jade tree. They were both rare beauties. Standing together, they were pleasing to the eye, like a celestial couple. It was the most adorable combination, an ideal "dominant-submissive" pairing hat she found utterly endearing. The palm print on Bai Ye's face had disappeared by now, and he was calmly enjoying his meal. His serene composure was a skill not many possessed. Ye Wei pulled her chair closer to Su Man, smiling mischievously. "Beauty Su, why did you slap our dear Brother Bai Ye?" Brother Bai Ye? Everyone was taken aback. Su Man didn't even lift his eyelids. "No comment." "No comment? Don't be so stingy," Ye Wei tugged at Su Man's sleeve, acting coquettishly. "Did Brother Bai Ye bully you? I'll beat him up for you. I know you can't beat him. But that's okay. I can beat him." "No need for the trouble." Su Man huffed, admitting he might not be as skilled as those from the special forces, but there were plenty of ways to bring down a person without relying on physical strength. "Not troublesome at all. In fact, I've been feeling unhappy with him for a long time and have been wanting to give him a good beating. There is really no trouble at all." Ye Wei continued with a smile. Little Cutie sighed inwardly for the Nth time, reflecting on his luck in having such a shameless aunt. Ordinary people really did not have this kind of ability to adapt to the situation so effortlessly.   "Up to you." Whatever Ye Wei said, Su Man brushed off with the three words. Even Ye Wei found him to be extremely tight-mouthed. It seemed Bai Ye wouldn't reveal any secrets either. "You guys aren't considerate. You have had a lively scene, but you're not entertaining the public. Sharing joy is better than enjoying it alone." Ye Wei protested discontentedly. Eleventh agreed. Miss Cheng continued eating, Little Cutie stayed out of the fray, not wanting to get implicated. "Brother Bai Ye, you're straight, right?" Ye Wei blinked and asked innocently. "I remember last year, Miss World was fawning over you. A Russian beauty, wasn't she? I even saw you two hugging and kissing. So, you must be straight, right?" Bai Ye fell silent for a moment and then raised an eyebrow. "You guys really are sneaky. You even saw that?" "I just felt that figure looked like you. It turned out true!" Ye Wei clapped her hands and laughed. "Since you're straight, I'm relieved. Just don't covet Beauty Su." Bai Ye smiled and remained silent, while Beauty Su, in contrast with his irritable mood at noon, acted like nothing had happened. He calmly advised Miss Cheng, "Get some rest early. We need to collect your blood samples tomorrow. Don't eat anything before entering the lab." With that, he got up and left. Everyone's attention shifted to his plate, which had barely been touched. Cheng Anya responded and asked Bai Ye, "Is the final ingredient my blood?" Bai Ye nodded, "That's correct." Cheng Anya felt reassured. Whether it would work or not would depend on tomorrow. She had no doubts about Bai Ye's words. His tone was relaxed and confident. She could put half of her worries to rest. "Is it your blood that's needed, Third Sister-in-law? I thought only Louis' blood would do." Ye Wei pondered for a moment. "Third Brother, get well soon. I miss you." "There should be an eighty percent chance of success." "By the way, Bai Ye, why hasn't the virus in Third Sister-in-law's body attacked her yet? She looks almost normal. Why is Third Brother's condition so severe?" Ye Wei asked curiously. "The first strain of this virus is inherently more stable than the second strain. It's not strange. Besides, there are still several days left until the one-month deadline. I've administered a reliever to her, which should keep the virus in check for another ten days or so. So, it's under control, and there's no problem." Bai Ye replied with a gentle smile. "I see." Cheng Anya nodded. The fact that it hadn't attacked was a good sign. Eleven looked at Bai Ye's plate, which was empty. She raised her eyebrows. "If I recall correctly, you two haven't left the lab for two days. Why did you eat so much, while Su Man ate so little? Upset stomach, loss of appetite? Is he made of iron?" Ye Wei nudged Bai Ye's arm. "What did you do to him? It's a rare sight for Su Man to use physical violence." Several pairs of eyes fixed on Bai Ye's face. Bai Ye smiled faintly. "No comment." "Eleven, it's been a while since we've had a good exercise." Ye Wei flexed her wrist, giving a threatening smile. Eleven acknowledged the message. They could have some physical activity later in the evening, using force if necessary. She would like to see if Bai Ye would spill the beans then. Bai Ye raised his hand, indicating he had a "Get Out of Jail Free" card. "I have to administer the antidote to Third Young Master Ye every day." Everyone was speechless.... "In that case, we can just break your legs. You can still administer the antidote while sitting in a wheelchair. What we need is your brain, not your legs." "Auntie, you are ruthless!" Little Cutie raised his thumb. Bai Ye pretended not to hear, and the maids brought them abalone soup. Each person received a portion. Diana said, "This was a gift from Her Highness to the Master. It's delicious. The Master wanted me to serve it for everyone to have a try." Leaning on her hand, Ye Wei smiled and said, "Diana, your words are getting sweeter and sweeter. Su Man definitely didn't ask you to do this. You must be the one who decided on this." "Miss Weiwei, you are truly wise," Diana replied with a smile. Only a pair of beautiful dark eyes were visible under her black veil, making her appear shy and timid, but exceptionally pretty. Even though they couldn't see her full face, those eyes alone indicated that Diana was undoubtedly a beauty. Ye Wei chuckled. "Su Man prefers mild-flavored food and doesn't like seafood. Those abalones and similar things would just fatten up the mice if they were placed in the mansion. Besides, it was a gift from Her Highness, so it must be of good quality. "This flavor is a bit strange." Miss Cheng fanned her nose and frowned, finding the scent uncomfortable. "It's fine. It smells wonderful," Little Cutie chimed in. Diana served everyone a bowl of the soup, and when she put a bowl in front of Cheng Anya, the latter suddenly felt nauseous. However, since there were so many other people present, she couldn't make a scene. She could only bear with it, but the smell kept digging into her senses. She couldn't take it anymore and rushed out of the dining hall, retching uncontrollably... Diana and the others were stunned. Little Cutie and Ye Wei quickly put down their bows and followed her out. Cheng Anya leaned against a pillar, vomiting repeatedly. The others exchanged puzzled glances. "Mommy, are you okay?" "Third Sister-in-law, what's wrong?"... Cheng Anya couldn't stop retching for a while. After she finally managed to calm down, she felt a bit lightheaded. Bai Ye furrowed his brow. After Cheng Anya had tidied up, he offered to examine her pulse. Cheng Anya smiled and said, "I'm fine, I'm fine. Maybe I'm just not used to the smell." "Please put out your hand." Bai Ye smiled gently. Cheng Anya could only extend her hand, and Bai Ye placed a thin sheet of paper on her wrist before taking her pulse. After a moment, he raised an eyebrow, his expression oddly peculiar as he looked at Cheng Anya. Little Cutie grew anxious. "Bai Ye, what's wrong with my Mommy? Has the virus attacked?" "It's not the virus." Bai Ye mumbled to himself, "She's pregnant." Chapter 380 To Keep or Not to Keep the Child? Pregnant? Cheng Anya's eyes widened in disbelief, her mind went blank, as if struck by lightning, which left her at a loss. It felt like she had just heard that aliens had taken over the Earth—a fantastical idea. Bai Ye was also somewhat perplexed, as if not quite believing it. He checked Cheng Anya's pulse multiple times before coming to the conclusion. He looked at Cheng Anya with an odd expression as if pondering something. "Bai Ye, you're not mistaken, are you? Third Sister-in-law is pregnant? They jumped off the plane twice during their escape. If she was pregnant, the child would have been lost long ago. How could it still be alive?" Ye Wei also found it unbelievable. They had experienced various exciting and violent movements along the trip. Was it because this child had an extraordinary fate, or... Eleven refrained from commenting, and Little Cutie rubbed his chin, seriously thinking about what was going on? "It's indeed the pulse of pregnancy. She's pregnant," Bai Ye said with unwavering certainty, his gaze oddly focused on Cheng Anya. Cheng Anya was still in shock, unable to come to her senses for a while. She sat there dazed, as if the matter of her pregnancy had nothing to do with her. The group exchanged glances, not knowing what to say for a moment. Little Cutie waved his hand in front of Cheng Anya. Only then did she come back to her senses, her face a little pale. "This child..." Seeing her strange expression, both Ye Wei and Eleven couldn't help wondering if this child was Loui. If it really was Louis', then this situation would be incredibly... Complicated. Louis had coveted her, and he had captured her and kept her under his control for so many days. Besides, Louis could lay his hand on her recklessly. If he had any malicious intentions towards her, it wouldn't be surprising to anyone. It seemed that she hadn't been pregnant for very long. This deduction was reasonable and logical. Seeing Cheng Anya's expression also becoming a bit odd, both Ye Wei and Eleven couldn't help but let their minds wander. However, Little Cutie quietly observed his Mommy. "Less than two weeks, around ten days or so," Bai Ye said, his expression growing even stranger. "What?" Ye Wei exclaimed, her eyes also taking on an odd look. Her lips twitched as she continued, "Third Brother isn't...that lustful, is he?" Ye Wei was quick to react. She immediately thought about the time Third Young Master Ye had been infected with the virus and when their escaped. She was pregnant for just ten days or so. The child definitely couldn't be Louis'. It must be Third Young Master Ye's. In addition, Third Young Master Ye had been wearing gloves all along, avoiding any physical contact with her. Everyone unanimously believed that during their parachute jump in the desert, they had collided with each other, and Third Young Master Ye subsequently contracted the virus. But the truth seemed to be so shocking. Ye Wei's expression easily led one to think of something. Cheng Anya's face turned slightly red, and she couldn't help but feel embarrassed. Weiwei, aren't you speaking too bluntly? Eleven also found the situation quite shocking, and she had a sinister sense of humor for the first time. "So, a man's true nature can't be changed, it seems to be true." Ye Wei smoothly picked up the thread, speaking clichéd words, "Under the peony flowers, one can die a romantic death, even as a ghost." Third Brother... you are really bold and lustful to the bone marrow. You idiot..." She finally understood what it meant for a man to risk his life for a beauty. "It's not like what you think." Cheng Anya hurriedly waved her hand, but she also felt that it was exactly the case. The moment she spoke, everyone's eyes fell on her, looking really a bit ambiguous as if they were saying, "Don't explain it. We all know what happened." As a result, Miss Cheng calmed down. Alright, since they all thought this way, then let it be. In any case, the impression that Third Young Master Ye gave people was also valiant. She simply shut her mouth, so as to avoid adding fuel to their wild imagination. How could she be pregnant? Cheng Anya couldn't tell what kind of mood she was in. There was a bit of joy, a bit of hesitation, and even a bit of fear. Being pregnant at this time wasn't a good thing. That time in the castle, she had a virus on her body. Third Young Master Ye didn't care about the situation at all. Under those kinds of conditions, he couldn't take any contraceptive measures. Because they had to flee, they didn't think too much about it for a moment, which finally caused them to end up in such a deathly situation. It was really deadly. Cheng Anya was deeply conflicted. How could her likelihood of getting pregnant be so high? They slept twice, and she got pregnant after happy time. If she kept this up, would she set a Guinness World Record for getting pregnant? Cheng Anya's mind was in a mess. Damn it! She realized her mind had wandered to an extraordinary extent, venturing into a level far beyond the reach of ordinary people. She was truly formidable. In her mind, she envisioned herself surrounded by a dozen children, all calling her "Mommy." A sudden jolt snapped Cheng Anya back to reality. She swallowed her saliva, feeling a chill down her spine. Ye Wei, Eleven, and Bai Ye were thoroughly amused by the dramatic expressions on her face. They observed her one-woman pantomime with leisure, feeling extremely amused. Little Cutie weakly inquired, "Mommy, what are you thinking about?" Cheng Anya shook her head, swiftly resuming her customary smile, not even needing to blink her eyes. "Nothing important." They were unaware of the inside story and naturally didn't know what she was thinking. She herself was caught off guard by the shocking news, her mind racing like unbridled horses. If she were to tell anyone what she had thought of, she would probably be the laughingstock for days on end. Perhaps she was the only extraordinary pregnant woman in the world who thought of such nasty things upon learning of her pregnancy. However, to be true to the fact, her likelihood of getting pregnant wasn't a hundred percent. That day, Third Young Master Ye had worked hard on her for almost a day and night, and they didn't know how many times they did it... Cheng Anya felt a sense of equilibrium in her mind. "Bai Ye, could there be any risk to this child?" Cheng Anya pushed aside the chaotic thoughts in her mind. Her greatest concern now was the health of the child. She had conceived under unhealthy circumstances, with multiple doses of antidotes injected into her body. There was a high possibility of harm to the child. If she were to give birth to a child with physical disabilities or mental retardation, it might have been better not to have the child at all. Although it was hard to let go, an unhealthy child was not an option. "Indeed, would the child be infected by the virus?" Ye Wei and Eleven chorused in unison. Bai Ye narrowed his eyes and pondered. "The specific situation isn't clear yet. After all, the child is still too young. We'll have to wait until the child is a bit older to be able to conduct a thorough examination on it. But the virus is definitely going to be a factor."  It was just a case severity. Cheng Anya was now pregnant, and it seemed that the detoxification process was about to get more complicated. He needed to consult Su Man about this. Cheng Anya clenched her fists anxiously, her heart pounding wildly. This pregnancy felt different from when she was pregnant with Ningning. The last time had been characterized by pure joy, but this time it was mingled with fear. She was afraid she wouldn't be able to carry this child to term. Seeing her worry, Ye Wei spoke gently, "Third Sister-in-law, don't worry too much. The virus will be cleared tomorrow. Besides, the child is still little. Once your virus is gone, the child's virus might be gone too. And even if the child isn't healthy, it doesn't matter if you abort it. You and Third Brother are still young. You'll have plenty of chances to have children in the future." Little Cutie's delicate face showed reluctance. "I want Mommy to give birth to a little brother or sister for me." "We think the same, but the has to be healthy to be born," Ye Wei replied, her heart growing heavy. This situation was truly unpredictable. Judging by common sense, even without an examination, it was impossible to keep this child. Cheng Anya also thought of this possibility. Her complexion paled, her dark eyes devoid of their usual luster, with a hint of pain passing through them. Did she really have to consider abortion? She didn't want to think too pessimistically. She hoped to keep the child. It was the fruit of their love. She couldn't bear to abort it. "Anya, don't worry too much for now. Let's clear the virus from your body first. There might still be hope for the child," Bai Ye reassured her. His smile was always distant yet warm, providing a comforting presence. In particular, his white coat and identity as a doctor made people feel at ease. Cheng Anya nodded and smiled weakly. "I understand." Ye Wei tilted her head, pondering for a moment before asking, "Bai Ye, Third Sister-in-law has been in good health all along, without any other symptoms. Is it possible that the virus has been transferred to the child?" Cheng Anya had also been considering this possibility. Her body had remained healthy. Could it be that the virus had truly been transferred to the child? If that was the case, this child definitely couldn't be kept. "That's possible." Bai Ye's brow furrowed. The analysis of Cheng Anya's blood showed the presence of the virus. It was unlikely that all of it had been transferred to the child. However, as long as the child was infected by the virus, it must be aborted. "I'll go talk to Su Man about it." Bai Ye stated, leaving the hall and heading towards Su Man's room. His brows weighed heavy with concern. Cheng Anya had an ominous premonition that this young life that hadn't been with her for long might not be destined to stay. In the end, it might have been just a fleeting joy. Her heart ached as if pricked by needles. "Don't worry, Mommy. Wait until Bai Ye talks to Su Man. We'll know the result once you receive a thorough examination." Little Cutie smiled. He didn't like seeing his Mommy looking troubled. "Yeah, Third Sister-in-law, don't worry too much. Maybe we're worrying for nothing," Ye Wei chimed in with a smile. Cheng Anya chuckled. "Don't worry about me, I'm fine. I was just wondering whether it's a boy or a girl." Little Cutie quickly raised his hand. "I want a little sister." A little sister was the cutest. He could be the protector of his little sister. He would definitely be a good big brother. "Why not a little brother?" "A little brother is fine too, but I prefer a little sister." Little Cutie laughed, a hint of excitement in his voice. "It would be great if my little sister is okay. Then, she can come out soon." "Ningning sweetheart, I bet with you it's going to be a little brother." "I bet it's going to be a little sister." "Well, you're going to lose. According to the Ye Family's tradition, more boys have been born than girls." Ye Wei stroked her chin and said seriously. Cheng Anya nodded. "It...seems to be the case." "I just want a sister." Chapter 381 Beauty in the Moonlight Cheng Anya returned to her room alone, sitting nervously. Whether it was just a psychological effect or not, she had a strong feeling that the child in her belly was growing vigorously, always giving her a sense of heart-to-heart connection. There had been many people earlier so that she didn't feel anything particularly extraordinary, except for a sense of astonishment. Now, standing alone on the balcony and gazing at the moon in the sky, she felt her emotions surge. It was as if waves of heat were rising in her heart, ready to engulf her. She felt a profound sense of motherhood, and she was even more moved than when she found out she was pregnant with Ningning all those years ago. Perhaps, this child was the result of her love with Ye Chen, a significance greater than when she was pregnant with Ningning. Ningning had been her pillar in a foreign land, while this child was the fruit of her love with Ah Chen. And yet, she didn't even know if this child would have the chance to be born, or if it would be healthy. This uncertainty would naturally lead any mother to focus more attention and care on the child. This was beyond doubt. Whether the child would be healthy or whether it could survive or not was the most significant concern at the moment. All mothers in the world share a similar sentiment—to love and cherish their children, and to hope for their survival and well-being. Cheng Anya was no exception. Tonight, the moon in Riyadh was exceptionally round, casting a gentle and clear moonlight that embraced the brightly lit city. It felt as if the city was enveloped in a mother's tender embrace. Cheng Anya couldn't help but pray, hoping that the heavens would grant her child a chance to survive. Cheng Anya wasn't particularly superstitious, but she couldn't help but wonder if prayer could make a difference. If it did, she wouldn't mind offering incense and praying sincerely to Buddha every day. "Mommy." Ningning appeared quietly on the balcony, his smile warm and soft. His face had lost a lot of weight, making his previous chubby appearance less apparent. He now had the appearance of a little adult. As a mother, Cheng Anya felt an even greater sense of tenderness towards him, wishing he could remain forever in his adorable and childlike state. "Why are you still up so late?" Cheng Anya intentionally moved a bit away, fearing she might impulsively pull him into her embrace. Ningning pouted in protest. Cheng Anya cast a glance at him. "No protests allowed." "Mommy, don't be so cautious." "Your mommy is a natural germ container. Keep your distance from me." Miss Cheng retorted playfully, "What's the matter? Can't sleep?" "Yeah. Mommy, will I really have a little sister?" Little Cutie's eyes sparkled, and his eyes seemed to radiate with the word "sister" in pink hue. His desire for a sister was evident. Cheng Anya hesitated on how to respond. To be honest, she didn't want to disappoint Ningning, but she also didn't want to lie. After three seconds of contemplation, she chose to tell the truth, "It's not certain for now. Don't get your hopes up too high. With Daddy and Mommy around, not only a sister but a brother might also come." Little Cutie chuckled, "Mommy, can you not be so funny when you talk? Besides, I don't want a brother, I want a sister." This reminded him of a saying: Love was around the corner, and so was bread. It was embarrassing. "Alright, then it's a sister." Cheng Anya smiled and replied. Actually, she was even more hopeful for the child to be safe and sound. When Third Young Master Ye woke up, he would surely be astonished. Cheng Anya pondered that he might even say a few words self-compliment, such as "My hard work on you day and night had not been in vain." Cheng Anya found herself in a gorgeous predicament. "Mommy, I think you're biased towards having a son." "Nonsense." She actually preferred having a daughter, a pretty one whom she could doll up and dress her in beautiful clothes. This would be quite an accomplishment for her as a mother. "I like having a daughter too." "Then why did you keep talking about having a son?" Little Cutie scolded Cheng Anya and pointed out the most direct evidence. He had never heard her mention a daughter from the start, but now she claimed to like daughters. She was a liar. "Didn't your aunt already explain it? The Ye Family used to have more male descendants than female ones." Cheng Anya defended herself with confidence, blaming Little Cutie for her wanting a son. After all, her son was even more adorable than girls, and he was more attentive and filial even than a daughter to her. "In that case, just keep giving birth, maybe if you have ten or eight children, one of them will be a daughter." Little Cutie solemnly expressed his opinion, making Cheng Anya's face turn dark. He even nodded earnestly as if he had come up with a brilliant idea. "Am I a sow? Are you tired of living?" If she could move at will, she would've slapped him already. Little Cutie laughed so hard that his eyes squinted, feeling quire carefree. Cheng Anya also felt warmth in her heart. Little Cutie's lightheartedness dispelled much of her worry for the baby. "Haven't you considered the possibility that Mommy might not be able to keep this child?" "With Bai Ye and Su Man, there's definitely no problem." Little Cutie smiled, "I believe in them. Even if you gave birth to an Ultraman-like sister, they could turn her into Snow White." Cheng Anya was speechless.... What a robust theory, and what a vivid analogy. "Son, this is blind trust." Miss Cheng was speechless. Little Cutie said, "I still hope you guys can stay safe, so I can settle the score with Louis." At the mention of Louis, Little Cutie's voice grew slightly more intense, tinged with a hint of bloodlust. His entire figure seemed to be enveloped in an icy aura. Such dominance and killing intent were undoubtedly evident, and he only displayed them in front of Cheng Anya. "Louis..." Cheng Anya looked up at the moon in the sky. "Didn't he disappear?" "I'm doing my best to find him. Once my abilities advance further, I won't need to fear Mo Ye and Mo Jue." Little Cutie said in a serious tone. Currently, Louis was able to remain untraceable, and the Mafia could hide their presence thanks to Mo Ye and Mo Jue's exceptional concealment abilities. Since he was stronger in the field of technology, he had been pushing his limits these days to break through. He wouldn't let them off the hook easily. "Well, take care of yourself." Cheng Anya said casually. She knew that someone would have to pay the price for Xu Nuo's death. Ningning had already held Louis accountable for everything and wouldn't stop until he got revenge for Xu Nuo. "You can leave Riyadh now." Cheng Anya suggested, "We're fine here, and if necessary, we can ask Black Hawk and the others to come over." "That won't do. I can feel at ease only if you are both safe." Little Cutie smiled. "In my heart, Daddy and Mommy rank first. How could I disregard you for the sake of revenge?" That won't do." "Fine, don't just try to please your Mommy. When you have a wife, you might forget about your mother. I'll focus on training your sister in the future." Cheng Anya half-jokingly said. Unexpectedly, Little Cutie didn't deny it. Instead, he said, "Women also forget their mothers for their husbands. Mommy, if you're like this, how can you teach my sister? You will set a bad example for my sister." Cheng Anya was left speechless by Little Cutie's words, unable to retort. After a while, she managed to say, "So, being parents is the greatest tragedy in this world." Little Cutie was speechless.... Uh... The situation was a little serious. "Mommy, in this world, I love you the most." Little Cutie said earnestly. Cheng Anya felt a pang in her heart. Yes, she knew her son loved her the most, because the one he loved most of all was no longer here. Cheng Anya didn't feel like her son had been taken away by someone else; on the contrary, she felt heartache for him. "I know." Cheng Anya smiled. "Sweetheart, you're being very sweet-tongued tonight." "Mommy's pregnant, so I'm happy." Little Cutie laughed, and Cheng Anya shook her head. "Let's hope so. I'm looking forward to your Daddy's reaction when he wakes up tomorrow." "Daddy will definitely say, 'Damn it, I haven't had enough coupledom with you yet, and now there's another third wheel.'" Little Cutie imitated Third Young Master Ye's swearing tone perfectly. Cheng Anya burst into laughter on the balcony. "Sweetie, you are such a great imitator." Su Man's mansion was somewhat similar to an ancient aristocratic estate, featuring both modern and classical courtyard designs. Su Man's secluded residence resembled a small, courtyard-style garden. The exterior of the house was designed in an old-fashioned manner, appearing as a bungalow, yet exuding an air of luxury. The walls were also made of white jade, the roof adorned with glazed tiles, and many white jade lotus lanterns hung beneath the eaves, giving off an elegant feel. The courtyard was filled with various exotic flowers and plants, each species being unique. At first glance, they seemed ordinary, but upon closer inspection, Bai Ye realized he couldn't name even a single one, such as a purple-blue flower. He could only sense a pleasant fragrance filling the air, refreshing and invigorating. "What kind of flower is this?" Bai Ye crouched down curiously, examining it closely. It was somewhat like a rose but was actually not. He had never seen a purple-blue rose before. Curious, he reached out his hand and was about to touch it but heard Su Man's icy voice carried by the night wind, "If you don't want to die, you'd better not touch it." His voice was as cold as the cold spring in winter, capable of chilling people even on a scorching summer day. Bai Ye quickly withdrew his hand. "Damn it. Was this a poisonous flower? Are there people who actually plant poisonous flowers in their own yard?" How peculiar. "What do you need from me?" Su Man asked coldly, standing in the moonlight. His figure appeared even more slender and erect, his demeanor fierce and noble, like a celestial being. Even a man would be momentarily stunned by his appearance. Standing in the moonlit, he looked like a peerlessly elegant beauty.  Bai Ye secretly wondered if Su Man was targeting this chilly attitude at him. He knew himself well. The two of them had been getting along better for the past few days, and he didn't expect it to suddenly turn sour again. It was... It was way too unexpected. Bai Ye smiled gracefully. "I came to discuss something with you. Cheng Anya is pregnant." Chapter 382 The Schemer and His Prey Su Man was taken aback, seemingly surprised by Cheng Anya's pregnancy. His eyebrows furrowed with a cold expression. After the initial astonishment, he shifted his icy gaze to Bai Ye. He mocked, "Aren't you a self-proclaimed genius doctor? You couldn't even detect it a few days ago? You're just riding on your reputation." Bai Ye smiled gently, making people feel as refreshing as bathing in a spring breeze. His calm and tranquil expression seemed to radiate warmth, and he didn't mind Su Man's sarcasm at all. "Why are you pointing fingers at me? You didn't notice it either." The last time they examined Cheng Anya was eight days ago, when she had only been about two days pregnant. Her symptoms weren't obvious at all, and their attention had been focused entirely on the virus. How could they have noticed her pregnancy? Even a thorough examination had its limits. Su Man's lab focused on research in viruses, and the blood analysis didn't provide detailed pregnancy indicators. It wasn't a gynecological department; it would have been strange if they had detected it. This matter had nothing to do with his medical skills whatsoever. Su Man snorted coldly. "I'm not a doctor." Beauty Man's one sentence absolved him of all responsibility. He wasn't a traditional doctor by any means, so it was only natural he couldn't diagnose Cheng Anya's pregnancy. On the other hand, Bai Ye was a genius doctor who hadn't detected it, which meant his medical skills were lacking. In his heart, Bai Ye silently criticized Su Man for his lack of morality. Clearly, Su Man had no idea of "morality". He pursed his lips lightly. "Pregnancy and virus aren't very related. Just detoxify her as needed. What's there to discuss?" Bai Ye shook his head, his smile carrying a hint of determination. "It's not that simple. Anya is pregnant, and there's a possibility that the child might be infected with the virus." "Abort it," Su Man stated matter-of-factly, his tone decisive. "This is a cellular virus. The child has been infected with the virus from the womb. Who knows what kind of monster will be born?" Bai Ye squinted his eyes, his expression serious. He had thought about this question as well. A cellular virus was different from other viruses. It could alter the human body's genetic cells, and he was indeed worried that the child might be born a bio-engineered human or a mutant. That would definitely be a tragedy. However, everyone was looking forward to the child's birth now. Suddenly suggesting an abortion seemed too cruel. "But what if the child hasn't been infected with the virus?" Bai Ye asked. Su Man sneered. "Do you even need to ask such a foolish question? What kind of so-called genius doctor are you? Don't you even have this basic medical knowledge? This child has grown in a sea of viruses. You actually want to try your luck and believe it hasn't been infected?" "Beauty Su, medical judgments aren't always a hundred percent accurate. There's a possibility." Bai Ye wasn't afraid of Su Man's mockery. He calmly presented his own viewpoint. Beauty Su's expression darkened. His cold and chilling gaze fixed on Bai Ye. "Call me Beauty Su one more time, and I'll poison you to death." Bai Ye remained silent as Su Man stood in the moonlight, dressed in a white robe, his ink-black hair tied with a silver ribbon, his long hair fluttering. Amidst the moon's glow, he was as beautiful as a dream, resembling an immortal who had walked out of ancient times. To call him a beauty was not an exaggeration. Moreover, Ye Wei, Little Cutie, and the others all called him "beauty." Why couldn't he call him "Beauty Su"? Clearly, there was a double standard in treatment. It seemed like Su Man could sense what Bai Ye was thinking. His expression turned even colder, emitting an aura that was quite intimidating. Bai Ye was very sensible and didn't insist on calling him Beauty Su. Su Man might not match Bai Ye in terms of fighting, but he had plenty of poison on him. He wondered what kind of poison powder would pounce on him with a casual wave of Su Man's hand. "I've come to talk to you about Anya and the child. Ningning really wants this child. Don't you want to spare him from disappointment?" Bai Ye pulled out his trump card. Everyone cared deeply for Ningning. Thanks to his young age, he was adored by many. But more importantly, this child was genuinely endearing, or else Bai Ye wouldn't be going all out to save Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya. As expected, Su Man calmed down. "We need to wait until the child is a bit older to determine anything. If the child is infected with the virus, it's probably not advisable to keep it. This virus is extremely unstable. It might mutate during the entire pregnancy to cause other impacts. Of course, if they're willing to take a gamble, I have no objections." Taking a gamble meant that this virus could fuse with the cellular layer and give birth to a superhuman child, potentially even more terrifying than Ningning. However, the odds were slim. Even adults couldn't fuse cells and viruses, let alone an unborn baby. The chances were minuscule. Bai Ye fell silent, understanding Su Man's point. "If the child is infected, will the antidote work?" Bai Ye asked. "There's an eighty percent chance it won't work. We are not talking about the first or second wave of infections, but a natural virus carrier. The antidote is completely useless." Su Man stated flatly, adding that the child was similar to someone who had ingested toxins since childhood. As a result, it would become immune to the antidote. Bai Ye was surprised. "You have no way to cure it?" Bai Ye raised an eyebrow, stroked his chin, and smiled a little madly. "Who was saying that I was riding on my reputation? It turned out you're no different." "Each has his own specialty. This isn't my area of expertise." Beauty Su Man cast a chilly gaze and said. However, he didn't give a direct answer. "I've learned about the issue. Let's talk about it tomorrow." He stood directly in the moonlight, his entire being seemingly merging with the icy glow. He exuded a chilling aura, and his cold and disdainful gaze made it clear he wanted Bai Ye to leave. Bai Ye stood still, looking at Su Man with a smile on his face. His handsome face remained as calm as the surface of a lake in March, as if he hadn't heard Su Man's words. Su Man sneered, his eyes as cold as snow. "Is there something else?" "Why are you still angry? A real man shouldn't be so petty, right?" Bai Ye said casually. "I didn't do it on purpose. You've already hit me, so you should be over it."    His tone was light, but it carried a hint of intimidating pressure that was just as imposing as Su Man's. He knew why Beauty Su was being so unfriendly to him. Bai Ye was naturally reserved, rarely losing his temper. He either put on an indifferent look or a smiling face, appearing as elegant and handsome as a gentleman to people around him. However, deep down, he was extremely domineering and proud. It was just hidden beneath his aloofness, giving people the illusion that he was quite a typical gentleman. In contrast, Su Man didn't bother to disguise his emotions. He was noble and proud, and he also had a reserved personality, but he didn't integrate it into smiles as Bai Ye did. His reservation was covered in frost. It was cold and threatening. "Enough with the nonsense. Please get lost." Su Man said with a chilly tone, with no pretension of hospitality. Bai Ye smiled, his long robe swaying like jade, his composure even more serene. He raised an eyebrow playfully. "Could it be that you really mind?" A sharp danger flickered in Su Man's pitch-black eyes as he cast a cold gaze at Bai Ye, who responded with a light smile that seemed like a warm breeze. However, Su Man's expression grew colder. Bai Ye continued smiling, saying nothing. Both of them involuntarily recalled the unexpected incident in the lab earlier that day. Almost for eight days, they had been together most of the time, working tirelessly to research the antidote for the virus. With Bai Ye's assistance, Su Man was able to save a lot of effort. His detoxification skills were indeed commendable, but there were areas where he fell short compared with Bai Ye. After all, each had their own area of expertise, and their research directions were different. They complemented each other's strengths, making their collaboration seamless. Initially, Su Man held a strong aversion to Bai Ye. He could sense that Bai Ye was intentionally challenging him. Su Man believed Bai Ye was overestimating his own abilities, given that Su Man had the audacity to be arrogant due to his credentials. He disdained Bai Ye's title of "genius doctor." However, as the days passed, Su Man gradually realized that Bai Ye's reputation was not unfounded. Bai Ye was indeed skilled in the medical field, possessing exceptional talent. Their collaboration grew more harmonious, and they found common topics of interest, fostering a warmer relationship. Heroes often recognized each other's worth, and this was especially true for geniuses like them, who had always stood unmatched in their respective domains. As familiarity grew, conversations flowed freely without taboos. One day, the topic of same-sex relationships came up—a rather awkward topic for two adult men, especially when one of them was homosexual. Su Man clearly didn't want to delve into the topic, and Bai Ye wisely refrained from asking. Unexpectedly, Su Man accidentally knocked over a bottle of reagent, causing Bai Ye to slip when cleaning it up... Such scenes were common in TV dramas—where the male protagonist slipped accidentally, fell onto the female lead, and ended up kissing her lips with remarkable accuracy. From there, a tale of a scandalous affair unfolded. In both television and film, this was a classic and boring scene. Audiences had seen it so often that they were practically desensitized, yet actors continued to play it out with enthusiasm. However, despite being a typical amorous scene, it certainly didn't fit Su Man and Bai Ye. Why? Bai Ye was skilled enough to navigate a floor covered in oil as if it were solid ground. Even if he fell, he could still stand up before his body touched the floor. Yet, in that fleeting moment when he realized that he was going to fall on Su Man, Bai Ye seemed to be in a trance. And that split-second loss of focus changed everything. Su Man found himself unexpectedly pinned by Bai Ye. Actually, being toppled was no big deal—it was an accident. Su Man had no reason to be angry. What mattered most was that the classic scene was missing a crucial element—a kiss after the fall. Without that kiss, the scene couldn't truly be called a classic one. But the situation wasn't an accident at all. Bai Ye deliberately kissed Su Man. Furthermore, there was no pause between his falling on and kissing Su Man. Bai Ye's actions appeared so genuine that one could easily believe it was a mere accident. However, Su Man was a shrewd individual who knew better. Bai Ye's skills and strength were crystal clear to him. He hesitated for four seconds before raising his hand and slapping Bai Ye. At that moment, Su Man was infuriated. He keenly felt Bai Ye's gaze shift midway and sensed that something was amiss. He attempted to push him away but couldn't react in time. For the first time in his life, Su Man had been taken advantage of in such a way. This was far different from the seductive and tempting actions of Ye Wei. At least Weiwei never came close to kissing him in the lips. Trading a kiss for a slap from Beauty—economically speaking, Bai Ye didn't come out too poorly. It was Beauty Su's first time being kissed by someone, his first kiss ever in life. Similarly, it was Bai Ye's first time being slapped by someone. They were even. Who could have expected that Su Man would suddenly become aloof again, treating Bai Ye as if he were a stranger. "Are you tired of living?" Su Man dangerously narrowed his eyes in a cold and imposing demeanor. Upon mentioning the issue and recalling the surprise and lust in Bai Ye's eyes, he found the situation extremely humiliating. If Bai Ye was tired of living, Su Man wouldn't mind fulfilling his wish. They had just discussed the topic of same-sex relationships, and Bai Ye had sarcastically mentioned that same-sex relationships rarely lasted, claiming that most people simply sought novelty, a viewpoint that had irked Su Man considerably. But it was undeniable that what Bai Ye said was truth. Su Man also knew that Bai Ye was different from him. Bai Ye liked women and was a genuine straight man. So, what did that kiss mean? Was Bai Ye lured by the novelty and enticed by his appearance? Su Man considered himself a proud and confident man, and he was unashamed of being a gay. But being treated like a woman by another man was a blow to his pride, causing a wellspring of anger that was easily fanned by his consistent high self-esteem. For the first time in his life, Su Man was losing his composure. Bai Ye raised an eyebrow and smirked, "No, I intend to live a long and prosperous life." Su Man let out a cold snort, flames dancing in his icy gaze. "Get lost, or don't blame me for not showing mercy." With that, he turned and left, leaving Bai Ye with a chilly and indifferent back. Bai Ye stood with hands behind his back, tall and elegant, humble and graceful. The smile at the corner of his lips gradually deepened. Why was he, a talented and handsome genius, met with such disdain from Beauty Su? Bai Ye was thoroughly puzzled. As for why he had kissed Su Man today, even Bai Ye himself wasn't quite sure. It seemed like an impulsive action, something he couldn't control. At that moment when they fell, the cold fragrance he had become familiar with over the past few days enveloped him. The fact that a man smelled of perfume was something deeply embarrassing, but Su Man was constantly surrounded by the fragrance of flowers in his garden. The air was filled with this unique and enticing aroma, as if it were a natural part of him, bewitching and captivating. The distance between them was so close. Perhaps the scent was too tempting, or perhaps Su Man's lips were too tempting. Bai Ye had been obsessed with the idea that kissing his lips would feel nice. It was as if a bolt of lightning had struck his mind. It was so swift that Bai Ye hadn't even fully comprehended his own actions before he felt the warmth of Su Man's lips against his. Calling it an accident wouldn't hold up—he had done it deliberately. Bai Ye glanced at the beautiful flowerbed before him, feeling a bit lost himself. He couldn't figure out why he had acted in such a way. Lost in thought, he left Su Man's courtyard, oblivious to the fact that Su Man's cold and piercing gaze had been following his retreating figure. Hmph! Su Man let out a cold snort. If someone dared to take advantage of him, they must be prepared to exact the same price. A faint smile graced the lips of the exquisitely handsome man. He looked as if seeing his prey walking into his trap. Chapter 383 The Virus Was Killed The next day, in the lab. Cheng Anya watched as Bai Ye injected the antidote into Third Young Master Ye's body. The transparent liquid flowed like a stream of ice water, sending a slight chill through her heart. Even her limbs felt a bit cold, and her palms were sweaty from nervousness. She stared intently at the reaction of Third Young Master Ye on the operating table. This wasn't the first time that Su Man and Bai Ye had developed an antidote. Over the past few days, they had experimented with three different antidotes, all of which had been tested on mice. The first two attempts resulted in the death of the mice, while the third mouse showed no reaction. However, this time, there was a reaction in the mouse's body. After Su Man's analysis, he determined that the toxins in the blood had completely disappeared within an hour. In other words, the antidote was effective, at least in mice. Since Cheng Anya was pregnant, they couldn't predict how the antidote would react in a human body. They had to first test it on Third Young Master Ye, who had very limited time left. The antidote had to be injected. Ye Wei, Eleven, and the others were all present, including Little Cutie. This was a critical day. If the antidote failed, they would have to find another way to save them, wasting even more time. Given Third Young Master Ye's condition, he couldn't hold on for much longer. Both Little Cutie and Cheng Anya understood that this was their last chance. The outcome depended on today. After the antidote was injected into Third Young Master Ye's body, everyone watched the diagrams on the screen with bated breath. The supply of sedative had been temporarily halted, and Third Young Master Ye was currently wearing an oxygen mask. All other reagents had been removed. They were now focused on the observation of the antidote's reaction. Bai Ye checked Third Young Master Ye's pulse, his expression grave. The pulse was very steady. Since the sedative had just been removed, there were no signs of Third Young Master Ye awakening yet, resulting in his steady pulse. However, after half an hour, there was still no significant reaction from him. The virus displayed on the screen hadn't been eradicated either. Cheng Anya couldn't quite understand the decomposition diagram, but she knew that it showed how the virus was engulfing cells. It was an internal view of Third Young Master Ye's body. Bai Ye had explained that the black areas represented regions invaded by the virus. Looking at the diagram, it was evident that the virus had severely infected Third Young Master Ye's liver, stomach, and spleen, and he was in a very critical state. His body was almost saturated with the terrifying virus, which was moving freely and mutating. After the antidote was injected, red bubbles appeared on the screen, relentlessly colliding with the black areas. Cheng Anya and the others had just seen the demonstration on the mice. In about ten minutes, the black areas slowly faded and gradually disappeared. It indicated that the virus was being eliminated and disappearing. However, half an hour had passed, and there was no change in Third Young Master Ye's body. Only the red bubbles continued to collide with the black areas, as if depicting a struggle between justice and evil. Justice was eager to defeat evil but was powerless to do so, like fighting the void with bare hands. Bai Ye's eyes were fixed on the screen, crossing his arms and almost holding his breath. For the first time, he felt such intense heartbeats. Could the antidote be ineffective? A chill ran down his spine. According to his precise calculation, there should have been a reaction after fifteen minutes. Why was there no response at all? The mice began to fuse with the virus after only ten minutes. Something was wrong. Even sweat formed on Bai Ye's forehead. Su Man sat calmly in front of the computer, his cold eyes locked on the screen. He appeared remarkably composed, showing no signs of panic. He seemed to consider the lack of response within half an hour as normal and there was no need to panic. However, Su Man's palms were also sweaty. He knew very well that if the antidote didn't work this time, Third Young Master Ye would undoubtedly die. Even if he and Bai Ye continued to research the antidote tirelessly, it would take at least three to five days to see any results. Cheng Anya could wait, but Third Young Master Ye wouldn't have that luxury. The elegant facial features of Su Man revealed a deep seriousness, and he didn't need to turn around to know the expressions on the faces behind him. Cheng Anya and the others didn't dare to disturb Su Man and Bai Ye, fearing that they might interrupt their train of thought. Ye Wei and Eleven pursed their lips, nervously waiting. Little Cutie kept Cheng Anya company, worried that his Mommy wouldn't be able to withstand the torture. The wait between life and death was excruciating, often leaving people feeling hopeless in such situations. Little Cutie gazed at his Daddy lying on the operating table not far away, pain evident in his eyes. He had only been reunited with his Daddy for less than half a year. He didn't want to lose him. After reading people's palms, fortune tellers often claimed that they had experienced the death of a loved one by the age of ten. Subsequent investigations showed that most people did lose a beloved family member by the age of ten. In various people's cases, it might be a grandfather, a mother, a grandmother, and so on. As for Little Cutie, he had already lost Nuonuo. So, in a way, he had lost a loved one too. That's why he hoped his Daddy must survive. If his Daddy died, his Mommy would probably become a walking corpse, never truly happy again for the rest of her life. Daddy, you must hold on. He had always been confident in Su Man and Bai Ye, but at this crucial moment, he realized how nervous he truly was. Cheng Anya stood alone on the side, gripping the edge of the table, her gaze fixed on the screen. She was afraid to miss any details and prayed fervently that the antidote would take effect soon. "Bai Ye, increase the dosage," Su Man said in a deep voice. Bai Ye's brow furrowed, but he didn't ask any further questions. He administered another dose of the antidote. In reality, this antidote was a type of poison. If Third Young Master Ye's body hadn't been infected with the virus, injecting the antidote alone could kill him within a minute. Therefore, increasing the dosage also carried some risk. A slight miscalculation could result in the antidote becoming deadly. "Bai Ye, what's going on? Why is there no reaction at all?" Ye Wei nervously asked, "Could it be ineffective?" "Wait," Bai Ye uttered a single word, his determination unwavering. Time passed slowly, and this waiting was truly torturous. He had told them that Third Young Master Ye would wake up within an hour. If he didn't wake up, he would die. Yet they had waited nearly an hour, and he still hadn't regained consciousness. It was like hope slipping away between their fingers, drop by drop. Suddenly, a loud clang sounded from the operating table. Third Young Master Ye's wrist moved, as if he wanted to break free from his restraints but was held back. He seemed agitated, pulling and struggling with great force. Everyone was startled. Su Man swiftly analyzed various functional indicators of Third Young Master Ye's body. Third Young Master Ye let out a muffled groan, as if experiencing pain. His head shook incessantly, and his body strained against the restraints. Cheng Anya and Ye Wei tried to approach, but Bai Ye stopped them. Abruptly, Third Young Master Ye let out a furious roar, "Ah..." After nearly ten days of tightly shutting eyes, he suddenly opened them. His jet-black pupils were bloodshot, looking horribly crimson, and he began to struggle violently. He screamed and yelled incessantly, appearing utterly insane. Cheng Anya's eyes reddened to the point of bursting as she exclaimed, "Ah Chen..." She covered her mouth tightly, and her heart ached like being twisted with a knife. She couldn't bear to watch, so she lowered her gaze to the table. However, his frantic screams continued to echo in her ears. Ah Chen... "Daddy.." "Third Brother...What happened to you?" Ye Wei was also panicking. "Su Man, what's happening to my brother?" "The antidote is starting to take effect." Su Man said calmly. "We removed the sedative earlier, so he'll be in excruciating pain. Plus, the antidote is attacking the virus. The two reactions are intensifying each other. This is a normal reaction." "Furthermore, we increased the dosage, so he'll be in even more pain." Bai Ye added. "Will something happen to Daddy?" "Since there's a reaction, he won't die," Su Man said, busy testing all of Third Young Master Ye's internal indicators and instructing Bai Ye to administer several other solutions to him. So cold and yet determined. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing that he wouldn't die. Cheng Anya and the others were laymen and couldn't comprehend everything. They only knew that Third Young Master Ye's suffering seemed to have lessened somewhat. The terrifying screams that sounded like he was having his organs torn out were truly horrifying. Third Young Master Ye's appearance was quite frightening. His facial features were twisted, his voice hoarse. His wrists and ankles were marked with wounds from the restraints, dripping with blood. The wounds were so deep that they seemed to penetrate his bones, as if they were being embedded into his very essence. Cheng Anya's heart kept aching. "Daddy, you'll be alright. Hold on," Little Cutie clenched his fist, cheering Third Young Master Ye on. "He can't hear you," Bai Ye smiled. At the moment, Third Young Master Ye was consumed by pain and a near-death dizziness. This state persisted for nearly ten minutes. The antidote had just begun rapidly merging with the black areas where the virus was present, gradually clearing the virus from Third Young Master Ye's body. Ye Wei and Eleven were familiar with various modern technologies but they had never seen such a vivid process. They could clearly observe the antidote sweeping through Third Young Master Ye's body, gradually dissipating and eventually eliminating the black virus. Simultaneously, Third Young Master Ye's body started to break into a sweat. His shouts slowly subsided, turning into painful groans. Finally, Bai Ye administered the serum, completing the final step of detoxification. Third Young Master Ye was completely exhausted and fell into a deep slumber. Cheng Anya was anxious and tried to approach, but Bai Ye swiftly stopped her. "Anya, we have just detoxified him. Don't get yourself poisoned again. It'll be your turn next." Cheng Anya's steps faltered. "Detoxified... Really? Is he safe now?" "Yeah, we succeeded." "That's fantastic!" Ye Wei and Eleven high-fived, and the lab erupted with cheers. Even Su Man couldn't hide the hint of a smile at the corner of his lips. After witnessing such a terrifying detoxification process, Little Cutie was extremely worried. "Will my Mommy experience the same agony as my Daddy?" "No," Bai Ye smiled. Chapter 384 Child Under the Virus' Impact Cheng Anya's detoxification process was not at all painful, and she felt as if she was receiving a routine injection. After being injected with the antidote, she felt a bit drowsy and then lay down on another operating table. From the internal view, everyone could see that the virus inside Cheng Anya's body had almost completely gathered around her uterus. Everything was as Bai Ye had anticipated. Ye Wei had mentioned that Cheng Anya's condition was very peculiar, not at all like someone infected with a virus. He had asked her before and learned that back when they were on the isolated island of Louis, she never experienced these symptoms. When the virus attacked, she became weak and feeble, and her organs would ache. This condition had started since they were in Prince William's castle, which meant that the child was gradually absorbing the virus. This child was essentially growing up immersed in the virus. Su Man was right. Even without the internal view, he knew that the child must have been infected. "So, this child has been absorbing the virus as nutrients?" Ye Wei looked at the internal view, greatly shocked. Her eyes widened, partly disbelieving what she saw. Little Cutie also seemed somewhat worried. This image was a bit terrifying. "It's most likely the case." Bai Ye said, feeling a bit uneasy. The child was conceived during the time Cheng Anya was infected with the virus. Moreover, this child would be born a carrier of the virus. Leaving aside the effects the virus might have on the child, what if they were unable to touch the child after it was born? Su Man furrowed his brows, forming an expression rarely seen on his face. Ye Wei, Eleven, and Little Cutie all felt that the situation was dire. Third Young Master Ye was sleeping peacefully on the side, unaware of what was happening. Cheng Anya was also asleep, completely unaware of the surroundings. However, their hearts were beating fast, and they were very worried. "Su Man, how is she?" Little Cutie asked. Su Man patted his hand and said calmly, "We don't know yet. Infection is certain. Whether there will be problems or not, we'll have to wait until the child is a bit older to find out. Your Mommy will be fine." The antidote was taking effect, gradually eliminating the virus from Cheng Anya's body. She didn't experience the intense pain that Third Young Master Ye had, just lying quietly as if she were asleep, with a peaceful expression on her face. "Bai Ye, I once heard the old witch mention that the Grey Wolf experimented on poisoned individuals. Could this child be related to that?" Ye Wei suddenly asked, recalling events from many years ago, her brows furrowing even more tightly. "Poisoned individuals?" Su Man raised an eyebrow. Bai Ye nodded to confirm the existence of such a phenomenon. "Grey Wolf once raised babies and treated them as poisoned individuals. The babies would consume highly toxic substances from birth. At that time, there were more than a dozen babies, and over ten of them died, leaving only three survivors." "Later, their food was all laced with deadly poison. As they grew up, two more died, leaving just one survivor. This child was very different from ordinary children. He's a carrier of poisons. Anyone who comes into contact with him would be poisoned. Severe cases would result in death. Even mild cases would require serum injections and months of recuperation. Even the air he exhaled was toxic." "How cruel." Little Cutie furrowed his brows. How could there be such cruel people? His Nuonuo had fallen into Grey Wolf's hands since childhood. Fortunately, Grey Wolf didn't treat her as a poisoned individual. This kind of suffering was beyond what an ordinary person could endure. "Indeed, it's very cruel. Later, the old witch imprisoned the child. That incident caused a falling out with Grey Wolf. It happened many years ago. I would have forgotten about it if Weiwei hadn't brought it up. The success rate for this method is very low. For each child that was successfully cultivated into a poisoned individual, many children died. Also, the food consumed by poisoned individuals must contain toxic substances. If they eat a normal diet for too long, they'll die due to lack of toxins," Bai Ye explained in a solemn tone. They had only heard about this matter, but in the special agent camp, whatever they heard, they had to believe. This was undoubtedly true. "If that's the case, will the child die if the virus disappears?" Eleven voiced her question. This matter was indeed too complex, and she found it deeply profound and difficult to comprehend. "I've heard about this as well, but it's different from the child's situation," Su Man calmly stated. "If the child can grow up, it indicates that the virus has fused with the child's cellular layers. Look at it. Although it hasn't fully formed, it's indeed growing. But virus and poison are different. Innate carriers might have the ability to control the virus. If he dies without the virus, it means he's destined not to be a part of this world." Su Man explained. By this time, the virus within Cheng Anya's body had mostly disappeared and had been expelled through sweat. Bai Ye also injected serum for her. Apart from Bai Ye, the others listened with confusion, but at least the virus was finally removed, which was a good thing. Ye Wei carried Cheng Anya back to her room, and Bai Ye carried Third Young Master Ye back to his. They all asked the maids to help them freshen up, especially Third Young Master Ye, whose wrists and ankles needed medication since he had been through quite a bit. Su Man and Little Cutie walked behind the others. Little Cutie smiled and said, "Su Man, a million thanks for your efforts this time." "It's a small matter," Su Man replied lightly, placing his hand on Little Cutie's shoulder. "We're a family. No need to be polite." Little Cutie smiled, and Su Man guided him to a bench in the central courtyard. It was an overcast day in Riyadh, and the temperature was slightly lower. Despite being outdoors, the central courtyard didn't feel stuffy, and the large fountain even brought a hint of coolness. Su Man asked, "When are you leaving?" They definitely couldn't stay for long. The Dragon Sector, the First Terrorist Organization, and the Mafia were all in a state of chaos and tension. Nobody knew who would have the last laugh. They definitely couldn't linger for too long. Some of them were core members of the terrorist organization, some were core members of the Dragon Sector. They all needed to find ways to deal with the attacks from the Mafia and the allied government forces.  The second half of the year was bound to be tumultuous. "I was just about to ask you the same question. Will my Mommy have any danger? With the child carrying the virus, could it be released again and cause my Mommy to be infected once more?" Little Cutie thought carefully and raised his concern. "No, they both have antibodies in their bodies. The same virus won't affect them anymore," Su Man reassured. "I had thought about this question a while ago. Don't worry. If something happens, it's more likely to affect the child, not your Mommy. The worst-case scenario would be aborting the child." Little Cutie nodded, feeling reassured. "I'm just worried about my Mommy. This time, we must be fully prepared. I won't let Louis succeed again." A trace of darkness crossed Little Cutie's face. He was close to finding Louis's hiding place. "In terms of strength, the First Terrorist Organization is the leader, the Mafia is second, and the Dragon Sector is third. If the second wants to take down the first, it won't be able to do it alone. It will most likely rope in the third," Su Man said with a smile. Despite staying at home, he could observe the world's events at ease and was well aware of the situation. Little Cutie also smiled and nodded. He understood this better than anyone else. "He definitely won't be able to win over the Dragon Sector. There's only one option left: to swallow up the Dragon Sector and sweep through all of North America. Once the Mafia swallowed up other forces in North America, the First Terrorist Organization would have to be cautious. At that point, it could truly become a situation of 'two tigers competing for one mountain,' and it might be too late for the First Terrorist Organization to dealt with the Mafia. Of course, the prerequisite is that the Mafia could swallow up the entire North America." Su Man chuckled, "Indeed." It was Little Cutie's first visit, and he had been busy with the virus the entire time, leaving them with little time for a proper conversation. Now it was almost time for Little Cutie to leave, Su Man felt a bit reluctant. But he was a carefree person after all, and the coming and going of people was a matter of fate. Besides, there would definitely be many opportunities for them to meet in the future. "Riyadh seems really calm. Mo Jue has been gone for so many days. Louis should know that my parents are in Riyadh, yet he didn't show up. It's quite strange," Little Cutie smiled. He had wanted to bait Louis and let him walk into the trap on his own. For that, he had evacuated all the personnel of the Dragon Sector and the First Terrorist Organization from Riyadh, leaving only Ye Wei and Eleven here with him. But unexpectedly, Louis hadn't made a move. It was truly unexpected. "When one has control over the world, beauties are just trivial," Su Man said lightly. Little Cutie thought about it and agreed. Then, Su Man suddenly asked, "Those firearms from last time, have they been developed?" "You mean the high-frequency magnetic wave guns? One prototype has been built." Little Cutie pouted, "The design you provided was really difficult to handle. Many of the products turned out to be failures, with only one success. But it might become much easier to manufacture more in the future." "Good job. I thought it would take another month or two to build one. The reserve forces of your organization are indeed strong." "Of course," Little Cutie proudly stated. "Speaking of which, Bai Ye was the first one to test the gun. Its power is incredible. It managed to hit a fighter jet flying at high speeds. It's truly unbelievable." "It's close to the speed of light." Su Man chuckled. This had been his proudest creation, the result of his three years' hard work. If it were to be sold in the black market, it would fetch an astronomical price. But in the end, Little Cutie tricked him and took it away. Bai Ye was unexpectedly the first one to test the gun. Hmph, he was really lucky. Little Cutie covered his mouth and laughed, his pitch-black eyes filled with slyness, revealing a hint of cunning. "Beauty Su, why do you have such a grudge against Bai Ye? Our Bai Ye is the calmest, most handsome, and the best-tempered in the terrorist organization. He is a gentleman as beautiful as flowers and as precious as jade. Ah, what a fitting and accurate description!" "Are you trying to dump your unsellable goods?" Su Man tilted his head, a smile gracing his refined face. Due to the angle, his already beautiful face now had an added touch of breathtaking beauty. Little Cutie couldn't help but adore his truly enchanting appearance. He couldn't help but reach out and touch Su Man's chest. It was firm. "You little rascal, you've got quite some nerve." Su Man chuckled, allowing him to touch his chest. His face held a faint sense of indulgence. "You and Ye Wei are indeed a family. Your behavior patterns are the same." Ye Wei had touched his chest numerous times, just to confirm whether he was male or female. "Beauty Su, you're really a soul-alluring beauty," Little Cutie playfully said. "Speaking of our Bai Ye, he is a hot item, not unsellable product." Little Cutie blinked his eyes. "This product's quality, appearance, and practicality are beyond reproach. Besides, it is a versatile product." Su Man burst into laughter. This metaphor was truly fitting. Little Cutie was satisfied. It was the first time he had seen Su Man laughing so heartily as to show his teeth. Watching this scene from the distant balcony of the villa, Ye Wei and Bai Ye felt that the atmosphere was quite amorous. Su Man laughed indulgently as Little Cutie clung to him in an almost impure manner. Ye Wei watched with a mixture of sadness and indignation. "Su Man is really immoral. He actually has impure thoughts about our Ningning. This is going too far." He must be a Lolicon, definitely! "You're overthinking it. Are you sure it's not Ningning making inappropriate advances toward him?" Bai Ye laughed and headed downstairs. Ye Wei raised an eyebrow and quickly caught up, placing her arms on Bai Ye's shoulder as she asked, "Bai Ye, do you have feelings for Su Man?" "I like beautiful women." Ye Wei rolled her eyes. "I should suggest that Su Man change his gender." "Changing one's gender doesn't make one a beautiful woman." There was a difference between a beauty and a beautiful woman. "Come on, don't slap yourself in the face." "Are you giving up on Su Man and switching to Mo Jue?" Bai Ye raised an eyebrow with a playful smile, allowing Ye Wei to hold onto his neck. He wasn't unaware that their closeness might be too much. However, neither he, Chu Li, or others had any romantic interest in Ye Wei or Eleven. Otherwise, with their exceptional looks and talents, after spending over a decade together, how could they fail to stir his heart? When they were young, even Jason had once had a crush on Eleven, but that had come to an end as well. Being a family was better than being lovers. Because they had met too early. "Nonsense." Ye Wei snorted, "I still like Beauty Su more." She deliberately avoided mentioning Mo Jue. Bai Ye did remind her, "When Third Young Master Ye and Anya wake up, we'll be leaving Riyadh. There's definitely going to be a tough battle. You should prepare yourself mentally. I know you're not one to let emotions get the better of you, but in many cases, it's still good to be reminded, in case you end up in a catastrophe and are doomed forever." Bai Ye was worried about her. Big Bai was fine because he was always obedient. Mo Jue, on the other hand, was too dangerous. He had a feeling that something terrifying would happen. "Don't you trust me?" Ye Wei pinched his arm. "Do I seem like someone who would betray you guys?" "Stop pretending innocence. I'm just concerned about you." Bai Ye smiled gently. "Mo Jue seems very dangerous. I don't think you're a match for him." "F*ck, I'm no match for him?" "In terms of scheming, men are indeed a bit better than women." Bai Ye smiled. "Look at Anya, she's so clever. But from my observation, when it comes to major matters, Third Young Master Ye's calculations are more accurate." "You're being sexist." "I'm just looking down on you. Anyway, be careful." "I got it. I won't let you down." Ye Wei said with a mischievous smile. They happened to arrive at the central courtyard at that moment. Ye Wei leaned in, her demeanor oozing charm, and she kissed Bai Ye in the cheek before whispering, "A reward for you." Bai Ye was both amused and exasperated. He happened to catch Su Man and Little Cutie looking at them. Su Man's expression remained unchanged, but his gaze turned cold and sharp. In the blink of an eye, the warmth he had shown to Little Cutie disappeared, replaced by a cold snort. Chapter 385 Caught at a Horny Moment in Bed Cheng Anya woke up to find that it was already deep into the night. The faint moonlight danced into the room through the balcony, scattering shards of silver on the floor. Inside the room, a soft white jade lamp was lit, emitting a gentle and non-glaring light, like a thin veil brushing by, creating a warm and soft ambiance. The poison was detoxified, and she knew it. When Bai Ye injected the antidote for her, she had thought that if she couldn't wake up, she would just fall into a deep slumber, ignorant and unaware of death, as if experiencing what people often referred to as euthanasia. She self-mockingly recalled that she had the leisure to wander off into these thoughts at that moment. Nonetheless, during that instant, she did feel relaxed. After all, she knew that Third Young Master Ye would be safe and sound. Even if she died, the only regret would be the child. A double death was not a favorable outcome. She smiled, turned slightly, and saw Third Young Master Ye sleeping by her side. He was nestled in the warmth of the blankets, the coziness permeating deep into his bones. Her lips curved into a light smile. Upon closer inspection, she realized that the room was still the original one, but with a new set of bedding. The silk quilt was warm in winter and cool in summer, radiating the body's temperature. She felt as though every pore on her skin had opened up, which was quite comfortable. Perhaps it was due to the power of the mind, for now that the poison was detoxified, she no longer needed to worry about infecting innocent people or harming her loved ones. In these few days, Cheng Anya appeared relaxed and carried on as usual in her conversations with them. However, her heart was heavy. Ever since Zhang Bo's death, a colossal boulder had been weighing down on her heart, making it hard for her to breathe during the midnight hours. It was a type of affliction that made her want to isolate herself from others, fearing innocent deaths. Now that the boulder had shattered, her heart felt much relaxed. She finally realized how nice it felt to have her burden removed, as if she had been reborn. Beside her, Third Young Master Ye's shallow breathing could be heard. During the detoxification process, his face had contorted in agony, making him look like a madman. However, that image was now far gone. She only saw him sleeping peacefully, completely safe. It had all been worth it. Cheng Anya had often heard people say that surviving a great ordeal would bring about good fortune subsequently. Throughout this journey, they had encountered numerous hardships – jumping from an airplane in the desert, being trapped in the desert for two days, almost getting killed in the castle, almost being blown to pieces on the sea's surface, and being tortured by the virus. Yet they emerged unscathed. Would their future be smooth sailing from now on? She hoped so. Cheng Anya was well aware that Louis had not died, the Mafia's whereabouts were unknown, and there had been significant changes in the Dragon Sector recently. All of this was orchestrated by someone behind the scenes, attempting to stir up bloodshed and chaos once again. She didn't need to inquire about these matters; she knew the ins and outs of it from Little Cutie and Ye Wei's analyses and discussions. After this detoxification, there would be even greater challenges awaiting them. She only hoped that Third Young Master Ye, who had already experienced so much suffering, had endured all the hardships in his life. May the future be smooth sailing for him. With a sigh, she brushed her fingers across the tip of his eyebrows. Third Young Master Ye had thick and well-shaped eyebrows that were quite pleasing to the eye. His tightly closed eyes were adorned with long lashes that curled slightly, creating a thin silhouette beneath his eyelids. His high, well-formed nose and elegant lips, along with his exquisite facial features, seemed like a masterpiece crafted by God. Cheng Anya had long known that Third Young Master Ye was exceptionally handsome. While he might not match the breathtaking beauty of Su Man, Mo Jue, and others, his appearance was a rarity in the world. Her slender fingers traced across his lips, which were slightly dry. Remembering the warmth of these lips, Cheng Anya was briefly stunned. She quickly withdrew her hand. If Third Young Master Ye found out she had touched him like this in secret, his narcissistic tendencies would surely have caused him to react in an unpredictable way. She rarely focused so intently on his features. Recalling his domineering manner, anger, slyness, feigned helplessness, and countless other expressions, Cheng Anya involuntarily smiled. Laughter escaped her lips. "Do I look that funny?" A voice that had been absent for many days emerged hoarse with a hint of displeasure. Cheng Anya was taken aback for a moment, only to meet a pair of pitch-black eyes that used to be closed. Right now, they were staring at her with an annoyed expression. Cheng Anya's heart leapt with joy. He was awake? Finally, he was fine. She then wondered when he had awakened. When she thought of her long fingers brushing past his facial features, her fingertips felt a little hot, and her face also flushed with heat. "You've been awake for a while?" "Tell me, what's so amusing?" Third Young Master Ye's eyes deepened, and he suddenly grabbed her hand, inadvertently brushing against the wound on his wrist. He let out a stifled groan and covered the wound with his other hand, causing the other hand to hurt, so much so that his brows furrowed in pain. "Don't move." Cheng Anya hurriedly helped him sit up. Fortunately, he hadn't tugged too hard, and the blood hadn't seeped through the bandage. She wanted to remove it and reapply the ointment, but Third Young Master Ye stopped her. "It's just a superficial wound," he said, glancing at his wrists and then at his ankles. Fragmented images flashed through his mind in bits and pieces that, when pieced together, it wasn't hard for him to guess what had happened. He vaguely remembered his manic state, accompanied with the sound of metal striking, and strangely enough, at that time, these pains had seemed inconsequential to him. He had no recollection of the experience whatsoever. "Even for a superficial wound, you still need ointment. Don't move." Cheng Anya took the ointment from the side and unwrapped the bandage, ready to reapply ointment for him. Third Young Master Ye finally realized just how horrifying the wounds on his wrists were. Startled, he shifted his gaze to Cheng Anya's wrists and found that she was unharmed. Third Young Master Ye suddenly asked, "What about the poison in your body? Has it been removed?" Cheng Anya nodded and explained the situation, omitting the matter of the child. She still wasn't sure how to tell Third Young Master Ye about it. After applying the ointment, she carefully rebandaged his wounds. "You still haven't answered my question." Third Young Master Ye bumped his head against her head, which was inches away from his. Laughing at him while he was asleep? She ought to be punished. Cheng Anya rolled her eyes at him. "Can't I be happy? The poison is removed. It's such a joyful occasion, why can't I laugh?" "You're lying." Third Young Master Ye hmphed and leaned in to give Cheng Anya a peck. "How many days have I been sleeping?" "Nine days," Cheng Anya replied. For nine days, she had been on tenterhooks. Especially today, during the detoxification process, the feeling of teetering on the edge of despair was etched deeply in her heart. She would never forget the agonizing wait, which was more unbearable than any other moment. Third Young Master Ye gazed at her, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he said, "I've been sleeping for so long, you should give me a kiss, like in fairy tales when the prince kisses the sleeping beauty." With that, he puckered his lips and leaned in, expecting a kiss. Cheng Anya gave him a light slap and pushed him to the other side. She laughed and scolded, "Which part of you looks like a princess?" Such a narcissist. Third Young Master Ye also chuckled. The somewhat heavy atmosphere dissipated in an instant, replaced by a sense of joy. Cheng Anya tilted her head and saw him smiling faintly. Curling up the corners of her lips, she leaned in, and Third Young Master Ye tilted his head and instinctively captured her lips in a kiss. Cheng Anya extended her tongue, delicately tracing the outline of his lips. Suddenly, he pressed her into his arms. Third Young Master Ye took control, diving into her lips and teeth, kissing her deeply. His tongue explored every inch of her mouth, lightly sucking and nipping, reveling in the joy of being reborn after experiencing near-death, and the excitement of regaining something lost. When the two of them fell into a deep sleep, they are prepared for the possibility that they might never wake up again, harboring complex emotions of parting and death. At this moment, with both alive, who wouldn't be moved and joyful? The precious treasure in his arms seemed even more precious. Cheng Anya closed her eyes and savored his kiss. His familiar scent lingered in her breath, his eyebrows brushed against hers, a gentle breeze caressed them, and the room was filled with tenderness. No amount of kissing seemed enough. Third Young Master Ye was insatiable. Just as he parted to let her catch her breath, he covered her lips again, dominating the kiss. His lips, like his demeanor, were overbearing and forceful. The moonlight was gentle, and the beauty was like jade, embraced in his arms on the bed. They naturally fell onto the bed. Cheng Anya was lost in the passionate kiss, feeling his lips teasing and sucking on her earlobe. His hot breath brushed against her ear, and the warmth seemed to penetrate her central nervous system, piercing through her central nervous system and driving down. A faint stir in her lower abdomen made her blush with embarrassment. This sensation was a bit unfamiliar yet somewhat familiar. She had felt this way countless times during that day and night in the desert castle. Even her fingertips had felt weak as she melted into a pool of desire in his arms. Her delicate face resembled a rose, and her eyes were seductive like silk. She was free for his taking. "Anya…" A low, husky voice murmured, and his scorching breath caressed Cheng Anya's tender skin at her neck. Her snowy skin took on a pink hue as his wet kisses trailed down, parting her clothing. His touch grazed his wounds, and he let out a brief groan. Cheng Anya, who had been dazed by desire, suddenly snapped back to reality. Clarity returned to her eyes as she stopped Third Young Master Ye's advances. "Ah Chen, stop this. You're not in a suitable condition." "I'm fine," Third Young Master Ye vetoed immediately, paying no attention to his own wounds. As he was about to tear open Cheng Anya's clothing, she hastily sat up, but was pressed down by him. "Don't move." "Alright, alright. You're not dead, and it's not urgent to do it in the couple of days," Cheng Anya sneered. Everyone, male or female, would be unable to refrain from asking for more once they experienced sex, especially when it came to someone like Third Young Master Ye, who possessed unparalleled sensuality. But everything had its right time and place. "How about you take the lead then?" Third Young Master Ye was relentless, winking suggestively. A dark glint appeared in his eyes, and a hint of greed gleamed in his gaze. He seemed quite eager for Miss Cheng to take charge. Cheng Anya's face turned crimson. She pushed his shoulder, signaling for him to let her off. "I don't know how to do it." "I'll teach you." "..." Miss Cheng's face grew even redder. Third Young Master Ye leaned in and whispered something in her ear. Cheng Anya nearly kicked him off the bed. Her face turned a delicate shade of embarrassment, and she was thoroughly embarrassed. "You lecherous scoundrel, forget it." Suddenly, Third Young Master Ye swooped down and kissed her deeply. Cheng Anya struggled briefly, and they both turned their heads in surprise at the sound of clinking objects. Two figures, one big and one small, were in the process of making a hasty escape. Ye Wei and Little Cutie slowly turned around. Ye Wei observed that her Third Sister-in-law's lips were swollen, her face flushing with passion, while her third brother's face was filled with unsatisfied desire, his eyes filled with an ominous intent. She… for the first time, found that the feeling of ruining someone else's intimate moment was unexpectedly… Thrilling. Little Cutie waved her hand in a very ladylike manner as a greeting. Ye Wei said, "Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, your stamina is really great, really great... Keep going, keep going. We'll come back in a while." "Yes, keep going, keep going..." Little Cutie echoed. Despite saying that, the two of them, one tall and one small, stood still with trays in their hands, watching the scene unfold with pure innocence. If it weren't for the injury on Third Young Master Ye's body, Cheng Anya would have kicked him off the bed long ago. Oh, what a shame... Oh, thunder, just strike me now! So, this was the feeling of being caught in a horny moment on bed. It was truly embarrassing. "You two have absolutely no sense of propriety." Third Young Master Ye snorted coldly. He finally got up from Cheng Anya's body, feeling lucky that he had refrained from tearing her clothes off in one go. Otherwise, the scene would have been even more embarrassing. Beauty Ye Wei remained silent and thought to herself, "Third Brother, how can you blame us when you were the one who was so eager? Who would still think of doing this after lying in bed for so many days with such serious injuries? It's really because you're too eager, so it's not our fault." Originally, she and Ningning had calculated the timing carefully. They hadn't eaten anything all day. Ye Wei had someone prepare some easily digestible food and sent it over. She was originally doing this to avoid ringing the doorbell and therefore save her brother and sister-in-law the trouble of getting off bed to open the door for them. Who would have known they would come across this scene? Even Little Cutie was surprised. Although he knew very well that her Daddy had been "starving" for a long time, he didn't expect him to be this horny. He actually asked Mommy to take charge because of his inconvenience. This was really... polluting the innocent mind of a junior. Little Cutie thought awkwardly to himself. "Third Brother, come on, have some cold milk to extinguish the fire." Ye Wei took out the drinks, porridge, and side dishes from the tray, and with a smiling gesture, she beckoned her dear Third Brother to come over and cool himself down. A man who wasn't satisfied with his desires was very scary. After the initial embarrassment, Cheng Anya didn't feel too ashamed. Being with the Ye Family, one's heart had to be a bit stronger. Such minor incidents weren't enough to make her panic, and fortunately, her clothes weren't in disarray, or she would have really been embarrassed. "Mommy, you can finally hug me." After setting down the tray, Ningning ignored his Daddy's jealous gaze and jumped into Cheng Anya's arms. Her small body clung to Cheng Anya and didn't let go, "Mommy..." "Good boy." Cheng Anya smiled, casually pinching Ningning's cheeks and giving him a big smooch on his face. Ningning grinned from ear to ear. "Mommy, you smell so good. No wonder Daddy loves to eat you." Little Cutie turned his head around, and Cheng Anya was left feeling greatly embarrassed. She playfully slapped the back of his head, saying, "Are you asking for a beating?" "You're quite violent." Little Cutie chuckled and pulled Cheng Anya over to the dining table. "Mommy, it's been a while since you tasted the food cooked by me, right? I prepared all of them for you." Third Young Master Ye had already been wolfing down the food. He was starving and suffering a dual hunger. Chapter 386 Parting Ways With the virus eradicated, it was time to discuss their departure from Riyadh. Ye Wei and Bai Ye had discussed it. They needed to return to Rome, intensify their efforts temporarily, and swiftly address the grievances between Prince William and Chu Li. Currently, the primary focus was dealing with the Mafia. Prince William was likely being used by Louis to weaken the First Terrorist Organization, hence diverting their attention. They couldn't afford to spend too much time dealing with Prince William; the cost would outweigh the benefits. Bai Ye had been contacted Chu Li. After he returned to Rome and explained the plan, he would mobilize the international power of the First Terrorist Organization to leverage the international situation to force Prince William to yield. At this stage, he doubted that Prince William would self-destruct along with Chu Li just for Rong Yan. This was the quickest way to resolve the situation. Eleven and Ye Wei had their own tasks as well. They needed to find the whereabouts of the Mo brothers and Louis. Little Cutie said, "Daddy, Mommy, can I go with Bai Ye this time?" This was the main reason he and Ye Wei went upstairs to see his parents. If it weren't for the recent incident, Little Cutie would have found a way to get to the First Terrorist Organization long ago. This was a perfect opportunity for him to enrich his experience and he didn't want to miss it. Being by their side would allow him to learn much more. He was determined to walk this path wholeheartedly to learn all the necessary skills. He could not always stay by his parents' side. Most importantly, he wanted to avenge Nuonuo. Louis and the Cang Lang, he wouldn't spare either of them. Third Young Master Ye didn't have any objections. He tilted his head, an indicator for his son that the person he needed to persuade was his Mommy. "Mommy, what do you think?" Little Cutie asked Cheng Anya, "I know it's a bit inappropriate to bring this up when you're still recovering, but Mommy, can you indulge me once, please?" Cheng Anya leaned back, gazing deeply at Little Cutie. She fell silent for a moment, and Little Cutie gazed back at her, appearing quite resolute. Deep inside, Cheng Anya sighed. What use was there in stopping him now? She had already decided during the trip of escape that she would let her son fly freely. She couldn't provide him with the skills he needed to grow up, a mission only others were capable of completing. "If you've made up your mind, I don't object." Cheng Anya finally agreed. Ye Wei felt a sense of relief. In the past, it might have been difficult to persuade Cheng Anya. After this incident, she knew it was as easy as pie. She truly didn't know whether to thank Louis or not for giving Cheng Anya such a profound lesson. "Mommy, you're the best to me." Little Cutie pounced and wrapped his arms around Cheng Anya's neck. "Thank you, Mommy." Cheng Anya kissed her dear son. "Do what you want to do. You've grown up, and Mommy trusts your judgment." After this incident, she had grown more mature. Her son had grown up too. It was time for her to let go. Her son was like a kite in the sky, and as his mother, she was the string. As long as she held on tightly, he could never fly beyond the horizon. Only by loosening the string could he soar higher and farther. The looser the string, the farther he could fly. It didn't matter, as long as her son didn't fall, she could always reel him in, and he would eventually come back. Third Young Master Ye watched the mother and son and smiled comfortingly. Meeting Cheng Anya and falling in love with her was the luckiest thing in his life. Having such an outstanding son was a blessing earned over several lifetimes, and he should cherish it. "Daddy, Mommy, what about you?" Little Cutie asked, a bit concerned. "Are you going back to City A?" Third Young Master Ye nodded. "I'm going back. It's been a month, and Lin Da and Tang Si are both worried. The three of us need to discuss how to fight against the Mafia. Louis is about to make a move to swallow up North America, and Dragon Sector will be the first to bear the brunt." Little Cutie nodded, gripping Cheng Anya's hand tightly. Suddenly, he made a suggestion. "Mommy, how about you stay in Riyadh? This is Su Man's home, a forbidden place. With Su Man here, no one can harm you. Once the situation stabilizes a bit, you can return to City A. How about that?" Cheng Anya shook her head. "No, I want to go back with you. There's no room for negotiation." Little Cutie understood his mother's personality very well. Since she said that, there was no room for negotiation. He couldn't help but look at Third Young Master Ye. Ye Chen gave a faint smile. "This time, I will be with her 24 hours a day. There won't be a repeat of the same incident." In addition, Dragon Sector's assassin team would also provide them with around-the-clock protection. They wouldn't be as careless as last time. Louis would find it difficult to approach City A this time. "I think it's a good idea. Following Third Brother or staying in Su Man's residence doesn't make much difference. City A is currently a peaceful zone, but Riyadh is becoming a bit unsafe. Although they're wary of Su Man, if Third Sister-in-law is alone, Louis won't hesitate to go to extremes." Ye Wei calmly analyzed, "We still haven't received any news about Louis or Boss Mo's whereabouts. Ningning, I know you're investigating their whereabouts. As soon as there's any discovery in City A, let us know in advance." "Naturally." Little Cutie held Cheng Anya's hand and said in a deep voice, "Mommy, I won't let you be frightened again." Before Cheng Anya could respond, Third Young Master Ye threw a punch, hitting Little Cutie in the head hard. Little Cutie held his head in pain, gazing at Third Young Master Ye with big and reproachful eyes. "Daddy, are you trying to beat me into a fool?" "I should be the one to say those words. Whenever are you allowed to steal my lines?" Third Young Master Ye squinted his eyes and glared, "You little brat, my wife doesn't need your protection." Little Cutie pouted in a dejected manner, lifting the corners of his lips. He had always been saying those words. Mommy was the greatest, and it was only natural for him to protect Mommy. After all, Daddy, you had been away for so many years. Suddenly, you appeared and intervened—it was not fair for you to do that. But Little Cutie was clever enough not to say those words out loud. Cheng Anya rolled her eyes and imitated Third Young Master Ye's previous action and gave him a punch. "Shut up." Ye Wei burst into laughter. "You rebel!" Third Young Master Ye pretended to raise his hand, but Cheng Anya showed no fear. She simply ignored him and turned to Ye Wei. "Weiwei, I'm entrusting Ningning to you. Please take care of him for me." "Don't worry, Third Sister-in-law. He's so clever and cunning. Nothing bad will happen to him." Little Cutie modestly smiled. "Since it's decided, I'll arrange for a plane later." Ye Wei said. "Third Sister-in-law, if you feel any discomfort, let Su Man know immediately. He said there won't be any danger for the time being." "Don't worry, I know." "Didn't Anya get detoxified?" The tone of Third Young Master Ye's voice dropped, his heart skipped a beat, and his gaze turned intense as he looked at Cheng Anya, a hint of panic flickering through his eyes. "Didn't Third Sister-in-law tell you? She got detoxified, but the baby inside her stomach hasn't shown any sign yet." Ye Wei blurted out, and Cheng Anya's attempt to stop her came too late. Third Young Master Ye was instantly petrified. Chapter 387 A Conversation Between Father and Son It took Third Young Master Ye nearly ten minutes to fully digest the meaning behind Ye Wei's words. By the time he came back to his senses, Ye Wei and Ningning had already left, leaving the space to them. As he regained his senses, Cheng Anya had already finished two cups of hot tea. Was he being silly with joy, or was he so angry that he became stupid? Cheng Anya wondered. The child's arrival was indeed sudden, not within their plans, but it had come after all. She was extremely happy about it. What about him? Seeing how he doted on Ningning, Cheng Anya speculated that he probably also loved children a lot. But his reaction had been far too drawn out. She almost felt like waking him up to get some other reaction out of him. He had held that expression for too long. Although his face wasn't getting tired, she was afraid of seeing him like that. "Pregnant?" "Yes, that night in the desert." Cheng Anya said softly and suddenly felt her wrist being tightly held before finding herself in his warm embrace. His large hand pressing against her back, pulling her onto his chest. He leaned in, his lips descending to hers, capturing them in a deep kiss. His kiss was domineering, his tongue parting her tightly closed lips and diving into her mouth, nearly reaching her throat. He explored every soft spot inside her mouth, tasting and taking without restraint. It was a storm of kisses, and she didn't resist him at all. Nestled in his embrace, she naturally responded. Third Young Master Ye positioned her hand behind her back, adjusting her to an angle that better suited him. He kissed her with fierce intensity. Though it wasn't their first kiss, Third Young Master Ye had never been gentle. However, she hadn't experienced this level of roughness before. She even tasted a hint of salty blood between their lips, a result of his excessive force. She sighed. This guy would never learn what gentleness meant. Getting excited doesn't mean you have to be this excited. Her breath was almost taken away by him. The kiss went on for a while, and Cheng Anya slightly turned her head to escape his scorching lips. Unsatisfied, he peppered kisses on her cheeks, the tender lobes of her ears, and his hot breath landed on her neck. There was a warm flow of heat between her lower abdomen, causing her to fidget. Embarrassed, a faint pink hue spread across her skin. In an instant, Third Young Master Ye turned Cheng Anya's face and once again claimed her lips, but this time, his approach was much gentler. Cheng Anya's gaze swept over, and the soft white light illuminated his tender eyebrows, making him seem as gentle as water. At this moment, everything felt peaceful and distant. As if time had become eternal. She was content. Although their ways of expressing joy were different, she didn't pretend to deny that she quite liked Third Young Master Ye's action-oriented display of affection. Her heart was filled with honey, a sweet sensation. This child, he liked him, without a doubt. How wonderful it would be if they could keep this child. She couldn't help but wonder: if Third Young Master Ye had known she was pregnant with Ningning seven years ago, how would he have reacted? Most likely, he would have coldly ordered her to abort it, saying that he didn't needed it. The difference between love and ruthlessness was truly vast. "Anya, I'm very happy," he whispered softly, lowering his chin to touch her forehead after a long kiss. Cheng Anya smiled. "I'm very happy too." Meanwhile, in Ningning's room... In the past few days, aside from closely monitoring the situation with Ye Wei, Eleven, and others during the day and exchanging messages with Chu Li, Little Cutie spent the rest of his time studying computer technology. He had to admit that there was a slight gap between him and Mo Jue and Mo Ye. When faced with a cap to one's abilities, it was extremely difficult to continue moving upwards. It was like getting a perfect score on an exam and trying to raise it further—there was no space left. The only difference would be the degree of perfection in the test paper. Sometimes, you had to put in more effort. Ningning was luckier than most. He was a genius, destined to take steps ahead of others, and he could accomplish more with less effort. Like this time, it was true that he hadn't reached Mo Jue and Mo Ye's level yet. However, he could at least determine whether the information Mo Jue and Mo Ye provided was true or false. With a bit more time, he was certain he could surpass the two brothers. In this field, he would be the ultimate master. When Third Young Master Ye arrived, Ningning was still busy. "Daddy?" Ningning paused in his work and glanced at the clock. It was already early morning. "Daddy, why haven't you slept?" "And what about you? Aren't you awake as well? What are you doing?" Third Young Master Ye sat down next to Ningning and understood as soon as he saw the computer screen. He rubbed his son's head. "Don't push yourself too hard." "It's okay." Little Cutie smiled. "I'm competing with the Mo brothers. I'm not tired at all. In fact, I'm quite passionate. Daddy, I'll be able to surpass them soon. When the time comes, taking down Louis won't be a problem." He had a hard time falling asleep at night. Every time he closed his eyes, he dreamed of Xu Nuo, wearing the red dress and holding the soft whip. She was like a fiery rose, charming and gentle, yet he couldn't touch her. He would wake up feeling lonely and desolate. He despised this feeling and almost didn't sleep at night, except for when he used sleep aids. That was not bad, and it gave him time to compete with the Mo brothers. Third Young Master Ye chuckled. "Daddy believes in you." "Why aren't you with Mommy?" "She's already asleep." Third Young Master Ye looked at his son and Ningning smiled knowingly. "Daddy, do you have something to tell me?" Otherwise, why would Daddy come to find him so late? "This time, as you leave our side, be cautious in all matters, understand? As for Louis, I know you hate him, but don't be consumed by revenge. Otherwise, you'll lose your way." Third Young Master Ye advised. He always had an uneasiness in his heart. Even Cheng Anya could sense the change in their son, so how could he fail to notice it? Even if he continued to be as cute and lively as before in front of them, his mentality had apparently changed. He was always worried that the hatred in his son's heart was so intense that he would end up harming himself. At this moment, the extent of his hatred for Louis and his desire for revenge weighed equally heavily on him. He could imagine how satisfying it would be when Little Cutie fulfilled his wishes and how deep his confusion would be after that. Being overly fixated on one thing often brought about negative consequences. He wondered what Little Cutie would find to keep himself alive once he had completely achieved his goal. Xu Nuo couldn't be resurrected, his heartache couldn't be healed, and he was afraid that his son would venture further and further down the path of revenge. Ultimately, it would backfire on himself. This was his personal experience. For so many years, he hadn't spent a single day outside the shadow, hadn't been happy until he had them—mother and son. He didn't want Ningning to walk the same lonely path he had walked. "Daddy, what are you talking about? I don't understand." Ningning elegantly chuckled, his somewhat youthful fingers lightly tapping the keyboard, seemingly aimless. His gaze, however, was directed toward the window rather than Third Young Master Ye. How could he not understand? But his emotional burden was something no one could fully comprehend. Without experiencing the same loss, people would never truly understand the heart-wrenching despair it caused. Occasionally, he would stand alone on the balcony, gazing at Riyadh's sky, thinking that perhaps his hatred would lessen once he annihilated the Mafia. His heart had grown fierce. "You really don't understand?" Third Young Master Ye asked with a deep voice. His son was too intelligent and mature for his age. The father-son relationship between them had always been like that of friends and family. He had never had such a serious conversation with Ningning, nor had he ever been angry with him. This son of his was too perfect. He wouldn't do anything to make you angry. He was obedient and filial, intelligent and adorable. He didn't have any flaws for you to catch onto and educate him. His thinking was meticulous, rigorous, and he understood matters clearly. Yet, because he was so intelligent, it was even more worrying when he became adamant about something. Ningning remained silent. His youthful face had long lost its innocence. His profile was obscured in the darkness, devoid of the warm, elegant smile he displayed during the day and the cute, charming demeanor he exhibited in front of Cheng Anya. He looked cold and formidable, his gaze reflecting his complex thoughts, as if his body was inhabited by a fierce spirit. The room was incredibly quiet. Riyadh's moon was rarely full, always missing a small portion. The moonlight seemed colder, flowing down as if it could chill one's heart. "Ningning, you've grown up. Are you ignoring what I said?" Third Young Master Ye's voice carried a hint of suppressed anger. Ningning's silence confirmed his suspicions. "Daddy, I know what I'm doing." Ningning spoke softly. Excessive cruelty was never a good thing. He did indeed harbor intentions of launching a massacre, but what did it matter to be cruel? But... "Ningning, if you punish yourself like that, then Xu Nuo's death will have been in vain," Third Young Master Ye said in a deep voice. "If it were your Mommy, she definitely wouldn't want me to become a merciless person who only knows how to hate rather than how to love." Not knowing how to love? Perhaps. It was said that a heart filled with hatred for too long could hardly understand how to love. Even if Louis were dead, it was unlikely to quell the hatred in his heart. But afterward, who would be the next target of his hatred? For the first time, Ningning felt that Ye Chen's image in his heart had grown so much magnificent. The hand resting on his shoulder had become so powerful. "Daddy, I understand." Third Young Master Ye patted Ningning's shoulder, his words carrying weight and deep meaning. "I hope you truly understand it and can soon emerge from the shadows." With that, he turned and left. Ningning watched Third Young Master Ye's departing figure at the doorway, silent. It was the first time someone had spoken to him like this since Xu Nuo's death, and he didn't know how he should respond. There was a hint of shock and anger, but that person was his father, so he couldn't be angry with him. There was also a touch of surprise, as he realized that although his father had never said anything, he had seen through his inner struggles at a glance. And there was also a sense of being moved, because he sensed that no matter how old or intelligent a child became, in the eyes of his parents, everything was laid bare, and all his emotions were exposed. In the past, he felt that having a father was inconsequential because he alone could ensure lifelong happiness for Cheng Anya. But now that he knew Ye Chen, he liked this father. He did everything he could to bring them together, hoping for a complete family. In reality, the significance of a father to him was having one more person who cared for him and one more person he cared for. He wasn't quite sure about the warm feeling in his heart right now. It wasn't until many years later that he would look back and realize just how important his father had been in his life. Subconsciously, he absorbed his father's words, preventing himself from going to extremes and straying onto the wrong path.
