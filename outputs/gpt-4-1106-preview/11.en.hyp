Chapter 1303: As Long As You (1)  "What are you doing?!" The elder of the Donggong family tapped his cane, his voice filled with anger.  "Our ancestor is about to arrive, please be patient, Elder Donggong. You'll know what we're doing in a moment," the leading man replied.  Elder Donggong naturally knew who the 'ancestor' referred to in his mouth was. He was somewhat at a loss, not knowing why Pei Yi would come. Having a feud with DK was not a good thing. Although everyone in the country R wanted to drive DK out, it was simply not possible. It was just wishful thinking.  A few minutes later, Pei Yi's car arrived. He got out of the car and looked towards another car not far away. An Xiao Ning saw him and got out of her car without taking off her mask and wig. Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind.  "You're here," An Xiao Ning spoke up.  Pei Yi looked her up and down, rarely smiling, walked up to her, leaned in a few inches, and said in a low voice, "Hey, with this look, these people would hardly guess it's you, right?"  "Of course, I don't want them to know my identity, that's why I asked you to come. It's not the right time yet."  Pei Yi subconsciously glanced at Wu Lianzhi, "Why are you with him?"  "I have something to do."  He stood up straight, turned around, and with a faint smile on his face, said to the Donggong family's people, "I don't know where my sister has offended the Donggong family clan to the point of wanting to kill her? Have you grown so bold?"  Upon hearing this, the faces of the Donggong family's people changed instantly. Pei Yi's sister? Where did Pei Yi get a sister?  Elder Donggong spoke up, "Mr. Pei's sister... we really don't know anything about that."  "Now that you don't know, I'm telling you," Pei Yi said coldly, "Do you hear me clearly?"  "Since Mr. Pei said this is your cousin, please take your cousin away. As for Donggong Lianzhi, his name is still in our family genealogy; we have not yet disowned this rebellious grandson, he is still a person of our Donggong family. How we deal with him is our family's internal affair."  Before Pei Yi could answer, An Xiao Ning took the opportunity to call out to him, "Brother, he is my boyfriend, and I have his child in my belly, you can't leave him behind."  Pei Yi originally wanted to take her away only, but now it seemed a little tricky. However, being overbearing was his style, and if he wanted to do something, such a small matter was not a problem at all.  "Old lady, you heard it too. This one... is also considered my brother-in-law now. They even have a child. Giving him to you would make the child fatherless in the future. Do you think I would agree?"  Elder Donggong was very clear that letting Pei Yi take the person away meant that they would no longer be able to deal with their grandson openly in the future. So, despite some fear of DK's power, her attitude could not be weakened.  "Mr. Pei, I'm afraid this won't do. Our family has our own family laws. When it comes to dealing with our own people, outsiders are not allowed to interfere."  "I've said it, he's the father of my sister's child in her belly. Are you getting old and deaf?" Pei Yi turned his gaze to Wu Lianzhi, "You say, are you a person of the Donggong family?"  "This morning, when my mother sent me poisoned food, I broke off the mother-son relationship with her on the spot. Before that, when the Donggong family tried to design me, Miss An, and her subordinates into accidental deaths, I was already clear. Although the name Donggong Lianzhi is still in the family genealogy and the household register of the Donggong family, I no longer bear the surname Donggong. My name is now Wu Lianzhi, and I am no longer a person of the Donggong family!"  His words were powerful and cold. Declaring such a statement in front of so many people showed his determination.  "This is not for you to decide!" Elder Donggong said, "Once you enter our Donggong door, alive you are our people, dead you are our ghost!"  "Then, Elder Donggong, I want to ask you, you know that your plot to murder Miss An is already known to her, and you still have the mood to want to punish and deal with me here, aren't you worried about the serious representations from country S?" This was said by Wu Lianzhi with a strange tone, without any fear.  "I have dealt with An Xiao Ning before," said Pei Yi with a slight smile. "She is the type to hold a grudge. You want her life; can she let it go easily? Alright, let's not waste words, my time is quite precious, I'll take both of them away."  Seeing that the Donggong family's people wanted to speak again, he added another sentence, "Unless you want to see blood here."  And so, the Donggong family's people watched as the duck that was already cooked flew away completely. Elder Donggong and the patriarch were really not okay.  In the end, Elder Donggong gave the order directly, "Forget it, remove his name from the register, and also destroy his household registration!"  ---  "We need to return to country S."  Pei Yi glanced at her, "Use and then leave? Didn't you say you'd agree to one of my requests? I haven't even mentioned it yet, and you’re talking about going back to the country?"  "I am in a hurry to return to the country for something, but I do promise you one request, so speak, what is it?"  "Well, my request might be a bit difficult for you..."  "Then don't mention it, propose one that you think won't be difficult for me."  Pei Yi turned to face her, staring intently, "You really haven't changed at all, accompany me for half a month."  "What kind of companionship?"  "Just like before."  An Xiao Ning looked at him, "No, first, I can't be chained, my freedom cannot be restricted, and second, half a month is too long, two days are possible."  "..." Pei Yi's smile slightly faded, "You're cutting the price too much, five days, not less. You said others could make a request, and when they do, you can't go back on your word. I will definitely give you freedom."  "Then can I go back to the country first?"  "No."  "..."  Wu Lianzhi, who was inside the car, listening to the two's conversation, really felt that these two people might be having an affair. Could these two have an unclear relationship? It sounded like it. But if that was the case, the two of them were too unguarded in front of him.  "Then let him go back to country S first, I'll be at your place alone, okay?"  "I won't do anything to you guys, let's go together."  His tone left no room for doubt.  An Xiao Ning didn't say anything more. Since it wasn't far from Qingping Mountain, they arrived quickly. Coming to this place again, there were indeed many mixed feelings. When Qin Guo saw her that instant, she was really unhappy. As they entered, she immediately rolled her eyes, thinking how her ancestor brought this calamity back again. Chapter 1304: As Long as You're Here (2)  After sending in the snacks and tea, Qin Guo couldn't help but ask, "Ancestor, who is this..."   "What's your name?" Pei Yi asked.  "Wu Lianzhi, I remember I told you already."  "I didn't pay attention." Pei Yi spoke indifferently, then told Qin Guo, "Arrange a room for him."  "Okay, but do we need to arrange one for Miss An?"  "No need."  Wu Lianzhi confirmed the guess in his heart; it seemed he was going to live with An Xiaoning.   An Xiaoning noticed that Wu Lianzhi was looking at her and Pei Yi in a strange way and immediately realized that he must have misunderstood something. For some reason, she didn't want anyone to misunderstand her relationship with another man.  Except for Jin Qingyan.  Thinking of her own man, she really had no solution.  "Lianzhi, come out with me for a bit, I have something to tell you."  "Okay."  Once they were outside, she asked in a low voice, "Did you misunderstand my relationship with Pei Yi?"  "Are you not..."  "Of course not. I usually sleep on the sofa where I was sitting just now. In the past, when he locked my hands and feet, I also slept on the sofa every day."  "Does he like you?"  "Don't talk nonsense." An Xiaoning patted his shoulder, "We'll stay here for five days, then go back."  "Okay."  ---  These past few days, Fang Erlan was extremely busy, having to make up for missed scenes and do promotions. Every day, from the moment she opened her eyes, she was busy until she went to sleep, and it was exhausting.  Despite Xiao Chenyang trying to nourish her every day, she still lost several pounds.  "These next few days, I'm afraid I won't be able to accompany you," Xiao Chenyang said after reading the message sent by An Xiaoning.  "What are you going to do?"  Xiao Chenyang had not told her about Jin Qingyan's dual personalities. He didn't want to keep it from her, but he knew that the fewer people who knew about it, the better. "There's something very important to do. I'll be back as soon as possible."  "I'll come with you."  "Aren't you still filming and doing promotions?"  "I can continue when I come back."  Xiao Chenyang reached out and touched her head. The more she worried about him, the more she depended on him, the happier he became. "I really wish you could come with me because it's the safest when you're with me. But not this time."  "What exactly are you going to do?" Fang Erlan pressed, "If you don't tell me, I won't let you go."  Seeing her worried, Xiao Chenyang said, "Then you must keep it a secret, absolutely must not tell anyone."  "Of course, I won't tell anyone."  Xiao Chenyang said gravely, "Qingyan has run away."  "Run away... what do you mean?"  "He has a dual personality. His second personality has run off, and we don't know where he is. We can't find him in the country, he might have gone abroad, we don't know which country. So, I need to get people to search for him. And An Xiaoning is in DK now, I need to go to Country R, because there's someone like me there, a person from the Wu family."  "Who is the person from the Wu family?"  Xiao Chenyang explained, "Our country's former witchcraft family, they had once cursed An Xiaoning and Qingyan. Then for some reason, they disappeared. Now that we've found them, their descendants haven't inherited their family's witchcraft. Instead, we found someone like me, this person must understand witchcraft. It would be better if we could capture him, if not, at least we can't let him live."  Fang Erlan felt like she was listening to a tale of wonders, "Sister Xiaoning won't be in trouble, right?"  "Hmm, they said it's fine, she'll return to the country after a few days."  "Then you go, I won't come with you, lest you get distracted by having to look after me. I'll ask Sister Yangyang to send over a few more bodyguards."  Xiao Chenyang ran his hand through her hair, "I just don't know when Qingyan will get better."  "Isn't he your senior brother? Why do you call him by his name instead of 'senior brother'?"  "I like it. I rarely called him 'senior brother' before. I usually did so when Master was present, but not much in private. I always called him by his name, since we grew up together and are close."  "I can't say anything to you."  Xiao Chenyang gave her a kiss, "I'll leave when the bodyguards arrive. Now call Sister Yangyang, and I'll explain to her."  "Okay."  Fang Erlan took out her phone and called Mei Yangyang.  "Sister, Chenyang has something to say to you."  Mei Yangyang responded, "Okay."  Fang Erlan handed the phone to Xiao Chenyang, who then put it to his ear, "I have important things to do and won't be by Erlan's side these few days. Send over eight bodyguards."  Fang Erlan immediately said, "That's too many, four will do."  "Not enough," he didn't listen, "Just have them come over now."  "Okay, I'll send people over now."  "Okay."  Xiao Chenyang hung up and specifically instructed her, "While I'm not at home these next few days, eat well, rest well, get to sleep as soon as you finish work, and don't play with your phone at night. It's bad for your eyes."  "I know."  ---  Knowing that Xiao Chenyang had come to Country R, An Xiaoning felt somewhat relieved, hoping to quickly find Jin Qingyan.  Two days at Qingping Mountain, she didn't spend her time folding paper cranes as she used to, but instead sat on the cashmere carpet on the ground practicing yoga.  While Pei Yi was working, he saw her performing various yoga poses, occasionally glancing up at her. Even without much interaction, having someone in the room made him feel a lot better.  "Now that DK has lost Xi Hou Jiaping, who's in charge?"  "Since DK was founded by him, although he's gone, there's no one capable of filling that position."  He looked at his computer while speaking, "Will you remarry Jin Qingyan?"  An Xiaoning twisted her body around, sat cross-legged, and faced him, "Actually, it's the same whether we remarry or not."  She wanted to affirm that they would remarry, but thinking of the curse, she truly didn't know what to say.  "How can it be the same?" He disagreed, "A marriage contract is the best proof of the relationship between two people. When others address you, they will refer to you more as Mrs. Jin rather than Miss An."  "Anyway, we will be together."  Pei Yi asked, "Do you know why I kept you here?"  "Your life is too dull and boring; you need me as a mood enhancer."  "An Xiaoning, can you not be so smart?"  "I can't help it, I was born this way."  "......" He pursed his lips and smiled, "That's not the only reason."  "Is there another reason?"  "If your heart wasn't already taken, I would have liked to make you my woman."  "Don't you have a fear of germs? How could you be interested in someone like me?"  "A truly charming woman, when she attracts a man's attention, what he sees is not those things, but her essence. Just like when I look at you, I automatically ignore those things and only see you for who you are." Chapter 1305: As Long As You (3)  Pei Yi looked up at her, "An Xiaoning, I greatly admire you and want to become friends with you, the kind that can meet often. Are you willing?"  An Xiaoning stood up from the blanket and sat down on the chair opposite his desk, wearing socks. She casually propped her chin with her hand, "Your identity is the head of the DK division, while my other identity is the daughter of the President's wife of Country S. Such two people becoming friends, in the eyes of others, would become a colluding group with interests, right?"  "So you... are unwilling?"  An Xiaoning looked at him, "Pei Yi, I also admire you very much, you really are charming, and I'm being honest, not just because you said the things I like to hear. You're very capable, but I have a principle, do you know what it is?"  "What principle?"  "Not to be friends with anyone from a terrorist organization, even if they have saved me. It's not prejudice, because many so-called decent people are also wantonly killing, for example, the Donggong family. Pei Yi, my wish is for world peace, although I know this day may never come, although I know it might take a very, very long time, but I don’t want this world to have wars that sacrifice the civilians anymore. Plus, I can't bear the rumors of colluding with DK. My parents are the President and the First Lady, I can't bring pressure to them. Because of my identity, if some people with ulterior motives make a big deal out of it, it will be hard to settle later."  Pei Yi nodded, "I know all that you've said."  "If, I mean if, one day you leave DK, I think, we can be very good friends. For now, it's better to keep the relationship as it is."  She thought he would say he would never leave DK, but he answered, "In the future, who knows."  After lunch, Pei Yi had to go out for something, leaving only her and Wu Lianzhi in the house. There were surveillance cameras everywhere, and although this was Pei Yi's office, the two of them wouldn't easily touch his things.  Qin Guo saw the two leisurely playing cards, and she had to personally serve tea and water, feeling very indignant in her heart.  "What are you dazing for? Go get me some cake, I want to eat cake."  Qin Guo said displeased, "May I ask, Miss An, do you think this is your own home?"  "If you won't get it, then?"  Qin Guo turned and left, muttering under her breath, "Eat cake and get fat to death."  After bringing the cake, she couldn't help but say, "I don't know what our ancestor brought you back for, just to eat, drink, and have fun."  "You should ask your ancestor that, how would I know?" An Xiaoning looked at her with a smile, "Miss Qin, if you're free, why don't you join us for cards?"  Qin Guo didn't speak.  "What's the matter, unwilling?"  "If our ancestor finds out..."  "It's fine, I will talk to him, you're free anyway."  Hearing her say this, Qin Guo said arrogantly, "All right, since Miss An has invited me so kindly, I will join you for a few rounds."  An Xiaoning really wanted to throw back at her, 'like to play or not, I'm giving you face...' but considering it was someone else's territory, she decided to let it go.  During the game, Qin Guo asked out of curiosity, "Miss An, do you like our ancestor?"  "Do you hope I like him or hope I don't?"  "I'm asking you, do you like him?"  "Why should I tell you my true feelings?"  Her statement successfully choked Qin Guo, who pursed her lips, "If you don't like our ancestor, please don't lure him in. He may seem cold and casual, but in fact, he takes things very seriously in his heart."  "Lure him? Child, you're overthinking. I have no romantic relationship with him."  Hearing this directly from her, Qin Guo immediately followed up, "Really? Is that really true?"  "Are you in love with him?"  Qin Guo denied, "Not at all, we are not qualified to covet our ancestor."  "That's right, he doesn't seem to be your type."  Qin Guo: "......"  "He should like two types of women."  "Which two types?"  "The first type, a simple girl without any craftiness or schemes. The second type, a strong, capable woman with her own thoughts, a woman who can catch his attention. Are you one of them?"  Qin Guo shook her head, "No."  "Then that settles it."  "Miss Qin, why did you join DK?"  "There's no reason, my whole family joined, why should I be an outsider?"  "You really have no opinion of your own. Just because your whole family joined, does it mean it's right? When your mother gave birth to you, did she forget your brain in her stomach?"  "......"  "What are you looking at? Am I wrong?"  "Miss An, your mouth is really poisonous."  "......"  ---  During the five days at Pei Yi's place, An Xiaoning was very calm and relaxed.  Although she was a bit tense in her thoughts, what mattered most was her own feelings.  Five days seemed not short, but it passed in the blink of an eye. For Pei Yi, five days was too short.  Even though it was too short, he would keep his promise and let An Xiaoning go back.  An Xiaoning was thinking of going back, but she received a call from Xiao Chenyang, telling her that Henry's whereabouts were discovered in Country R.  So, the two went to meet with Xiao Chenyang.  Xiao Chenyang opened the door and was surprised to see Wu Lianzhi, "So it's really you."  "Do we know each other?"  "Pfft." Xiao Chenyang suddenly laughed.  Wu Lianzhi looked at An Xiaoning, "What's wrong with him?"  "I've never seen him like this before, probably having a fit?" An Xiaoning said as she walked inside.  Wu Lianzhi followed inside, and after Xiao Chenyang had closed the door and laughed enough, he twisted open a bottle of mineral water and took a few sips before saying, "I had guessed it was him long ago, but seeing him in person today really feels like a long-awaited sight."  "It looks like you know who he is, which saves me from having to introduce in detail."  "An Xiaoning, you really have no impression of him at all?"  "None."  Xiao Chenyang sat back on the sofa, his long legs naturally crossed on the coffee table, and said with a smile, "The Wu family has produced such a talent, of course, I have some memory of him."  "Don't beat around the bush, just tell me."  "I heard he's a friend with whom you have a good relationship."  An Xiaoning thought it was something, "I already knew that early on, did you laugh for so long just because of this? I don't see why it's funny."  "Ah... I laughed because I thought of Long Tianze, it was thinking about Long Tianze's desperate expression that made me laugh."  "What does it have to do with Young Master Long..."  "It seems that when you recalled your past life, you only remembered things about you and your man. You didn't really consider others."  (Note: Some parts of the text may be incoherent or out of context as it's an excerpt from a larger narrative, and without the full context, it may be challenging to provide a translation that fully captures the original meaning or intent.) Chapter 1306: As Long As You (4)  An Xiaoning nodded, "It seems to be the case, go on and tell me."  "He and the person from the Long Tianze family's previous life were lovers, it was Yu Jiao."  An Xiaoning widened her eyes, "Are you lying to me?"  "Would I lie to you for a meal? Because our Western Marquis has been jealous of him a few times, occasionally bringing it up, saying that the one he liked was not you, but the maid by your side."  "..."  Wu Lianzhi probably understood the meaning of his words, "Who is Yu Jiao?"  An Xiaoning chuckled dryly, "In the previous life, she was the maid by my side."  "What about this life?"  "In this life, she is already married with children. Her husband is called Long Tianze, and he is the owner of an advertising company, entertainment company, and film production company on our side."  Wu Lianzhi nodded, "Mr. Xiao, did Yu Jiao and I get together in the previous life?"  "They were lovers, but you definitely didn't end up together because I know about your death. You were dealt with by your own Wu family."  "So that's how it is, but that's already a matter of the past. Xiaoning, is Yu Jiao living well now?"  "Mhm, very well. Her husband adores her, and they have a pair of children, living very happily."  "That's good."  Wu Lianzhi was very open-minded, "The matters of the past, since we didn't meet early in this life, it means our fate has already ended in the last life. It's enough that she is happy in this life. But, do you have a photo?"  "Yes."  An Xiaoning opened the photo album on her phone and found a beaming photo to show him, "This is her, in this life she is called Mei Yangyang."  Wu Lianzhi looked and smiled knowingly, "She's quite pretty."  "Right? Her daughter looks super like her, both with little bun faces."  "Xiaoning."  "Hm?"  "Don't tell her about our relationship in the past life, and don't tell her husband either. It's good this way. I don't want to disturb their peaceful life because of me."  An Xiaoning didn't expect him to be so considerate of Mei Yangyang, "Since you've said so, let's not mention it then. Just like you said, you have no fate in this life, might as well each live well on your own."  After finishing this topic, it was time to talk business.  "Have you found him?"  "I've already sent people to catch him. We've found him, and soon we'll be able to bring him back for questioning."  Xiao Chenyang returned to his usual manner, "But did he specifically come here to look for you?"  "I don't think so? I'm not sure. But have you been to the Donggong family's mansion?"  "I have. I confronted that so-called elder once. I thought he would be really powerful, but he was laid out after a few moves. I've already brought him back to country S."  "..."  An Xiaoning gave a thumbs up, "Awesome, really cool."  "Thanks for the praise."  Xiao Chenyang took the opportunity to talk about Er Lan, "Your studio should cultivate new talent, Er Lan won't act after this drama."  "We're already preparing. Yangyang and I have already guessed you would do this. But when do you plan to get married?"  "I haven't thought about it yet. This can't be rushed. A wedding is a serious matter and must be well-prepared. Originally, I thought life was a matter between the two of us, and we didn't need to share too much with others, just inviting some close friends and relatives would be enough. But now I've changed my mind. On the wedding day, I want the whole world to know that she is my woman."  "Yo yo yo," An Xiaoning praised, "So it's going to be that grand. Are you planning to spend all your fortune that day?"  "Do you know how much fortune I have?"  "Five hundred billion?"  Xiao Chenyang opened the bottle on the table and poured three cups, "You really underestimate me. I'll drink to this, you do as you please."  Saying that, he slowly brought it to his lips.  An Xiaoning handed a cup to Wu Lianzhi and then picked up another cup and began to drink slowly, "Where did you get so much money?"  "Stolen."  "Psht... who are you fooling?"  "Then where else would my money come from?"  An Xiaoning stared at him for a few seconds, then quickly pulled out her phone, "I believe Er Lan doesn't know about this either. I have to report this to her. I don't know what her reaction will be."  Xiao Chenyang grabbed her wrist, "I was wrong."  "Less tricks, more sincerity, okay?"  "In the past, besides hibernating, in order to fulfill my heart, I was doing business while looking for Er Lan. I was involved in various businesses, like a long time ago, our Xiao family was originally a big business family. Moreover, with three older sisters, I am the youngest and the only son in the family, all the family assets would be mine anyway. I was involved in many types of businesses, and then it grew bigger and bigger, and in the past few decades, I have also focused on investing in jewelry, gold, real estate, and made a lot. Then I timely stopped. I'll go back and explain this to Er Lan, she indeed doesn't know for now."  "When did you stop with real estate?"  "The year before last."  "Capitalist, oh capitalist," An Xiaoning lamented, "I really did underestimate you. But it's good that you stopped in time. Some businessmen never stop for their whole life."  "How much money is enough to earn? I've started to register a household in country S recently. It's really troublesome not to have a household registration here."  "Where is your current household registration?"  "Country Y. Every few decades, I have to cancel and re-register the household registration. I can just transfer it from abroad."  An Xiaoning turned to look at Wu Lianzhi, "Do you have any plans for your future?"  "Not yet."  "You can start thinking now. Didn't you hear him? The elder of the Donggong family, Wu Haigang, has already been taken back to country S. I believe your family will soon come to look for me in person in the country. They will definitely think it was my doing. I will mention your matter by the way, so you can plan for your future now."  "I think... I want to find a woman who likes me and whom I also like, to live a peaceful life together."  "You will find one."  ...  The three of them were waiting for the news from Xiao Chenyang's subordinates. After two hours, they finally received specific news about the whereabouts. Initially, they were going to capture him and bring him back, but since they couldn't subdue him, he ran away. At this time, they could only rush over from the hotel.  Upon seeing his figure, An Xiaoning immediately tore off her mask, "Henry!"  Henry, who was far away, was startled and turned around, seeing her.  An Xiaoning ran towards him, and he stood still.  "Didn't I tell you not to cause trouble? Why don't you listen?"  "I just felt it was too boring at home and wanted to go out for a bit."  "If you wanted to go out, couldn't you bring someone with you? You could go anywhere you wanted."  An Xiaoning tried to reach out to hold his arm but was subtly avoided by him.  "They are all over trying to catch me, making me feel like a criminal suspect." Chapter 1307: Just You (5)  An Xiao Ning forcibly clung to his arm, fearing that he would become restless and try to run away again, “I was just afraid that you would cause trouble, which is why I wanted to find you quickly.”  “Why did he come too?”  “It’s all because of you.”  Henry didn't say anything else, and went with her towards Xiao Chen Yang.  ---  Fan Shi Xin finally breathed a sigh of relief when he knew Henry had been found. He rubbed his temples; from the moment he ran away until now, his nerves hadn't had a moment of rest. After taking a short break, he then called Xiao Huang over.  “Captain, you were looking for me.”  “Take He Yi to the duty room, I’ll be right there.”  “Okay.”  Fan Shi Xin took a shower and changed into a new set of clothes before heading out.  He Yi had been locked up in the basement until now when he finally saw the light of day again. He appeared very disheveled, nothing like the state and appearance he had when he was locked up.  Fan Shi Xin looked at him, “Not just anyone can scheme against our family's young madam. You were even our young master's high school classmate. This time, our young madam said she would spare you this once; there will be no next time, and definitely no repetition. You can go now.”  The people detaining He Yi immediately let go of their grip.  He Yi straightened himself up, knowing it wasn't the time to show off his abilities, and left without saying anything.  Xiao Huang asked, “Captain, why did you let him go? Weren’t those people at the police station all sentenced to death? Shouldn’t he be sentenced to a few years too?”  “The young madam ordered it, but his case is different from those who are sentenced to death,” Fan Shi Xin calmly explained. “At most, he’s a coerced first-time offender who didn’t succeed in his plans, and a lesson has been taught. The other seven or eight people are agents of the Donggong family placed in S country to collect intelligence. Our country takes serious actions against such people. If He Yi was also sent from abroad, I believe our young madam would not let him off either.”  “Captain, you haven’t dried your hair yet, did you take a shower?”  “Yes, what about it?”  “You took a shower and changed clothes.” Xiao Huang asked with delight, touching his chin, “Captain, are you going on a date?”  “What, are you jealous?” He laughed, “I understand. For a perennial bachelor like you, seeing someone else going on a date is a lethal psychological blow.”  “Captain, can you not rub salt in the wound?!” Xiao Huang wailed.  “Alright, I’m leaving.” Fan Shi Xin glanced at the time and went out directly.  From the trip to R country to the discovery that Henry was missing, and until now, there were several times when Wu Pingyang asked to meet him, but he had always declined, saying he was busy and didn’t have time to go out on a date with her. So now that he suddenly had some free time, he naturally wanted to make it up to her. He was planning to go find her. Because he wanted to buy a gift for her, he didn’t call her directly.  The hospital where Wu Pingyang worked was A City's No.1 People's Hospital. Fan Shi Xin held a box of red roses in his hand. Thinking that all girls like flowers, he bought this as a gift for his girlfriend.  After reaching the second floor, he saw the sign for the dental department and went over with the gift box.  At the moment, Wu Pingyang was fitting a teenage boy with braces and didn’t notice his arrival. The other doctors saw him first and greeted him with a smile, “It's Captain Fan, isn't it?”  “Hello.”  Hearing his voice, Wu Pingyang finally looked up and saw him. She was overjoyed and said hurriedly, “I’ll be done soon, take a seat first.”  “Okay.” Fan Shi Xin sat down, noticing the surrounding doctors and assistants staring at him, making him quite uncomfortable.  This was the first time Fan Shi Xin watched his girlfriend at work. She was wearing a white coat and a blue mask, busily working with precision, which added a certain charm to her.  After she finished her work, basking in the envy of her female colleagues, she felt particularly proud and elated. She quickly removed her mask and coat, “Why are you here?”  “I’ve been quite busy these past days, so now I have some time to come see you, this is for you.”  Wu Pingyang hurriedly took the gift box, opened it, and saw it was full of red roses, joy lit up her face, “So pretty, are you free this afternoon?”  “Yes, I should be.”  “Great, I actually had a half-day off just for you, my family wants to meet you.”  Wu Pingyang covered the gift box, then gently took his hand, “Let’s go outside to talk.”  “Okay.”  The two of them went out together, and Fan Shi Xin asked, “Your family asked to meet me?”  “Yes, they asked when you are free, and they want to have a meal with you at home. I told them you were busy the past few days.”  “Then let’s go to your house this afternoon, and have dinner there in the evening.”  Seeing him agree, Wu Pingyang was thrilled. She was actually afraid he would refuse, because she had confidently assured her grandfather that he would definitely come.  “Okay, I’ll call my family right now to let them know.”  “Alright.”  Wu Pingyang immediately called her family to share the news. After hanging up, she excitedly told Fan Shi Xin, “We’re going to my grandfather's house. Have you thought about what gifts to bring?”  “Not yet.”  “My grandfather loves that famous liquor from B city, I forget the English name, but it's that very fragrant blue liquid.”  “Right, that's the one. My grandfather always talks about it. If you bring that when you go, he will be extremely happy.”  “That..." Fan Shi Xin couldn't help but remind her, “One bottle of that liquor is two hundred thousand, and it seems to be out of production now, basically a collector's item. I’m afraid it might not even be available for twenty thousand. The factory is not producing it anymore, should we consider something else?”  It was his first time meeting the girl's family, and naturally, he should bring a gift, which he understood. But to bring something so expensive, he felt it might give the wrong impression, making it seem like he was a wealthy young master who throws around money carelessly. In fact, he was not a rich young master, although he had a car and a house and earned two hundred thousand a month, but his background was not like that of Long Tianze, Ling Ci Ye, or Jin Qing Yan. His parents both worked at the Jin family's old house, working hard every day.  Hearing his words, Wu Pingyang became somewhat unhappy, “What's wrong with a bottle of wine costing two hundred thousand? My grandfather can drink it for a long time, what’s wrong with honoring him? Besides, we’re only buying it this once. After we get married, the money spent will be returned through the wedding gifts, won’t it?”  “There are many ways to honor elders, and it doesn't have to be with money.”  Fan Shi Xin directly refused, “I will take care of the gift, you don’t need to worry about it.”  Wu Pingyang was at a loss for words and after a pause asked, “Then what are you going to buy?”  “I’ll see this afternoon.” Chapter 1308: As Long As You (6)  Wu Pingyang also did not dare to easily anger him, so he did not bring up the matter again, "This time the main members of our family will probably all be present, don't be restrained when you come."  "I won't." He had seen all sorts of situations, so seeing a few people was nothing, "But why not go directly to your parents' house?"  "Mainly because my grandfather wants to meet you. My mom said to arrange for the meeting at my grandfather's house."  Wu Pingyang gave him a heads-up, "If my family brings up the topic of marriage... how do you plan to respond to them?"  "After we've dated longer and understand each other better, it's not too late to talk about marriage. I'm courting with the intention of marrying, but it can't be too hasty; after all, marriage is a lifelong matter."  Wu Pingyang nodded, "Then where shall we go now?"  "Where do you want to go?"  "Let's go to the Winnie District."  "Okay."  He took her back to the Winnie District. Just as they got out of the car, she glanced at the main villa, "Shixin, can you take me to have a look? I really want to know what Mr. Jin's house looks like."  Fan Shixin hesitated a bit, "Generally, our young master doesn't allow outsiders to go to his house, unless it's with his permission or if they are friends or something. But since you are my girlfriend, we can only have a look at the living room, upstairs is off-limits."  Not wanting to make things difficult for him, she obediently nodded, "Okay."  Fan Shixin held her hand as they walked over. Just as they reached the entrance, Wu Pingyang exclaimed as she saw the inside of the house, "Wow, it really is magnificent!"  "Come in." He stepped in first.  Wu Pingyang followed him in, looking around. The last time she came here, she only visited his residence and never dared to come here to look around.  Not knowing until she saw it, her heart was pounding; it was so luxurious. If she could be fortunate enough to live in such a house in this life, she would die without regrets!  After looking around, she still wanted to go upstairs but resisted, as she had already promised him.  After leaving, Wu Pingyang asked in a low voice, "Shixin, who was the aunt we saw just now?"  "She's Aunt Chen, she's in charge of the kitchen, responsible for cooking. Her culinary skills are top-notch."  "I see."  Seeing that it was almost noon, Fan Shixin asked her, "Do you want to have lunch here or shall I take you to a restaurant outside?"  "Let's eat here, no need to trouble going out."  "What would you like to eat?" he asked again.  "Do I have a choice of anything I want?" Wu Pingyang looked up, "I want to eat something delicious."  "Let's hear it, if possible, I will try to satisfy your wish."  "I would like to have red wine and steak."  Fan Shixin nodded, "Okay, I'll go tell the kitchen. You go wait for me in the duty room."  "Okay."  She obediently walked towards the duty room while Fan Shixin went to inform the kitchen and also called An Xiaoning.  At this time, the R country was in the middle of the night, and An Xiaoning had not yet gone to sleep.  "Madam, have you slept yet?"  "Not yet, what's up, Shixin?"  Fan Shixin thought for a moment and said, "Today my girlfriend asked me to have dinner at her house, what kind of gifts should I bring when I go?"  "You should prepare two sets, for her parents."  "It's not just her parents..." Fan Shixin coughed dryly, "She asked me to go to her grandfather's house, the Mu family."  "Isn't the first time usually to meet the parents? If you're going to her grandfather's house, then the gifts you prepare shouldn't be too simple, after all, her parents, her uncles and aunts, her grandfather and the like. I think it's best not to meet these relatives of hers until you have discussed marriage. If you have to meet them every now and then, won't you go bankrupt?"  "Today, she said her grandfather likes to drink Blueocean and asked me to buy a bottle for him, saying the old master would definitely be very happy."  "This girl, how impractical," An Xiaoning said with a laugh in her voice, "You've only just become boyfriend and girlfriend for a short while, not even married yet, there's no need for this. How about this, go to our cellar and bring a bottle of wine worth twenty or thirty thousand for her grandfather. See how many uncles she has, and bring some good cigarettes as well, and also take some for her father. One pack of cigarettes per person, fair and equal. You don't need to buy them specially, just take them from our house, that's already quite a lot. Usually, in ordinary households, the man only buys things worth a few hundred or a thousand, you're already spending tens of thousands, that should be enough."  Fan Shixin felt she made sense, "Okay, thanks madam."  "Remember to wear formal attire when you go."  "Got it."  After hanging up the phone, Fan Shixin immediately went to prepare.  He carefully packaged it with a gift bag.  Then, carrying it, he went to the duty room.  Seeing him holding a gift bag, Wu Pingyang quickly asked, "What's that?"  "Wine and cigarettes, prepared for your grandfather and your uncles."  "What about my mom and my aunts?"  Fan Shixin replied, "There's no need to buy something for everyone, it's not an engagement or a wedding, just bringing the general gifts is fine."  "How can you buy for men and not for women? What will my aunts and my mom think? Moreover, this is your first time visiting, how can you be so casual?"  "How is it casual? These are worth fifty or sixty thousand. Am I being casual if I bring gifts worth fifty or sixty thousand the first time I visit? They're quite valuable."  Fan Shixin asked, "Do you expect me to bring gifts worth over a hundred thousand the first time I visit?"  Wu Pingyang bit her lip and looked at him, "You just don't care about me. I didn't ask you to bring gifts worth tens of thousands for my mom and my aunts, but at the very least, you should buy something to show some gesture, right?"  Suppressing the different emotions in his heart, Fan Shixin said, "Fine, I'll buy some gifts on the way there."  Under normal circumstances, Wu Pingyang would have left already, but she knew she couldn't mess this up, otherwise her family would not let her off easily.  Holding back her temper, she said, "Okay, I'm hungry."  "I'll take you to eat."  "Okay."  This was Fan Shixin's first visit to the Mu family, and somehow, he did not have a good feeling about any of them: Wu Pingyang's grandfather, parents, uncles, and aunts. Their gazes seemed too revealing, as if they wanted to say something, and he could clearly see what they were expecting.  He was reserved in character and not good at speaking in front of strangers. He originally thought that he had seen all sorts of situations and meeting her family would be nothing, but when he was actually there, he realized that spending an afternoon and even an evening with a group of people who asked all sorts of questions was simply torture.  They even inquired about topics that should not be touched, from business matters to Jin Qingyan and An Xiaoning's affairs, all of which he avoided discussing. It was clear they were disappointed, not having heard particularly useful information from him. Chapter 1309: All I Want Is You (7)  Wu Pingyang looked at her grandfather with a bit of disappointment, feeling as if her face instantly lost its luster. She whispered to Fan Shixin beside her, "When grandfather asks you something, can't you just go along with his wishes? You don't say anything, which is quite boring."  Fan Shixin looked at her, sticking to his principles, "They always ask about things I cannot discuss. What can I do? There are matters that cannot be disclosed; these are my rules."  "That's no fun," Wu Pingyang muttered softly, feeling that he was completely different from the kind of man she had imagined.  "What did you say?" Fan Shixin frowned, catching a glimpse of impatience on her face in that moment.  "Nothing."  Fan Shixin wanted to leave immediately, but since he had come, he endured and stayed until the evening.  During the meal, people at the table kept toasting him. Even though he could hold his liquor well, drinking a lot inevitably led to some drunkenness. He repeatedly waved his hands saying he could not drink anymore, as he had driven there, but Wu Pingyang's uncle insisted that a servant could drive him back, and under their enthusiastic toasting, he drank glass after glass.  Eventually, feeling really uncomfortable in his stomach, he firmly refused to drink any more. As Jin Qingyan's right-hand man, he always adhered to one principle: in such environments, he absolutely could not become unconscious.  His concerns were legitimate; when Wu Pingyang's mother suggested he stay at the Mu family's place, he immediately sobered up a bit and persistently declined.  No matter what the Mu family said, he firmly refused. Seeing that he really wouldn't consent, the Mu family had no choice but to have someone drive his car to take him back, and they instructed Wu Pingyang to take care of him.  Wu Pingyang followed him into the car, and the car returned to the Vinci community. Fan Shixin leaned back in his seat, keeping his eyes closed, his consciousness somewhat hazy. But he was not completely unconscious.  By the time they reached home, Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai helped him out of the car. He squinted at Wu Pingyang and said, "You should go back..."  "You've had too much to drink; I'll stay with you to take care of you."  "Sister-in-law, we are here, we'll take care of him; sister-in-law, you go back," Xiao Bai said with a grin. As soon as he spoke, Xiao Huang slapped him, "What are you saying?"  Wu Pingyang, thinking of maintaining her pure and innocent image in front of Fan Shixin, nodded, got back into the car, and instructed through the window, "Give him some sobering soup."  "Okay, sister-in-law, take care."  Seeing the car leave, Xiao Huang said, "Why did you let sister-in-law go when she wanted to stay? You idiot."  "Didn't you see our captain telling her to go? It means our captain doesn't want her to stay here."  Xiao Huang asked Fan Shixin, "Captain, why did you drink so much?"  "They kept pouring drinks... my stomach feels awful... ugh..." He couldn't hold it in, and vomited on the spot. The vomiting made him feel much better, and his rationality also recovered a bit.  Xiao Bai called someone to clean up, and with Xiao Huang, they took him back to his room. After asking the kitchen to prepare sobering soup and having him drink it, the two left.  Fan Shixin slept for two or three hours, and when he woke up, apart from a severe headache, the drunkenness had largely subsided, and he didn't feel like sleeping anymore.  He got up, washed up, changed into clean clothes, and left the house. It was already eleven o'clock at night.  It was Xiao Bai's turn to be on the night shift. Seeing that he had gotten up, Xiao Bai yawned, "Captain, why are you up?"  "My head hurts, I can't sleep," his voice was very hoarse.  "If I had known, I wouldn't have suggested that sister-in-law go back. If she had stayed to accompany you, you definitely wouldn't have been unable to sleep, and you would have slept soundly," Xiao Bai winked at him, "Right, Captain?"  "Cut it out, don't casually call her sister-in-law, we're not married yet."  "What does that matter? Our young madam isn't remarried to our young master yet, and we still call her young madam directly. Captain, are you shy? Stop being pretentious, sister-in-law didn't say anything."  Fan Shixin instructed him, "Weren't you sleeping during the day? How come you look so listless now? Perk up."  "Yes, Captain!" Xiao Bai shook himself, opening his eyes wide, trying to muster his energy.  Fan Shixin stretched out his hand to grab the mouse and scanned the surveillance of the community. While checking, he unexpectedly found that the lights in his own house were still on.  At this hour, why hasn't she slept yet?  "How has Miss Mu been these past few days when you guys delivered her meals?"  "Quite good, but Miss Mu doesn't let us deliver meals to her anymore."  "Hm?" Fan Shixin asked, "Why?"  "Miss Mu said it was quite a hassle for us to deliver three meals to her every day. She hopes we could deliver her groceries so she could cook for herself and pass the time. So today, we have already filled her refrigerator, which should be enough for Miss Mu to eat for two or three days."  Fan Shixin hummed in response and turned to leave the duty room. It started to drizzle outside.  He left the main door and went to his own house. After entering the password, Fan Shixin slowly walked in, even the sound of closing the door seemed somewhat soft.  Arriving at the door of the guest bedroom, he politely knocked. Inside, her voice came through, "Who is it?"  "It's me."  "Come in."  Fan Shixin pushed open the door and saw her sitting on the bed, embroidering a cross-stitch, "Why haven't you rested yet?"  "I can't sleep."  Mu Wansheng smelled a faint scent of alcohol on him, "You've been drinking?"  "I took a shower, brushed my teeth, can you still smell it?"  "It's faint, but I can still smell it. It looks like you drank quite a bit."  "I went to your house this afternoon, and had dinner there. Your family almost got me drunk."  Mu Wansheng put the cross-stitch on the table, "Is it about an engagement?"  "No, Pingyang said your grandfather wanted to see me, so I went."  "It must have cost a lot of money, right?" Mu Wansheng looked at him with certainty in her tone.  "The young madam asked me to bring a bottle of wine and some expensive cigarettes from the warehouse, each worth twenty to thirty thousand."  Mu Wansheng took a deep breath, "Captain Fan, do you like Pingyang?"  Fan Shixin stared into her eyes, "I suppose I do."  The words Mu Wansheng wanted to say got stuck in her throat. She didn't want to be nosy, yet she didn't want someone who was kind to her to get hurt, "Pingyang marrying you is what all the Mu family elders want to see, except for my mother. To be precise, it's something my grandfather is very much looking forward to. Pingyang is not entirely sincere with you; she has an ulterior motive towards you."  As she spoke, her hands were continuously fidgeting with her blanket, yet her tone was very gentle.  "Things like seeking a marriage alliance are all about conditions." Fan Shixin was already well aware of this, "That's why I don't have any plans to get married right now. I'll make a decision after getting to know and spending more time with her." Chapter 1310: As Long As It's You (8)  Mu Wansheng smiled gently, "Captain Fan is so nice, Pingyang will see your good side."  "Do you really think I'm good?"  "Of course, you are the best person to me in the world."  Fan Shixin didn't expect her to use the words 'the world,' and his lips curled into a smile, "What if I don't want Pingyang, but want you instead?"  Mu Wansheng looked at him in astonishment, "Captain..."  Seeing her like this, Fan Shixin suddenly laughed out loud, "Scared? I was just teasing you."  Mu Wansheng lowered her eyes, "It's getting late, Captain. You should go back and rest early, I'm sleepy."  Fan Shixin put away his smile, "Mm, good night."  "Good night." Mu Wansheng slowly lay down, stretched out her hand, and turned off the light.  He then closed the door behind him.  She reached out to touch her face, which was burning hot. Just now, she had actually taken his joke seriously, feeling somewhat embarrassed and ashamed. How could she not distinguish a joke? Was she too foolish?  He is Pingyang's boyfriend, and in the future, he will be her cousin's husband.  Thinking of the words 'cousin's husband,' Mu Wansheng's eyes dimmed. After she recovered from her injury, she would ultimately have to return to the Mu family. After all, she couldn't hide in a room forever without going out; she would need to earn money and pay off debts. Sooner or later, the Mu family would discover her.   Just thinking about those things made her realize how precious it was to be able to live here at the moment, without worrying about food or anything else.  What she always longed for was a warm home. So it didn't matter if her boyfriend had no money; as long as he was good to her, she was willing to work hard with him for their future.  Now, she had nothing.  All her hopes were extinguished.  Mu Wansheng closed her eyes, and a tear slowly trickled down the corner of her eye.  ---  When An Xiaoning, Henry, Wu Lianzhi, and Xiao Chenyang returned, it was already dawn. Stepping back onto the land of the Vini community, they all felt a strong sense of security. Indeed, An Xiaoning had come to regard this place as her home, no, it was her home.  After arranging guest rooms for Wu Lianzhi and Xiao Chenyang, An Xiaoning went upstairs with Henry. As soon as she entered the bedroom, she kicked off her slippers and pounced onto the big, soft bed, "Ah, this is so comfortable."  "You've already slept for so long, do you still want to sleep?"  "No, I want to remove my makeup, apply a face mask, and have a good lie down to calm my mind and think about how to solve the things that come next."  Henry went to shower, and by the time he came out in his bathrobe, she was already lying on the bed, legs up, leisurely applying a face mask.  He walked over, toweling his hair, and started using her skincare products at her vanity.  "Your skin is better than mine without any care, why are you applying that?"  "Do I have to wait until I'm old to apply it?"  An Xiaoning reminded him, "You won't get old, you will live a very, very long time, so you don't need to worry about that."  He took it as a joke, "If I don't get old, then you're the one who'll suffer. I'll stay young while you become a wrinkly old woman in your seventies or eighties."  Her eyes shot him a sharp look, hearing his disdain, "Then you'll be disappointed because I won't grow old or die either."  "That's such a wonderful wish."  "I'm telling the truth, okay?"  "Oh, truly."  "It is true!"  He patted his face and walked over, nodding at her with insincere agreement, "I said it's true."  Seeing him wanting to sit down, An Xiaoning stretched out her leg and placed it right on the edge of the bed.  Seeing this, he actually sat right on her leg.  "Ah!!!" An Xiaoning turned to the side and kicked his neck with her other foot, "The bed is mine, go sleep on your sofa."  "Is your name written on it?"  "If you lie down here, I’ll touch you, kiss you, and do that to you."  "Go ahead, as long as you don't want to be thrown against the wall again by me." He flipped her leg to one side and lay down smoothly.  "Henry, you're showing some spirit, some spirit indeed."  "Even a cornered rabbit will jump over a wall."  An Xiaoning got out of bed, opened a drawer, took out a very thin needle, and then grabbed his hand, pricking him with it before he could react.  He wanted to retract his hand, but the next moment, she took his hand and put it in her mouth.  Henry stared at her in shock, "What are you doing, pricking me?!"  "Drinking your blood."  "...... Crazy."  An Xiaoning took his hand out of her mouth, didn't care, and just lay back down on the bed.  Henry looked at his hand, shiny with saliva, and showed a disgusted expression. He got up and went to the washroom to wash his hand before coming back out.  "That's disgusting."  "How come it didn't disgust you to death."  "That's called being disgusted?" An Xiaoning smiled mischievously, leaning close to him, "I'll tell you something even more disgusting, and I guarantee you'll be silent for a minute."  "I don't want to hear it."  "Just listen, it's something you did."  "I said I don't want to hear it." He felt it wasn't anything good, so he firmly refused, but his refusal was useless, as the person who wanted to speak would still say what they wanted to say.  An Xiaoning's lips moved lightly, and then she said something.  This remark made Henry want to explode; his face nearly turned into a tomato, "You're talking nonsense; I don't believe that."  An Xiaoning got out of bed and left the room.  Ten minutes later, she came back.  She took her phone, got into bed, and said, "You don't believe it, I'll show you the surveillance footage."  Henry's heart was torn with conflict and curiosity.  So he took the phone from her hand and ran off to the bathroom by himself.  An Xiaoning watched his actions with amusement, murmuring to herself, "Shouldn't have disbelieved me, the evidence is solid."  Henry never imagined his body would do such a thing; it was hard for him to believe and yet he felt almost completely exposed to An Xiaoning in an instant.  He knew his body must have had many encounters with An Xiaoning, as the child was the best proof.  But he didn't expect that he would personally serve her. And even allow her to record it!  His head felt like it would explode in that moment.  He quickly deleted the video, then came out glaring.  An Xiaoning reached out her hand, he put the phone in her hand, and didn't want to say another word.  Seeing that he had deleted the video, she calmly said, "The video was originally on my computer; this was a copy."  "Do you plan to let a computer expert take it and then let the whole world see it?" He glanced at her sideways, somewhat worried.   Chapter 1311: All You Need (9)  "Of course not, this video was taken on a whim when we were in high spirits. It was later saved in a hidden file on the computer. However, I already deleted it when I copied it just now. Look how nervous I made you." Hearing her say this, Henry finally calmed down. Even though he clearly saw his own body having an indescribable relationship with her, he had no memory of it whatsoever, and even less of an idea of what it felt like.  "Such a player."  "Isn't that normal?" An Xiao Ning propped her head with one hand as she looked at him, "Do you want to continue sleeping, or do you want to get up?"  "What about you?"  "I can't sleep anymore; I'll be getting up soon."  "Then you get up, I want to sleep."  "......"  ---  Ideals are plump, reality is boney; Henry wanted to sleep but didn't get his wish.   At breakfast, when everyone was in their places, Wu Lianzhi, because he was at someone else's home, didn't appear as relaxed as the others, showing a bit of restraint.  Everyone was enjoying their meal when Long Tianze came over humming a tune.  "Hello, my dear friends, I'm here."  Xiao Chen Yang saw him and subconsciously glanced at An Xiao Ning. An Xiao Ning received his signal and the two shared a tacit smile.  "What's so special about you coming?" The one who spoke was Henry.  "Of course, I missed you!"  "Scram."  Long Tianze was not surprised and just shrugged, "I haven't eaten yet, let me join the meal. Aunt Chen, get me a pair of chopsticks."  "Alright."  This was Long Tianze, always like this in front of friends.  Long Tianze took the chopsticks from Aunt Chen and happily sat down to eat together.  "Who is this?" He looked up at Wu Lianzhi.  "Hello, I am Wu Lianzhi."  "Long Tianze." As soon as he said his name, Wu Lianzhi was stunned.  He remembered the name Long Tianze very well and couldn't help but give him a few more glances.  Noticing his frequent glances, Long Tianze jokingly asked, "Why keep looking at me? Do you fancy me?"  Wu Lianzhi dryly laughed, "No, you just look like a good man."  Pleased with the compliment, Long Tianze's smile almost split his face, "Of course, I'm the number one good man in S country, right, Qing Yan?"  Henry bluntly said, "You've blown all the bulls away, you're so narcissistic you've almost forgotten your own last name."  "Do I need to brag? This is a fact. Sister-in-law, tell me, have I not been good to our Yangyang? Whatever she says, I don't object. If she says go west, I definitely won't say go east."  "Mm, I admit, Long Shao is really beyond reproach to Yangyang."  An Xiao Ning agreed with him, "Whether or not you're the number one good man in S country, at the very least, you are a good man in front of Yangyang."  "Did you hear that, Xiao Jinzi?"  Henry didn't argue and quietly ate his meal.  After breakfast, Xiao Chen Yang had Wu Hai Gang, the elder of the Wu family, brought over. Then he asked An Xiao Ning, "He's supposed to be quite powerful in witchcraft, but he doesn't actually have any real skills. However, I think if handled correctly, he should be able to lift the curse on you and Qing Yan. Do you have any good methods to make him willing to do it?"  "People only care about their own life after all. But it depends on whether he still wants to live or not. He probably knows that even if he helps us lift the curse, he won't survive. After all, to lift the curse, he would need to know our birth dates and time, and if he knows that, how could we let him live? Therefore, this method is destined not to work. Thus, it might be more appropriate to exchange with another method."  Xiao Chen Yang listened attentively, "What?"  "His family. We both clearly understand the fundamental reason why his family changed their names and moved to R country. For a family, changing their original surname is already extremely difficult, so the descendants are much more important than anything else."  Xiao Chen Yang agreed with her, "What you said makes sense, let's execute it this way. Anyway, his so-called family is just that. If what they were originally good at no longer exists, what's the difference from ordinary people? But, aren't you going to check the other side?"  An Xiao Ning nodded, "I was just about to go, you wait here."  "Alright."  When An Xiao Ning went to the other side, Long Tianze and Wu Lianzhi were chatting in the living room, and Mei Yangyang was not in sight.  "Long Shao, where's Yangyang?"  "She went to the studio early in the morning; she said she wanted to talk to the two boys and a girl selected from the school."  She nodded, "So that's how it is. What are you two big men chatting about?"  "Nothing much, just some topics between men."  Long Tianze said with a grin, "I found that Brother Wu here is quite humorous."  "Humorous?" Her eyes rolled, she didn't see how Wu Lianzhi was humorous.  "Yeah, sister-in-law, he's quite humorous."  "When will Yangyang be back?"  "Should be soon, she didn't even have breakfast before she left, said she would eat when she comes back."  An Xiao Ning glanced at the time and sat down directly, "Lianzhi, do you know? Tianze and Yangyang's daughter and my son are betrothed."  Wu Lianzhi nodded, "He just told me, but it's quite traditional to arrange a marriage for such young children."  "I really like our little meat bun, Xiao Xi, chubby and cute just like Yangyang, so lovable."  Long Tianze expressed his pride, his eyes brimming with joy, "That's right, that's my little sweetheart, you can't not like her."  "Tsk tsk tsk, just mentioning his little padded jacket, look how happy he is."  Wu Lianzhi smiled and nodded, "I can see that, Brother Long, your family is truly very happy."  "Of course."  An Xiao Ning was a bit disdainful, "I say, you two, can you not call each other by those names?"  "Is there a problem?"  "Of course, there is a problem. Long Shao, when you call him Brother Wu, those who don't know might think you're saying 'no chest', and Lianzhi, when you call him Brother Long, others might also mistakenly think you're saying 'breast augmentation'. You two are really a perfect match, it’s only the first time you've met today... is it because both of you have no chest that you're going together for augmentation?"  After her analysis, both men couldn't help but laugh, a point that neither of them had thought about.  Half an hour later, Mei Yangyang returned.  She was wearing jeans and an off-white sweater, carrying a bag as she came in.  "Husband, I'm back."  "Yeah, wife, we have a guest at home."  "Who is it?" Mei Yangyang asked as she changed her shoes and looked towards the so-called guest on the sofa.  After a glance, she hesitated, "This is..."  "He's my friend, Wu Lianzhi. Your Tianze hit it off with him on their first meeting today."  Mei Yangyang came in with a smile, "He's the sociable type."   Chapter 1312: As Long As You (10)  Wu Lianzhi looked at her, and although he really couldn't recall any memories associated with her, he always felt a special affection when he saw her. "Hello," he said.  Mei Yangyang replied, "Hello."  ...  On the way back from that place, An Xiaoning observed that Wu Lianzhi remained very composed and asked, "How do you feel?"  "I feel pretty good. Seeing her so happy truly makes me happy," he said.  An Xiaoning patted his shoulder, "It's okay. You will also be happy. It's just that there was a connection in the previous life but not in this one. Plan well for your future. Tell me what job you want to do, and if I can help arrange it for you, I will."  Wu Lianzhi entered the main gate with her, "I can feel it. Her husband is really a good person. Living with such an optimistic man, it's hard to have a bad life. I'm very relieved and comforted. As for my future, I want to live a stable life and find a girl who can bring me happiness to share life with. But to meet a nice girl, first I need to go to places where there are many girls, right?"  An Xiaoning agreed, "That's the idea, yes."  Not long after returning, Wu Haigang was brought before them.  An Xiaoning looked at the man before her. He seemed to be in his thirties or forties and didn't look old at all. "Hello, Mr. Wu, I believe you are very familiar with this person. He used to be one of the Wu family just like you."  He raised his eyes, his gaze cold, "He doesn't deserve to be a member of my Wu family."  "Ah... and you do?" An Xiaoning stared at him, "Let me tell you, today, you're in our hands, and you have no choice. Your life has already been worthless. The key is whether you want your entire Wu family and their descendants to be buried with you?"  "Including him?" he pointed at Wu Lianzhi.  "No, although he has changed his surname back to Wu, he's no longer a member of your family. So, no, he's not included. Mr. Wu, you should be very clear about my identity by now. A wealthy clan in Country R really isn't much. One bomb thrown over, and probably many will die, right? The state of Country R is currently unstable, with the situation turbulent. So now, it's up to you whether you want to lift our curse or to protect your clan members. It's your call."  "You..." he asked, "How can I trust you? Trust that you won't go back on your word?"  "You don't have a choice," An Xiaoning clearly told him. "Do you think I've forgotten about your clan's scheme to kill me? A wealthy clan trying to assassinate a person from another country, and especially me - do you think my country would not negotiate with Country R? If I want to, I have many ways to make your family pay back double and wipe them out. You'd like to see that with your own eyes, right?"  Wu Haigang closed his eyes, with nothing else to say.  Indeed, if he died, that was one thing, but if the entire clan was wiped out, he would be the sinner of the Wu family, unable to face his ancestors after death.  This time, he had truly fallen.  ---  "Er Lan sister, I heard that Jing Shui has finished his scenes and is leaving today."  "Whether he finishes his scenes or not, what difference does it make?" Fang Erlan applied lipstick lightly to her lips, "Other than being more diligent when he first joined the crew, he hardly ever came to the set later on. I heard from the director that a lot of his scenes were completed by a stand-in. Using a stand-in so frequently for a supporting role number five, if it were his brother's crew, I don't think it would fly."  "Of course, Director Jing Tian has high demands, he wouldn't allow such frequent use of a stand-in."  Xiao Yue said so, "By the way, Er Lan sister, when is cousin coming back?"  "Should be soon."  "Ah, I'm craving. When cousin is here, he thinks of ways to buy you all kinds of delicious food every day, and I get to enjoy it too, to please my taste buds."  "Little foodie." Fang Erlan stood up from the chair, "Let's go."  "Ah." Xiao Yue picked up her bag and followed her out, with numerous bodyguards watching her leave and following suit.  Her entrance was quite queen-like.  You should know that Yu Caivei only brought three or four bodyguards, whereas she forcefully brought eight bodyguards.  Walking like this, they formed a long queue.  The event they were attending was a promotional activity for a TV drama, a fan meeting.  Most of the attendees were female fans of Yan Ge, and her fans were obviously few.  Although she had some popularity, it was mainly due to the announcement of her relationship with Yan Ge. With two dramas not yet aired, where would she have fans from?  But what she didn't know was that her fans did come, indeed around ten or twenty people.  A few hundred people, and only ten or twenty fans, that's really...  The event lasted for about half an hour, and just when it was about to end, an accident happened.  When Fang Erlan was about to go down, when she was closest to those present, a man in his fifties suddenly lunged at her. He didn't lunge normally, because the bodyguards were blocking, he dived under the bodyguard's arm and grabbed Fang Erlan.  In that instant, there was chaos at the scene.  Fang Erlan fell onto the bodyguard on the inside.  The bodyguard on the outside almost instinctively pulled her away, as fast as lightning, and threw the man to the ground, causing the crowd to step back. The man in his fifties fell hard.  Fang Erlan stood up, still somewhat shaken, but she quickly and composedly left the area.  Xiao Yue was furious, and once they got back to the nanny car, she started swearing, "Damn it, that old man is tired of living, isn't he? If cousin were here, he would have dislocated his arm."  Fang Erlan calmed down and said nothing.  Seeing her silent, Xiao Yue thought she was in a bad mood and hurriedly comforted her, "Er Lan sister, it's okay. Didn't you see our bodyguard brother throw that old man out?"  "Xiao Yue, what do you want to do in the future?"  Xiao Yue was taken aback by her question, "Huh? What do I want to do in the future?"  "I still want to continue working with you."  "What if I leave the entertainment industry?"  Xiao Yue looked at her, "Then I still want to follow Er Lan sister."  "If I leave the entertainment industry, Xiao Yue, you won't be able to follow me. Isn't your family's situation quite ordinary too? You once said your biggest wish is to have your own house in A City, right?"  "Yeah, but with the housing prices so high, I can't afford it with a few thousand a month."  "How much do you have in savings?" Fang Erlan asked.  "Over thirty thousand."  "How about I buy you a one-bedroom apartment?"   Xiao Yue was stunned, "Sister, that's not right. Even the cheapest one-bedroom apartment costs at least one to two million. I haven't been with sister for long, you shouldn't be so good to me." Chapter 1313: As Long As You (11)  "Really don't want it?" "Don't want it," Xiao Yue answered, "It's not easy for you to earn money either, Er Lan sister. You work hard every day. Keep it for yourself, I believe that one day I will manage to save enough money for a down payment."  Fang Er Lan didn't say anything more. When she returned to the hotel to rest, she sat on the bed alone browsing online real estate listings.  Xiao Yue had not been with her for a very long time, but it had also been about a year.  They were almost together every day, but that would no longer be the case once she retired from the entertainment industry.  She wanted to do something for Xiao Yue.  After all, Xiao Yue had always been particularly good to her, caring for her, looking after her.  When the doorbell rang, she had already scouted several neighborhoods.  There was a bodyguard on duty at the door, so she didn't need to check the peephole and just opened the door directly. Seeing the man at the door, Fang Er Lan's eyebrows were tinged with a smile, "You're back?"  "Mm." He entered, closing the door behind him.  He picked her up horizontally and walked inside, "What are you doing?"  "Looking at houses."  "Looking at houses?" Xiao Chen Yang put her down on the bed, his eyes glancing over to the notebook on the small table.  "One bedroom, one living room?" He was puzzled, "Our house needs to be a bit bigger to be good."  "It's not for us, it's for Xiao Yue."  Xiao Chen Yang took off his shoes, "Does she have the money to buy a house?"  "Of course, I want to buy it for her."  "That's fine."  He sat next to her, stretching out his hand to wrap around her shoulder, "But which one have you taken a liking to?"  "Look, this one, this one, and this one," she said, pointing them out with the mouse.  "I think the one in Sanqiao is not bad, the ventilation and lighting are pretty good. By the way, isn't An Xiao Ning's house there? Let's choose this one."  Seeing that he said it was good, Fang Er Lan decided on this one and wrote down the homeowner's contact information. Then she asked, "Should we also settle our own house? It will take a while for renovation, and after the house is renovated, we can't move in immediately, we need to let it air out for a few months."  "There's no need to go through the trouble of redecorating, just buy one that's already been nicely renovated. I asked Captain Fan, and there's a fully furnished villa for sale in the Vini neighborhood, the price is also quite fair, let's buy it."  "Villa?" Fang Er Lan inquired, "Is it similar to the one Yang Yang sister's family has?"  "Pretty much."  "Then let's buy it."  "Alright."  "Today, during the event, an old man took advantage of me and knocked me down."  Seeing the fire in his eyes suddenly ignited, she added, "Luckily our bodyguard is top-notch, he threw him out the next second."  Fang Er Lan put away the computer and the small table, then sat back down next to him, facing him seriously, "To be honest, have you missed me these past few days?"  "I haven't missed you, I missed Fang Xiaogou."  She feigned anger, "You're the puppy."  He hugged her and lay down, "Alright alright, I'm the puppy, you're the woman who sleeps with the puppy."  "......" Fang Er Lan reached out and pinched him, "Can't you speak properly?"  "I can... Mrs. Xiao."  Fang Er Lan was finally satisfied and asked, "Is everything taken care of?"  "Almost, but it's quite amusing."  He turned his body, "Allow me to recount the details to you."  "Alright, I'm all ears."  ——  Hospital.  An Xiao Ning and Henry came to the hospital together to see Mr. Jin.  Hearing from Fan Shi Xin that Mr. Jin had woken up and was no longer in any danger, only needing to rest well in the hospital, Henry didn't really want to come, but An Xiao Ning insisted on bringing him.  When the two entered the hospital room, Mr. Jin was reading the newspaper. Seeing them, he couldn't help but hum, "It's been so many days and you, as his son, are only coming to see me now, is that acceptable?"  Henry didn't mince words in his reply, "It's already not easy for me to come see you, what more do you want?"  "What do you mean 'not easy'? I'm your dad!"  "You know you're my dad?" Henry's attitude was cold and he didn't want to engage further, "When will you learn to be well-behaved?"  Mr. Jin was choked with anger and stopped talking, putting the newspaper aside on the bedside.  "Uncle, are you feeling better?" An Xiao Ning put down the fruit, and asked.  "Mm, much better."  "Qing Yan has been unwell these few days and hasn't come to see you, but he's been thinking of you. It's just, uncle, can you refrain from going to the casino from now on? I remember you never used to frequent the casino. If you find life boring now, you can join some peers for travel or participate in recreational activities, that would be more substantial."  Mr. Jin let out a heavy sniff, "What's the point of mingling with those strangers I don't know. It's meaningless."  "Yes, losing money is meaningful," Henry retorted, "Lying in the hospital, you can't gamble now, can you?"  "You're not happy unless you're arguing with me, are you?" Mr. Jin was indignant, "If you have nothing else to say, then go, everyone go."  Henry didn't hesitate, grabbed An Xiao Ning's arm, and walked away.  Outside the room, he let go of her arm and said, "I told you there was no need to see him, but you insisted."  "You have to come and see when your dad is in the hospital, so as to avoid harsh words from others, it's better to come and see."  He was impatient, "Seeing him, I'd rather go see the family's Wang Cai and Fu Gui."  "......" An Xiao Ning was speechless, "Alright, we've seen him, let's go back."  In any case, they had seen Mr. Jin at the hospital.  But there was one more place to go.  When he noticed that she wasn't driving in the direction back to the Vini neighborhood, he asked, "Where are you going?"  "To the Devil's Training Camp."  He didn't say anything else, letting the car drive into the courtyard of the Devil's Training Camp.  On the way, An Xiao Ning bought gifts for the children, including two for Long Tian Ze's children, one for each.  The kids were all delighted.  Returning from there, it was already an hour later.  Wu Hai Gang had already promised to lift their curse, but it would have to wait until Jin Qing Yan's birthday, October 16th.  It was coming soon, so there was no rush for these few days.  Therefore, Wu Hai Gang was temporarily detained.  She also made a special request for someone to check on Wu Lian Zhi's information abroad. Initially, she had thought about transferring her household registration to Country S, but unexpectedly, it was directly canceled there, saving some trouble.  He specifically went to the Public Security Bureau to apply for his household registration.  Since An Xiao Ning had already made a call, his application was processed there.  When he returned, he found An Xiao Ning waiting for him, drinking coffee.  "I nearly forgot something."  "What?"  "You still haven't answered my question about why, initially, you instructed your people here to get my hair."  Upon this question, he was somewhat embarrassed. Chapter 1314: As Long As You (12)  "Actually, I didn't want to tell you at first, mainly because after I saw that mural, I had a very bold idea in my mind."  "What idea?"  "I want to get a DNA test on your hair to see if there's any blood relation between us."  "Pfft." An Xiaoning never expected this reason.  "That's why I didn't tell you, I was afraid you would be disgusted."  "There's nothing to be disgusted about."  As she finished speaking, Xiao Lv's voice came from outside the door, "Young Madam, people from the Donggong family abroad have arrived, they are at the main gate."  She had anticipated their arrival but didn't expect them to come so quickly.  "Let them in."  "Okay."  "Should I... avoid them for a bit?" he asked.  "No need, why avoid anything, still afraid of them?"  "That's not it."  An Xiaoning waved to the servant, "Make me another cup of coffee."  "Okay, Young Madam."  The people from the Donggong family were several sons of the old patriarch and a few grandsons.  Without exception, those who came were fairly prominent men of the Donggong family, and all were male.  "Please take a seat."  Six or seven people sat down, one after another, and the first to speak was the eldest son of the old patriarch, "Miss An, the purpose of our visit this time is, first, to formally apologize to you, and second, to hope that you can release our family elder."  "I accept the apology, but releasing your family elder? Where does that come from? I don't even know your family elder. Who is he? What does he look like? What's his name?"  Wu Lianzhi didn't expect her to deny it outright, and seemed to guess why she did it, so he didn't say anything and just quietly sat there.  However, the men from the Donggong family were a bit stunned, not expecting her to deny it outright.  "Miss An, let's not beat around the bush. We have come to understand that the elder is with you."  "Do you have evidence?"  "This..." The men exchanged looks, "But we are certain that he is with you."  "Sorry, baseless claims don't count. Without evidence, what are you so sure about?" She wouldn't give them any chance to grasp anything on her, "You can't just throw dirt on someone."  "Miss An." The second eldest of the Donggong spoke up, "Make a condition, as long as you release the person, no matter what condition you set, we will agree to it."  "Do I need to repeat myself?" Her expression remained calm, "I really didn't take away your so-called family elder."  However, they didn't believe her words; they knew she was just not admitting it.  Seeing that she was neither soft nor hard, the men didn't know what to do next.  Of course, they didn't know that An Xiaoning was planning to make them take a fruitless trip because she would never let Wu Haigang live in the future.  "Miss An..." After nearly a minute of silence, the eldest of the Donggong finally spoke, "If you are willing to release our elder, our Donggong family is willing to pledge loyalty to you, these are my father's original words."  Wu Lianzhi froze completely.  "Why would your father..." She didn't finish her sentence, leaving it half-said.  "Our Donggong family has long lost the art of witchcraft; the elder is the only clan member who knows it. If he's not around, there's no hope of revival."  "Revival?" An Xiaoning asked with a smile, "To let you carry forward the witchcraft and continue to harm people?"  "That's not what I meant."  An Xiaoning was not moved by his words at all, "Really sorry, but I really didn't take away your elder, and I don't know who he is. I apologize, but if there's nothing else, please leave; we won't keep you."  She directly issued an eviction order.  The Donggong family's delegation was suddenly out of options, even after having played their trump card, seeing that she remained unmoved, they were truly at a loss.  Just like that.  The eldest of the Donggong reluctantly knelt down.  "What are you doing? I really haven't seen your family elder, are you expecting me to perform magic and make him appear?"  "..."  In the end, they left. Empty-handed.  Without a single solution.  The living room quieted down, and An Xiaoning looked at Wu Lianzhi, who was expressionless, and asked, "Do you think I'm also heartless?"  "Not at all." Wu Lianzhi sincerely said to her, "I understand your considerations, and you did the right thing from your standpoint. I have already left the Donggong family, so this is someone else's business, and I have no comment."  "When the curse is lifted, this matter can be considered completely over. To be honest, after it's resolved, the person I should thank the most is you. If it wasn't for you taking the initiative to contact me, I wouldn't have known about your existence, or even if I did, it might have taken a long time. If it wasn't for you, I couldn't have learned about these things so quickly. Do you know, Xiao Chenyang once looked for the descendants of the Wu family but couldn't find any trace. After so many years, it's not so easy to find. We originally thought it was very likely that they had become extinct due to backlash."  "I'm also very happy to have been able to help you solve this matter so coincidentally. Fate is really wonderful, bringing us together in such a way."  When Henry came down from upstairs, he happened to see An Xiaoning and Wu Lianzhi smiling at each other. Standing at the stairway, he casually called to An Xiaoning, "Come up here, I have something to tell you."  "What is it?"  "Come up and you'll know." Saying that, he turned and went up first. An Xiaoning really thought he had something to tell her, but after following him up, she learned he didn't have anything at all.  "You said you had something, are you fooling me?"  "So what if I'm fooling you?"  An Xiaoning was speechless, glancing at him, "Alright, if you're happy, I'll go back down."  "Hold on."  "What now?"  "When are you going to let that guy leave?"  "He'll stay here for now, we'll talk about it after some time." An Xiaoning thought they should at least wait until the curse was lifted and Wu Lianzhi's household registration was approved before making arrangements for him.  "After some time?" Henry was unhappy, "I think having an unfamiliar man in the house makes me very uncomfortable."  "Then just be uncomfortable, you'll get over it."  "An Xiaoning, this is my territory!"  "So you admit you are Qing Yan?" she approached him.  "Who says we're not the same person? Isn't that the way it's always been?"  "That's convenient." She sat down on the bed, her hands lightly supporting herself behind her, "I have a special need right now, and I hope you can satisfy me."  Henry's mouth twitched, "Here you go again..."  "What do you mean again? Isn't this very normal? Henry, I think it's necessary for us to communicate well physically. I hope you can sincerely feel my suggestion." Chapter 1315: As Long As You (13)  "No need." An Xiaoning directly turned and walked away, his voice calling out from behind, "Where are you going?"  "To die a death."  "......"  An Xiaoning came downstairs to find that Wu Lianzhi was no longer below. She sat on the sofa and turned on the TV, which was broadcasting an archaeological documentary. It happened to feature an interview with Wang Jinsheng. Staring at the TV screen, An Xiaoning relaxed and watched for a few minutes before making a phone call to Pan Zhenghui.  "Chief Pan, it's me."  "Ah... Xiaoning."  "Is the archaeological team still led by Captain Wang Jinsheng?"  "Yes, but I was just about to contact you about him in these two days. Ever since you mentioned his connection with tomb raiding, I've been secretly investigating him, and now we have results."  This was somewhat unexpected for An Xiaoning. "You're quite efficient at your job."  "What are you talking about? How could I not take seriously what you've said?" said Pan Zhenghui. "It's too much to explain in a few words. Xiaoning, why don't you stop by the station?"  "Okay, I'll come over now."  "Alright, good."  As she spoke, she turned off the TV.  Pan Zhenghui had organized the materials well by the time An Xiaoning arrived, and he had even brewed tea, "Come, Xiaoning, try this new tea I bought. Sit down, let's talk slowly."  An Xiaoning took it and sat opposite him. "What's the situation?"  "According to the investigation, this Captain Wang, ah, it's really disappointing. You can't tell normally, but a check reveals his true colors. Captain Wang hasn't been in contact with He Yi for very long, but he has dealings with those traffickers who sell national artifacts. We found that he privately sold items that should have been turned over to the state, making quite a bit of money secretly."  An Xiaoning didn't know what to say. "Then continue the thorough investigation, and deal with the punishment fairly and justly."  "Yes, of course."  "Also, keep an eye on He Yi, he's an old hand at tomb raiding. Monitor him. If he dares to continue tomb raiding domestically, you'll handle it."  "Okay, I got it."  An Xiaoning then asked, "Has there been no one found to replace Officer Yuan Mingzhu in the special team?"  Speaking of this, Pan Zhenghui couldn't help but sigh, "If I had found someone, I would have told you. It's not that easy. We haven't found anyone suitable. Just the other day, we found one, but he was a charlatan who really thought he was a sage. Xiaoning, come back, even if it's just to help investigate a case from time to time, okay? There are cases from ten or twenty years ago that are still unsolved. There are no outsiders here, I'll only tell you, some cases, if you don't take them on, will remain unsolved for life, no one else can solve them. It's not that there's insufficient evidence, it's just that our rank is too low to take action."  "What do you mean?"  "Do you really not understand what I mean?" Pan Zhenghui lowered his voice to the lowest, "The backgrounds of some perpetrators are too strong, and cases can only be left unresolved."  "Let's do this," An Xiaoning said, "I will still serve as the head of the special team, but I can't come to the station every day, I have a lot of personal matters, so I can only come when I'm free, maybe only a few days a month, maybe only one day, it depends."  Seeing her agreement, Pan Zhenghui was so excited he almost jumped up, "That's great! Even if it's just one day a month, as long as you come, that's good!"  "Really? Then when you finish the cases you're working on, we'll start a new one. I'm just here to give you a heads-up. Alright, I won't disturb your thinking any longer, carry on, I'm leaving."  "The chair hasn't even warmed up yet, and you're leaving?"  "I'm afraid of disturbing you. Work well, see you another day."  She got up and left.  On the way back, she stopped her car in front of a supermarket to buy water because she was thirsty.  Unexpectedly, she ran into Shi Shaochuan and... Bu Xianxian.  She had heard that Shi Shaochuan and Bu Xianxian had broken up long ago, so why... this world... why is it so strange?  "Wow, Bu Xianxian, you're really something."  An Xiaoning picked up a bottle of mineral water and took the initiative to speak up. Chapter 1316: As Long As You (14)  "What do you mean?" Bu Qianqian looked straight at her. "What do you mean by 'I'm really capable'?"  "Weren't you two broken up? How come you're back together?"  "That's our business, none of your concern." Bu Qianqian was somewhat nervous. "So, don't meddle in other people's affairs, off you go."  An Xiaoning shrugged her shoulders and hummed, "Oh, good luck."  After watching her walk away, Bu Qianqian, holding Shi Shaochuan's arm, said, "Isn't she annoying?"  "Hasn't she always been annoying?" Shi Shaochuan replied indifferently. "Don't bother with her. Have you finished buying?"  "Yeah, almost."  "Let's go then." Shi Shaochuan went with her to pay, and when they exited the supermarket, they saw An Xiaoning standing by the car door drinking water, looking towards them.  "Shi Shaochuan."  Shi Shaochuan couldn't be bothered with her. "What is it?"  "I have a piece of advice for you, interested in hearing it?"  "Keep your nonsense to yourself."  An Xiaoning spread her hands, "You said it, then I won't say anything. But don't you feel uncomfortable?"  She walked around the front of the car, said nothing else, opened the door, and was about to get in, but at this moment, Shi Shaochuan stopped her, "Wait."  She rolled down the window, "What?"  "Did you figure something out?"  Bu Qianqian quickly interjected, "An Xiaoning, don't play tricks in front of us, we won't fall for it."  "Bu Qianqian, you're really something." An Xiaoning leaned back in her seat lazily, her eyes looking out at the two people from the car. "If it were any other woman, Shi Shaochuan, I definitely wouldn't be so conscientious in telling you this. You're not a good person to begin with, but it happens to be Bu Qianqian, the woman I hate the most. Ah, after much deliberation, I really don't want to see Bu Qianqian living so comfortably. Shi Shaochuan, you have someone on your back."  "Someone on my back? What do you mean?"  She smiled at him, "What do you think? Figure it out yourself."  Without saying more, she closed the car window and drove off.  Shi Shaochuan stood there, then looked at Bu Qianqian, "Does what she just said mean you're up to something?"  "Shaochuan, please don't believe her nonsense, of course it wasn't me, I don't have that ability, don't wrong me."  Bu Qianqian explained eagerly, "It's me who has a grudge with her. Didn't you hear her say she doesn't want to see me living comfortably? That damn An Xiaoning is just spouting nonsense, don't believe her. Her aim is to make us both unhappy."  "Then why does she know I'm not feeling well?"  "You look so pale, anyone who's not blind can see it."  Bu Qianqian continued, "Shaochuan, don't believe her words."  Shi Shaochuan's head was aching, he didn't say anything more and just got into the car with Bu Qianqian sitting in the passenger seat.  The car headed in the direction of the Shi family's home.  The two of them didn't talk much along the way. Shi Shaochuan barely managed to drive the car home and went straight to bed as soon as they arrived. Bu Qianqian sat on the edge of the bed, her lips curling up slightly.  But thinking of An Xiaoning, that troublemaker, she wished she could just bash her with a mallet.  Fortunately, it seemed that Shi Shaochuan hadn't suspected anything.  On her way, An Xiaoning thought about the scene she had just witnessed. Shi Shaochuan had a little ghost on his back, and without thinking, she knew who was behind it. She hadn't expected Bu Qianqian to start playing dirty.  However, using a little ghost to do one's bidding, if not well looked after, would backfire.  Did she really understand the rules involved? Such a foolish woman.  It was like putting one's life in the hands of a little ghost, letting it do work for them.  Equivalent exchange.  She really didn't know what Bu Qianqian was up to.  It looked like she wanted to continue taking advantage of Shi Shaochuan, nothing else seemed apparent.  Never mind, it has nothing to do with her.  Everyone has their own fate.  In the afternoon, the heavily pregnant Jin Qingyue came.  She was close to her due date and had already prepared the baby room, but she hadn't prepared clothes for the child. She planned to ask An Xiaoning to accompany her to pick them out, and since An Xiaoning had nothing else to do, she agreed.  Wu Lianzhi also went along. He mainly drove and carried things. Originally, they wanted to call Henry, but An Xiaoning thought it over and knew that Henry definitely wouldn't want to be a porter, his temper was well known, so they didn't call him.  Little did they know, because she didn't call him, he stood by the window sulking alone.  Jin Qingyue's hair was tidied up, draped over the sides of her face, covering much of her rounded cheeks. Because of her pregnancy, she had freckles on her face, and throughout her pregnancy, she had avoided makeup to protect the baby, leaving her previously beautiful skin looking somewhat dull without the cover of cosmetics.  But her stunning beauty could not be hidden.  She walked down the stairs slowly and carefully, afraid of falling, as she couldn't see the path under her feet due to her big belly. An Xiaoning followed behind her, cautioning her to be careful, fearing any accidents.  Wu Lianzhi drove the car, and the two women sat side by side in the back seat.  The car smoothly stopped in front of the department store. This department store was one of the properties owned by the Jin Corporation.  An Xiaoning and Jin Qingyue didn't visit often. When they got out of the car, they put on hats and masks. Considering Jin Qingyue's lack of makeup, if anyone took photos of her, it could create unnecessary news. Plus, Jin Qingyue came to pick out items intending to pay, not wanting to just charge it to her family's property. So a simple disguise was more efficient.  The three of them walked through the automatic doors of the department store and entered the maternity and baby section after checking the signs.  Because Wu Lianzhi didn't wear a mask, the salesperson couldn't help but look at him a few more times.  "Bring over all your best baby boy products and clothes, let us take a look," he said.  The salesperson was stunned for a moment, "All of them?"  "All of them, and the best ones, let us choose."  The salesperson quickly called the manager, and together they brought over many baby clothes and products.  "These are all of them, please take a look."  "Put them here." Wu Lianzhi turned to the two women beside him and said, "You pick."  Jin Qingyue picked up a little outfit, her lips curving into a smile, and An Xiaoning felt the same, seeing these things made her maternal instincts overflow.  "There are so many, he won't be able to wear them all. Qingyue, we should pick some comfortable ones, no need to take so many. Just select a few for now." Jin Qingyue quickly picked several sets, small and medium-sized, "Of course, of course, children grow fast, too many won't be needed, it's enough to have just what he can wear, start by choosing a few." Chapter 1317: Just For You (15)  A good while later, Jin Qingyue took eight sets, and An Xiaoning felt it was not enough, so she took out another five sets. Then, the two of them also picked out some infant items, such as diapers, baby bottles, and the like. As for baby formula, there was no need to buy it for the time being; it could be bought later when needed. After making their selections, An Xiaoning said to the salesperson, “You can take these away; these are enough for us.”  Upon hearing this, the manager's face, which had been smiling just before, suddenly cooled down. He snorted coldly, “You people, pretending to be rich when you have no money, acting all generous and asking for the most expensive and best things to be brought out, but in the end, you didn’t even buy half.”  An Xiaoning explained, “Over a dozen sets of little clothes are enough to change into. If it's not enough, we'll come back and buy more. It's not far, and it's not like these items would be out of stock in City A, right?”  The salesperson, who was also a mother, hurriedly said, “Manager, if the customer doesn't want to buy, we can't force them. These are indeed about enough.”  However, her words not only did not have a positive effect but further angered the manager, “Am I asking for your advice? Who is the manager here, you or me?”  The salesperson was frightened, shrinking back and saying continuously, “You are, of course, you are.”  Jin Qingyue joined in, “Look, this manager knows even less than the salesperson. Maybe you two should switch positions. Manager, you can become a salesperson, or you can resign.”  Upon hearing this, the manager became even more furious, but no matter what, these were customers, so he still suppressed some of his temper, “This is our internal matter. Those who are capable can be managers, those who aren't can only be salespeople.”  Jin Qingyue, seeing how arrogant the manager was, became somewhat unhappy, “Forget it, we don't want any of these. There are other counters here. Sister-in-law, let's go have a look at another counter.”  Seeing that they didn’t want any of the items, the manager, on the other hand, was unwilling, “If you want to leave, you can go after you buy these.”  Wu Lianzhi watched coldly, “Isn’t this forced buying and selling?”  “Since you don't want them, who asked you to take so many? Are you purposely playing with us? Everything has been bagged for you.” The manager waved his hand, and immediately several security guards approached.  The meaning was clear to everyone.  However, at this moment, Jin Qingyue's phone rang. She was about to take out her phone when the manager, thinking she was going to call the police, snatched the phone away instantly.  “Pay the money quickly, and I’ll let you go.”  An Xiaoning could no longer tolerate it, “Who gave you the audacity to bully customers like this? Just take them out of the bags and put them back. Give me the phone.”  At this time, she still thought to let the matter go, considering it was Jin's department store; causing any trouble wouldn't be good.  But the manager did not see her intention and refused to give back the phone.  An Xiaoning had no choice but to take off her hat and mask. The manager and the salesperson who saw her face were scared silly.  She walked up to the manager, snatched the phone back, and delivered a sentence to him, “You really have some nerve.”  The manager turned pale, completely losing the face and tone he had before, now resembling a soft egg, unable to muster a response.  “Miss An... I'm sorry, I was blind and failed to recognize a great person, I truly apologize, I apologize to you.”  “There's no need to apologize. After all, your apology isn't sincere. It makes no difference whether you do it or not. Call over the person in charge here.”  The manager had a premonition that this matter wouldn't be easy to resolve and stood there without moving.  “You go.” An Xiaoning shouted to the salesperson, “Go call the person in charge here.”  “Yes.”  A few minutes later, the person in charge came running, followed by several people, along with the out-of-breath salesperson.  The person in charge had already heard the whole story from the salesperson on the way, “Young Madam, this is really a case of a single mouse dropping ruining a whole pot of soup. Normally, our department store staff would never dare to offend customers. It's my lack of management. Young Madam, rest assured, I will tighten up on this attitude issue, and I will fire this manager immediately.”  “That's good. I don't want to see anything like this happen here again, understand?”  “Yes, Young Madam, rest assured, it won't happen a second time.”  As the person in charge said this, he promptly ordered the salesperson, “Quickly bring the items that Young Madam liked.”  “Qingyue, do you still want these items?”  An Xiaoning called out, and then the person in charge realized that the pregnant lady in front of him was the sister of their own chairman and felt like dying.  “Forget it, they've been picked out already, I can't be bothered to look elsewhere. Let's settle the account, I'll pay with a card.”  On the way here, she had made it clear that she didn't need the items to be given to her for free, nor did she need An Xiaoning to pay for them, so An Xiaoning didn't stop her from paying with her card.  On the way back, just as the car rounded the corner ready to take the main road, a luxury car sped from behind to the front, with the man wearing black sunglasses driving away flamboyantly.  The three were somewhat dumbfounded by the flamboyance of the car, and most importantly, the car was very similar to Jin Qingyan's Mercedes, because it drove too fast, An Xiaoning didn't see it very clearly.  Wu Lianzhi looked at the passing car, shaking so much that his hands holding the steering wheel trembled, “The person driving is really wild, driving so fast, really doesn’t want to live.”  Just as they were talking, as the car drove further ahead, they saw that the car had stopped in front.  Wu Lianzhi asked, “Why has it stopped?”  An Xiaoning squinted and looked ahead, and when she saw the license plate number of the car's tail, she was somewhat speechless, turning to Jin Qingyue beside her, “That's your brother's sports car.”  “Ah? Is it?” Jin Qingyue asked, “What is my brother doing driving so fast?”  “Who knows.”  As their car was about to overtake the Mercedes, the Mercedes suddenly took off again.  “Lianzhi, follow him.”  “Alright.”  Wu Lianzhi narrowed his eyes, his gaze fixed on the car ahead that was running very fast, and his foot pressed hard on the accelerator, both fast and very steady.  Following the car, they finally arrived at a restaurant entrance.  Seeing Henry getting out of the car along with Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai, An Xiaoning immediately understood that he had been followed when he went out.  She got out of the car and asked Wu Lianzhi to take Jin Qingyue back first, since she was pregnant.  She herself walked quickly towards the entrance of the restaurant.  Henry sat at a table by the window, and the two people who followed him did not sit together but at another table.  “What were you doing just now?” An Xiaoning sat opposite Henry, “Why were you driving so fast, tired of living?”  Henry grandly rolled his eyes at her, “Why didn't the person with you come in?”  “They've gone back.”  He, of course, saw this, and deliberately asked her. Chapter 1318: As Long As You (16)  "Why didn't you go back with them?" "I saw you coming in, didn't I?" An Xiaoning spoke directly, "Did you come to the restaurant to eat because you couldn't eat at home?!" "Can't I occasionally eat out?" "Of course you can, but it's only ten o'clock, are you already hungry?" "Is there a set time for being hungry?"  Feeling that he was deliberately picking on her, An Xiaoning asked, "What do you want to eat? Let's order." "The person I'm meeting hasn't arrived yet, I'll order when they get here." "You've made an appointment?" An Xiaoning asked, "Who is it?" "Is it any of your business?" "..."  An Xiaoning deeply felt his strong irritation. What did she do to provoke him? Crazy. However, she fell silent.  An Xiaoning's hands were crossed and propped up under her chin, staring at him. He felt uncomfortable being watched and turned his gaze out of the window.  About ten minutes later, Li Baozhen hurried over. Seeing her, An Xiaoning instantly understood, "Miss Li has arrived, please take a seat." Li Baozhen did not expect to see An Xiaoning there, she said with a light smile, "Thank you, I was really surprised to receive a call from Brother Qingyan today to have a meal together, it just so happens I'm off work today."  "So that's how it is, your Brother Qingyan said he hasn't been able to see you lately, so he thought of inviting you out for a meal to ask about your recent situation. After all, you are his lifesaver, he always remembers you." Li Baozhen smiled slightly, "I'm doing well, at the company I work every day, eat meals, and after work, I stay where I live, occasionally going out for a stroll."  Henry handed her the menu, "Order what you like." "Alright." Li Baozhen took the menu, ordered a few dishes, then passed it to An Xiaoning, suggesting her to order too. An Xiaoning wasn't hungry, so she didn't order anything.  The atmosphere was somewhat awkward, perhaps because they couldn't find any common topics to discuss. During this deadlock, An Xiaoning suddenly said to Henry, "I want to have a second child."  Everyone who heard this turned their gaze to her face at the same time. Xiao Bai and Xiao Huang snickered, and Li Baozhen felt even more awkward. Henry had no idea how to respond. If it were just the two of them, he would probably have bluntly said, "Go have it yourself." But with others around, he could only say, "That's good, I've been thinking about this as well, we should have a good talk about this big issue when we get back."  Unintentionally, the three single people around them were suddenly force-fed dog food.  An Xiaoning actually understood very well that he didn't know about her past because he didn't have memories of her and Jin Qingyan, and he hadn't experienced her past, so naturally, he did not know that it was very difficult for her to get pregnant.  Under the table, she stretched out her foot and casually hooked his. Henry tensed up, his dark eyes met hers, and without thinking, he knew that the foot under the table was hers because Li Baozhen was sitting next to him.  When the food arrived, An Xiaoning only ate a few bites before stopping. As she wiped her mouth with a napkin, the napkin fell to the floor. As she bent down to pick it up, she took the opportunity to touch Henry's leg.  Henry was furious. She was teasing him surreptitiously in such a public setting. And when she picked up the napkin without any hint of a change in expression and quickly winked at him, he had to sit there as if he hadn't been affected at all.  This meal was not very enjoyable, at least the mood wasn't. So much so that when they finished, he said to her, "You and Xiao Huang, Xiao Bai go to the car, I have something I want to say to Baozhen alone."  An Xiaoning readily agreed, saving his face, "Okay." The three of them quickly left.  He waited until the three of them got into the car before turning to Li Baozhen and saying, "Work well at the company, visit your parents when you have time. If you need help with anything at the company, you can reach out to Xiaoning or Captain Fan, okay?"  "Brother Qingyan, you already told me this when I went to the company, and now you're repeating it. Are you going on a business trip again?" Henry told her, "Yes, I often go on business trips and am not often in A City." "Brother Qingyan," Li Baozhen looked at him, "why do I feel like you're going to a faraway place and not coming back?"  He didn't say more, "Let's go out, Xiaoning and the others are waiting, I'll take you back to the company." "Okay."  After sending Li Baozhen back to the company, the car returned to the Viney community, however... When they reached the garage, the car remained quiet. Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai got out first, followed closely by the two of them. It wasn't until they got back to the second floor that someone spoke.  It was An Xiaoning who spoke first, "What did you talk to her about when we were back in the car?" "I said some things that are not for others to hear." "..." An Xiaoning felt he was being strange, "What's wrong with you?" "Nothing." He opened the covers and lay down, closing his eyes as if he didn't want to bother with her.  An Xiaoning moved closer, kicked off her shoes, knelt on the bed and looked at him, "Henry, at the dining table, you agreed to have a second child with me." "Can't you tell I didn't want to embarrass you?" "You've changed." An Xiaoning looked at him, "You're not the Henry who hated me anymore. If it were the same as before, would you care if I were embarrassed?"  He squinted at her, "An Xiaoning, I want you to promise me something." "Is it that if I agree, you will want to have a second child with me?" "..." "Alright, what is it?" "From now on, when I'm not around, if he sees Baozhen, I hope he will greet her, and occasionally visit Baozhen's parents, even if it's just once a year."  "What if he doesn't go?" An Xiaoning asked. "No, he will go. He listens to you."  An Xiaoning was really going crazy, looking at his charming eyes, she really wanted to devour him. "I know you don't want to touch me at all, but I find it strange that at this moment I want to touch you. If you let me kiss you, I'll agree to it." "..."  "If you don't let me, then forget it." She was about to move over him to the inside of the bed when he suddenly said, "Just one kiss."  So, she straddled him directly, leaned down and kissed him. When Henry wanted to change his mind, it was already too late because she wasn't just giving one kiss. She practically kissed him until he had a physical reaction.  When she finally let go of him, Henry felt as if he was completely immobilized. Chapter 1319: As Long As You (17)  An Xiao Ning looked at him contentedly and sweetly said, "Oppa, saranghae." Henry's heart fluttered unexpectedly, and he found himself at a loss for words.  An Xiao Ning lay beside him, wrapping her arms around his neck, "Today, I went shopping for baby products with Lian Zhiyue, and seeing all those baby items made me really want to have another child. That way, we would have three children at home, how nice would that be?"  His lips moved, as if he wanted to say something, but he couldn't.  After a while, she did not hear his voice and thought he had fallen asleep. But when she looked up, she saw that his eyes were open, and he seemed to be lost in thought.  "Why do I feel like you have something on your mind?"  "There's nothing."  "Henry, let's go to sleep."  "Okay, let's sleep."  She repeated herself, emphasizing the word "sleep" heavily, "OK?"  "OK."  Now it was An Xiao Ning's turn to be dumbfounded. She sat up and looked at him carefully, "Qing Yan?"  "I am Henry."  "!!"  An Xiao Ning leaned in closer, "What's wrong with you? If something's troubling you, just tell me, don't keep it to yourself."  "An Xiao Ning."  "Hmm?"  "If I never disappear, will you really hate me?"  "I refuse to answer that question," she said, declining to respond.  He nodded, apparently understanding something.  "Ah! What are you doing?!"  "Henry, have you gone mad? What's gotten into you?"  "Let go, I'm telling you to let go, you're crazy, let me go!"  "..."  The soundproofing in the room was so good that none of the noise inside could be heard from outside.  In the afternoon.  Aunt Chen knocked on the door again, "Young Madam, Young Master, it's time to eat, it's already three o'clock."  Inside, An Xiao Ning made a soft and gentle sound, "I know, Aunt Chen, I'll be down soon."  After hearing her response, Aunt Chen hurried downstairs to get ready.  An Xiao Ning slightly opened her eyes, her gaze vacant for a moment before she turned to look at the man beside her.  She had never thought, really never thought that he would be so proactive, and in such a wild manner at that. Usually, he didn't even want her to touch a finger, which just goes to show the old saying, the more unexpected it is, the more surprising.  An Xiao Ning propped herself up and sat up, noticing a piece of paper on the nightstand alongside a pen.  She picked up the paper, which had a few lines written on it.  [I lost our bet, and I keep my word, I will disappear on my own, today... was the happiest day of my life, and it was you, the one I used to hate, who gave it to me, thank you. ——Henry]  Reading this, An Xiao Ning's hand trembled slightly.  For her, today, he had been too surprising.  She didn't even know when she had made him fall in love with her.  Originally, his disappearance would have been more than welcome for her.  But this silent goodbye made her feel a little sad.  She sat there in a daze for quite a while before she let herself lie back down, hugging the man next to her tightly.  The man she hugged instinctively hugged her back and whispered, "Xiao Ning..."  "Mhm."  He opened his eyes and saw her close at hand before looking at himself.  Soon, he realized.  They were facing each other with nothing to hide.  Jin Qing Yan's mind flashed back to the passion they shared.  Then, gradually, more and more memories began to flood in, prompting him to sit up abruptly.  "Qing Yan, what's wrong?"  Jin Qing Yan hugged her tightly, "Xiao Ning."  "Yes, what is it?"  "Why do I suddenly have Henry's memories?"  An Xiao Ning understood what was happening. If the two sets of memories were originally separated, blocked, now they were just connected, and the price was Henry's true disappearance.  "He kept his promise to me and disappeared on his own. Actually, it's just that your unhappy and negative things have come to light, you are still you, whether it's Henry or Jin Qing Yan, it's still just you. You guys were always one person. But this is also a precedent. Dissociative identity disorder is still diagnosed as incurable in current medicine, yet you recovered, didn't you? Unbelievable."  "He fell in love with you?" Although this was within Jin Qing Yan's expectations, he still found it somewhat incredible, "Earlier than I imagined. I thought at the very least it would take many more times of you two being alone together."  "I also feel it's quite sudden. I thought about it carefully, and he probably realized today that his feelings for me had changed from dislike to being moved. His behavior today was very off, and he suddenly went crazy and pinned me to the bed, hmph."  Jin Qing Yan raised his eyebrows with a meaningful "oh," "So..."  "There's no 'so.' I need to get up, it's already three in the afternoon, I need to eat. Since all of Henry's memories have merged with yours, I don't need to tell you some things separately, especially about Li Baozhen's matter. Henry said that at least once a year we should go see her parents and treat them well. I support that, after all, they're people who saved you, we owe them, don't we?"  "Of course, but say it one more time."  "Say what one more time?"  "Say oppa, saranghae."  "..."  An Xiao Ning complied with his request and called out, "Oppa, saranghae, brother, I love you."  He hugged her joyfully into his arms.  —  October 16th on the lunar calendar is Jin Qing Yan's birthday.  For him, the best birthday gift would be the lifting of the curse.  They were not worried about Wu Haigang deceiving them because he knew very well that he would die at their hands, while his descendants would still be alive.  At this time, he didn't have the time to choose otherwise.  On the 16th, he lifted their curse, but with the curse lifted, he also met his end.  The witchcraft of the Wu family was completely eradicated.  As for the Donggong family of Country R, An Xiao Ning thought that their decision to execute her resulted in Wu Haigang dying by her hand.  Nothing else mattered anymore.  After the curse was lifted, Wu Haigang was executed secretly.  An Xiao Ning finally felt relieved, and this was the most relaxed and comfortable phase of her life.  Wu Lianzhi's household registration application was approved.  "Now that you have permanent residence here, I've also arranged a job for you, a counselor at the university. Although the school prohibits romantic relationships between teachers and students, I think this is the place with the most female students. If you find someone you're mutually attracted to, you can choose another job, or you can keep your marriage and relationship secret. What do you think?" Chapter 1320: As Long As You Wish (18)  "It's exactly what I want, but I'm worried about one thing."  "What?"  "The Donggong family might continue to seek revenge on me."  "Do you think they would dare to do that?" An Xiaoning continued, "In that case, I will send another statement to them later, telling them that you are my good friend. If they dare to trouble you again, I will definitely hold them accountable. Is that okay?"  "Xiaoning is mighty."  An Xiaoning laughed, "Isn't that what I should do? Thanks to you, the curse has been lifted. I will protect you thoroughly. So, boldly pursue the peaceful life you want and find the girl you like."  "Mm, okay, I will try hard."  ...  The servants at the manor were busy preparing for the birthday party all day.  Although Jin Qingyan had already received the best birthday gift, it didn't mean that there wasn't another celebration.  In the evening, he would invite his closest friends to attend a small party.  They would celebrate together.  Just after five o'clock in the afternoon, An Xiaoning had just finished her bath and came out when he caught her and carried her straight to bed, domineeringly saying, "First, sing me a birthday song."  "I'll sing it properly for you when the party starts."  "I want to hear you sing it first."  An Xiaoning rolled her eyes, "True to Jin San Sui's style. Alright, alright, today is your birthday, you're the boss. It's just singing it once, and now I'll start singing for our Oppa."  He even clapped his hands, which made An Xiaoning want to laugh.  "Happy Birthday to you... Happy Birthday to you..."  "It sounds really nice."  He had just finished complimenting her when he pressed her down, turned over, and kissed and tickled her on the bed. The two of them rolled around on the bed, and at that moment, An Xiaoning couldn't stop laughing.  If it weren't for someone knocking on the door, she could have laughed for another three minutes.  It was Fan Shixin delivering the equipment for tonight's birthday party.  The specially tailored clothes and shoes for her.  After opening and looking at them, An Xiaoning particularly liked the outfit, a white evening dress with matching diamond-studded high heels. These high heels were specially made with care for An Xiaoning, who did not like to wear high heels. The heels were quite high, but they were very stable to walk in, and they made her feet look very pretty.  After both of them had gotten ready, when they came downstairs, a small group of people had already arrived.  Ling Ciyue and Jin Qingyue were leaning on the couch, while Long Tianze was originally sitting on the other side of Ling Ciyue. However, he felt uncomfortable sitting and simply lay down, laying on Ling Ciyue's legs.  If it weren't for the fact that they were buddies, Ling Ciyue would have long kicked him to Wakawakaland.  "Yah yah yah yah yah." Long Tianze smacked his lips in admiration, "Look at how beautiful sister-in-law is, beautiful, beautiful."  "Indeed, sister-in-law, you look really good in this outfit."  Jin Qingyue also praised, "Very beautiful."  "Money is useful, isn't it?"  An Xiaoning smiled, "How come Yangyang hasn't arrived yet?"  "He went to pick up the kids. How can the kids not participate in such a celebration?"  Once the kids were picked up, almost everyone had arrived.  There weren't many outsiders here. It was a small gathering.  So, at a little past six o'clock, the birthday party officially began.  Fan Shixin took on the role of the host, and after the opening words were said, it was time for Jin Qingyan to make a wish and cut the cake.  Jin Qingyan walked up to the cake, the birthday song played, and he held his own hand and closed his eyes. Soon, he gently blew out the candles on the cake.  Below, there was a thunderous applause.  Jin Qingyan spoke, "I just made a wish, do you all want to know what it is?"  Everyone looked at him with bated breath, curious about his wish.  "My wish..." he paused slightly, his eyes full of tenderness as he looked towards An Xiaoning in the audience, "is to marry Xiaoning as my wife as soon as possible."  "Great!" Long Tianze led the cheer, clapping excitedly.  The others also followed suit with cheers and shouts.  Only An Xiaoning stood there quietly watching Jin Qingyan, with a faint smile on her face.  When it was time to cut the cake, An Xiaoning cut it with him, and after everyone had a piece of cake, they started to eat, drink, and be merry. They danced together and had a blast.  The kids were incredibly happy, and they even sneakily gathered in a room together, bringing alcohol with them.  As a result, they all drank a bit too much and got drunk, sprawling out asleep.  ---  An Xiaoning never expected that Wang Jinsheng would actually come to find her. She still saw him, though she really didn't want to.  "Miss An..."  "If you came here this time to ask me to speak for you about your issue, then there's no need to speak, it's useless and unnecessary."  Wang Jinsheng didn't expect that she already knew, "Miss An, when did you..."  "Although the morning news reported it today, I already knew before that." An Xiaoning asked with a smile, "Isn't it you who told Heyi that it was me who blew up Shenjia Lake? Isn't it you who has been in frequent contact with Heyi, a member of the archaeological team in touch with tomb raiders so often, I really don't know what you're thinking? Moreover... you actually did those illegal things, it can be said that you can still come here now, the police must already be on their way to arrest you, right?"  Hearing her say this, Wang Jinsheng was already sweating profusely, "Miss An, please help me this time, I promise I won't do it again."  "Captain Wang, can't you hear what I'm saying?" An Xiaoning stood up, "You have to bear the consequences of your own mistakes."  "Madam, the Criminal Police Brigade is here, they said they are here to take Captain Wang."  "Isn't he right here?"  Fan Shixin made a gesture to the officers outside the door.  Several officers came in and took Wang Jinsheng away. An Xiaoning let out a sigh of relief and asked, "Shixin, I really don't know what Captain Wang was thinking?"  "I don't know what he was thinking either. He probably didn't know that you were already aware of the situation, so he came to try his luck."  "Possibly. There's nothing to be done when someone deliberately hurts themselves."  ...  After lunch, An Xiaoning received a phone call from Pan Zhenghui, asking her to go to the station.  An Xiaoning went, and Pan Zhenghui called her in mainly to discuss two things. The first was about Wang Jinsheng and Heyi, and the second was about a case he wanted to hand over to her.  First, talking about Wang Jinsheng's matter, Pan Zhenghui shook his head and said, "It's such a pity, he's been in the archaeological team for so many years, and as a team leader, how could he make such a mistake? He can't be a leader anymore, losing his job is one thing, but he will also have to go to jail. Speaking of Heyi, you asked me to keep an eye on him, and he really hasn't stopped, he's not an easy person to deal with. The police in Country Y are currently issuing a warrant for his arrest, requesting the assistance of our police force." Chapter 1321: As Long As You (19)  An Xiaoning asked, "Did you catch him?"  "Could we not have? You had already instructed me to keep an eye on him. I had people watching him at all times, and we easily captured him. He's already been taken away by the overseas police; his guilt is even greater than Wang Jinsheng's."  "How many years do you think he'll be sentenced to?"  "At a conservative estimate, more than ten years. He's fallen; he's got it coming."  Hearing this, An Xiaoning didn't say much more; after all, everyone has their own life, and everyone should be responsible for themselves.  "Let's talk about the case."  "Sure." Pan Zhenghui handed her several file boxes, "Here are two famous cold cases. Take a look and decide which one to investigate first. These cases haven't been solved for many years. However, one of them, despite having sufficient evidence, feels very challenging to me. Take them back and discuss with the members of the special group."  An Xiaoning took them and said, "Alright, I got it."  As she left the office, she opened the file boxes while walking.  The files inside had yellowed, showing their age.  An Xiaoning walked into the office, and the several people inside all looked at her. Ma Jianguo rubbed his hands and chuckled, "Xiaoning, you're here. We've been waiting for you. We've just finished our case, and the chief said that we're to start on a major case with you."  An Xiaoning sat down and spoke seriously, "I currently have two famous cold cases on hand. I've briefly scanned through them; one is from twenty-two years ago, and the other is from fourteen years ago. All of the cases don't necessarily involve meticulous thinkers with strong anti-investigation capabilities. Thinking back on ten or twenty years ago, when there were no surveillance cameras or fingerprints, it was indeed not easy to solve cases. Take a preliminary look at these two cases, and after you've seen them, I'll take a look."  She passed the file bags to every one of them to look through. After about ten minutes, everyone had quickly reviewed the key points and then passed the files back to her.  "Have you all finished? Which case do you think we should start with?"  Ma Jianguo suggested, "I propose we start with the Widow Village case. It's the oldest and, although there is a lot of speculation online, it's not as conclusive as the other one. I think that the case without evidence will be very difficult, so let's start with the more challenging one."  "I agree with Lao Ma," Gong Le echoed, "Team leader, I've been following the discussions about the Widow Village case online as well, but I think that the perpetrator is still living well to this day, which is the most unsettling part for the victims. This case will be the hardest to investigate, so I also think we should start with this one."  An Xiaoning nodded, "Then we'll start with this one. But do you really think the second case with conclusive evidence will be easy to resolve? If it were that easy, why was the investigation terminated despite the evidence and without a conclusion?"  Ma Jianguo said in a low voice, "Isn't it because the perpetrator's family background is too powerful? Someone was pressing down on it. Of course, compared to your status, Xiaoning, that person's status is nothing. There's always someone greater out there. I bet they don't know you're personally going to investigate this case. I wonder if they would be scared out of their wits if they knew."  "Keep your mouths shut about the second case. We haven't started yet, so keep your lips sealed tight, or else you'll be responsible for the consequences."  "Ah, Xiaoning, you can rest easy a hundred times over. What are we? We are police officers, alright? Trust your subordinates, OK?"  An Xiaoning hummed in acknowledgment, "I'll take the second case file home with me and keep it there. When we start working on it, I'll discuss it with you. For now, focus all your attention on the first case. I want to adopt a discreet approach to the investigation and delve into it slowly. This case has probably become a taboo topic in the village. Also, I want to confirm something: before this case happened, the gender ratio in the village was normal, right?"  "That's right. After the case, men in the village started dying one after another, and many men were too scared to stay at home and moved away. Now, the only ones living in the village are economically disadvantaged elderly men, middle-aged widows, and children. Most of the elderly are also widows. At that time, everyone suspected it was a problem with the water source, but that's not it. After all, both men and women in the village drank from the well, so why did only the men die one after another? It didn't take long for the village to be renamed Widow Village."  Ma Jianguo recalled, "More than twenty years ago, there were superstitious rumors that the deceased of the case we're investigating was taking revenge on the village. So now, basically, the victim's death is associated with this."  "It seems that to truly understand the situation in Widow Village, we must go there in person. I was planning to do so anyway."  Zu Dong asked, "Team leader, are we going with you, or do you have other plans?"  "If so many of us go together, it will definitely raise suspicions. I'll assign tasks."  She said methodically, "Zu Dong will come with me. Gong Le and Ding Liang, you two young ones will go to the area around Widow Village for a field investigation without arousing suspicion from the villagers. As for Ma Jianguo, being the eldest, you'll stay on standby at the station."  "Xiaoning, you're discriminating against me for being old," Ma Jianguo protested strongly, "I don't want to stay at the station. I'll go with the two of them. I'm an experienced old police officer, much more knowledgeable than they are."  "Alright, then. I'll take the case file home and take a closer look. You three go for the reconnaissance, and Zu Dong will come back to the Vini community with me."  "Okay."  An Xiaoning drove Zu Dong back and found that Jin Qingyan was still at home and hadn't gone to the company.  "Why didn't you go to the company?"  "I'll go in a while."  When Jin Qingyan saw Zu Dong come in with her, he asked, "Are you really taking on a case?"  "Yes, I've taken it. This afternoon, Zu Dong and I will go to Widow Village. I won't be coming back for a while."  Jin Qingyan disliked hearing such words, as it meant he'd have to sleep alone at night and wouldn't see her for a short period.  "So you plan to stay there?"  "Yes, of course."  An Xiaoning thought for a moment and added, "Zu Dong and I will pretend to be a married couple looking to rent a house."  It was better to tell him early to avoid him getting jealous unexpectedly.  "..."  Jin Qingyan disagreed, "Let Shi Xin go with you." Chapter 1322: As Long As You (20)  "Why? Shixin is your assistant, I'm going to solve a case, so it would be more appropriate to go with our team's police officers, right?" An Xiaoning seemed to have realized something, "Didn't I pretend to be a couple with Shixin when I went to Country V before? Don't be too petty."  "I'm not being petty. Am I a petty person? The main thing is I'm worried when you go, so I feel more at ease if Shixin goes with you."  "......" Seeing him making unreasonable arguments, clearly not wanting others to pretend to be her husband, so he...  "Have you considered his girlfriend's feelings when you command Shixin like this?" An Xiaoning waved her hand to let Zu Dong wait outside. Zu Dong felt a bit awkward and immediately went out.  "Either you don't go, or you take him with you, you choose."  "Jin Qingyan."  "I didn't hear."  "Brother."  "It's useless even if you call me Grandpa."  An Xiaoning approached him and sat down beside him, "How old are you? You're thirty-four, not three or four years old. I'm going to do my job with the police officers, not to do something else. Is it necessary?"  "I just want my person to accompany you. If I could accompany you myself, I would have gone, but I have to manage the company. Having Shixin go with you, I'm at ease if you two pretend to be a couple. You've pretended before and have experience."  "......"  "Did you hear what I said?"  "Alright, let Shixin go with you then. I see you trust your people."  An Xiaoning glared at him, "Are you satisfied now?"  "Mhm, satisfied."  He dialed Fan Shixin's number, called and then quickly hung up. In no time, Fan Shixin arrived.  "Young Master."  "Go on a countryside trip with your young madam."  Fan Shixin was confused. Generally, trips like this should be accompanied by himself, right? Why was it his turn now?  "Young Master, a countryside trip?"  "Mhm, considering you've been working hard for the company recently, I specially grant you this."  "Even though you say that, Young Master, I still feel like there's a catch."  "Don't listen to your young master's nonsense. There's no trip. I'm going to the countryside to investigate a case. Originally, I was going to pretend to be a couple with one of our male police officers...um..."  Before she could finish, her mouth was forcefully covered.  Fan Shixin roughly understood the situation and completed the unfinished sentence for An Xiaoning, "The police officer at the door, right? My young master doesn't want you to pretend to be a couple with him, so he assigned me. To be precise, my young master doesn't like you pretending to be a couple with people he doesn't trust, even though he knows it's fake, even though he knows nothing will happen, but he's just petty and unwilling."  "That's right!" An Xiaoning pried Jin Qingyan's hand away, "Did you hear that? Shixin expressed it so accurately. Jin Qingyan, you're really hopeless."  "If I'm hopeless, I'm hopeless. I'm happy to spend my money as I please, and I just like to do it this way. If you're not happy, don't go."  An Xiaoning had had enough and pointed her index finger directly at his forehead, "Fine, fine, fine. We'll do it your way. Shixin and I will go together."  Zu Dong, due to her sudden change of mind, could only go and meet up with Ma Jianguo and others.  She and Fan Shixin then packed their luggage and put it in the car.  The car left the city at half-past one and didn't arrive until half-past five in the afternoon, a full four-hour drive.  When they got to the market town near Widow Village, the sky was gloomy and looked like it was about to rain.  An Xiaoning had Fan Shixin park the car in a parking lot, then they both wore masks and took their luggage on a tricycle to their destination.  The tricycle driver, a man, was very surprised when he heard that the two of them were going there.  "Are the two of you going back to see your parents?" he asked.  "No, we're visiting relatives."  "Then don't stay there too long. That village is particularly strange. The village is left with only women, and it is very rare to see men, so generally no men go there. You and your man shouldn't stay there for long. Go quickly and come back quickly. Look, it's getting dark."  An Xiaoning suddenly asked, "Big brother, is it really that strange? You're making me a bit scared."  "It's really that strange. All the men in their village had accidents within a short period of time, and almost all of them died. Everyone here knows about this. You two don't sound like you've been here before, right?"  "Mhm, it's our first time."  "Then no wonder. Listen to me, you won't go wrong."  "Alright, thank you, big brother."  After seven or eight minutes, the tricycle arrived at a spot before Widow Village and stopped there. The driver, disliking the bad luck, didn't go further. "There, that's the place."  An Xiaoning paid the fare, and she and Fan Shixin walked the rest of the way.  "Shixin, remember when we went to Country V with Xiaobai? We pretended to be a couple, and starting now, we'll do the same. I'll be called Mu Ning."  "Okay, I got it. Don't worry, my acting skills are top-notch."  An Xiaoning smirked with pursed lips, "Yes, I acknowledge your acting skills. It's just that your young master is sometimes blindly worried."  "He cares too much about you, that's why."  "There are people at the entrance of the village. Let's walk faster and ask."  The two of them quickened their pace, and An Xiaoning greeted them with a smile, "Hello, is there a house for rent in the village? My husband and I are doing a small business at the market town, but the houses there are too expensive. This place is very close to the town, so we want to rent a house nearby. We asked around other villages, but there were none."  "There is one, there is." A middle-aged woman stood up enthusiastically, "My family has two lower rooms empty, but..."  Her tone gradually became hesitant, "If you and your husband don't mind our village's bad reputation, I can rent them to you."  "It's fine, my husband plans to sleep in the shop, and he won't live here much. Mainly, I'll cook and live here."  Hearing her say that, the middle-aged woman immediately spoke up, "Then that's great, I'll rent it to you."  Upon hearing this, An Xiaoning immediately beamed with joy, "Okay, sister, take us to see the house. If there's no problem, we'll settle down."  "Alright, girl, follow me."  The two followed the middle-aged woman into the village and stopped in front of an iron gate. She took out the key and opened the gate, "My last name is Wang. After the kids went to school and my husband went to work out of town, he hasn't come back for several years. Only I am left at home, and there's no one to talk to. The lower rooms were originally my daughter's place, quite clean, but she only comes back during summer and winter vacations, so they're empty anyway."  "Wang sister, are there many people in the village?"
