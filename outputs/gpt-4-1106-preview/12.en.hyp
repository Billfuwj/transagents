Chapter 1906: It's Hard to Forget Without Thinking (Twelve)  Thinking of these, Su Jue couldn't help feeling sorry for Su Yan and held his arm tightly without letting go. She pouted and said, "Brother, I really do hope you find me a sister-in-law soon, have a little nephew, so you also have someone to take care of you."  "Who asked you to worry about this?" Su Yan still had a smile on his face, and he reached out to gently pinch Su Jue's mouth.  It was still indulgent.  He wanted to avoid the topic with all his heart, and Su Jue, no matter how naive, could see it. She didn't want to force him, sat up straight, and sighed, "Well, let's leave it, I get worried every time we talk about it."  Her hands were still holding his arm, very affectionately.  Su Yan smiled slightly and said, "With my good conditions, I won't end up a bachelor."  "Cut." Su Jue gave him a dismissive white eye, "Narcissist, you've been infected by the third brother."  Su Yan laughed helplessly, while laughing, he shrugged noncommittally.  It seemed to say: That's how it is.  Su Jue reached out again to pick up the cup. The tea in the cup had a bit of a hot feeling just now, and it was just right to drink in one go now. After testing the temperature, she tilted her head back and drank a cup of water in one breath, looking very thirsty. Su Yan watched her and asked with curiosity, "Where have you been, why are you here at this time?"  After finishing the water, Su Jue put down the cup and replied truthfully to Su Yan, "I went to see Qiao Chen's mother. On my way back, I unconsciously came here."  "Oh."  Su Jue nodded and then asked, "Did you bring little Qiao with you?"  He looked at little Qiao, munching an apple, with his little legs dangling and swinging from side to side, an innocent look of carefree joy.  It was irresistible to want to protect her, not wanting, afraid that she would suffer any harm.  His mother didn't have the beautiful childhood she should have had, so he was particularly eager to give her a beautiful and warm childhood filled with colors.  There was a time when he wanted to intervene, there was a Qiao Chen, the guy who risked his life to save Su Jue.  He had thought he would be the one sent by heaven to compensate Su Jue for the shortcomings of her childhood and teenage years living in the dark.  He thought Qiao Chen would be Su Jue's best and final destination.  But unexpectedly, he was the best, but not the final.  That guy, even now, would suddenly burst into his mind, into his dreams.  So little Qiao must not forget him.  And he also hopes that Ming Ansheng won't be worse than Qiao Chen, that his love for Su Jue won't be less than Qiao Chen's.  This is a selfish thought, a selfish wish of a brother.  "Mhm."  Su Jue pursed her lips and said, "But I didn't go in, just looked from the doorway for a while. I was afraid that if I went in, she would remember Qiao Chen when she saw me, and it would upset her."  Su Yan smiled and changed the subject, "Is little Qiao adapting well to kindergarten?"  Su Jue nodded, "Mhm, with Yan Yan and the others taking care of her, she gets along quite well with the other kids."  "That's good."  Su Yan smiled slightly, then looked at Su Jue and said, "Bring little Qiao with you to the new product launch event to have fun."  Su Jue was thrilled, "Sure, I'll bring Ming Ansheng with me."  "Does he need you to bring him?" Su Yan raised an eyebrow, "Isn't he the one bringing you?"  Su Jue pouted, "If we're talking about who's more important, from Rongsheng's perspective, I'm the main one."  While the two were talking, the door to Su Yan's office suddenly opened. Hearing the door open, Su Jue looked over in surprise, wondering who was so rude to come in without knocking. The only one she could guess was probably the third brother, but the person who came in was a tall woman. Chapter 1907: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Thirteen)  Su Yue looked at the woman who walked in with surprise. This... wasn't this the big star, Aireli, from just before? Why has she come back again? No... the question should be why she came to her brother's office, and most importantly, she didn't even knock on the door; this woman was too impolite.  Watching Aireli stride in, Su Yue couldn't explain the feeling of annoyance that arose in her heart, she could only summarize it as feeling upset.  Aireli, with a light green Herm√®s bag on one arm and her spectacles she had just taken off after entering in the other hand, walked into the office. The high heels on her feet tapped on the wooden floor with a 'clack clack' sound, making her presence very noticeable.  Upon entering, she first glanced in the direction of Su Yan's office, and upon seeing Su Xiaoqiao, a look of surprise flashed across her beautiful face, followed by a confused gaze towards Su Xiaoqiao.  However, Su Xiaoqiao, who was engrossed in watching an animated film, didn't notice her presence at all. Her bright, sparkling eyes were glued to the computer screen, unblinking.  Aireli watched Su Xiaoqiao for a while, and just as she was about to divert her gaze elsewhere, Su Yan suddenly looked at her and called out, "Miss Ai."  After calling her, he stood up, ready to greet her.  Su Yue also stood up with him, her hands still wrapped around his arm, affectionate and natural.  Hearing Su Yan's voice, Aireli smiled with her lips curved, and as her gaze turned towards him, and then to Su Yue by his side, the smile on her face stiffened for a moment.  "President Su."  After greeting Su Yan, she looked at Su Yue with a puzzled... and slightly probing gaze, a complex look flashing in her eyes.  Su Yue noticed all of Aireli's reactions after seeing her, and deliberately hugged Su Yan's arm tighter, even resting her head on his shoulder.  Her brother was such a catch that even a big star couldn't resist the temptation. This woman, at one glance, it was obvious she liked her brother.  But for some reason, she felt an innate rejection of her, which was inexplicable.  Or perhaps, she thought that her brother's indifferent nature was not suited for women from the entertainment industry, especially those who appeared to be strong-willed.  Of course, her thoughts only represented herself and nobody else, including her brother.  "President Su, who is this?" Su Yue was pondering to herself when Aireli, after observing her for a while, pointed at her and asked Su Yan.  Su Yan then introduced, "This is my sister, Su Yue."  A simple introduction, but it made Aireli's beautiful face go from winter to spring, as if revitalized.  It was too obvious, Su Yue criticized in her mind, what a Best Actress, with no acting skills at all.  However, this also meant that her brother was excellent, to the point where even a Best Actress couldn't help herself around him.  Proudly thinking to herself, Su Yue watched as Aireli approached with a smile, "Hello."  Aireli walked up to Su Yue and politely extended her right hand.  The Su Yue of the past, when faced with people she didn't like, even if they were standing right in front of her, would just tilt her head up and not even glance at them. But now, time had smoothed her edges, and she understood the ways of the world and how to interact with people.  She reached out and shook hands with Aireli, smiling slightly, "Hello, Miss Ai."  After the greeting, she withdrew her hand, quite naturally.  Aireli didn't find it awkward either, withdrawing her hand and smiling again at Su Yan, "I just realized that I forgot my scarf here." Chapter 1908: Without Deliberation, Unforgettable (14)  As she spoke, her gaze swept across the sofa and finally landed on a corner of the couch. Her heavily made-up, somewhat enchanting almond eyes brightened as she pointed in that direction and said, "It's there. I was too careless, always losing and forgetting things." She laughed at herself, walked over, and picked up the scarf.  Although it was a large floral scarf, the pattern was very refreshing, not at all vulgar but rather elegant. This is also the value of big brands and top designers.  Su Jue stared at the scarf in Ai Rili's hand, thoughtful. She came to talk about work, left her scarf behind, and didn't bring an assistant. Was the scarf really lost by accident, or was it a ploy to find another opportunity to strike up a conversation with her brother?  Ah, ah, ah, Su Jue, why are you so narrow-minded, have you been reading too many novels? She reined in those melodramatic plot lines in her mind, pouted, and looked at Ai Rili, still feeling sour inside.  For some reason, she actually wanted her brother to find a girlfriend and get married soon. She held Su Yan's arm and never let go, always hugging it tightly, as if declaring her ownership to Ai Rili, or as if she was telling Ai Rili that she didn't like her.  Ai Rili, holding the scarf, returned to the front of the Su Yan and Su Jue siblings. Su Yan looked at her and politely said, "Make a phone call, and I'll have someone send it down."  Ai Rili smiled generously, "It's no trouble, I came up to get it myself."  To become a movie queen and to be so popular, there must be something extraordinary about her. Su Jue noticed that Ai Rili's smile with those dimples was really charming. Especially her face, which seemed perfect but with some indescribable small imperfections, compared to those flawless internet celebrities and surgically altered stars, was unique.  Su Jue's gaze, without realizing, was assessing Ai Rili again. Ai Rili suddenly looked towards her, her smile still generous. After glancing at Su Jue, she smiled and said to Su Yan, "President Su, your sister is very pretty."  Without waiting for Su Yan to respond, she added, "And she looks a lot like you."  Su Yan's lips curled up slightly, but he said nothing.  Upon hearing this, Su Jue secretly rolled her eyes at Ai Rili. Just compliment her brother on being handsome, why bother using her as a pretext?  In her heart, Su Jue criticized Ai Rili numerous times. She's popular, has temperament, has charm, but... she just didn't like her. She felt that personal feelings were really inexplicable.  Ai Rili showed no signs of leaving and kept looking for topics to chat with Su Yan about. As Su Jue listened to the irrelevant chatter, she found it boring and let go of Su Yan's arm, preparing to go to Xiao Qiao's place.  ‚ÄòKnock, knock, knock‚Äô  Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Without waiting for Su Yan to respond, the knocker had already pushed the door open.  "Su Yan, your third brother and I have to leave now," said Wen Xuxu, carrying a bag and rushing in to greet Su Yan. Seeing Ai Rili, she paused, and her hurried demeanor became a bit more reserved.  "Sister-in-law."  Su Jue saw Wen Xuxu and changed direction, walking towards her happily. "Xuxu is here," Su Jue said with a smile, though it seemed somewhat forced.  Seeing this, Su Yan grew anxious, "What's wrong? What happened?"  He asked while walking towards Xuxu.  Xuxu's mouth turned down sadly, "Ah Heng's grandfather passed away at the Cardio-Cerebral Vascular Hospital, and your third brother and I are going there now." Chapter 1909: Without Contemplation, It's Hard to Forget (Fifteen)  Her relationship with Jiang Zhuoheng, along with the fact that the old Master Jiang and the Jiang family had been very good to her, weighed on her mind. Now that the old master had passed away, although he had lived to a ripe old age, she still felt very sad.  Upon hearing the news, Su Yan's face showed a moment of shock, "Then you should hurry over."  "Okay," Xu Xu nodded, turned to Su Xuan and called out, "We're leaving now."  She then hurriedly walked towards the door. Su Xiaoqiao suddenly called out to her, "Auntie."  Xu Xu stopped in her tracks, turned around with a gentle smile to the little girl, "Xiaoqiao, auntie has something to do now and can't play with you. Be good, okay?"  "Okay," Su Xiaoqiao obediently nodded, then raised her little hand to wave goodbye to Xu Xu, "Bye, auntie."  "Goodbye!" Xu Xu quickly left, and Su Yan watched the office door close automatically, somewhat lost in thought.  "Brother, isn't Ah Heng's grandfather also Xin Yanting's grandfather?" Su Yan nodded in confirmation.  "Uh, aren't you going to pay a visit?"  "Don't gossip."  "Hmph, I don't like this attitude of yours."  "President Su, I'll be leaving first then."  "Miss Ai, take care."  Su Yan nodded slightly to Ai Ruili, then called out, "Mi Xiao."  Hearing this, Su Xuan asked in confusion, "Who is Mi Xiao?"  Before her words had finished, the door to the office opened, and in came a skinny little girl dressed in a white shirt and black fashion pants, her attire very professional. She wore black-framed glasses on her nose bridge and looked to be around her age, possibly even younger. At first glance, her looks were very ordinary.  Su Xuan sized up the girl who had come in. The girl adjusted the glasses on her nose bridge and looked at Su Yan, asking, "President Su."  Su Yan instructed her, "See Miss Ai out."  "Okay." Mi Xiao nodded, then turned to look at Ai Ruili. Her expression seemed a bit nervous, perhaps not very familiar with the task.  "Miss Ai, please." Mi Xiao bowed slightly to Ai Ruili, and after Ai Ruili walked out, she followed and closed the office door behind them.  "Brother, who was that?" Su Xuan withdrew her gaze from the door and looked at Su Yan, "Isn't it usually the secretary's job to escort guests out?"  That should indeed be the case.  "That's right, she is my secretary," Su Yan replied indifferently to Su Xuan, then walked towards Su Xiaoqiao with his hands naturally tucked into his trouser pockets, his steps leisurely.  Secretary? Su Xuan's eyes widened in surprise, "Wow!"  She watched Su Yan's tall figure and quickly followed after him, "Is there a problem?"  Su Yan glanced at her lazily, pretending to be puzzled. As astute as he was, he obviously knew why Su Xuan had reacted that way.  Su Xuan nodded quickly like a pecking chicken, "Mhm, it's a big problem."  As they walked, she said, "Weren't you the one who doesn't use female secretaries? I remember the last time you went abroad, you had that very handsome male secretary."  Hearing this, Su Yan laughed and curved his lips, "Just haven't recruited the right one, making a big deal out of nothing."  After saying that, he flicked Su Xuan's forehead.  Su Xuan winced in pain, covered her head with her hand, and pouted unhappily, "That hurt, but the one just now didn't seem that impressive either."  She then grinned again and laughed, "But brother, you've finally come around to letting other women come close to you, so I'm relieved. Otherwise, every time you travel on business, you always have to bring a handsome guy with you. It really worries me, I'm afraid you'd get confused." Chapter 1910: Without Contemplation, Hard to Forget (Sixteen)  "What?" Su Yan's eyebrows furrowed, a dangerous glint in his eyes, and the hand he had just slipped into his pocket was pulled out again. Su Yue hurriedly shrank her neck and agilely raised her hands to protect her head, giving Su Yan an ingratiating smile, "Hehe, a slip of the tongue, a slip of the tongue..."  Indeed it was a bit much, joking around with her own brother like that.  But even as she begged for mercy, Su Yan's eyes continued to stare at her unblinkingly.  Su Yue was on guard, "What? Why are you looking at me like that?"  Su Yan curved his lips into a smile, "I just remembered, you're idling at home now, why don't you come to work? That way, I don't have to hire someone else."  His tone and attitude made it hard to distinguish his sincerity.  Regardless of whether it was true or false, Su Yue immediately shook her head in refusal, "Psh, I don't want to."  As she spoke, she remembered something and, feeling unconvinced, pouted, "Who says I'm idling? My online store is still running, alright?"  And her online store was doing quite well.  She wouldn't give up such a free-spirited job to work nine-to-five at a company unless she was crazy.  "Besides, even if I wanted to work and be a secretary, I would go be Ming Ansheng's secretary, not run off to Rongsheng."  Su Yan nodded in understanding, "Mm, daughters married off are like water spilled out, but..."  He paused for a moment, then suddenly laughed, "But you haven't married off yet, have you?"  "Annoying." Su Yue's face blushed red, and she punched Su Yan's shoulder lightly.  Su Yan chuckled, then put away his joking demeanor and said to Su Yue, "I'll be busy for a while, you take Xiao Qiao to play."  "Okay." Su Yue nodded, "I'll take Xiao Qiao upstairs and downstairs for a walk, and we'll go eat dinner together after you finish work."  "Mm."  ...  "Sure enough, the traffic is jammed at this time, without exception."  On the ring road at six o'clock, the cars were moving slower than Mr. Sloth's speaking pace, causing Su Yue to complain.  "Are you very hungry?" Su Yan pointed at the storage compartment in front of Su Yue, saying, "There seems to be a bag of biscuits in there."  Su Yue shook her head, "Not hungry, just anxious."  She had to wait a long time at almost every red light, not to mention the slow driving speed.  Seeing Su Yue's anxious appearance, Su Yan smiled indulgently, "Still like a child."  At that moment, Su Yue's phone rang, displaying Ming Ansheng's name.  She immediately answered, putting it to her ear, "Hello."  "Oh, then I'll go over too."  "Mm."  After a brief conversation with Ming Ansheng, Su Yue hung up the phone, looked up at Su Yan and said, "Brother, I'm afraid I can't go to dinner. Ah Heng's grandfather has passed away, Ming Ansheng is there helping out, I should go over too."  Although she didn't have much interaction with Jiang Zhuo Heng, their relationships were intertwined, and most importantly, Ming Ansheng had such a deep relationship with him, and she was Ming Ansheng's... wife.  She had moved into his house, they had a child, she should be considered a wife, so she felt she should go.  Upon hearing this, Su Yan didn't say much, just indifferently said, "I'll take you."  "Okay." Su Yue nodded, then looked at Su Xiao Qiao beside her, the little girl was watching the scenery outside the window.  She thought for a moment, then looked at Su Yan again, "Take care of Xiao Qiao for me, or help me send her home."  Given the circumstances and it being late at night, it was better not to take a child there. Chapter 1911: Without Contemplation, Hard to Forget (Seventeen)  Su Yan nodded happily, "I'll take her out for a meal."  As the car approached the next traffic light, Su Yan changed direction.  The Jiang family, based in the capital, was reputable and influential. Coupled with Jiang Shaomei's extensive connections, the news of the old master's death spread quickly, and within a few hours, those who usually had good cooperation with the family all arrived.  The old master was highly respected, so the Jiang family unanimously decided to set up the memorial hall at home.  The entrance to the Jiang residence was like a shopping mall parking lot, with a line of cars extending to the road intersection, forming a long dragon. Fortunately, the road was cleared, and Su Yan took Su Jue to the entrance of the Jiang family's courtyard.  "Xiao Qiao, go have a meal with uncle. Mommy will come to pick you up tonight," Su Jue said as she patted Su Xiao Qiao's head and then opened the car door to get out. "Brother, drive slowly on the road."  After calling out to Su Yan, Su Jue reached out to close the car door. She looked up, paused for a moment, and her actions froze.  A black Cadillac stopped behind them, the driver's door opened, and a plainly dressed woman with shiny short hair tied in a simple ponytail and carrying a black bag got out. With a bare face and eyes red and swollen from crying, she appeared.  "Xin Yanting," Su Jue uttered almost instinctively upon seeing her.  Hearing Su Jue call her name, Xin Yanting also froze for a moment, then looked up and saw Su Jue, a flash of surprise crossing her eyes.  Then, she instinctively glanced at the driver's seat, saw half of Su Yan's profile, and her hand gripping the bag tightened.  Suddenly, she lowered her head and walked past Su Yan's car.  "Brother, you go ahead," Su Jue said after closing the car door and quickly followed after Xin Yanting.  She wanted to talk to her but didn't know what to say, and at a time like this, with her grandfather's passing, her heart must be filled with sorrow. So after some thought, she decided not to and slowed down her pace.  As she approached the entrance, she turned back and saw no trace of Su Yan's car, pouted her lips, and sighed helplessly. To like is to like, to dislike is to dislike... It's better to say brother is indifferent rather than heartless.  Ah, ah, ah, how can you think like that, Su Jue? He's your own brother after all.  Although she felt sorry for Xin Yanting, thinking she was innocent, as a woman, she felt guilty and sympathetic towards her.  "What are you thinking about?" Su Jue was pondering when a familiar voice came from ahead - it was Ming Ansheng.  She collected her thoughts, looked up, and gently shook her head, "Nothing."  She stepped up the stairs, one by one, and walked to Ming Ansheng's side.  ...  "Xiao Qiao, do you want to eat anything else?" After having dinner, it was already past eight o'clock. Traffic had finally eased. Su Yan drove around the bustling area with Su Xiao Qiao.  The colorful neon lights of the city flickered, disorienting people. At a traffic light, which was red, Su Yan gently pressed the brake pedal.  From behind came Su Xiao Qiao's voice, "I want to eat ice cream."  Su Yan withdrew his gaze from outside the car window and turned to look at Su Xiao Qiao with a smile, "You want ice cream again?"  Su Xiao Qiao pursed her lips and kept silent, which was her way of responding.  People really, really want to eat ice cream, okay? Is there even a need to ask? This is a secret known by everyone on Earth, right? Chapter 1912: Unwilling to Think, Unable to Forget (Eighteen)  Seeing her cute little appearance, how could Su Yan have the heart to refuse? He said, "Then we can only eat a small portion."  This was an agreement, and Su Xiaoqiao nodded happily, "Mhm."  Her chubby little face smiled, and her eyes curved like crescents, looking beautiful and adorable.  Su Yan drove past a couple of traffic lights, always keeping an eye on the roadside, searching for an ice cream shop. He seldom went out to shop, and he didn't like to eat out.  So he could only search blindly.  Finally, upon passing a shopping mall, he saw a H√§agen-Dazs store at the base of the mall with a very conspicuous sign. His eyes lit up, and he pointed to the H√§agen-Dazs and asked Su Xiaoqiao, "H√§agen-Dazs, is that okay?"  "Mhm mhm mhm," Su Xiaoqiao nodded vigorously.  As long as it was ice cream, as long as she could eat ice cream, it didn't matter what brand it was.  She wasn't very demanding, okay?  Su Yan parked the car on a roadside spot and then carried little Qiao towards the H√§agen-Dazs store. It was after mealtime, and there were many people out shopping and strolling. The weather was neither cold nor hot, and inside the H√§agen-Dazs store, there were many teenagers, mostly girls, sitting in groups, with almost all seats occupied.  "What flavor does Xiaoqiao want to eat?" Su Yan held Xiaoqiao up to the counter to let her look at the flavors on the large poster.  Su Xiaoqiao glanced at the poster and pointed at one without hesitation, "I want vanilla and strawberry."  "Okay."  Su Yan pointed to the two flavors Xiaoqiao wanted and told the salesperson, "We'll have vanilla and strawberry, two flavors mixed."  The salesperson smiled slightly and said, "Our store has a promotion with the cinema in the mall today. If you buy ice cream with three flavors, you will get two movie tickets for 'Little Sea Star.'"  As she spoke, she looked at Su Xiaoqiao. The name 'Little Sea Star' clearly indicated it was a movie for children.  She was trying to entice the child's interest.  Su Xiaoqiao blinked and asked, "Is 'Little Sea Star' any good?"  "Over there is the promotional poster, it tells the story of Little Sea Star and its friends in the ocean."  The salesperson pointed to the promotional poster near the entrance.  The poster featured various marine creatures, with vibrant colors and a dreamy appearance.  Su Xiaoqiao immediately became interested, turned her gaze back to Su Yan, pouted her lips, and with a pleasing tone, said, "Uncle, I want to see 'Little Sea Star.'"  Although Su Yan was very good to her and doted on her, the two had spent very little time together, so the little girl didn't dare to act spoiled or throw a tantrum around him.  Every expression she made, even the petulant ones, made people unable to refuse, let alone when she was trying to please. Su Yan stretched out his hand, smiled, and gently scraped her little nose, "But you can only have a little bit of ice cream."  Su Xiaoqiao knew that this meant he agreed. She nodded her head and stretched out her chubby little hand to gesture, "Mhm mhm, just a little bit, this much."  "Okay."  "Smack..." Seeing Su Yan nod in agreement, Su Xiaoqiao happily stretched out her arms, hugged Su Yan's neck, and gave him a big kiss on his lips.  Her soft little lips left Su Yan stunned. As he came back to his senses, he hugged the little girl tightly, wishing he could spoil her to his heart's content.  When he was younger, he felt a sense of fulfillment and achievement as if a dream from his childhood had finally come true.  Back when he watched his sister being sent to the orphanage, watching her cry and yell, he wished so much to hold her and take her home. Chapter 1913: Without Intention, Hard to Forget (Nineteen)  After getting the three-colored ice cream, the three little scoops in three different colors were placed in a paper cup, which Su Yan used as a table while holding Su Xiaoqiao with one hand and the ice cream with the other.  Su Xiaoqiao, holding a fork, was eating happily while walking, her mouth covered with it.  They got two movie ticket vouchers; the cinema was on the top floor of the shopping mall, which had a total of ten floors.  The mall's elevator was like the one in the hospital, stopping almost on every floor, making adults incredibly anxious. Su Xiaoqiao, eating her ice cream, was in no hurry at all.  "Sorry, there are no tickets left for the nearest show, the next one is at 9:40."  Upon reaching the cinema's ticket counter, the ticket seller informed them that tickets for the upcoming show were sold out and the next one was more than an hour away.  Su Yan looked at his wristwatch and said to Su Xiaoqiao, "It starts at 9:30, and it'll be past 11 by the time it finishes. It's too late; Xiaoqiao can't watch it."  He pursed his lips, looking at the little girl, waiting for her reaction.  After hearing his words, Su Xiaoqiao's mouth corners drooped in disappointment, and she mumbled softly, "I want to watch."  Just as she was getting excited, being told suddenly that she couldn't watch was indeed a disappointment.  "But it's very late, Xiaoqiao won't grow tall if she doesn't sleep," Su Yan said, gently coaxing her while rubbing her head.  Upon hearing this, Su Xiaoqiao neither fussed nor threw a tantrum. Instead, she just looked down, pouting with a look of loss that was even more heart-wrenching than if she had cried and made a scene.  Su Yan felt a bit heartbroken. He looked around and suddenly noticed a long line of people standing opposite, not sure what they were doing.  He instinctively looked up and saw 'Snowy Love Ice Rink, National Champion Level Roller Skating Coach...'  His eyes lit up, and pointing in that direction, he said to Xiaoqiao, "There's an ice rink over there, how about I take you skating?"  Hearing this, Su Xiaoqiao followed the direction of Su Yan's finger and saw a long line of people standing outside the railing, looking very lively.  She blinked, still pouting, her mind still on the 'Little Starfish' movie.  However, since uncle said it was too late and the movie might not be possible, skating was better than not playing anything...  After considering it for a moment, Su Xiaoqiao nodded reluctantly and agreed, "Well, let's go skating."  It was with a begrudging tone.  Su Yan touched her little face sympathetically and comforted her, "Uncle will bring you to watch Little Starfish on the weekend."  Su Xiaoqiao's eyes brightened, and she stretched out her little finger towards Su Yan, saying, "Pinky promise."  Dumbfounded, Su Yan extended his little finger, made a pinky promise with the little girl, and even stamped it.  His shirt was neat, and just his aura and height made him stand out in the crowd, not to mention his high attractiveness. Passersby, whether married women or single girls, couldn't help but give him an extra glance.  Seeing him interact with Su Xiaoqiao made countless girls envious.  They wished they were the little girl in the handsome man's arms.  They decided on a whim to go roller skating, without any gear, but it was just a matter of buying what they needed‚Äîmoney was no object when it came to equipment.  A grown-up and a child, they made a list, paid, and the sales clerk handed over two complete sets of roller skating gear to Su Yan.  "Sir, we have several roller skating coaches here who are on the national team, including national champions, who specialize in teaching children," the sales clerk also recommended their roller skating coaches to Su Yan. Chapter 1914: Without Contemplation, Unforgettable (Twenty)  Su Yan patiently listened to his introduction, then politely shook his head to refuse, "No need, thank you."  He took the complete set of equipment, leading Su Xiaoqiao to the chairs in the resting area, changing shoes and gear.  ...  "Alright, are you scared?"  After getting equipped, Su Yan stood up first, then slowly helped Su Xiaoqiao to her feet.  Step by step, they walked towards the ice rink.  The ground was covered with thick ice, and cold air was rising in gusts, causing Su Xiaoqiao to shiver before she looked up at Su Yan and shook her head, "Not scared."  Seeing all the children in the rink, their screams, and laughter, the little girl slowly forgot the sadness of not having seen the movie.  Her chubby little face was radiant with smiles like blooming flowers.  "Xiaoqiao is amazing, there's no need to be scared, uncle will always hold your hand and support you," Su Yan praised her while leading her onto the rink.  He held her little hands with both of his, facing her and pulling her along.  He skated backward steadily, which surprised Su Xiaoqiao, "Uncle, can you ice skate?"  Su Yan winked at her, "Won't you know if you look?"  Saying so, he carefully let go of Su Xiaoqiao's hands, slowly gliding backward. Suddenly, he spun around, picking up speed rapidly, and in the blink of an eye, Su Xiaoqiao watched with an open mouth in disbelief, admiringly staring at Su Yan, "Uncle is so amazing, so impressive."  "So do you believe uncle won't let you fall?" Su Yan returned to Xiaoqiao's side with ease, holding her hand, leading her, and slowly skating along while patiently instructing her verbally.  He was wearing his own clothes; among all the equipment, he only changed his shoes and didn't bring things like knee pads.  But when it came to protecting Su Xiaoqiao, he was not careless at all, equipping her with knee pads, elbow pads, a helmet, and so on.  "Mhm," Su Xiaoqiao was incredibly admiring of her uncle at this point, trusting him completely.  At this moment, even if her uncle took her to sell for money, she would help him count it.  "The teacher is so cool."  The uncle and niece were in sync and had a great time chatting when suddenly, a burst of applause came from a distance.  Su Xiaoqiao's gaze shifted in that direction, and the next second she excitedly gripped Su Yan's hand, pointing in the direction she was looking, "Uncle, that sister is so skilled."  Hearing this, Su Yan turned his head to look in the direction Su Xiaoqiao was pointing, his expression indifferent. He looked not out of curiosity, but instinctively.  In that direction, there was a round of applause and cheers from a group of children, in a corner diagonally opposite them.  A girl in a white sports outfit... around her early twenties, was surrounded by a group of children.  Su Yan turned to look, and the girl was performing a 360-degree spin just like he had done for Xiaoqiao, but she was spinning continuously.  The girl's bun spun rapidly, her face indistinct due to the speed.  She was probably a roller-skating coach here; it was quite normal to have such little tricks. Su Yan glanced at her, ready to look away.  Suddenly, the elastic band in her hair snapped, and her dark hair cascaded down, creating a beautiful arc in the air with her spinning movement.  It was like a staged scene, yet it was so natural, so unexpected.  This accident was stunning to many people.  However, it was not anticipated by the person involved. The girl hadn't expected her hair to come loose, and she immediately stopped. Because of the abrupt stop, her body lurched forward. Chapter 1915: Without Thought, It's Hard to Forget (Twenty-One)  Su Yan instinctively reached out his hands. He was only acting on his nature to offer a helping hand out of love for others. However, he had indeed been a bit distracted just now. Otherwise, he wouldn't have forgotten to maintain distance.  "Teacher, teacher."  The girl staggered a bit, losing her balance. She tried hard to stabilize herself. The group of students surrounding her quickly came over and, working together, managed to steady her.  The girl stood up straight, bowed her head, and playfully stuck out her tongue at the children around her, "How embarrassing, the teacher almost fell down."  It wasn't just in front of a group of children; there were also a bunch of parents watching from outside. She should have felt awkward, but there was not a hint of embarrassment in her tone, just natural and calm.  Such a mindset...  Su Yan was somewhat surprised, and his gaze couldn't help but drift back to her.  The girl bowed her head, and her waist-length hair cascaded down, covering her cheeks. He only saw one word...  Calm.  It was so close to what he had always longed for in his heart...  The comfort, ease, and peace.  "Teacher is so beautiful."  "Teacher is like a fairy."  The little boys who came forward to comfort her were all eager to act as the teacher's 'warm men,' sparing no effort in praising her.  The girl teacher extended her hands and gently stroked the heads of two little guys, "How can your little mouths be so sweet?"  Her voice sounded somehow... familiar?  Su Yan suddenly felt that the voice of the roller-skating teacher was familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had heard it before.  He frowned and observed, when Su Xiaoqiao suddenly reached out and tugged at his hand, asking, "Uncle, do you also think that sister is pretty?"  Su Yan's thoughts were interrupted, and he looked down with a smile at Su Xiaoqiao, "Not as pretty as Xiaoqiao."  Being praised, every girl likes it, regardless of age, and Su Xiaoqiao was no exception.  She laughed happily, "Uncle has good taste."  Su Yan smiled slightly, then turned around to look in that direction again. The children were still there, but the roller-skating teacher was no longer in sight.  He pursed his lips and withdrew his gaze.  The roller-skating rink closed at nine-thirty, and they had only played for about fifty minutes. After taking off the skating gear, Su Yan packed it up and carried it in his hand.  Then he led Su Xiaoqiao to the exit, asking her as they walked, "Did Xiaoqiao have fun?"  Su Xiaoqiao nodded her head, "Fun."  She responded to Su Yan and turned her head to take one last glance at the now deserted skating rink.  Su Yan caught her little expression and bent down to ask her, "Do you like roller-skating?"  "I like it, can we come again next time?" Su Xiaoqiao looked up at Su Yan with a pleading face.  Su Yan nodded in agreement, "Okay, uncle will be your teacher."  Su Xiaoqiao was extremely happy, reaching out and affectionately hugging Su Yan's leg, "Good uncle."  "So, shall we go home to sleep now?" Su Yan bent down to pick up Su Xiaoqiao.  He walked out of the roller-skating rink with big strides.  She was dressed too lightly, Su Xiaoqiao's little hands were ice cold, and the tip of her nose was also red from the cold.  Su Yan put her little hands in his embrace to warm them up, and they headed towards the elevator.  "Teacher, goodbye."  "Goodbye."  The voices of the children and the teacher saying farewell came from behind. The voice of that female roller-skating teacher still gave him an inexplicably familiar feeling.  But it wasn't that strong. Chapter 1916: Without Intention, Hard to Forget (Twenty-Two)  Su Yan was prompted to turn his head, but all he saw was a graceful silhouette, with long hair like silk satin, almost completely covering the girl‚Äôs slender back. That feeling was familiar, as if it were from a few years ago, on that old street in N City of Country Y... In this world, there was still a girl who could give him such a feeling.  The girl had already taken the escalator downstairs and disappeared from Su Yan's sight. The sensation, like a person admiring a small bridge over flowing water in the mountains, slowly trickled through his heart.  "Uncle, what are you looking at?" Su Xiaoqiao looked up at Su Yan with puzzled eyes.  Interrupted once again in his thoughts, he withdrew his gaze, looked down at Xiaoqiao, and shook his head with a smile, "Nothing, let's go home."  Then he took her and walked towards the elevator.  ...  Although it's normal to experience birth, aging, sickness, and death, the passing of the old master was still a great shock to Jiang Zhuoheng, not just for him, but for the entire Jiang family as well. Thus, it's strange how the human heart works; some things are clearly anticipated, but when they actually happen, acceptance still requires a process.  Yan Rusheng and Ming Ansheng, who were also watched over by the old master as they grew up, stayed with Jiang Zhuoheng, busy until late at night.  The guests who remained had gone to rest, leaving only a few men of the Jiang family, Xin Yanting, and Yan Rusheng's group in the mourning hall.  Xin Yanting and Jiang Zhuoheng kneeled in front of the memorial hall, and she had been sobbing intermittently ever since she arrived.  She grew up in the Jiang family, where the old master treated her like a treasure in the palm of his hand, doting on her to the sky. She had not returned from abroad for four years.  During her years abroad, she and her grandfather almost talked on the phone every day. Even when busy, they would make contact every other day at most. Even if it was just a greeting.  Yesterday, upon receiving the news that the old master was near the end, she rushed back immediately, but ultimately, she still missed the chance to see him one last time.  That was probably the main reason she refused to rise, out of guilt, self-reproach.  The old master's several nephews and Jiang Zhuoheng were arranged to keep vigil overnight. Seeing that most people had left, Yan Rusheng and his group discussed and prepared to leave as well.  Xuxu voluntarily took on the task of saying goodbye, "Ah Heng, we're going to head back first."  As she spoke, she approached Jiang Zhuoheng.  Jiang Zhuoheng stood up to meet her, "Hmm, be careful on the road."  As he said this, his gaze turned to Yan Rusheng and Ming Ansheng's group, nodding at them as a gesture.  Xuxu pursed her lips as she looked at Jiang Zhuoheng's face, then spoke again to comfort him, "You... take care of yourself."  "Hmm," Jiang Zhuoheng nodded gently, "Go back, it's getting late."  Xuxu nodded, "Then we will come over again tomorrow."  Then her gaze shifted to Xin Yanting, who was kneeling there, head down, motionless, and very quiet.  She was quite different from the Xin Yanting of the past, who was always haughty and looked down on people, evoking a sense of compassion.  Sigh!  Love can change a person, and it can also destroy a person. In four years, she had not been in contact with Xin Yanting, and she thought several times to ask Jiang Zhuoheng for some news, but she never asked.  There was always a sense of guilt in her heart, even though Su Yan had only used the same tactics against her, even though in the end, he only took the thirty percent of Rongsheng's shares from her.  But from the standpoint of a woman, from a rational standpoint, Xin Yanting was innocent. Chapter 1917: Unwilling to Think, Hard to Forget (Twenty-Three)  However, she was considering things from the perspective of a woman, adopting a saint-like heart. The business world is full of deceit and trickery, even her mother had used such... despicable means before. She gave Xin Yanting a deep look, but in the end, she didn't step forward, and the words of 'condolences' for Xin Yanting were left unsaid.  She sighed helplessly in her heart, then turned around and whispered to Yan Rusheng and Su Yue, "Let's go."  "Oh!" Su Yue responded, and when she turned around following Ming Ansheng, her gaze lingered on Xin Yanting. Her thoughts and feelings were the same as hers, from the perspective of a woman.  Similarly, she ended up just pursing her lips helplessly and followed Ming Ansheng to leave.  ...  "I think Xin Yanting is a bit pitiful." Once in the car and the car had started, Su Yue, sitting in the passenger seat, suddenly said. She leaned her head back on the seat, feeling a bit tired.  Hearing this, Ming Ansheng turned his head and looked at her with a smile and raised eyebrows, "Didn't you use to dislike her?"  He looked at her, his eyes were gentle and satisfied, he knew she had always been kind-hearted, and only kind-hearted people could be so conflicted. Since she arrived, her attention was always on Xin Yanting, full of guilt in her gaze.  In fact, in their eyes, the matter between Su Yan and Xin Yanting wasn't really an issue. Deceiving the other's trust was a means and also a tactic.  Su Yue pouted and sighed, "Well, I don't like her, but that doesn't affect my sympathy for her, as a woman."  Hearing this, Ming Ansheng mischievously raised his eyebrows, "Woman? Are you sure?"  Looking at her with furrowed brows and her troubled expression, he didn't know how to comfort her, so he tried to adjust the atmosphere.  "Cut it out..." Su Yue glared at Ming Ansheng without good humor but also started to laugh. When she laughed, Ming Ansheng felt the atmosphere had improved a lot, and he started to joke again, "This is all your brother's fault."  Su Yue defended her brother, "But what my brother did wasn't wrong either, he just wanted to take back the thirty percent of Rongsheng's shares. Xin Yanting liked him, but he never made any promises to her, she just assumed that my brother liked her too."  It seemed to be the case, it was indeed the case, but why did she feel conflicted when she saw Xin Yanting? Why did she feel guilty?  As Su Yue was questioning herself internally, Ming Ansheng also asked her, "So why are you conflicted?"  "I don't know either." Su Yue frustratedly ruffled her hair, "I heard that Xin Yanting even got a tattoo for my brother, how much does someone have to love another to get a tattoo for them?"  She heard this later from her sister-in-law, saying that Xin Yanting had a rose tattooed on her back, and even had her brother's name on the rose. After hearing that, she felt very uncomfortable, a woman falls in love with a man, very foolishly and innocently, as if she wants to tell the whole world, always wanting to give her best to the other person, and once she commits, she forgets her way back.  How much Xin Yanting must have loved her brother to tattoo his name onto her body, into her flesh. She definitely did not anticipate that she was just a pawn for her brother.  Perhaps she had a similar experience before, when Ceng Tangfeiling branded her chest with a hot iron, it felt as if her heart was being gouged out. If that tattoo didn't have anything to do with Ming Ansheng, it would have been nothing more than a physical pain. Chapter 1918: Without Deliberation, It's Hard to Forget (Twenty-Four)  I don't know if Xin Yanting's tattoo is still there; if it is, I wonder if it hurts every time she sees it. And if it's gone, was the removal as painful as when she first got it?  Su Jue's brows were tightly knitted as she looked out the window with a solemn expression.  Ming Ansheng glanced at her and said with a smile, "Actually, tattoos are also a form of art. Some people get them purely for the sake of art."  Su Jue knew that Ming Ansheng was trying to make her laugh, and she really did smile. Turning her head with a cold gaze, she asked, "So when you got your tattoo, was it for the sake of art or to commemorate the unfulfilled love between you and Sister Meiduo?"  Ming Ansheng pursed his lips. "Let's continue talking about Xin Yanting and your brother."  As the conversation went on, he found himself back in the line of fire. He didn't want to be metaphorically 'shot,' so he decided it was better to calmly keep her company in her troubles.  Meiduo was no longer around, and Su Jue had no intention of bringing her up to tease Ming Ansheng. It was just a casual mention; the past, no matter what, was already in the past.  Looking out the window, the streets late at night were very quiet. It wasn't in a bustling area; most of the storefronts had turned off their lights and closed their doors, dark and oppressive.  Her mood was still heavy, perhaps related to just having come from the wake.  Suddenly both of them fell silent, and the atmosphere in the car quieted down.  As the car slowly moved, Su Jue's eyelids began to droop. After passing through the residential area, the light inside the car suddenly brightened.  Su Jue opened her eyes and looked outside. It was a hospital, brightly lit at the entrance, likely a private one. The display screen above was still flashing, showing images.  She sighed again, "Oh, I also heard that Xin Yanting attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills after learning the truth. She looked down on Tang Feiling's relentless pursuit of you, supposedly being someone who could easily embrace and let go of love, someone bold in both love and hate. Yet, she ended up trying to take her own life over just a man."  This was something she heard later from Mul√≠. When Mul√≠ talked to her about it, she said she had heard it from someone else, so it was unclear if it was true.  "Hmm, so what you mean is that your brother is just a man," Ming Ansheng nodded, deliberately misinterpreting her words.  Su Jue knew he was doing it on purpose and turned her head to retort with a frown, "Don't always twist my words, okay? I'm talking about this matter; aside from all his outstanding qualities, my brother is just an ordinary man."  Setting aside his outstanding qualities, her brother was just an ordinary man... What kind of logic was that? Ming Ansheng looked at Su Jue amusedly and shook his head.  After laughing for a while, he raised his eyebrows and asked her, "But can you figure out a conclusion?"  "I can't," Su Jue shook her head vigorously and shrugged, "Forget it, I don't want to think about it anymore. No matter how much I agonize over it, I won't come to any conclusion, and it won't change my brother's feelings for her. If he doesn't like her, he just doesn't like her."  Seeing her so troubled, Ming Ansheng promptly changed the subject, "Are you hungry?"  Su Jue shook her head, "Not hungry, let's hurry up and pick up Xiaoqiao."  "Okay."  ...  When they arrived at Su Yan's house and knocked on his door, Su Yan, wearing a smoke-gray pajama, was just woken up from his sleep, his eyes still groggy.  Seeing Su Jue and Ming Ansheng, he knew they were there to pick up Xiaoqiao, and said, "Xiaoqiao is asleep, just let her stay here tonight."  Su Jue said, "She has to go to kindergarten tomorrow morning."  She had only started a few days ago and had already taken a day off today. She was still in the adaptation period and couldn't keep taking days off. Chapter 1919: Can't Stop Thinking, Hard to Forget (25)  "I'll take her there," Su Yan said while yawning. Then he turned around, pointed at the shoe cabinet, and lazily said to Su Yue, "The shoes are inside; you guys help yourselves."  He dragged his lazy steps to the sofa and sat down, while I was in the corner, yawning continuously.  Su Yue changed into her shoes and entered the room, looking at Su Yan and asking, "Which room is Xiao Qiao in?"  Su Yan stretched out his hand and pointed to a room. Su Yue walked towards that room and stopped at the door. The bedside lamp was on, its light dimmed very low.  She stood at the door and saw Su Xiao Qiao lying there, saw her peacefully sleeping face, and she didn't have the heart to disturb her at this time, in case she woke her up.  After thinking for a bit, she turned around and quietly walked away from the door, then said to Ming Ansheng, who was already sitting on the sofa, "How about I stay here tonight, and you go back alone?"  Before Ming Ansheng could speak, Su Yan preempted, "Why don't both of you stay here tonight? Just settle down here; it's very far from here to your house."  After all, he had moved to a bigger house, with plenty of rooms.  One in the south of the city and one in the north, indeed quite far.  Hearing this, Su Yue nodded in agreement without any hesitation, "Yeah, that's a good idea."  Then she looked at Ming Ansheng to discuss, "Let's stay here tonight, and we'll take Xiao Qiao to kindergarten together tomorrow morning."  Ming Ansheng pursed his lips, held back for a moment, then replied with a slight smile, "You stay here, I have a meeting at the company early tomorrow morning, I'll head back first."  He had never slept over at someone else's home, except for hotels, especially at the home of a younger... big brother-in-law; he would suffer from insomnia and be scared, okay?  He would rather drive for thirty or forty minutes to get a good sleep at home.  Hearing that he had work early the next day, Su Yue did not insist and bade him, "Then be careful on the road."  Ming Ansheng nodded, "I know, you go to sleep early."  He said this as he stood up, then looked at Su Yan, nodded at him, "I'm leaving now."  Even without adding a title or calling him "big brother," his tone sounded reluctant, and clearly, even Su Yue could hear it.  Suppressing her laughter, Su Yue escorted Ming Ansheng to the door, repeatedly telling him to be careful on the road until she saw him enter the elevator and the elevator doors closed. Only then did she return to the room.  "Ha ha ha..."   Back in the room, after closing the door, she covered her mouth and laughed.  While laughing, she walked towards Su Yan.  Su Yan looked at her amusedly and asked, "What's the matter, did you find money in the middle of the night?"  "I feel like Ming Ansheng is suffering," Su Yue said as she walked over to Su Yan and sat down next to him, still laughing.  Su Yan frowned, "Have you gone crazy?"  Su Yue said, "He wants to call you big brother, but is too embarrassed to do so."  Su Yan rolled his eyes at her, "It's not me who's tormenting him, it must be someone else."  After saying that, he closed his eyes lazily again.  "That's right, third brother!" Su Yue said, and couldn't help but burst into laughter again, "Third brother, you're so bad, always deliberately teasing him with this."  At this, Su Yan opened his eyes again, turned his head to look at her with a frown, "How is that teasing? Shouldn't he call me brother, call me third brother?"  "Should, should, okay?" Su Yue stuck out her tongue, then suddenly she moved closer to Su Yan, "Big brother."  The atmosphere suddenly became serious.  Su Yan gave her a sidelong glance, "What is it?"  "You tell me honestly, have you ever had anything happen with Xin Yanting?" Su Yue stared at Su Yan without blinking, as if afraid he would lie. Chapter 1920: Unwilling to Think, Unforgettable (Twenty-Six)  Su Yan knowingly asked, "What are you referring to?"  "You know what I mean," Su Yue pouted and hummed, "I hope you're not truly a big jerk."  Su Yan couldn't help but laugh irritably, stretching out his hand to poke Su Yue's forehead, "What are you thinking about? Go take a shower and sleep."  Then he stood up, walking lazily towards the room.  Su Yue, watching his back, also grinned, "Does that mean it's over?"  "I'm a Virgo," Su Yan's lazy voice came through.  Su Yue lifted her head to look over, his tall figure had already entered the room.  "I'm a Virgo..." Su Yue's mouth twitched; besides being a bit of a neat freak in his daily life and pursuing perfection in his emotions and career, she really couldn't see how he was anything like a Virgo. He had no demands on the people around him, was sparing with his words, and his indifferent nature always made him seem invulnerable, showing none of the typical traits of a big Virgo.  But his meaning should be that he hadn't had any substantial relationship with Xin Yanting, which made her feel quite relieved.  Su Yue sighed deeply in her heart, put down the pillow, and stood up to walk towards her room.  ...  These past few days, Yan Rusheng and Wen Xuxu spent very little time at the company, leaving most of the work piling up on Su Yan's head.  Upon arriving at the company in the morning, he buried himself in a pile of work. It took a while before the company's employees began to trickle in to start their day.  After dealing with several tricky tasks, he glanced at his wristwatch; it was only nine o'clock, just the start of the workday. He looked up towards the door and saw a bustling crowd outside the frosted glass door.  Every morning, everyone was busy.  He withdrew his gaze, reached out for the white porcelain cup on his desk, and took a look ‚Äì it still contained yesterday's boiled water.  He stood up, walking towards the water dispenser.  "Uh..."  Just as Su Yan stood up, the office door suddenly opened, and the person entering was his new secretary, Mi Xiao.  Upon seeing Su Yan, Mi Xiao was taken aback, or perhaps frightened, with a somewhat panicked expression.  Stunned for a moment, she hastily apologized, "I'm sorry, President Su, I didn't know you came in so early."  Saying that, she prepared to step back.  Su Yan shook his head, speaking indifferently, "It's alright."  Then he continued walking towards the water dispenser.  He often came in early, but this new secretary had not encountered it before; it wasn't a big deal.  Mi Xiao watched Su Yan for a while, and perhaps confirming that he wasn't angry, she then pushed her glasses up on the bridge of her nose and stepped into the office.  She was holding two green file folders and walked to Su Yan's desk, looking at him cautiously.  Su Yan poured a cup of water and drank it as he walked back to his desk.  If there wasn't a board meeting or an important executive meeting, he didn't like to wear a tie. A white shirt and black suit pants, comfortable and casual, along with his naturally indifferent handsome face, were pleasing to the eye.  He approached Mi Xiao, swallowed the water he had just drunk, looked down at her slight figure and asked, "What is it?"  The new secretary had been working for just over two weeks, and this was the first time he was this close to her, realizing that the secretary he hired was so short.  To see her clearly, he had to lower his head.  Large black-framed glasses nearly covered half her face, and bangs cut straight across her forehead, making her look rather plain at first glance.  Unintentionally, Su Yan gave his new secretary Mi Xiao a once-over. Chapter 1921: Unwilling to Think, But Hard to Forget (Twenty-Seven)  He then mocked himself internally, as everyone said he was past the prime age for discussing marriage and was worried for him, urging him to interact more with women. In truth, he was only just 28 years old, but since she and Yueyue were both anxious for him.  So, this time he simply found a female secretary, but whom was he trying to appease?  Su Yan scrutinized without leaving a trace, so Mi Xiao did not notice. She handed over two halves of a document with both hands, "President Su, these documents are all waiting for your signature."  Su Yan hummed a response, reached out to take them, put the documents on the table, flipped them open, glanced at them, and then signed his name.  While he was signing, Mi Xiao continued, "You have lunch with Director Wang from the Hundred Corporations Group at noon."  "Uh-huh, I know. Are there any other schedules?" Su Yan nodded and asked while handing the signed documents back to Mi Xiao.  Mi Xiao took the documents, shook her head, "No more."  Just after she answered, she seemed to remember something, "Oh right, Miss Erelie called earlier, asking if President Su is free tonight."  When he heard the name 'Erelie,' Su Yan's expression paused momentarily as if in thought. After a moment, he nodded lightly to Mi Xiao, "I got it."  He did not directly answer Mi Xiao whether he was available or not.  "Then I will go out first."   Mi Xiao, holding the documents, nodded slightly to Su Yan, then turned and walked towards the door.  She wore black boat shoes with a three to four centimeter heel, making her slender legs look even more delicate. Walking on the wooden floor, her footsteps made a 'clump clump' sound, gentle, like her demeanor, petite, and with a style completely different from Erelie's high-profile and flamboyance.  Su Yan couldn't help but turn his head to look towards the door, seeing Mi Xiao's smaller figure, her ponytail gently swaying behind her back. He felt inexplicably comfortable. As Mi Xiao opened the door and stepped out, Su Yan suddenly opened his mouth to call out, "Mi Xiao, make me a cup of black tea."  "Okay."   Mi Xiao stopped in her tracks, turned her head to respond to Su Yan, and then went out.  Su Yan sat back down at his spot. After a knock on the door and his permission, Mi Xiao pushed the door and entered.  After entering, she pushed her glasses up on the bridge of her nose. It should have been a habitual action, but in Su Yan's eyes, it seemed awkward, as if she wasn't used to wearing glasses. But this was nothing strange; maybe she had just gotten glasses for myopia, or maybe it was his mistaken impression.  Su Yan didn't think too much of it, just glanced at Mi Xiao and continued to work with his head down.  "President Su, your black tea is ready."  Mi Xiao had brewed the tea and walked over to Su Yan.  "Uh-huh, put it here."  Su Yan nodded without looking up.  "Okay."  Mi Xiao placed the teacup in front of Su Yan, and as she was about to withdraw her hands, Su Yan finally lifted his eyelids, his gaze inadvertently sweeping over her hands.  Her hands were small and fair, but the joints of her fingers were somewhat prominent, resembling hands that had seen hard work.  He wasn't present during the hiring process; it was all arranged by the HR department, so regarding this new secretary, he only knew her name, the university she graduated from, and that she was a recent graduate who came out to intern early.  He was unaware of the rest, including where she was registered, whether she was from the countryside or a city person, whether she had other internship experiences, etc.  He was completely clueless. Chapter 1922: Unintentional Thoughts, Inevitably Remembered (Twenty-Eight)  As Su Yan thought to himself, he lifted his head to look at Mi Xiao from a top-down angle. Actually, Mi Xiao wasn't that tall, and even as he sat, he wasn't much shorter than her. However, looking from a different angle gave him a different feeling.  This girl's petite melon-seed-shaped face was quiet and gentle, her skin clean and fair, and even though her straight-across bangs and large black-rimmed glasses were plain to the point of being dull, the feeling she gave him was the same as the impression her silhouette had given him earlier‚Äîcomfortable, as if basking in the spring breeze.  It seems that viewing a girl from different angles is important, no wonder those women always take selfies from the same angle, probably because it's their best angle. That's why on their Weibo and Facebook, the photos they post are always from the same angle, in almost the same pose.  As Su Yan thought about it, he couldn't help but shake his head with a smile, seemingly forgetting that his new secretary was still in front of him. Mi Xiao looked at Su Yan with a puzzled face, probably curious as to why he had suddenly started laughing.  Feeling Mi Xiao's gaze, he lifted his head, met her questioning eyes, and his smile naturally faded, returning to his usual indifference. It was odd that he had been studying a woman, an ordinary secretary, so intently.  Seeing the smile disappear from Su Yan's face, Mi Xiao quickly asked, "President Su, is there anything else you need?"  Su Yan shook his head, "No, you can go now."  "Okay." Mi Xiao nodded her head, turned around to leave, but then Su Yan seemed to remember something and raised his head to tell her, "Reply to Arielle that I am free after work this evening."  "Oh," Mi Xiao nodded in response, her tone sounding somewhat dejected. Anyone would feel dejected, considering Miss Arielle was very familiar with President Su, casually entering and leaving his office. Their relationship, which seemed unusual in the eyes of all their colleagues, why didn't they contact each other privately, instead of through the office phone?  In the afternoon, Su Yan received another call from Mi Xiao, saying that Arielle had called and they had already made plans to have dinner together that evening.  ...  "President Su, if there's nothing else, may I leave work now?" It was 5:10 PM, ten minutes past the end of the workday, when Mi Xiao knocked on the door of Su Yan's office and stood at the entrance, asking him.  Although she always seemed very careful, her speech and actions had good logic and efficiency. It always felt like she would make a clumsy mistake, but so far, she hadn't made a single one, just like a child learning to walk‚Äîyou always feel like they might fall over, but they remain upright like a Weeble.  Su Yan thought about it and couldn't help but smile again; the feeling was strange, and for some reason, it felt familiar. Mi Xiao was still waiting for his reply. He collected his thoughts and said to her, "Make me another cup of coffee."  He still had a lot of work to do and needed to perk up.  "Oh..." Mi Xiao, who had been standing with her legs together, stepped forward with a sense of urgency in her step. She approached the office, came up to Su Yan, reached out to pick up his cup, then suddenly seemed to remember something, looked at him, and asked uncertainly, "President Su, should I brew it?"  Her expression gave Su Yan the impression that she was asking, annoyed and dissatisfied: It's so late, why the hell are you still drinking brewed coffee, such a hassle.  Thinking this, Su Yan couldn't help but smile again, then he said, "If you have something urgent, then instant is also fine."  He felt that Mi Xiao seemed to have something urgent; after all, it was already past working hours, and there were no difficult tasks waiting for her, so there was no need to delay her personal matters. Chapter 1923: Without Intention, Hard to Forget (Twenty-nine)  "I don't have anything urgent." Mi Xiao shook her head, and her neat bangs swayed with the movement. Under the light, they were exceptionally black and smooth.  However, the emotions that leaked from her clear eyes didn't feel that sincere to Su Yan. He obviously seemed very anxious...  He pretended not to notice and waved his hand at her, saying, "Then go and make it, don't add any sugar."  "Okay." Mi Xiao nodded, her small hands clutching the cup tightly.  When she turned around, Su Yan caught her frowning.  Su Yan smiled and shook his head; he really was bored from working all day long, to the point of teasing a little girl.  The coffee machine was in his office. Mi Xiao was fiddling with it over there while he flipped through his phone here, waiting for the coffee to start, the aroma drifting over.  He put down his phone and looked over. The girl was standing in front of the coffee machine, her back to him, waiting for the coffee to be ready. She was so still that she seemed to be deep in thought, very quiet.  Su Yan was stunned. He liked and longed for this feeling. When he was working, there was someone quietly by his side who didn't affect his work at all but was still there.  Not like... Xin Yanting, not like her, always trying to make her presence known.  "Su Yan, I just bought this bag today, Burberry's new model; it matches my white dress well, doesn't it?"  "Su Yan, which color of this lipstick looks better than the one I wore yesterday?"  "Su Yan, do you want to drink milk tea?"  "Su Yan, can you take me with you to Europe?"  "Su Yan, you..."  Thinking of Xin Yanting and all the things she used to say in his ear, he felt self-mockery in his heart.  He didn't know how he had put up with it.  It seemed that he was indeed just like most men, not too noble, not too individualistic, not too different.  "President Su, the coffee is ready."  Su Yan was lost in thought when Mi Xiao came to him with the brewed coffee.  The steaming coffee, with its hot steam and fragrance, entered his nose. Su Yan looked down and saw Mi Xiao's slightly rough hands again.  He said offhandedly, "Have a cup too."  It was just a casual remark, but Mi Xiao was surprised, staring with wide eyes for a second or two before reacting, "No thanks."  She shook her head gently, just surprised for a moment, and did not feel flattered by the invitation to have coffee together.  Very indifferent.  Su Yan raised an eyebrow, "Got urgent business?"  Mi Xiao shook her head again, "No."  It's obvious, yet still asking, asking your sister.  Impatience was already apparent on her face, probably without her realizing it herself. Su Yan smiled and decided not to tease Mi Xiao any further, saying lightly, "If there's nothing else, you can get off work."  After addressing her, he picked up the coffee, took a sip, and prepared to dive back into work.  There was still a lot of work to do.  Mi Xiao felt relieved, the uncontrollable impatience on her face also disappearing.  "Then I'll get off work first."  She nodded slightly to Su Yan, then remembered something and reminded him, "President Su, you have dinner with Miss Eireli at seven tonight."  Su Yan nodded, "Hmm."  Seven o'clock...  He watched Mi Xiao leave his office, took a look at the time on the bottom right of his computer screen‚Äîit was already six o'clock.  He picked up his phone, hesitating, when suddenly there was a knock at the door. He lifted his eyelids to look, and through the frosted glass door, he saw a tall figure. Chapter 1924: Unwilling to Think, Yet Hard to Forget (30)  "Come in." He put away the complex thoughts he had just had and responded indifferently to the door, then reached out to tidy up the documents and other items on the table.  The door opened, and a tall, fashionable beauty entered his sight. He was not surprised and greeted her politely with a faint smile, calling her 'Miss Ai'.  Ai Rui Li was wearing a light aqua printed blouse and white skinny pants that perfectly outlined her slender figure. Different from her work time, she had light makeup on her face, showing off her good complexion.  She was still wearing high heels not less than ten centimeters tall, also in a light color, and her outfit was very spring-like and fresh.  She walked gracefully towards Su Yan, smiling at him while she spoke, "President Su, I was afraid you would be busy, so I came up to wait for you."  Su Yan pressed his lips together and shook his head, "It's okay, I've also finished my work, we can leave." Saying this, he closed his laptop, stood up, walked over to the coat rack, and took down his jacket, draping it over his arm.  Ai Rui Li looked at the mountain of work on his desk and sincerely said to him, "President Su, I don't have anything tonight, and I'm not hungry, so there's no rush for dinner."  It was not easy to have the opportunity to be alone with him, and going to a restaurant would make the environment even more exciting.  It would be happiness just to sit here and watch him work.  Ai Rui Li stared at Su Yan's handsome face, slightly lost in her fantasies.  "Let's go earlier, I've booked the place for seven o'clock," Su Yan said indifferently, lifting his foot and walking towards the office door.  He had already left, and Ai Rui Li had no reason to stay, so she hurriedly followed him.  Along the way, she was looking for topics to chat with Su Yan, but she did it unobtrusively, very naturally, and casually.  Not like some people, chattering incessantly, making it obvious that they are deliberately looking for topics.  Su Yan held the steering wheel with both hands, looking ahead on the road. It was already early summer, the days had become longer, and it was still bright past six o'clock, but most of the shops that were still doing business at night had already turned on their lights.  Neon lights were flashing, and his mood suddenly became complex, inexplicably so.  "President Su, the red light!" Ai Rui Li suddenly exclaimed in alarm, interrupting his thoughts. Su Yan snapped back to reality, but the car had already entered the intersection and passed the crosswalk.  The traffic and pedestrians had already started moving, and he couldn't accelerate through the intersection, so he had to brake urgently.  The car stopped, the inertia was significant, but fortunately, both of them were prepared, so there were no injuries.  After the car steadied, Ai Rui Li calmed her heartbeat and turned to look at Su Yan with concern, asking, "President Su, what were you so engrossed in thinking about just now?"  "Work stuff," Su Yan replied casually, then showed Ai Rui Li an apologetic smile, "I'm sorry to have startled you."  Ai Rui Li shook her head, "I'm fine."  The red light ended, the green light came on again, and the car started up slowly, crossing the street.  Su Yan tried hard to control his emotions and thoughts, not letting himself get distracted again.  Actually, he didn't even know what he was thinking about just now; he was clearly listening to Ai Rui Li talking about recent stock issues.  But as he listened, he became lost in thought.  At seven o'clock, it was dinner time, and in the upscale Western restaurant, there were no empty seats as far as the eye could see.  They had reserved a seat in advance, so there was no need to worry about not having a spot.  Their reserved spot was a private booth, separated by beaded curtains, although also in the main hall, the environment was relatively much quieter and more elegant. Chapter 1925: Unintentional, Unforgettable (Thirty-One)  The meal was ready and quickly served; they ordered classic steaks and the signature snacks made by the head chef of the restaurant. Aireli also ordered a bottle of red wine.  The young male waiter, tall and slender, served their meals and then opened the red wine for them, ready to pour. Aireli looked up and smiled slightly at him, "Thank you, we can pour it ourselves."  Hearing this, the waiter put down the wine bottle, nodded slightly at them, and left.  In the private dining area, only the two of them remained. Su Yan had taken off his suit jacket and was now wearing a white shirt; he had undone his cufflinks and rolled up his sleeves a bit.  Holding a knife in one hand and a fork in the other, he skillfully and elegantly cut his steak.  "President Su, let's have a drink," Aireli said, picking up the bottle of red wine and tilting it toward Su Yan's glass, the mouth of the bottle tipping slowly downwards.  Su Yan glanced at it and opened his mouth, as if he wanted to stop her.  Aireli noticed this and, even though she stopped pouring the wine, looked at Su Yan.  Suddenly, Su Yan lowered his eyelids again and continued to cut his steak without saying a word.  This was taken as tacit approval, an agreement.  Aireli smiled slightly and elegantly poured wine into Su Yan's glass, and then a bit for herself.  After pouring the wine, she put down the bottle, picked up her glass, raised it towards Su Yan, and said with a smile, "President Su, let's have a drink to celebrate our pleasant cooperation in advance."  Su Yan put down his fork, picked up his glass, and clinked it against Aireli's, saying in a light tone, "To a pleasant cooperation."  Both took an elegant sip of wine.  Then Aireli looked at Su Yan and said with a smile, "Actually, I'm quite surprised."  Su Yan raised his eyebrows inquisitively, waiting for Aireli to continue.  Aireli said, "I'm surprised that you agreed to come out for dinner today, President Su. My impression of you is that you're always so busy. Every time I see you, you're very preoccupied and don't even have time to talk."  Hearing this, Su Yan smiled apologetically, "I'm very sorry; perhaps I haven't been a good host."  Aireli waved her hand, "It's okay, I know that's how successful people are."  As she spoke, she picked up her glass and took a small sip.  Her sexy red lips, painted with alluring lipstick and stained with red wine, looked particularly sensual and added a touch of temptation that men couldn't resist.  It was unclear whether she did it on purpose or not, but she didn't use a napkin to wipe the corner of her mouth, allowing the wine to remain on her lips while she smiled at Su Yan.  Unfortunately for her, Su Yan's gaze did not linger on her face; he gave a courteous glance and then continued to cut his steak methodically.  After a busy day of work, having lunch with clients and missing afternoon tea, he was genuinely hungry now.  Aireli, feeling somewhat let down upon seeing Su Yan so engrossed in eating, listlessly took a napkin and wiped her mouth.  She also picked up her knife and fork and began cutting the steak to eat.  She was a big star, an actress with millions of fans; even if she was interested in a man, she would not act like a lovesick girl in front of him.  The two fell into silence, remaining so until the meal was over.  After settling the bill, Su Yan and Aireli walked out of the restaurant side by side, with Aireli putting on her sunglasses as they walked.  "Niuniu, be careful."  As they walked out through the revolving door, a woman with a little girl entered it. The girl looked about three or four years old and was chubby.  Aireli thought of something and looked at Su Yan to ask, "President Su, that cute little girl in your office the other day, is she your niece?"
