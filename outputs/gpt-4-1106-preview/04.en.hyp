Chapter 368: Out of Danger  The situation was completely one-sided, with both sides firing with all their might, and the entire sky above the ocean was filled with gunpowder smoke. Bai Ye once again fired his high-speed magnetic wave scanning gun, and another airplane was blown to pieces. This gun was really useful, and he was getting addicted to it. Xiao Nai Bao commanded with ease, and the air force of the First Terrorist Organization formed an indestructible attack and defense team, initiating the final fierce assault.  Upon seeing the unfavorable situation, Nickla could not care about rank and raised his voice, "Master, we should retreat. If we continue to fight like this, our entire army will be wiped out."  Luis clenched his fists tightly, his face gloomy and his body full of murderous aura. He could clearly see the current situation, but he was unwilling to retreat just like that, especially when victory was within reach, and they could have captured them. It was infuriating to think that their efforts would be wasted so close to success.  The man's emerald green eyes flashed with a murderous intent, which then retreated back into his silent and melancholic gaze. He nodded at Nickla, who immediately ordered a cover retreat.  Luis gazed at the two figures drifting above the sea and scoffed coldly. This time they were just lucky; he would not let them go so easily.  "Baby, they are retreating. Should we pursue?" Bai Ye chuckled lightly. He was very fond of the magnetic wave scanning gun, holding it as if he were holding a child, with his lips curling into an indifferent and dangerous smile.  Xiao Nai Bao also smiled elegantly, ordering to stop the attack, with a calm tranquility in his dark, large eyes, he slowly said, "No pursuit. It would be too much of a pity to let him die just like that. The game of cat and mouse has only just begun."  This game had already turned the tide.  Luis, he should not have provoked him. Nuonuo's death, someone must accompany her in death; otherwise, he could not swallow this grievance. When the game would start, Luis could decide, but...  With a cold smile on Xiao Nai Bao's face, compelling and forceful, he decided when it would end.  Bai Ye smiled, casually brushing his sleeve, "Fine, no pursuit. We have the capital to play with him. It might not even be our turn to take action before someone is eager to deal with Luis."  Xiao Nai Bao looked in the direction of their escape and sneered without saying a word.  "Chu Li, it's over, no need for support. Let's head back immediately," Bai Ye said after finishing the phone call with Chu Li and ordered his subordinates to turn back to Rome.  It took a tremendous effort for Black Hawk and others to pull Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya out of the water. They knew that Cheng Anya had a virus and had taken protective measures in advance. Ye Sanshao also warned them that he was carrying a virus, so Black Hawk and the others were even more cautious.  Ye Sanshao lay there, gasping for air, and couldn't help but kick Miss Cheng, "Xiao Anya, you need to lose some weight, you're so heavy."  His entire shoulder was a bit numb because he had been swimming in the sea for a long time, which had consumed a lot of his energy, and then having to drag Cheng Anya along was indeed quite a strain on his arm.  He had almost failed to hold onto her and dropped her into the sea. The thought of that moment still made him shudder.  Black Hawk and the others cheered for their safety, passing towels and pouring hot water, everyone was busy, and some even took the opportunity to joke about how Ye Sanshao had been doing these days.  The airplane was lively, with men gathered together, there was an air of boldness.  Cheng Anya took a towel from Black Hawk to dry her hair, and wrapped herself with a blanket to warm up her chilled body. She automatically blocked out his words and finally felt safe. She sneezed and couldn't help but wrap herself a little tighter.  Black Hawk chuckled and said, "Third Master, if the lady loses any more weight, you'll complain about her being all bones."  "I'm complaining now," Ye Sanshao got up, drying off the seawater on his body. "It's because she's all bones that she's so heavy."  Cheng Anya continued to uphold the virtue that silence is golden. Black Hawk found two sets of clothes for them to change into. Since they were men's clothes, they looked comical on Miss Cheng, so she simply wrapped herself in a blanket.  Just after changing clothes, Black Hawk informed her that Ningning wanted to speak with her. Cheng Anya excitedly snatched the microphone, "Baby, it's Mommy."  "Hi, Mommy, did you miss your baby?" Xiao Nai Bao sat on the sofa, smiling and chatting with Cheng Anya, having missed her voice for a long time.  "Not at all." Cheng Anya snorted coldly, showing a fierce tone, "You're too clumsy, taking so long to find Mommy, you deserve a spanking."  Ningning thought of his promise, his heart tightened, but then he smiled, "Okay, baby accepts the spanking. Once we get back to Rome, you can spank however you want. I really missed Mommy, you don't love me enough, I despise you."  "Despise you back." Cheng Anya laughed loudly, worriedly asking, "You didn't get hurt, did you?"  "No, I'm fine, not a scratch, don't worry," Ningning said with a smile, "Mommy, the plane is about to land, we'll talk later."  "Okay." Xiao Nai Bao turned off the communicator, Cheng Anya sipped hot water to warm up, and Ye Sanshao, who had been eagerly hoping to chat with his son, was hung up on before he could, leaving him very dissatisfied, looking at Cheng Anya with accusing eyes.  Miss Cheng calmly ignored him, and Black Hawk said with a smile, "Third Master, the plane is about to land, you'll be able to see the young master soon."  Ye Sanshao felt completely ignored and couldn't help but pinch Miss Cheng, "Heartless little thing."  "Stingy ghost." Cheng Anya laughed and scolded, handing him the hot water. Ye Sanshao took it, drinking the remaining hot water in Miss Cheng's cup, thinking how wonderful it would be to have some alcohol to warm up at this moment.  The plane landed soon after, all descending into the castle. Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, and others were all there. Seeing Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya safe, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.  "Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, you really look ragged..." Ye Wei laughed, her body trembling, "Third Brother, I should have taken a picture as a memento."  "Stinky girl." Ye Sanshao scolded with a laugh. With Weiwei, Eleven, and Xiao Nai Bao all safe, he finally felt at ease.  After all this trouble, how could anything go wrong? Xiao Nai Bao cheerfully wanted to hug Cheng Anya but was sternly stopped by her. Xiao Nai Bao then remembered that his mommy had a virus, as Black Hawk had already mentioned, and then he looked at the hands his daddy and mommy were holding, feeling a slight heaviness in his heart.  "Daddy, Mommy, you both..." Bai Ye, you have to check on them quickly."  Xiao Nai Bao's first reaction was to find Bai Ye, who was a genius doctor and there was no disease he couldn't cure.  "I got it, I got it, don't worry," Bai Ye said with a smile.  "Virus?" A handsome man with golden hair and blue eyes blinked, "Xiao Bai, this isn't your strong suit, right?"  Xiao Bai? Bai Ye twisted his wrist, smiling suavely and gently, "Jason, try calling me Xiao Bai one more time?"  "... Damn, what's wrong with calling you Xiao Bai? You're Xiao Bai, and they even call Black Jack Xiao Tie."  Jason, known as the fire dragon, burst into flames on the spot, looking like a golden lion king, but still infuriatingly handsome. Especially those sapphire blue eyes, so dazzling. When he got angry, there was a kind of intimidating aura, like a volcanic eruption, with a very outwardly dominant presence.  Beside him, Black Jack, a man in his twenties, had a very delicate appearance, a mix of Chinese and English blood, with mysterious features of an Easterner and the depth of a Westerner, and a pair of gray-blue eyes that always seemed misty, giving the illusion of deep affection, but upon closer inspection, one would find that he was extremely sharp, with a kind of hidden depth.  The two leaders of the First Terrorist Organization, both young, with contrasting personalities, but both with a strong presence, each had an aura of reigning supreme, let alone having all three of the major leaders here.  This lineup was visually impactful.  "Jason, you really need a lesson," Eleven snorted, "Why call him Xiao Bai? Xiao Bai, beat him up."  Everyone, "......"  Ye Wei shook her head with a glance, "Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, don't bother with them, you guys should take a hot bath, and then get checked later, to avoid getting sick."  She summoned the maids to take Ye Chen and Cheng Anya to wash up. Xiao Nai Bao wanted to follow, but he stayed here, as Bai Ye looked like he was about to beat someone up, so Xiao Nai Bao quickly grabbed his sleeve.  "Bai Ye, can you save my daddy and mommy?" Xiao Nai Bao's eyes were bright, like two black grapes embedded in his tender face, full of hope, as if the light in his eyes would dim if Bai Ye shook his head.  Jason grabbed Xiao Nai Bao and hugged him, full of pride, "Baby, don't worry, Xiao Bai can even save the dead, let alone the living. Stop worrying about nothing, come help me bombard the mafia's defenses when you're free."  "Who was questioning Bai Ye's medical skills just now?" Black Jack expressed doubt, and with a palm strike, Jason swiftly dodged.  Xiao Nai Bao struggled a bit, and Jason put him down. Xiao Nai Bao asked, "Bai Ye..."  "Ningning, wait until I've examined them before I can be sure, don't be anxious," Bai Ye said, ruffling Xiao Nai Bao's head, "I promise to do my best."  Xiao Nai Bao had just lost NuoNuo, and with his parents' lives hanging by a thread, it was natural for him to feel uneasy, no matter how calm he was. He couldn't lose them again, and Bai Ye understood his psychology well.  "Don't worry too much," Bai Ye said.  Ye Wei said, "That settles it, leave it to Bai Ye, there is no unsolvable problem in this world. Since Luis could develop a virus, there must be an antidote, it's not possible to have no solution, if Bai Ye can't solve it, we'll take down his signboard."  Chu Li smiled, "Agreed."  "Xiao Bai, do you have a signboard?" Jason was puzzled; he never knew he had one. Eleven was very tempted to punch him.  "Speaking of which, why didn't you two catch Luis and bring him back?" Black Jack asked, "If that guy died earlier, we would have been at ease."  "I've wanted to annihilate him long ago. Recently, the mafia has been provoking us everywhere. Even after his headquarters were bombed, he still has the mood to engage in romantic affairs, truly incompetent."  "Luis is not in a hurry," Xiao Nai Bao said slowly, his face forming a dangerous arc, and his black eyes full of calculating light, "Winning without a battle is the highest realm of victory. It's one thing that he has a personal vendetta with us, but the struggle between the mafia and the terrorist organization is another matter. If we want to exterminate the mafia, it will definitely cost a lot of financial and material resources. After this incident, his position within the mafia is precarious. I've always suspected that there is another force hidden in places we can't see in the mafia. Otherwise, they would not allow Luis to engage in such self-destructive actions. Since that's the case, we'll let Luis lead the way for us, draw out this force, and annihilate them in one fell swoop."  Cunning... That was everyone's unanimous thought. Although they knew he was always scheming and sinister, because of his young age, everyone couldn't help but dote on him. Plus, with such a cute appearance, it was easy to overlook his true nature.  "Treacherous!" Jason gave a thumbs up. He had always been about action, not thinking too much like the others. However, he usually listened to Black Jack and Chu Li's plans. Xiao Nai Bao's plans, he always followed without question.  An action-oriented leader with a strong think-tank was a terrifying force.  "Ningning's method, I agree," Chu Li said, as he and Bai Ye always agreed with his ideas, "Once and for all, so that no one dares to challenge us again."  "Ningning's words, when have you ever refuted them? You're in cahoots," Black Jack laughed, "But this time, we really should teach the mafia a lesson, let them avoid us for fifty years."  Bai Ye nodded; he had no objections. His priority was to find a cure for the virus on Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya. That was the most important thing, leaving the rest to Chu Li.  Ye Wei and Eleven exchanged glances. Another force? In their minds, they both thought of the same face. Was it Mo Ye and Mo Yu? In the mafia, only they would have enough charisma and be mysterious enough. Besides them, they couldn't think of anyone else who could have such courage, a man who should have been superior to Luis, it made no sense for them to obey him.  The group moved to the living room, Xiao Nai Bao went to find Cheng Anya, she had just finished her bath and had drunk a cup of hot tea. Her body was warm, her cheeks flushed with a hint of pink, and she was lying on the bed, lost in thought as she looked at her fingers.  "Mommy..." Xiao Nai Bao pushed the door and entered, walking over with a smile.  Cheng Anya came back to her senses and squinted, praising, "Baby, you really have style."  This outfit really had a presence. There wasn't a hint of a child about him; he was a dangerous person through and through.  "Thanks for the compliment, Mommy."  "Don't come closer, sit farther away, I'm afraid I won't be able to resist hitting you," Cheng Anya pointed to the sofa opposite, "Sit there."  Xiao Nai Bao gave Cheng Anya a grievous look, "Mommy, you're rejecting me."  "Correct," Cheng Anya said with a smile, glancing at Xiao Nai Bao. She always felt that there was something different about the child. Although he seemed no different from before, a mother knows her child best. Any changes in him, no matter how well hidden, she could usually sense.  "Mommy, are you looking at me like that because you think your baby is handsome?" Xiao Nai Bao playfully blinked, looking extremely adorable.  Cheng Anya looked at him with a half-smile, "You've learned eight or nine points of your daddy's vanity. How have you been recently? Tell Mommy the truth. Were you bullied?"  Xiao Nai Bao shook his head, "No."  "Nonsense, Luis showed me photos, you were clearly covered in blood," Cheng Anya was clearly unconvinced, grinding her teeth, "He deserves to be hacked to pieces, I can't let it go."  Thinking of her own experiences, Cheng Anya felt extreme hatred towards Luis. Her bright face was covered with a layer of coldness, and remembering what Xiao Nai Bao had suffered, she had a bad premonition.  "Mommy, I'm really okay. Most of it must have been fabricated," Xiao Nai Bao said elegantly, rolling up his sleeve to reveal a fair arm, "Look, not a single scar."  The bullet wound on his arm was mostly healed, and he wasn't afraid of Cheng Anya finding out. The whip marks he had received were left by NuoNuo. Since they were inflicted by NuoNuo, he didn't feel bullied; instead, he was somewhat nostalgic for the pain of being beaten by her.  If NuoNuo could live, he would be willing to be beaten by her for the rest of his life.  "Ningning, are you really okay?" Cheng Anya's brows furrowed, not missing the fleeting pain in her son's eyes.  Xiao Nai Bao nodded, "I'm really fine, Mommy. The ones in trouble are you and daddy. Uncle Black Hawk said you have a virus. How did daddy get it too?"  "..." Cheng Anya thought of Ye Sanshao, who was driven by lust, her cheeks reddened again, and she lost the desire to speak, "Don't mention it. I jumped out of a plane in the desert and then again over the sea. How could we not have come into contact?"  Miss Cheng spoke very calmly, and Xiao Nai Bao didn't doubt her.  "Mommy, it'll be fine. Bai Ye is so skilled in medicine, he will surely have a way to save you both." Chapter 369: Self-Help for Adequate Food and Clothing  After Bai Ye conducted a detailed examination for them and drew blood from the two for a more comprehensive analysis, his face showed a rare seriousness, and Xiao Nai Bao had a bad premonition. When Cheng An Ya was hit and infected by bacteria, the doctors concluded that amputation was necessary to save her life. However, Bai Ye didn't even take a look and left a sarcastic remark before elegantly entering the laboratory. It seemed like there was no disease that could challenge the genius doctor Bai Ye. Last year, when Chu Li was shot 23 times, Bai Ye remained calm and composed. This was a confidence that transcended others; in this field, he was a legendary figure who shouldn't be stumped by any disease.  But this time, just as Jason had predicted, the virus was not Bai Ye's strong suit. Once he showed a serious expression, it meant that things were bad. Jason even patted Bai Ye's shoulder sympathetically.  "You finally encountered a difficult case, how rare. It's like Xiao Nai Bao being a legend in the field of computer technology, only to be surpassed by the brothers Mo Ye and Mo Yue." Bai Ye summoned over a dozen virus experts from Rome to the castle to study together, casting a serious atmosphere over the entire castle.  The patient herself was quite calm. Cheng An Ya had come to terms with her fate, feeling that even death was no big deal. In her life, she had loved passionately, with her beloved Ye Chen, the doting Ning Ning, a happy family, and a fairly successful career. She had experienced almost everything a woman could in her life.  Now, she was content with living such a tumultuous life of ups and downs. Her only regret was that she might not see Ning Ning again. But now that this wish had been fulfilled, she was indifferent to life and death. Ye San Shao cared even less; neither were people who feared death, and they were much calmer than expected.  Chu Li called it a spirit.  At the moment, everyone was in the conference hall discussing the virus and the fact that Ye San Shao only had five days left to live. Suddenly, Cheng An Ya remembered something, "Rong Yan gave us an agent that delayed the onset of the virus, it should be able to postpone it for a few days."  In the joy of their reunion, she had almost forgotten about Rong Yan and Chu Li. Although Rong Yan hadn't explicitly asked them to bring a message to Chu Li, how could they not? It was an unspoken understanding. Even if Rong Yan didn't mention it, Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao would still inform Chu Li.  Chu Li's eyes widened sharply, his gaze fixed on Cheng An Ya with a calm but urgent sharpness that startled her. Jason and Black Jack, who were joking around, also suddenly fell silent.  "You have news of Rong Yan."  Chu Li asked calmly, his voice ordinary but overly restrained. His body was tense, and it was obvious to everyone that he was stiff.  Xiao Nai Bao was also surprised. Ye San Shao recounted the events, and Chu Li stood up abruptly, saying, "Thanks!" He left only these two words before rushing out, with Jason and Black Jack quickly following.  Ye Wei laughed, "Dark Chu is thrilled this time. Look at how anxious he is; it's a rare sight in a hundred years."  The number one terror organization was about to launch a large-scale military operation. If the three giants went to battle together, it would be an earth-shattering intensity. Ye Wei mentally offered condolences to Prince William.  Somebody's territory was definitely gone, and maybe even the entire thing would be lost.  Since Rong Yan could come up with it, Bai Ye should also be able to, Xiao Nai Bao pondered. Right now, his entire mind was focused on the virus affecting his dad and mom, thinking when a man came over, "Young master, Brother Chu asked you to go to the study room."  Xiao Nai Bao pursed his lips, "Dad, Mom, I'll come over to accompany you in a while."  Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao exchanged glances, both feeling the sense of having a grown-up son. It seemed that Xiao Nai Bao had made up his mind about the first terror organization. Looking at his momentum, he was very different from the obedient son in front of her.  Well, since their son had chosen his path, then they should support him in seeing it through to the end. Cheng An Ya was supportive.  Ye San Shao was quite pleased. It was something to be proud and proud of that his son had grown up.  Cheng An Ya thoughtfully watched his figure disappear into the corridor, then turned to ask Ye Wei, "Wei Wei, did something happen to Ning Ning?"  A mother knows her child best. She asked because Xiao Nai Bao didn't say anything, but it didn't mean she truly believed nothing was wrong.  Ye Wei admired her sister-in-law's sharpness. She and Eleven exchanged glances, wondering whether to mention the matter with Xu Nuo. Ye San Shao could tell at a glance that something was being kept from them.  "Wei Wei, just tell us."  Ye Wei looked at them and relayed the events with Ning Ning and Xu Nuo, including Xu Nuo's death and Xiao Nai Bao's blindness, without omission.  The more Cheng An Ya listened, the heavier her heart became. No wonder she felt that her son's eyes were different now, no longer as clear and clean as before. Even with his background, he was still just a child with a bit of innocence.  But some experiences and shocks change a person's gaze, making them feel different; it wasn't just her being over-sensitive.  Ye San Shao also frowned slightly, feeling distressed over his son's experiences and blaming himself deeply. If it had been Cheng An Ya who died for him, he probably would have gone mad, not just blind.  This was similar to his past experiences of being withdrawn.  "Is the girl confirmed dead?" Cheng An Ya asked.  Ye Wei nodded, "Our people searched, confirmed dead. Speaking of Nuo Nuo, it just annoys me..."  Ye Wei slammed the table, recounting Xu Nuo's background, "All the bad things have fallen on Nuo Nuo; God really is a bastard."  Ye San Shao paused, "Xu Mingyang, I have some business dealings with him. He seems upright, I can't see how he would be so superstitious. Is there more to it?"  "It's not like that," Eleven said, "I've checked the Miao family's records; they indeed have such a life chart. Although it's fortune-telling, it's very accurate. The Miao family does have such a curse. However, there are many ways to deal with it; they shouldn't have abandoned Xu Nuo. Letting someone else raise her would have been acceptable; these parents were too heartless."  Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao were both silent, which meant that their son's future was worrisome.  Especially Cheng An Ya, she wasn't being overly anxious, but she knew her son best. He seemed unchanged from the past, but that was just appearance. Once the heart becomes desolate, it's like a walking corpse.  "Third Sister-in-law, don't worry too much. Ning Ning is still young; maybe he'll be better as he grows up," Ye Wei said, after all, they were just two children. No matter how deep the affection, it would fade with time.  No matter how profound the love in this world is, it cannot withstand the erosion of time.  Cheng An Ya smiled faintly, humming in response. What Ye Wei said was just to comfort them. Even Ye San Shao knew that forgetting is harder than remembering.  Falling in love with someone takes just a second.  Forgetting someone, however, takes a lifetime.  Ye San Shao inquired about the current situation of the Dragon Gate, and Ye Wei didn't hide anything, telling him everything. The situation wasn't optimistic; the three giants of the Dragon Gate all had troubles, especially Lin Yi Xuan, who was in constant trouble recently.  "Brother, don't worry about this. You should focus on curing the virus in your body. The huge Dragon Gate has many capable people," Ye Wei said with a seductive smile, "Louis won't be able to make a fuss for a while, and it's a good time for everyone to rest and recuperate. You don't know, the chief scolded us bloody yesterday. That sea battle was quite sensational."  The use of new weapons in combat and being the world's largest illegal arms dealer, could it not be sensational?  Eleven sneered coldly, "According to Jason's statistics last night, there are already thirteen countries that have paid a high price for this type of firearm, and they are all heavyweight countries. Each one is issuing joint statements to resist terrorists and eradicate terrorist organizations. But behind the scenes, they are spending money on our weapons."  "That's why I say, the truth, the truth, you're just a passing cloud!" Ye Wei laughed even more seductively.  Cheng An Ya didn't comment, and Ye San Shao just smiled. The arms market was in the hands of Jason, Black Jack, and Chu Li; indeed, they controlled many of the international lifelines.  Powerful enough that no one dared to ignore it.  The next heir was their family's Ning Ning, and the power was estimated to be even greater.  After staying for a while, Ye San Shao went to find Black Hawk to understand the current situation of the Dragon Gate. Ye Wei leaned towards Cheng An Ya, "Third sister-in-law, don't mention what we just talked about to Ning Ning."  "What happened?"  "The kid hasn't mentioned Nuo Nuo since he regained his sight."  "I understand," Cheng An Ya said, "Thank you all. If it weren't for you, Ning Ning's chances would have been slim."  "We have to thank Nuo Nuo. Ning Ning's life was exchanged for hers."  ...  At noon, five fighter jets and three helicopters took off from the castle, all heading towards the direction of Messilia. Chu Li, Jason, and Black Jack had all gone. Actually, Chu Li alone could have handled the matter. There wasn't any problem in the world that required all three terror leaders to act together. Jason was bored, Black Jack was bored, and since the mafia couldn't make a fuss, it was just the right time for them to stretch their muscles.  In the laboratory, it was a busy scene, with a dozen virus experts all in a state of panic. Bai Ye's face was even heavier; for the first time, he was at a loss. He stood in front of the computer with one hand propped up, eyes narrowed, as people bustled around, all researching the virus and various reagents being combined for study.  "Mr. Bai, I think it's better to do this. Since the mafia researched it, they definitely know the antidote," the team leader suggested, "Researching a new virus takes a long time, and Ye San Shao and Miss Cheng may not be able to wait."  Even with the relief agent, it could only delay for about 20 days, and they might not have any leads in twenty days. Moreover, this virus was extremely unstable, being a cellular virus. If it suddenly acted up, the relief agent would be useless, and death would be certain.  "Self-help for adequate food and clothing," Bai Ye said with a calm face, echoing the great saying.  The team leader was speechless.  Louis could ruthlessly fire at Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao, so expecting him to provide an antidote was impossible. He would have anticipated that they would cure Ye San Shao and Miss Cheng and would also anticipate that they wouldn't be able to solve it, definitely seeking him out. By then, he would be elusive, and before they could find him, the people would be gone. It was a risk not worth taking.  He was convinced that Louis would definitely not show up in the near future. Why bother?  Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao had lunch and then slept. They had been busy with examinations and blood samples since their return the night before, and both of them slept restlessly, being very tired. Furthermore, the virus was slowly consuming their bodies, and both of them were exhausted.  Mo Yue was ignored by Ye Wei for a day and was very displeased, pulling on Ye Wei's sleeve and staring at her resentfully. Ye Wei really wanted to kick him into the swimming pool. Xiao Nai Bao was curious about such a Mo Yue.  "Aunt, has he been like this for several days?"  "Five days," Ye Wei said, "Possessed by a ghost."  Xiao Nai Bao was curious about such a Mo Yue, the beautiful man with a stunning appearance and purple eyes, pure as an unpolluted flower, without the previous cunningness and malice.  Having seen the past Mo Yue, now seeing him calling Ye Wei "wife" with such impact...  "Wife, you're talking badly about me."  Mo Yue's purple eyes looked aggrieved, his lips pouting, biting Ye Wei's cheek, causing Xiao Nai Bao to shudder. This tone, he wasn't used to it even when he was three years old and coquettish with his mother... it was so... tender.  Ye Wei was already used to his touchy-feely behavior, patting his head, "Be good, wife admires ghosts the most, who can scare who to death. This is praise for you, understand?"  "Really?" The innocent Mo Yue looked at her with pure eyes.  Ye Wei didn't blush or skip a beat, "Of course, when have I ever lied to you?"  Xiao Nai Bao was silent. This was too... composed.  He had to sigh at Ye Wei's composure and boldness, not something ordinary people could compare to.  "Aunt, can he find Mo Ye?" Xiao Nai Bao didn't care if Mo Yue understood or not, and just asked.  "He said he couldn't find him," Ye Wei said, "Old Big Ice Block seems quite awesome, after all, the second is the second."  Xiao Nai Bao, "..."  Mo Yue showed a look of grievance again, hugging Ye Wei and biting non-stop. Xiao Nai Bao deeply felt it was not suitable for children and got up to go to the laboratory.  "Ning Ning, why are you here?"  "Is there no clue?"  Xiao Nai Bao could tell from Bai Ye's heavy face that things were not good. He was mentally prepared. Just then, someone brought in the data on the 1934 virus. Bai Ye said, "I'll talk to you in a bit."  He focused on reading the data, and Xiao Nai Bao, curious, joined in. The data on su-1934 was very comprehensive, with the harm, number of deaths, government's strong measures, and Bai Ye was most concerned about its designer.  "Su Jin Xiao?"  "Su Jin Xiao?" Bai Ye muttered, unfamiliar with the name. It was the first time he had heard it. The key was that the incident was an accident, and it was claimed to be a nuclear station leak causing the cruel deaths, with very few people knowing it was a virus causing harm.  Xiao Nai Bao had a flash of insight, "The grandfather of Su Man?" Chapter 370: Going to Riyadh  The little bun found out that Grandpa Su Man was the designer of 1934. He immediately contacted Su Man. Ye Wei, who was by his side, was very conflicted, extremely sad and resentful, staring at the little bun with a gaze so mournful as if she were a female ghost about to strangle him right there and then. Shi Yi naturally knew why and smiled very calmly.  Mo Jue pouted his tender lips and looked at his wife, and timidly commented, "Wife, you are so scary!"  Everyone nodded in agreement. Indeed, it was terrifying. Ye San Shao was even afraid that his sister would devour their own son. That expression was extraordinary and terrifying, and everyone felt extremely horrified.  Bai Ye touched his nose. Except for Shi Yi, no one knew why.  While waiting for Su Man to answer the phone, the little bun raised his eyebrows and asked his aunt, "Auntie, what are you doing?"  "I hate you, I hate you..." Ye Wei's normally enchanting and charming face turned into a resentful, angry ghostly expression. Ning Ning felt a bit terrified, and just as he was about to say something, Su Man responded from the other end.  "Ning Ning?"  Su Man's voice was extremely pleasant, like the wind blowing over the mountaintop in the early morning, cold but with a touch of freshness, so clean that it was untainted by the mundane world, listening to it made one feel unreachable and inviolable.  "Um, Su beauty, I need you for something. Can you go online? I'll send you something."  Ning Ning's voice was very urgent. It was his first time calling Su Man, and he forgot to greet him. At the moment, he didn't even care about his aunt's resentful eyes.  "Is something wrong?"  "Yes, a life-threatening matter."  Ning Ning didn't hide it.  "Send it over, I'm online."  Su Man didn't ask further and simply said. Just as Ning Ning said "okay," Ye Wei snatched the phone, "Su beauty, long time no see, did you miss me?"  There was silence on the other end...  "Ye Wei?"  "Why so distant? Just call me Wei Wei. We've been honest with each other, no need for such formality."  Ye Wei held the phone, her voice was coquettish and seductive.  Mo Jue pouted and stared at Ye Wei with resentful eyes. His wife's expression, tone, and smile clearly meant she was contemplating infidelity. Mo Jue's cosmos burned fiercely; he wanted to tear Su Man into pieces, to dismember him and grind his bones to dust.  A cold murderous aura instantly spread. Shi Yi, Bai Ye, and Ye Chen all shivered at once. Ye Wei just raised her eyebrows and looked at Mo Jue, then splendidly ignored him. Mo Jue's murderous aura grew stronger.  In that instant, everyone felt as if he was about to revert to the old Mo Jue, but his gaze remained clean. Although filled with murderous intent, it lacked that viciousness. Clenching his fists, he was very sad and angry, but showed no sign of actual action. They were reassured.  "Busy, hanging up," Su Man said and decisively hung up the phone.  The beauty of Ye Wei was not something every man could enjoy. It was a great test of endurance. To make someone like Su Man, who was always calm, keep his distance, Ye Wei certainly had her formidable aspects.  She wanted to entangle a man. No matter who it was, they only had the option to evade, absolutely no match for her.  "Su beauty is too insincere, just three words to dismiss me."  Ye Wei held the phone, full of sorrow, "I've been longing for him day and night, what a waste of feelings."  Cheng An Ya and Ye Chen smiled. Bai Ye walked over to the little bun, and Ning Ning sent the information Bai Ye had prepared to Su Man.  Shi Yi pointed to the ghostly Mo Jue. Ye Wei's smile faded a bit, and she asked innocently, "Big Bai, who bullied you? Tell your wife, and your wife will help you beat him up."  Mo Jue was also quite interesting. He pointed straight at Ye Wei with his index finger and accused, "Wife, you are bullying me."  Everyone, "......"  Ye Chen pursed his lips and smiled, not wanting to expose Ye Wei too much. The pure Mo Jue was obviously Ye Wei's nemesis. Her complicated scheming was all useless against him, as he was like a child who expressed his displeasure in the most direct way. He simply didn't understand what a facial expression was.  Ye Wei smiled gracefully, "Are you saying that I should beat myself up?"  Mo Jue reluctantly glared and suddenly rushed to Ye Wei's side, grabbing her sleeve and crying out, "Wife, who is he, who is he, why are you so nice to him? You are seducing him!"  Shi Yi was a bit startled. Seduce? The pure Mo Jue knew what seduction was? It was a miracle. Thinking back to a few days ago when he became Big Bai, he was like a blank slate, not understanding anything except for his wife.  And now, he understood everything.  Ye Wei's ability to corrupt was indeed formidable. Such a pure child had been tainted by her. It was strong, just one word. In the future, if Mo Jue returned to his old self, recalling the days when he was Big Bai...  Well... Wei Wei probably wouldn't have enough heads for him to take, considering how vicious the man was. It was unlikely he would let things end peacefully. She was a bit worried about Wei Wei's future.  Ye Wei gently patted Mo Jue's face, her smile enchanting and captivating, "Big Bai, how could you wrongly accuse your wife? He is hundreds of kilometers away from me, impossible to seduce. If I were to seduce anyone, it would be you."  "Wife, you don't love me anymore. Wife, don't fall in love with someone else. Big Bai will be very good, very good."  Mo Jue's expression was pitiful, clinging to Ye Wei's arm as if afraid she would dump him.  Ye Wei was silent. How could this child use such words? Talking about falling in love with someone else, one was the past tense, and the other was the present tense. It should be moving Su Man's feelings, not falling in love with you.  Ye Wei was flabbergasted.  "Wife..."  Mo Jue was not so easily dismissed. Ye Wei punched him in the stomach, "Stop it, or I'll beat you so much you won't even recognize your brother."  Everyone, "......"  Miss Cheng and Ye San Shao enjoyed the show, exchanging smiles. They found the couple's interactions quite interesting. Miss Cheng also secretly thought that the two extremes of this man were very challenging.  She had personally seen the scars on Ye Wei's body, beaten to a horrific extent. The iron lotus on her wrist nearly crippled her hand, and from these scars, one could tell how ruthless the man was.  Now that he had become this white, easily moldable, it was quite a challenge.  Only someone as fierce as Ye Wei could suppress him.  Mo Jue was extremely sad and angry, his purple eyes brimming with grievance, his tender lips trembling like autumn leaves, causing great fear among the few people around him.  The little bun was witnessing this spectacle for the first time. Compared to the hellish figures he had seen at the supermarket before, the little bun's lips curled sinisterly, "Big Bai brother-in-law, do you know who Su beauty is? He's my aunt's old lover. My aunt was very enthusiastic about him, chasing him for a year. This time, she must be jealous because I have Su Man's contact information and she doesn't, so my aunt is jealous of me."  Upon hearing this, Mo Jue's gaze became even more mournful as he looked at Ye Wei, suddenly standing up in anger, and left with a flourish. It was actually very handsome and dignified.  Ye Wei was dumbfounded... o(╯□╰)o! Damn, Mo Jue, are you rebelling? You're showing her your back, throwing a tantrum. Wow, that's gutsy.  Miss Cheng calmly smiled, "Wei Wei, aren't you going to comfort him? He's really angered."  "Wei Wei, seems like it's the first time he's angry at you?" Shi Yi asked doubtfully, and it seemed to be true.  From that day on, Mo Jue had always revered Ye Wei. Ye Wei said one, and he wouldn't say two. If Ye Wei told him to kill, he wouldn't let the person live. In short, whatever Ye Wei said was the decree, Ye Wei's word was the truth. He was obedient and compliant, never showing Ye Wei any temper. He just feared Ye Wei would get the slightest bit upset and run away. This was truly a spectacle.  Shi Yi's explanation was that Ye Wei not only colored him but also infected him with her temper.  After the little bun stirred up trouble, he smiled elegantly. Bai Ye gave a thumbs up. After all, watching Ye Wei's drama was rare, and with someone offering a free showing, he was naturally happy to watch.  "She's turned against him."  Ye Wei rose abruptly and strode out, her angry demeanor as if she was about to take someone to task.  "Auntie, Su Man has sent a message," the little bun called out from behind. Ye Wei seemed not to hear and disappeared in a blink of an eye.  Everyone laughed. Indeed, there is a cure for every ailment, but Ye Wei's nemesis was perhaps too extraordinary, too unexpected.  They say that innocence and cunning make a perfect pair, and it seems to be true.  Though this one is thoroughly white.  Su Man had apparently already looked at the materials, which included information on 1934 and an analysis of the new virus. He was a virus expert himself and could quickly understand these professional materials.  Su Man: Bring the person here.  Mommy is the Greatest: Is there a cure?  Su Man: 70%.  Mommy is the Greatest: Okay, I will leave immediately.  Su Man sent an address to the little bun, and Bai Ye took note of it. He was somewhat curious, "70% certainty, is he sure? So many of our experts are at a loss, can he do it?"  He sounded confident, just by looking at the materials he claimed a 70% chance of success.  "If Su Man says there is, there definitely is. Daddy, Mommy, let's make a trip. It's only a few hours from here to Riyadh, we can go back and forth quickly," said the little bun.  This was an opportunity he wouldn't miss, any chance to cure his daddy and mommy.  Miss Cheng and Ye San Shao looked at each other and nodded in agreement.  "I'm going too," Bai Ye said, his face expressionless, his emotions not visible, but only he knew how curious and excited he was inside. Chapter 371: A Beauty's Smile Overturns the City - Part 1  Men always compare their strength to one another. Bai Ye is known as a genius doctor, and although his research on viruses isn't deep, he does have some involvement with them. He's troubled by a virus that has also troubled many experts.  That man claimed to have a 70% certainty of success at first glance. For people like them, a 70% certainty means that there's a good chance of a cure.  Bai Ye was very curious about how capable this person was. Moreover, the prospect of a high-speed magnetic wave scanner was enough to open his eyes to new possibilities.  The name Su Man was well-known to everyone. Neither Ye Sanshao nor Cheng Anya had any objections; a trip wouldn't take much time, and since there was a possibility of a cure, they were more than happy.  Under Ning Ning and Bai Ye's arrangements, the plane was quickly prepared. The affairs of the Number One Terrorist Organization were temporarily handed over to Claude for command, while Bai Ye instructed the experts in the research lab to continue studying the virus and to send any analysis reports to them immediately to avoid duplicating Su Man's research.  Everything was arranged in an orderly manner. Initially, Ye Wei and Mo Jue were not considered, but just when the plane was about to take off, Ye Wei dragged Mo Jue onto the plane.  Eleven naturally also boarded the plane; she was always inseparable from Ye Wei. Besides, with Mo Jue present, there was a chance to encounter Mo Ye.  "Niece, why are you going too?" The little bun was utterly puzzled.  Everyone knew that Ye Wei and Su Man had a history, and now she was bringing along Mo Jue, who was extremely jealous. Wouldn't this turn everything upside down?  He still wished for Su Man to focus on treating his parents' virus.  "Why can't I go? I haven't chatted with Su Man for a long time," Ye Wei replied confidently, her smile capable of captivating all. It was a pity that there were only three men on the plane - Bai Ye, Ye Sanshao, and Mo Jue - otherwise, she would have surely charmed everyone.  Is that really just chatting? Everyone expressed their doubts, as chatting wasn't usually so provocative.  She must be dreaming of hooking up with Su Man. In fact, with such an obedient and beautiful person like Mo Jue, it was puzzling why Ye Wei was still so obsessed with Su Man. Everyone wondered what kind of celestial being Su Man was to have such a great charm, even the usually discerning little bun admired Su Man.  Looking at Mo Jue again, he had just left with a stern face and dignified air, but in the blink of an eye, he became a typical henpecked husband, holding onto Ye Wei and not letting go. It was a classic case of a husband who does whatever his wife says.  Ye Sanshao and Bai Ye both gave Ye Wei a thumbs-up and simultaneously despised Mo Jue's henpecked appearance.  Bai Ye said, "Brother Da Bai, are you jealous?"  Mo Jue hugged Ye Wei and nodded vigorously, his innocent face showing a very pure expression. It seemed he was no longer jealous.  Ye Sanshao expressed his contempt again. It was rare to see such a submissive man.  Occasionally teasing Miss Cheng and watching her walk into his trap was something Ye Sanshao found very satisfying.  Cheng Anya also gave a thumbs-up. "You really have a way to control your husband, Wei Wei. When you're free, teach me a few tricks."  "Sure, no problem. I guarantee that Third Brother will be incredibly obedient," Ye Wei replied.  Ye Sanshao promptly pulled Miss Cheng to his side, smiling sinisterly and darkly. "Miss Cheng, am I not good enough for you? You still want to learn how to control your husband? What are you dissatisfied with? Tell me, and I'll change right away."  The little bun shuddered and huddled with Bai Ye.  Eleven raised her eyebrows, and Ye Wei said, "How sour, Brother. What did you eat for lunch? You shouldn't threaten people like that. You should be as obedient as Da Bai, and Third Sister-in-law will be nicer and gentler to you."  Ye Sanshao sent Ye Wei a dagger-like glare. If he were as white as Mo Jue, Miss Cheng would probably know how to bully him even more. He didn't want that. A man should have some dignity.  Besides, he couldn't fake the innocent, unpolluted look like Mo Jue.  "Exactly, I think so too," Miss Cheng agreed, making her look forward to seeing if Ye Sanshao could change his ways for a bit of excitement.  "Come on, be good and give me a smile," Miss Cheng hooked her finger under Ye Sanshao's chin, openly flirting with him.  Ye Sanshao's lips twitched fiercely.  This flirtatious behavior was just like Ye Wei's. Learning it to perfection, indeed, birds of a feather flock together.  He felt that he needed to keep his wife at least two hundred meters away from his sister to prevent her from being led astray.  Ye Wei collapsed into Mo Jue's arms laughing, and even Eleven's lips curled into a slight smile.  The little bun innocently covered his eyes and said in his childlike voice, "Mommy, don't be so provocative. It's not suitable for children. You should also take care of a child's pure heart."  Everyone: "......"  Pure? If you are pure, then what is dark?  Bai Ye laughed casually and offered a few words, "Women are too scary."  "I sympathize with you," the little bun patted Bai Ye's shoulder gravely, offering condolences. "Indeed, too scary. I mourn for your future."  Bai Ye, Chu Li, and others have long been oppressed by Ye Wei and Eleven. Now, witnessing Miss Cheng's wicked taste, anyone would find women terrifying.  Bai Ye patted the little bun's shoulder in return, also offering condolences. "I also mourn for you twenty years from now."  "No need. I don't need it," the little bun smiled. He thought that the person who would be tormented was gone. Everything was empty. As long as he had Nono in his heart for a lifetime, he didn't need any other women, so no one could torment him.  Miss Cheng was chatting and laughing with Ye Sanshao when she overheard the conversation and suddenly felt a heavy heart, not knowing what to say to the little bun. She just looked at him deeply.  The rest of the group didn't think about Nono at the moment and continued to joke around. Ye Sanshao and the others were all family, very familiar with each other. Bai Ye, despite being indifferent, grew up with Ye Wei and Eleven and got along well with Ye Sanshao, so the atmosphere remained lively, with no worries about the virus.  Everyone was carefree, and it was impossible to be sentimental.  Eleven was curious. "Da Bai, why did you let Wei Wei go to Riyadh? Aren't you afraid that your wife will be seduced by Su Man?"  Ye Wei kicked her, wondering when this block of ice also learned to watch her drama. Deserved to be hit.  Eleven, always cool and composed, ignored Ye Wei's protest. In fact, she thought it was a drama not to be missed.  Not just she was curious; Bai Ye, Miss Cheng, Ye Sanshao, and the little bun were all very interested, their eyes fixed on Mo Jue.  Mo Jue blinked his eyes, answering very honestly, "Wife said, Su Man is not as good-looking as me. She abandoned Su Man, not me. I am the original."  Everyone: "......"  Even someone as cold as Eleven choked up, let alone Cheng Anya and others.  Wei Wei, you could actually say such a thing. Indeed... fierce.  "Brother Da Bai, Wei Wei is deceiving you. I guarantee with my integrity that this is absolutely insincere. Just look at how excited she gets when she hears Su Man's name. How can you believe that?" Bai Ye, oppressed for many years, finally had a chance to stir up trouble.  The little bun expressed the same doubt.  Mo Jue's purple eyes were confused. Seeing everyone nodding in agreement, and then looking at Ye Wei, he pulled her sleeve and asked, "Wife, would you deceive me?"  "No," Ye Wei replied calmly, her face unchanging.  Mo Jue was satisfied and proudly glanced over everyone. "Wife said she wouldn't deceive me. Don't try to sow discord."  Eleven's eyelid twitched. It was rare to see Mo Jue being trained by Ye Wei to such an extent.  The little bun laughed heartily.  As a fellow man, Bai Ye admired Mo Jue with one hundred percent respect.  Ye Sanshao lay on Cheng Anya's shoulder, laughing uncontrollably. This man was too adorable.  Miss Cheng was very calm. Mo Jue's expression when he said not to sow discord was genuinely unique, like a typical little white rabbit.  "Wei Wei, that was a good move," said Cheng Anya.  "Thank you for the compliment, Third Sister-in-law," Ye Wei replied.  The two women exchanged a smile. Miss Cheng glanced at Ye Sanshao, and he felt a chill down his spine, in a dilemma.  Miss Cheng's wicked tastes were not few. Being targeted by her meant a dead end.  "Miss Cheng, stop the strange images in your mind. He and I are not the same kind," Ye Sanshao immediately declared.  Mo Jue was the most typical image of a henpecked husband, and no man would want to learn from him.  Ye Wei laughed, "Third Brother, our Mo Jue is tenderer than you, very delicious. From the inside out, he is very pure."  Indeed, that was the truth.  Miss Cheng's smile became gentler. "You really don't know how to write 'pure'."  The little bun pondered with his chin in his hand, "I'm also curious about what Su Man looks like. Auntie, is she really celestial?"  "Ask Eleven," Ye Wei said casually, with Mo Jue present, she kept her mouth shut.  Eleven looked at Mo Jue and gave a fair opinion, "They each have their own merits."  "Then she must be celestial," the little bun said with a smile.  Miss Cheng suddenly noticed the jade pendant on the little bun's chest and asked with curiosity, "Baby, what are you wearing? A jade pendant?"  Isn't that something for girls? Her son never wore such things.  The little bun's smile faded slightly, a hint of pain flashing through his eyes before quickly returning to calm. He was about to answer when Mo Jue did it for him, "It's from my Nono's home."  The atmosphere turned a bit heavy.  Ye Wei and others knew the situation, but Cheng Anya and Ye Sanshao didn't.  The little bun casually tucked the inadvertently exposed jade pendant back in, his expression very calm, showing no trace of sorrow or despair.  But many years later, when Cheng Anya recalled this scene, she would understand.  There is a calmness called the ripple of still water.  "It's very beautiful," said Cheng Anya lightly, and Ye Sanshao held her hand tightly.  The little bun smiled brightly, "Yes, I think it's beautiful too."  Seeing their harmonious scene, he missed Nono very much. He was afraid to sleep at night, fearing that he would dream of her and upon waking up, he could only grasp the regret lingering in the air, unable to sleep all night.  These feelings, experienced too early, seemed engraved in his heart.  As time settled, this memory became clearer and clearer, firmly imprinted in his heart, slowly adding marks that could never be erased. For a lifetime, like a shadow, he would live with this memory, without regret.  Bai Ye patted the little bun on the shoulder, and everyone fell silent for a while. It was Ye Sanshao who knocked on the table. "Ning Ning, didn't you say you'd bring a fool home? Stay away from the fierce ones. Didn't listen and suffered for it?"  Miss Cheng was silent.  Bai Ye laughed. This early start on love education was also special.  The little bun clasped his hands together, adopting a look of utmost admiration, "Wise and mighty Daddy, your baby will definitely heed your teachings and won't dare again."  Everyone laughed lightly.  The atmosphere became lively again. Cheng Anya smiled and said nothing more, but her heart ached. His forced laughter was evident to her, very heartbreaking.  They chatted and laughed all the way to Riyadh, and the plane landed on a private airstrip. The estate was exceptionally spacious, like an oasis, with a vast date palm grove and a dense palm forest. In the center of the garden, there was a delicate fountain. The elegant villa courtyard was lush with various exotic flowers and plants. The estate was somewhat old, exuding a deep historical flavor. The bending corridors were adorned with lotus petal crystal lamps, very attractive. The walls were covered with climbing vines, full of greenery.  The female servants who came to greet them were all dressed in typical Arabian attire, with black robes, black head coverings, and black sand. They led them to the hall.  Ye Wei greeted them cheerfully, causing a round of light laughter. One of them, speaking in English, said, "The master is going to have a headache again."  Summers in Riyadh were extremely hot, but the hall was cool throughout. Bai Ye, with his keen observation, noticed that the walls were carved from ice jade, inconspicuous at first glance, but very cold to the touch. This was a special design to reduce the summer heat. Quite ingenious.  "Their family's walls are all carved from ice jade. Rich people indeed," Ye Wei said. Having lived there for quite some time with Eleven, she was very familiar with the place and took the initiative to grab some fruit to quench her thirst.  Riyadh's summer heat was unbearable, and they were parched upon disembarking the plane.  The female servants soon brought cold drinks and fruit snacks. Knowing Ye Wei and Eleven's preferences, they even prepared two cups of blue-green fruit drinks for the two of them.  Ye Wei spoke in Arabic, "Sister Diana, I didn't expect you to remember my favorite. I'm so touched."  Diana smiled and said, "The master is currently receiving Princess Seven. He'll be here shortly."  "Is she good-looking?" Ye Wei was very curious. The visitor must have come with the intention of throwing herself into his arms. Ye Wei had seen even more astounding scenes last year.  Diana's large eyes were full of smiles, "Not as good-looking as you."  Ye Wei was satisfied. Sister Diana, you know how to play the game.  Bai Ye shook his head and poked her shoulder, "Can yours understand Arabic?"  You should soothe your inner courtyard before you try to hook up with someone. Otherwise, you might set your own house on fire.  Ye Wei had forgotten about this and said to Mo Jue in Arabic, "Da Bai, my drink doesn't taste good. Let's switch."  Mo Jue obediently exchanged his drink with Ye Wei's, but she quickly stopped him, "No need, I suddenly find it very tasty."  He could understand. Ye Wei was conflicted.  The little bun laughed and explained to Cheng Anya, as she was the only one among them who didn't understand Arabic. She wasn't as versatile as them, only knowing English, Japanese, and French.  Soon, someone outside called for the master, and a tall figure slowly entered everyone's sight, his back to the sun, dressed in a white robe, surrounded by a faint and serene halo.  Emanating a sense of untouchable sanctity.  Cheng Anya's first impression was, indeed, Su the beauty!  Everyone had only one thought in their minds. A beauty's smile overturns the city. Chapter 372: A Beauty's Smile Overturns the City (Part 2)  Su Man, in his mid to late twenties, stood tall and straight. Unlike the typical Arab, instead of wearing a white robe, black headband, and white turban, he only wore a white robe, his long hair bound behind him with a silver ribbon. His eyebrows were like willow leaves, fine and long, resembling the dark greenery of distant mountains. His eyes, black and spirited, were like the springs in a mountain stream, cold yet carrying a sense of purity. Upon closer inspection, they were like the wind over an ice field, piercing and intimidating.  His high nose and beautifully shaped lips, with a color so lovely, carried an air of refinement that made his chin equally captivating. Every feature was a masterpiece from God. His entire presence exuded arrogance, iciness, and an unapproachable dignity that seemed almost blasphemous to violate. His stunning features would never be mistaken for a woman's because at a glance, he was unmistakably a confident and powerful man, emitting an aura of dominance and aloofness that no woman could possess.  Dressed in white that surpassed snow, with ink-black hair contrasted by a silver band, he was the epitome of peerless elegance. His appearance was guaranteed to amaze the entire room one hundred percent. Once he stood there, the whole world seemed like a mere backdrop to his radiance. Every man and woman in the hall, seasoned and calm as they were, became silent at the sight of such beauty. Even Ye Wei and Shi Yi, accustomed to his looks, were taken aback. Some people never tire the eyes, no matter how much they are observed; he was as dazzling as when they first saw him.  Su Man's gaze swept across the men and women in the hall, accustomed to such admiring looks. His eyes landed on the little one, and his usually unsmiling lips curved slightly. In an instant, his elegance illuminated the room, a smile that could overthrow cities.  "Su the beauty, I've missed you so much," Ye Wei was the first to recover, not even minding Mo Jue's jealousy, her figure darting over, eager to throw herself into his arms. Ye Wei was the top assassin, very quick on her feet, but there was someone even faster.  Mo Jue followed suit, pulling her by the waist to his side, his stunning features filled with protest, "Wife..."  This 'wife' was drawn out very long.  Su Man raised an eyebrow, his cold gaze falling on Ye Wei and Mo Jue. Ye Wei hadn't managed to reach her target and was filled with resentment, yet she couldn't let Mo Jue throw a tantrum, feeling extremely aggrieved.  "I don't miss you at all," Su Man said with a cold gaze, his voice clear and clean.  Mo Jue earned a full measure of respect for being able to control Ye Wei; otherwise, how many people would she have harmed?   "Su the beauty, that's not very kind of you," Ye Wei protested, patting Da Bai's hand, signaling him to let go.  Bringing him was a very wrong decision. If not for the fact that no one in the castle could control him, she really didn't want to bring him.  "Su Man." The little one approached, touching his chin, generous with his praise, "You are really unexpected."  Although they had heard he was extraordinary, they only realized upon meeting him just how otherworldly he was—noble and compelling.  "Little fellow, you are quite unexpected too," Su Man said, patting his shoulder, his expression softening, "How come Ye Wei is here too?"  Ye Wei immediately objected, "Su the beauty, what do you mean by that?"  Shi Yi was straightforward, "He's tired of you."  The little one laughed, "She's my aunt."  "The world is indeed small," Su Man's usual cold gaze flashed with helplessness, and it turned out to be one group after another.  The little one introduced them all because Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao were infected with a virus, the two just nodded in greeting. Su Man was also not fond of socializing, which suited his temperament. A nod was considered an acknowledgment, and the same went for Bai Ye.  "Ning Ning, why are so many people here for a medical check-up?" Su Man's cold sweep made everyone feel an invisible pressure. Some people just have that kind of aura, a casual remark enough to intimidate.  Ye San Shao was silent, and Miss Cheng was also silent. It seemed that geniuses always had a bit of a strange temperament. Of course, except for their baby, in any case, they definitely had to come for a medical check-up, and the rest were none of their business.  "I miss you. Is that not allowed? You know that Shi Yi and I are inseparable," Ye Wei said.  "Yeah, and you even brought your family along."  "Hey, could it be that you regret not accepting me back then?" Ye Wei teased, hooking Su Man's arm, "Beauty, do you really not miss me at all?"  "I don't miss you," Su Man replied succinctly.  His cold gaze shifted, and Mo Jue had already pulled Ye Wei to his side. His purple eyes were filled with jealousy, "Wife, don't be like this, just come and hug me."  Everyone else, "......"  The others had their excuses, and Bai Ye said indifferently, "The virus they are infected with is under my jurisdiction, maybe I can help."  "No need," Su Man said coldly, his voice exuding restrained arrogance.  Bai Ye remained calm, but his eyebrows seemed to carry a hint of frost, gradually revealing his domineering side, "Trust me, you'll need me."  Their gazes clashed, one casual and distant, the other cold and arrogant, neither willing to give in an inch, the atmosphere oppressively tense.  The little one stood elegantly in the middle, smiling. Both men looked away, one serene, the other snorting. With a smile, the little one said, "Su the beauty, Bai Ye has also studied viruses. He's not as thorough as you, but his medical skills are definitely stronger than yours."  Su Man's cold eyebrows rose, "I need the latest analysis data."  "No problem," Bai Ye nodded.  Su Man swept his gaze around, instructing Ye San Shao and Cheng An Ya to follow him to the lab, barring others from following. Everyone obediently stayed in the hall. Bai Ye commented, "He's really arrogant."  "He has the capital to be," Shi Yi said. "He knew about Wei Wei and my identities from the start and never showed a good face."  "Ah, Wei Wei, you like that sort, huh? But..." Bai Ye looked at Mo Jue with a smile, "Your taste has changed too much."  Mo Jue didn't understand what Bai Ye was talking about, the little one laughed, Shi Yi couldn't help but chuckle, and Ye Wei waved her hand lazily. She was speechless, "It was absolutely an accident, an accident..."  "Is he Arab?" Bai Ye curiously asked. Su Man had the depth and refinement of Arabs, but also the delicacy of Eastern people, overall more resembling an Easterner.  "His mother is Arab, and his father is Chinese, a mixed-race child."  Everyone nodded, realizing that mixed-race children tend to be stunning. They had seen a few, all similarly impressive, but none quite like Su Man.  Ye Wei leaned lazily in her chair, sipping a cold drink, and spoke slowly, "Now you know why I was so fixated. Su the beauty is captivating inside and out. The more you know him, the more you realize he's a rare real man."  Too bad he wasn't interested in her. According to insider information, Su Man didn't like women but preferred men, so she was naturally ruled out from the start. Truly a tragedy.  "Auntie, your charm is failing."  "Little kid, don't talk nonsense. Look how he's still smitten and lost, where has it diminished?"  Ye Wei pointed to Mo Jue who was beside her, smiling enchantingly. Her charm still worked on Mo Jue.  Mo Jue held Ye Wei's hand and asked, "Wife, didn't you say he wasn't as handsome as me and that you had abandoned him? Why are you still so close to him? Wife, you lied to me."  "Friends haven't seen each other for so long, missing each other is normal, hugging is basic etiquette, understand?"  Mo Jue shook his head, pointing to Shi Yi, "She didn't go to hug."  Bai Ye and the little one couldn't help but smile. Shi Yi huffed coldly, and Ye Wei cooperated, "Look how icy Shi Yi is, who would dare to hug her? Do you want to die? How can you compare your wife to Shi Yi?"  Fire and ice cannot be compared.  "Wife, you should be like Shi Yi, no need to be too enthusiastic, Da Bai doesn't like it," Mo Jue said dejectedly.  He looked down, his mood downcast, his limpid purple eyes dimming, losing their luster.  Ye Wei paused, feeling a bit... displeased with this side of Mo Jue. She had never planned to change her behavior for anyone, and besides, Su Man wasn't interested in her. Teasing him was harmless, nothing serious.  "Wei Wei, have you noticed? He seems to be getting smarter," Shi Yi suddenly said, especially these past few days, quite noticeable, not like the naive person at the beginning, who would believe anything Ye Wei said.  Ye Wei nodded, and Shi Yi harbored another worry. Was he about to recover? Or?  "Da Bai, did you remember something?" Ye Wei asked softly. Mo Jue shook his head, and Ye Wei and Shi Yi exchanged a look, saying nothing. Maybe it was just an illusion.  "Wife, if you continue like this, I will kill him," Mo Jue said gravely, his purple eyes filled with murderous intent.  "......"  "Da Bai, let's go. I'll take you to enjoy the scenery of Riyadh," Ye Wei said, dragging Mo Jue out. His gloomy face immediately brightened up like clouds parting for sunshine.  This was a small research lab.  Since Su Man was a virus expert, his home lab was equipped with the world's most complete research facilities. Despite being small, it had everything necessary. At a glance, there were test tubes, reagents, automated equipment, computer-aided analysis, and a huge LCD screen.  Su Man took blood samples from the two and injected them with two different colored reagents. There were only three people here, and Ye San Shao didn't hold back, asking gravely, "Mr. Su, can this virus really be cured?"  Su Man was performing a systematic examination on Cheng An Ya, and he responded indifferently, "Maybe it can be, maybe not. I'm not completely sure myself. We have to see how unstable the virus is."  Ye San Shao was also prepared for the worst, watching Cheng An Ya, he smiled slightly. Cheng An Ya returned his smile. At their level, life and death seemed not so important. Su Man glanced at this couple, perhaps because of his good relationship with Ning Ning, he had a favorable impression of them, and his attitude softened quite a bit. After all, to raise a child like the little one, the parents couldn't be ordinary. Plus, a few months ago, Ye San Shao's exploits and scandals shook the globe quite dramatically. Knowing they were Ning Ning's parents, Su Man naturally paid attention, finding it quite interesting.  Now seeing them face life and death with such composure, he admired them. "Just call me Su Man."  Su Man's voice was always crisp, without much emotional fluctuation.  Cheng An Ya smiled as he examined her, starting a conversation, "Su Man, how did you meet Ning Ning?"  "By chance, I guess. He wanted a set of weapon blueprints, and I happened to have them. Originally I didn't want to give them, but he hacked my home computer. I had no choice but to compromise. If I didn't agree, I was afraid he would even help me change my nationality for free, and when I woke up, I'd become stateless. Maybe even my ID card would have a name popping up in the spouse column," Su Man recounted.  As the parents of the little one, Ye San Shao and Miss Cheng felt somewhat embarrassed... Their son's behavior was really... Robber-like! It's no wonder he's their son, Ye San Shao thought proudly. Even though the methods were sneaky and scheming, they were the most effective.  "...... You're really unlucky."  Miss Cheng managed to say after a long time, regretting it as soon as she spoke. Under normal circumstances, shouldn't they, as parents, be apologizing? Miss Cheng, o(╯□╰)o!  "Yeah, I consider myself unlucky," Su Man agreed, not feeling that the parents' education was twisted at all. Miss Cheng's indulgence in the little one had reached a certain level.  "Being unlucky occasionally is quite good. My son is quite useful," Ye San Shao also said, not feeling that the little one's behavior was shameful, but rather quite proud.  Su Man nodded in agreement, "Indeed."  Miss Cheng and Ye San Shao felt satisfied. Su Man was really accommodating. How they met wasn't important, what mattered was their current friendship, which was quite good, wasn't it?  Su Man finished examining Miss Cheng, his eyelids slightly raised, his cold eyes sweeping a trace of understanding, "I finally realize Ning Ning's character is not nurtured, but inherited."  Ye San Shao, "......"  Miss Cheng, "......"  Su Man asked Miss Cheng to get up and Ye San Shao to lie down, then said, "But you're right about one thing."  While examining Ye San Shao, Su Man looked at the screen displaying images and data, his gaze darkening. It was in Arabic, which Cheng An Ya couldn't understand, but she could clearly see the images—it was a liver.  "It's a bit troublesome," Su Man murmured.  Cheng An Ya's heart skipped a beat, feeling a bad premonition, "What's wrong? Is there no cure?"  "The virus has already invaded the liver, his case is more serious than yours," Su Man said truthfully, believing they were strong enough to handle the news, so he didn't hide it, "It's a kind of cellular virus. Once it invades the liver, bodily functions will significantly decline. He won't be able to move freely in a day and will have to lie in the lab, surviving on sedatives and oxygen masks."  Cheng An Ya's eyes widened in shock, blood draining from her face, feeling a painful pressure in her heart and head, completely blank. What else couldn't she concern herself with? Her hands and feet became numb and cold, and waves of fear washed over her. She had a strong feeling that she was about to lose Ye San Shao.  "Su Man, what should we do?" Cheng An Ya tried to remain calm, but couldn't, her voice trembling, her slender body stiffening.  Ye San Shao reached out, holding Cheng An Ya's hand. The cold touch was heart-wrenching. Although they had come to terms with life and death, the prospect of eternal separation still brought pain and despair.  "Don't worry, Xiao An Ya, it's not like there's no hope at all," Ye San Shao said softly, "We've agreed, haven't we?"  "The situation is worse than I thought, but it's not hopeless. Rest assured, I'll do my best," Su Man said firmly, his cold eyes filled with determination, "Ning Ning rarely asks me for anything, and I will do whatever it takes to grant his wish."  Cheng An Ya felt relieved for some reason, believing Su Man's words without reservation.  "And her?" Su Man glanced at Cheng An Ya, "She's fine, still under control for now. She's the first vector, the virus is more stable in her, so her condition is quite good."  "Why is that? I was infected before him."  "It doesn't have much to do with the timing of the infection," Su Man explained, "This cellular virus is inherently unstable, and being the second vector magnifies that instability, making mutations more likely."  Cheng An Ya didn't understand viruses well, but seeing Su Man's serious expression, she felt heavy-hearted. Ye San Shao, however, was calm, accepting the bad news peacefully.  "By the way, Su Man, the designer of 1934 was your grandfather. Bai Ye said the principle is similar, is there an antidote?" Cheng An Ya asked Su Man.  Su Man nodded, his cold eyes briefly showing pain, quickly concealed, "1934 was researched by my grandfather when he was young. At that time, my grandmother had liver cancer, and my grandfather's study of cellular viruses was solely for treating liver cancer. It was locked in the lab and unknown to anyone because he was aware of the great harm that could come from it. Unfortunately, it was stolen by an apprentice and fell into the hands of criminals, causing tens of thousands of deaths in a Siberian town. He regretted it deeply. Later, he devoted himself to researching an antidote for 1934, only managing to develop it in his later years. However, some documents were lost during a move, and several pages of the antidote records are missing. It will take me some time to complete them. Though the principle is the same, this virus is obviously more complex. Currently, I only have a rough idea and must confirm it before daring to test it on you."  Ye San Shao looked at Su Man, smiling slowly, serene and carefree, "Go ahead and do it, I trust you." Chapter 373: Wife, I Don't Think Highly of Him  After Su Man conducted a detailed examination of Ye Shaoshao and Cheng Anya, it was nearly evening when she came out. She stayed in the laboratory to prepare materials, and had the maid take the two to their residence.  The little milk bun had been waiting in the room early on. The examination took a bit longer than it did in Rome. The little milk bun felt uneasy, fearing that something might go wrong. If even Su Man said there was no way, it would mean that probably no one in the world could save them.  As soon as they returned, Ye Shaoshao's complexion looked very pale, which made the little milk bun's heart sink. He hurried forward, but Cheng Anya, fearing an accidental touch, ordered him to stay away.  Reluctantly, the little milk bun backed off to a safe distance.  "Daddy, Mommy, are you guys alright? What did Su Man say?" The little milk bun was very anxious, having waited an entire afternoon, losing patience, and now only wanting to hear good news, though he also knew this was very unlikely.  Cheng Anya didn't hide the truth from him and told him the reality.  The little milk bun felt fear and worry in his heart but did not show it. He pursed his lips and said, "Here we have the world's most awesome doctors and the top virus experts. Daddy and Mommy will definitely be fine."  Ye Shaoshao let out a carefree smile. The calm exhibited by the little milk bun was very much like that of a great general. He couldn't help but recall how the child had behaved when Cheng Anya was hit by a car and needed an amputation; he was not flustered and was busy comforting Grandpa Cheng.  But...  "Baby, don't worry too much. Do what you need to do. Since we trust them, let's trust them completely. At this point, whatever the result is, your mommy and I will accept it," Ye Shaoshao said soothingly.  "Don't keep a straight face, it's bad luck. Your daddy and mommy aren't dead yet, but with such a face, you might bring bad luck upon us. Be happy."  Miss Cheng waved her hand dismissively, not wanting to see her son's stern face, which made her uncomfortable.  In her memory, her son should always be smiling elegantly and adorably. A stern face didn't suit her at all.  "Got it, got it," the little milk bun pouted, his tender lips full of displeasure, "In any case, you're not allowed to leave me."  Miss Cheng chuckled, not recognizing her own child, "Who just said that we have the most amazing doctors and top virus experts here, and that nothing will happen? Why have you changed your tune so quickly? Lost confidence?"  "Mommy, don't expose your baby like this," the little milk bun glared, the little gentleman expressing his discontent.  Miss Cheng and Ye Shaoshao exchanged smiles.  "Little Anya, Ningning, let's go out for a walk as a family later. You haven't been to Riyadh before; the night view is very beautiful," Ye Shaoshao suggested. Because of business, he had been to Riyadh twice, but each time was a brief visit, and he never had the chance to truly appreciate the beauty of the city. The night view of Riyadh had left a deep impression on him.  Saying it was splendid would not be an exaggeration. A family trip would feel very good. Apart from that one time at the beach, they had never traveled as a family, and he didn't know if he would have the opportunity to enjoy such warm family time in the future.  He cherished it very much.  "Baby agrees," the little milk bun revealed an elegant smile and joyfully cast his vote in favor, his dark eyes revealing a childlike delight, "Su Man said that the local specialties here are very famous."  Ye Shaoshao nodded and gave his son a thumbs-up gesture. Father and son exchanged a smile.  Cheng Anya hesitated for a moment, her bright eyes revealing a hint of worry and fear. The incident with Zhang Bo was etched in her memory; that pain was indescribable and very painful.  "With our bodies like this, it's not suitable to go out on the streets. Better not go, it would be bad if others were harmed," said Cheng Anya. She wanted to see it too, but the situation didn't allow it. Inevitable physical collisions on the streets could lead to unimaginable consequences if the virus spread.  "That's true," Ye Shaoshao felt it was inappropriate as well. Even though the streets of Riyadh were spacious, there could always be unexpected incidents, "Damn, I have to lie down tomorrow and they won't even give me one sweet date tonight, God is really a bastard."  Miss Cheng, "......"  The little milk bun, "...... Daddy, use civilized language, don't set a bad example for your baby."  Ye Shaoshao smirked and threw a disdainful look at the little milk bun, "Come on, you've already given Louis the finger, how much more civilized can you get? Anyway, there's hardly anyone in our family, so we might as well not pretend."  The little milk bun touched his nose, reigned in his smile, and said seriously, "Daddy, you can't say that. Image is still very important."  Watching the father and son, Cheng Anya couldn't help but laugh; they were too cute.  "How about this, we'll go by car and won't get out. If there's anything to buy, let the baby go and buy it," Cheng Anya suggested with a smile.  "Baby, considering your father is going to start having tough days tomorrow, you'll just have to work a bit harder."  "At your command!" The little milk bun saluted in a military fashion.  Ye Wei and Mo Jue were having so much fun that they were nowhere to be seen for an afternoon. It was only at dinner time when Su Man came out of the laboratory that the two of them came back in a high-profile manner. Mo Jue was shouting "wife" so loudly that everyone felt the food was particularly delicious.  They didn't hold back and took their seats as soon as they returned. The maid served them food and drinks. Da Bai had gone out at noon with an unhappy face, but now he was very happy, his cheeks even flushed a lovely pink, looking very cute.  Shiyi whispered to Ye Wei, "Did you handle him? Did you find anything?"  In terms of tacit understanding, Ye Wei and Shiyi were the best. They even knew what each other had done in a short time without even exchanging looks. Ye Wei shook her head, "All normal."  Because of her special identity, Ye Wei, no matter how she felt about Mo Jue, whether she had fallen in love with him or not, was always on guard. No matter what she did, nothing could interfere with the big picture, so their caution was normal.  But whether it was a fake play that turned real or a real play that seemed fake, how much was true and how much was false, Ye Wei herself probably wasn't clear.  Not to mention others.  Her thoughts were always hard to guess, and others would see her as they did in the past: carefree and enchanting, without a half-point difference. It was precisely because of this that Ye Shaoshao and Bai Ye were reassured to have her look after Mo Jue.  "Su beauty, how are my brother and sister-in-law?" Ye Wei and Mo Jue happened to be sitting opposite Su Man, and with just a glance, they saw a pleasing beauty, which made Ye Wei's mood soar.  "Good," Su Man replied indifferently.  The little milk bun said, "Auntie, you're so lost in joy, do you still remember my daddy and mommy?"  "Little kid, eat more and talk less."  "Big White Uncle, did Auntie bully you?"  Mo Jue shook his head innocently, very protective of his wife, "No, my wife treats me very well."  Everyone silently mourned for Brother Big White. Any normal person with eyes could see that this was far from being good.  Su Man played with the food on her plate, her eyebrows slightly raised, her eyes occasionally landing on Mo Jue. Because she was sitting directly opposite, she could see him with just a glance, which didn't seem strange at all.  But what was strange was that Su Man looked many times, and everyone present was sensitive, except for Mo Jue who was oblivious, the rest could all feel it.  Su Man's sexual orientation was known to Ye Wei and Shiyi, and it was mentioned once on the plane.  Shiyi was always cool and collected, even Miss Cheng, who was usually very calm, could hardly maintain her composure because it was so suggestive.  Mo Jue's looks were indeed irresistible to both men and women, especially now with his innocent eyes, a peach blossom face, watery purple pupils, and tender pink lips, he looked very much like a pet suitable for keeping.  Seeing how Ye Wei enjoyed teasing him, it was quite fun.  So everyone immediately conjured up an intricate love triangle in their minds: Mo Jue took a fancy to Ye Wei, Ye Wei took a fancy to Su Man, and Su Man took a fancy to Mo Jue. This Ye Wei had been pursuing Su Man for over a year, and she came here mainly for Su Man this time.  Unexpectedly, bringing Mo Jue along somehow added a love rival to herself, and this love rival kept calling her "wife."  Everyone was now wickedly thinking about how aggrieved Ye Wei must be.  The little milk bun sipped on his iced coconut milk, his dark eyes darting around restlessly over his aunt, Big White uncle, and Su Man, looking very sly.  Ye Wei slowly put down her cutlery, smiling in a flirtatious manner, and got straight to the point, "Su beauty, have you taken a fancy to my Big White?"  Su Man's expression remained calm, her brows not even twitching, "Nonsense."  Mo Jue looked innocently at Ye Wei, as if afraid she would get angry, hastily waving his hands, "Wife, don't be angry, rest assured, I like my wife the most, I won't take a fancy to him."  Silence...  Shiyi turned her face away in embarrassment, her shoulders shaking a few times, apparently laughing madly.  Miss Cheng calmly tugged at the tablecloth, almost laughing herself onto the table. Ye Shaoshao's eyes twitched, wanting to laugh but feeling it was very impolite. After all, Su Man was the host and they were the guests.  The little milk bun choked on his coconut milk, sprayed it out in a different direction, and kept coughing.  "Ha ha..." In the midst of a strange silence, only Bai Ye laughed heartily, slapping the table. He was naturally carefree and indifferent, and it was the first time he acted out of character like this. Su Man's eyebrows were coldly raised, and with a motion as if in slow motion, her eyes swept over Bai Ye, sipping her tea with an air of lightness.  Mo Jue seemed oblivious to the consequences he had caused, looking around innocently, "What's wrong with you all?"  Ye Wei patted Mo Jue's head, quite comforted. She had been bullied by Su Man so many times without winning once. She didn't expect that with Mo Jue's appearance, he would give Su Man a big red face straight on.  Very good, very promising.  Seeing Su Man change her face was a very refreshing thing, although he was still very light and airy.  "It's nothing, Big White. You did well, and you deserve praise."  Ye Wei praised him generously, and Mo Jue naturally couldn't stop smiling when he heard his wife compliment him.  "Weiwei, you've trained a top-class pet." Bai Ye laughed so hard he was out of breath.  Ye Wei smiled charmingly, her laugh deviously cunning, "Su beauty, don't be shy. If you consider giving me a kiss, I might consider lending you Big White for a hug."  The others, "......"  The little milk bun was glad he wasn't drinking anything. Auntie, it's still you who's strong.  Ye Shaoshao couldn't help but feel that with such a sister, his life was truly complete.  Miss Cheng, however, felt that those with the surname Ye were indeed perverts. She had this realization long ago.  Su Man's eyes were still cold, her lips curving into an arc that was definitely not a smile, as if a frost had swept over. The man spoke evenly, without any waves, "In terms of personality, his condition is called a split personality. In terms of age, he is called dual age layers. In terms of the soul, he is not considered a complete individual."  ......  Another silence fell over everyone.  Ye Wei's smile faded, and she glanced at Mo Jue, "Have you encountered such cases before?"  "A few years ago," Su Man replied.  "Why does this happen?"  "How would I know?" Su Man answered coolly.  Ye Wei looked gloomy, "Su beauty, that's not very kind of you."  "I've always been this unkind."  Ye Wei was silent. Even if it was the truth, Su beauty, you shouldn't say it so confidently, o(╯□╰)o.  The little milk bun was curious, "Su Man, Mo Jue wasn't like this before. I've seen him once; he's worlds apart from now. He's been like this for many days now. When will he recover?"  Mo Jue was still very confused and didn't understand what they were talking about.  Su Man raised an eyebrow and glanced at Mo Jue, "I don't know."  "You said you've encountered cases before, haven't you?" Ye Shaoshao was also very curious.  Su beauty said, "This is not an illness, and it varies from person to person. Naturally, I am not clear."  Shiyi, however, was most concerned about another matter, "Can it be cured?"  "I don't know."  "Why do you not know everything I ask?" Bai Ye commented.  Ye Wei nodded in agreement, not knowing anything when asked, a quack doctor.  Su Man's cold gaze swept over Bai Ye, "If I ask you, you probably wouldn't know five things."  The others were silent. Su beauty, you're so vicious.  Bai Ye laughed nonchalantly, not caring at all, "It's not a disease, so it's normal not to know five things. Different specialties, no comparison."  Su Man sipped tea, unfazed, "Making excuses."  Bai Ye smiled, calmly sipping a glass of red wine, and everyone was silent.  The atmosphere was truly strange.  Ye Wei glanced at Mo Jue and kept silent. A split personality? She had never heard of it. Not a complete individual? That's even more nonsensical; he was clearly a living person. Chapter 374: The Beautiful Ink Jade Lady Returns  After dinner, Ye Shaoshao drove Cheng Anya and Little Bun out for a drive. Su Man originally wanted to act as a tour guide, but Ye Shaoshao refused, insisting that although he was not familiar with Liyade, with his all-capable son, they would surely not get lost. He did not want anyone else to disrupt the warm family time of the three of them.  The night scenery in Liyade was indeed very beautiful. Shedding its desert city appearance of over a decade ago with flying dust and sand, today's Liyade is filled with towering buildings, spacious and bright streets, and the city is brightly lit. Looking over, the street lights of the entire city lit up, giving people a feeling of a sea of lights.  The car moved slowly, and Cheng Anya noticed that the city had many fountains, with two fountains visible on almost every street, all uniquely designed, adding a touch of coolness to the hot summer days.  The city's greening was also quite good. Ye Shaoshao smiled and said, "Most of the Sahara Desert is within the territory of Saudi Arabia, and every bit of greening in Liyade city has to be artificially maintained, which is very costly. The fountains are just for regulating the city's temperature."  Cheng Anya nodded in understanding and showed respect. In fact, she also felt that Liyade was indeed too hot. During the day, at Su Man's mansion, there were ice jades everywhere, which was very cool. But once she stepped outside, the heat was overwhelming. Ye Wei cheerfully told her that 40 degrees was considered normal temperature, and the hottest could reach 45 degrees.  She finally understood why the streets of Liyade were so empty. Normally, no one would walk or shop outside when the daytime temperature was over 40 degrees and the nighttime temperature over 30 degrees. It was definitely self-torture.  The streets were really too empty. When there was no one around, they would get out of the car to take photos as a keepsake. Although hot and sweaty, Cheng Anya was smiling happily.  What they did not know was that a storm was brewing back at Su Man's mansion.  After dinner, Su Man entered the laboratory again to complete the antidote data for 1934 and continued researching the virus. He was the only person in the vast laboratory. When Ye Wei came, he was not surprised at all.  "Su beauty, how about I accompany you to spend a wonderful evening?" Ye Wei smiled charmingly, leaning into Su Man's embrace with a soft and fragrant body, hooking Su Man's neck with one hand, and smiling seductively, generously planting a kiss on Su Man's cheek.  Su Man did not even blink. Firstly, in terms of agility, he was no match for Ye Wei and could not escape. Secondly, such scenes of throwing oneself into his arms were too many, and he had become numb to them.  The man with black hair and a silver band was noble and cold. He slowly put down the dossier in his hand, and his cold and compelling gaze swept over Ye Wei, "If you want to seduce someone, at least dress professionally."  Ye Wei burst into laughter, her amorous gaze hooking the chin of Su Man, with an ambiguous expression, "I once stripped naked and wrapped myself in your blanket, and you remained unmoved."  "Good to know," Su Man said, brushing her hand away.  Ye Wei, a beautiful woman, brazenly attacked Su Man's chest, feeling the firmness and flatness, and expressed her grievance with a pout, "When can I feel something soft? Su beauty, it's really not generous of you not to tell me that you like men, causing me to chase you in vain for a year."  "You never asked," Su Man frowned, signaling her to get up. He really disliked being in such close contact with women.  Ye Wei refused to comply, hugging Su Man's neck and giggling, "Su beauty, if you had told me you liked men, I would have changed my sex for you back then, and by now we would surely have been a heavenly match. You just tore apart a perfect marriage, how can you live with yourself?"  Facing Ye Wei's irrational behavior and the belief that repeating a fallacy a hundred times turns it into truth, Su Man was very calm, "Even if you became a man, I still wouldn't like you."  "......Beauty, it's not right to judge people by their gender," Ye Wei said indignantly.  Why was it always impossible to hook Su beauty? Ye Wei was very conflicted. I am not calm anymore!  "Stop messing around, if you have something to say, say it quickly. I'm busy," Su Man said coldly, his imposing manner spreading throughout the room, intimidating enough to make ordinary people's legs go weak. But for Ye Wei, this kind of aura was completely useless; she had experienced even more awe-inspiring presences.  "Do you know why I'm looking for you? Are you pretending to be ignorant?" Ye Wei said.  "Just speak directly, your roundabout talk won't erase your affection for him," Su Man said bluntly. Although Ye Wei had entangled him for over a year, it was mostly in jest, and he was clear about it.  After all, he had tacitly accepted Ye Wei and Eleven as friends; otherwise, why would he have let them stay at his house for so long? No matter how strong they were, if he wanted to drive the two away, there were many ways.  "What if I like him?" Ye Wei admitted straightforwardly. Her secret being exposed did not embarrass or shame her at all; she openly acknowledged it, patting Su Man's chest, "As he is now, is he two people or one?"  "What do you think?" Su Man countered, "What are you concerned about?"  "He is a member of the mafia, possibly the mastermind behind Louis. So what if I like him?" Ye Wei said, her smile tinged with self-mockery, "It might just be a plot."  Su Man raised his eyebrows. Under the night's shadows, the man was dressed in white, noble and aloof, but his eyes were clear and intelligent, "Are you worried he's plotting against you?"  "It's a reasonable deduction," Ye Wei said, pulling over a chair to sit down, "I've spent my life scheming against others, and I never planned to be schemed against."  "Ye Wei, you're done," Su Man stated calmly, his voice warmed by a hint of warmth, "You've truly fallen for him."  Ye Wei's smile faded slightly, her expression becoming a bit cruel and domineering, "Su beauty, do you think I should kill him? To avoid future troubles!"  Su Man smiled, nobly detached, "I'm certain, you won't be able to do it."  "Ridiculous, there's no one in this world I can't kill," Ye Wei also smiled, her elegance and domineering attitude apparent, her pride unabashed and wilful.  "I'm certain," Su Man said solemnly, crossing his arms, "Ye Wei, you take what you want, you plunder, what you don't want, you destroy, you've always been like this. I advise you, the stiffest tree is most easily cracked."  "Don't compare half a catty with eight taels, you're not much better," Ye Wei waved her hand, "Aren't you the same? Me, you, Eleven, Bai Ye, all of us, which one isn't like this? Take the past Ink Jade for example, he was the same."  Su Man just looked at her, not speaking. His dark eyes held a terrifying clarity that disturbed Ye Wei, "You really don't know when he will recover?"  "I don't know, such people are rare, there are no precedents to follow, even if I have encountered them before, other people's situations can't be compared with Ink Jade's," Su Man said truthfully.  "Is there a way to keep him always as Da Bai?" Ye Wei asked.  "What do you mean?"  "Keep him like this forever."  "Ye Wei, that's impossible," Su Man said gravely, his tone extremely harsh, "This temporary personality appearing now is temporary, and it won't last long. The original one is the real him; don't get confused. It's like reality and virtuality, the current personality is virtual."  "I don't care, I just ask, is there a way to keep him like this forever?" Ye Wei asked sternly.  She didn't like the current Ink Jade more than the previous one; she knew very well that the previous Ink Jade was the real Ink Jade. But what Ye Wei worried about was that once Ink Jade returned to his previous personality, their relationship would be over.  If that was the case, it was better to keep things as they were.  "Would you rather guard a shell?" Su Man was surprised. This wasn't Ye Wei's character; the Ye Wei he knew was free-spirited and wilful, and would never go to such an extreme for someone.  "It's not exactly a shell; he's quite cute now," Ye Wei said, her expression turning cold, "Can you, or can't you?"  "Can't," Su Man said decisively, "A virtual soul existing in his body for too long will devour the original self, and in the end, he will die."  Ye Wei's brows knitted together.  Will he die?  She paused her breath slightly, feeling as if a stone was pressing on her heart, heavy and annoying, always harboring an ominous premonition.  "Su Man, I have a very ominous premonition, it's not him who will die, but me. What do you think, how should I deal with it?"  "Do you want him to die, or do you want to die?"  "Nonsense, I'm only in my early twenties; I don't want to die."  "Then isn't that the end of it?" Su Man countered, and Ye Wei was taken aback.  "Ok!" Ye Wei smiled, a hint of murderous intent flickering across her lips, "Understood."  She turned and left the laboratory.  As soon as she left, Bai Ye entered. Su Man's gaze darkened, cold and sharp as the coldest black iron, "What are you here for?"  "There's the latest virus analysis data from Rome," Bai Ye replied calmly, glancing in the direction where Ye Wei had left, "Are you sure you're not trying to break up a loving couple?"  "Lovers ought to be beaten," Su Man replied.  Bai Ye, "......"  Ye Wei sat alone in the courtyard, silent and brooding. She knew she shouldn't have gone to find Su Man, her mood extremely heavy. She had never been so hesitant in her life. She looked up at the moon in the sky and felt even more irritable in her heart.  Ink Jade, Ink Jade...  What should she do with him?  Ye Wei was also unclear about her own thoughts now. If Ink Jade reverted to his previous self, then they would be enemies. There might even be a major battle.  She was excited at the thought of the past when the two fought to the death, but also a bit helpless.  If he always remained Da Bai, then it would be unfair to them. As Su Man said, even life would become unreal.  Ye Wei didn't want that, and what she wanted even less was that if Da Bai's recent behavior was just an act, what kind of scenario would that be?  Ye Wei knew herself well; she would not show mercy to enemies, even if this enemy was Ink Jade.  Kill him? Unable to do it?  Su Man indeed had a pair of penetrating eyes that saw everything clearly. If she and Ink Jade were to fight, she would go all out.  But if it really came to killing him, could she do it? The incident at the beach was a living example.  If she were to kill him, she should do it now. She was very concerned about his behavior these past few days. If he reverted to the previous Ink Jade, she might not have the chance to kill him in this lifetime.  It was a sin they created, and they should end it themselves.  "Eleven, if it were Elder Ink, would you kill him?" Ye Wei suddenly asked.  Eleven coldly said, "Whatever I say won't count; you decide for yourself, so I don't mislead you."  "That means you would," Ye Wei smiled, her heart clear, "It's really tough, how can I bring myself to harm such an innocent Ink Jade?"  "......"  Ye Wei, you've really fallen too deep.  "Elder Ink has gone missing for so many days, where could he have gone?" Ye Wei muttered to herself, finding it very unusual, and worrisome, "You said that back on the beach, he almost dropped his gun for Ink Jade, willing to give up his life. Now that Ink Jade is in our hands, he has disappeared without a trace. Isn't that strange? He loves Ink Jade so much, it doesn't make sense for him to ignore him like this."  "I also find it strange," Eleven said, narrowing her eyes coldly, "Not just you, I also have a bad premonition."  As assassins, their intuition was the sharpest.  Ye Wei and Eleven exchanged glances, neither speaking much. After sitting for a while, Ye Wei went back to her room.  Ink Jade was playing with a computer on the bed. Ye Wei's brows knotted; she had never seen Ink Jade play with a computer these past few days. Seeing Ye Wei come in, Ink Jade cheerfully raised a smiling face, "Wife, you're back, come and give me a kiss."  Ye Wei smiled and sat down beside him, kissing his lips, "What are you playing?"  "Games," Ink Jade said, showing her his achievements like a treasure, "I defeated the monster."  "Awesome," Ye Wei smiled. It was indeed a game screen; her heart that was tense also relaxed.  This little idiot, she looked at Ink Jade sideways, his stunning face, and innocent smile.  Just like a child.  Who would actually have the heart to harm a child?  "Wife, why are you looking at me like that?" Ink Jade felt Ye Wei's gaze, paused the game, and asked curiously, his gaze somewhat blank. What's wrong with his wife?  "Nothing," Ye Wei replied casually, collapsing onto the bed.  This little idiot, why do your eyes have to be so innocent?  "Wife, are you very sad?" Ink Jade lay beside Ye Wei, his gaze a bit fierce, "Who bullied my wife? Tell Da Bai, and Da Bai will tear him to pieces."  An angel, instantly turning into a demon.  "Only my wife has the right to bully others, no one has the right to bully my wife," Ye Wei raised her hand, "Do I look sad to you?"  Damn, little idiot, do you know what sadness is?  A person without a heart, where does the sadness come from?  "You look sad," Ink Jade insisted stubbornly, "Wife, do you really like that Su Man?"  "Yes."  "What about me? What about Da Bai?"  "You're different," Ye Wei laughed and replied, patting his puffed cheeks, "Stop pouting, why do you care about Su Man?"  "I don't want you to like him."  "I also like third brother, Eleven, third sister-in-law, Ning Ning, there are so many people I like," Ye Wei raised her hand, watching Ink Jade's angry gaze, she found it amusing.  "Wife, you didn't mention me," Ink Jade's gaze looked particularly aggrieved, clutching Ye Wei's sleeve like a coquettish dog.  "Enough, I'm going to wash my face, I'll talk to you later," Ye Wei bounced off the bed and entered the bathroom.  Ink Jade unhappily pouted, tapping a few keys on the keyboard, and the game screen suddenly switched to another 3D image.  Drinking? Why did brother let him drink?  Ink Ye typed on the keyboard, after drinking, your wife will love you more.  Ink Jade was puzzled. Is that so?  Elder Ink: Be good, trust your brother.  Ink Jade's gaze turned to the side where two glasses of red wine were placed. These were delivered by the maid just now, and his wife never let him drink.  Curiously, he picked it up...  Ye Wei came out of the bathroom and immediately felt a change in the air. The room was carved with ice jade, exceptionally cool, but she felt her heart turn half cold. Ink Jade was sitting on the edge of the bed, slowly putting down the wine glass...  When did they have wine here? Ye Wei was shocked but saw Ink Jade look up, his pair of lustrous purple eyes, cold, grim, and exuding an eerie aura all over.  Ye Wei was still for three seconds, then she raised her usual flirtatious smile, "Hey, Ink Jade beauty, you awake?" Chapter 375: The Virus Acts Up Prematurely  Mo Jue slowly got up, his tall figure as if soaked in a layer of night, creating an overwhelming pressure. The already cool room felt as if a gust of icy snow had swept through, filled with danger. It was a tense and sharp atmospheric pressure, as if it wanted to slice a person into pieces inch by inch.  Ye Wei's smile became more and more enchanting, but there was a fierce murderous intent in her eyes, an indescribable cold ruthlessness and hostility, and a hint of complex determination. Paired with that smile, Ye Wei seemed like a poppy perched on the edge of a cliff. Beautiful, yet dangerous.  The two confronted each other without speaking, as if competing in a battle of auras, their equally beautiful and dangerous gazes fiercely colliding midair, sparking intense flames.  This feeling was all too familiar.  It was just like that time in the underground sewer, where both were ruthless, merciless, wanting to drive the other to death.  Mo Jue, you also want to kill me, don't you?  They were of the same kind. Since she had the intention to kill Mo Jue, she understood that the real Mo Jue would not spare her life either. It was mutual.  "Where is this?" Mo Jue asked word by word, his voice ice-cold. His memory still lingered on the island, the scene where Ye Wei hit him with a rum bottle. For the past seven days, all memories were blank to him.  He couldn't remember the things that happened when he was Da Bai (Big White).  However, based on his keen observation and amazing deduction skills, he knew that Ye Wei had escaped danger, and it was he who had helped her. Otherwise, on that island, even if Shi Yi (Eleven) were unharmed, the two of them couldn't have escaped from the island.  He knew that once he drank alcohol, he would become obedient to the first person he saw, so Mo Ye (Mo Jue's older brother) never let him touch alcohol. From his birth until now, he had only become a fool on rare occasions, and three other times were when Mo Lao Da (the eldest Mo) thought he looked cute when white, letting him drink. There was also once when they caused trouble as kids, Mo Lao Da had him drink and then act coquettishly towards their master.  Apart from these five times, this was the sixth.  Mo Jue knew all too well what kind of person Ye Wei was; she would definitely use him relentlessly, and his older brother would definitely spare Ye Wei and Shi Yi for the time being to protect him.  "Saudi Arabia, Riyadh."  Ye Wei smiled seductively, her voice like silver bells, "Mo Jue the beauty, do you remember nothing?"  This was an affirmative sentence. No matter how well he hid it, he revealed his traces once he spoke.  He doesn't remember, how truly...  Ye Wei was aggrieved. Although she felt she had oppressed Mo Jue more, in the past seven days, she had been extremely kind to him, hugging and kissing at will, almost to the point of pouncing on the bed.  She was rarely this kind-hearted, this gentle, and he actually didn't remember?  Ye Wei was very unsettled. Mo Jue coldly said, "No need!"  "No need?" Ye Wei raised an eyebrow. She didn't hear wrong, did she? The smile on the woman's face became colder, already tight with anger.  Mo Jue looked at her deeply, "I don't need these memories."  Ye Wei's eyes turned cold, and the flames in her eyes grew fiercer. She too smiled, "Is it unnecessary? You've just had a dream. Upon waking there are no traces, for me, it can't even be counted as a dream, naturally, there's no need to remember."  Mo Jue's gaze darkened, the curtains fluttered, and the entire spacious room was filled with a fierce murderous intent.  The atmosphere was tense, like a taut string.  Suddenly, Mo Jue moved, his figure swiftly like a specter, and in a blink, he was in front of Ye Wei. His five fingers spread out, aiming directly for Ye Wei's throat at an extremely fast speed. A gust of wind swept through, and Ye Wei repeatedly retreated, stepping on the wall to borrow strength and flipped over, landing behind Mo Jue. She turned around and kicked at Mo Jue's spine.  Mo Jue discerned the direction by the wind without looking back, and with a flick and pull, he tossed Ye Wei against the wall like an eagle discarding a chick.  Damn, that was ruthless!  Ye Wei turned in mid-air, and without giving her a moment to breathe, Mo Jue's palm was already on its way. Ye Wei propped her palm against the wall, kicking the wall repeatedly to avoid Mo Jue's palm wind, and grabbed the iron handle of a crystal lamp, gracefully spinning and kicking at Mo Jue, forcing him to retreat.  Ye Wei took the opportunity to land, kicking up a wooden chair in the room towards Mo Jue, following up without giving him a chance to react. However, Mo Jue's fist met the chair, and the massive impact force collided, shattering the chair to pieces.  Splinters flew everywhere.  His fist collided with Ye Wei's incoming fist, and in that instant, Ye Wei felt her wrist go numb, a sharp pain in her tiger's mouth. Her other hand opened, fiercely pressing and grabbing up along Mo Jue's arm, attempting to trap him with a reversal.  But Mo Jue easily turned his body, holding her in his arms with her back against him.  "You can't beat me." Mo Jue's voice was heavy, stating a fact without emotion.  His hot breath sprayed between Ye Wei's neck, the most familiar scent to her in these seven days. Ye Wei smiled faintly, "Then let's try and see who has the crueler heart."  As soon as she finished speaking, her elbow struck backward, which Mo Jue stopped with his hand, but suddenly felt a sharp pain in his other wrist. Ye Wei had twisted and turned, kicking fiercely at his head.  Caught off guard, Mo Jue was hit squarely, his body slamming hard against the wall. Ye Wei tapped her foot, the chair rose, she caught it, and smashed it hard at Mo Jue.  Mo Jue protected his head with both hands as the chair crashed onto his arms and broke apart.  Only a chair leg remained.  Made of iron and copper.  "Damn, Su Mei Ren (Beautiful Person Su), you're so rich yet you use counterfeit goods." The chair was too fragile; it broke so easily, definitely a counterfeit. Ye Wei tossed the wooden stick in her hand, and with a swing of her fist, she smashed it hard onto Mo Jue's handsome face.  Before she could enjoy punching him twice, Mo Jue caught her wrist and pulled her forward fiercely. Their positions switched instantly, and Ye Wei was pressed against the wall by Mo Jue, who punched her mercilessly without any consideration, landing four or five punches on her chest and abdomen.  "Playing tough?" Mo Jue's voice was dark as he ignored Ye Wei spitting out blood and raised another punch, landing it hard on her abdomen. Ye Wei vomited a mouthful of fresh blood, her face instantly pale as a sheet, feeling as if her organs had shifted, burning with pain.  The pain was unbearable...  Compared to their first fight in the sewer, Mo Jue was even more ruthless and faster this time, proving with actions that he was crueler than her, so she shouldn't try to play tough with him.  Ye Wei wiped the blood from the corner of her lips, an enchanting smile curling up, like a rose that lost its luster but stubbornly bloomed with her beauty, tenaciously emitting her charm, proud even in withering splendor.  "Why did you stop?" The beautiful Ye Wei smiled exquisitely, raising her hand and scraping it hard towards Mo Jue's face. He dodged by tilting his head, and Ye Wei followed through with another hand, her blood-stained palm hitting Mo Jue's face hard.  Mo Jue's eyes darkened, and Ye Wei laughed lightly, "This punch, this slap, all our interactions in these seven days, let's write them off. Neither of us owes the other."  He paused, and Ye Wei smiled. Enchanting and unparalleled, Mo Jue realized that during the fight, Ye Wei's palm wind had reached his chest, slapping it hard. Mo Jue stumbled back several steps.  Blood spilled from the corners of his mouth, and raising his eyes, he swept a cold glance. Ye Wei's palm wind came again, hitting his chest several times, not holding back at all, clearly intending to beat him to death.  Extremely ruthless.  Though she wore a smile, it was a suffocatingly dangerous one.  "Ye Wei!" Mo Jue, who was always sparing of words, was also angered, his body swiftly jumping up. The two fierce individuals crazily scuffled together.  It was a very clumsy way of fighting, as if both had forgotten their excellent martial arts, resembling a street brawl, all attack and no defense, an exchange of punches and slaps.  They fought like wild beasts, roaring and scuffling. The room's furniture was scattered and broken, none intact, looking like the aftermath of an earthquake.  Both were battered and bruised, here a bruise, there a purple mark, too ghastly to behold, especially Ye Wei, like a bloodied broken doll. But she seemed to have endless strength, stubbornly confronting Mo Jue, not showing any sign of weakness.  Such a commotion had already alarmed Bai Ye, Su Man, and Shi Yi, along with Ye San Shao, Cheng An Ya, and Xiao Nai Bao who had returned with them.  When they arrived, Ye Wei was on top of Mo Jue, punching him repeatedly with a vicious force that Bai Ye and Ye San Shao felt horrified watching. Suddenly, Mo Jue kicked hard at her abdomen, and Ye Wei was about to fall back onto a pile of broken glass. Shi Yi was about to move forward to catch her, but Mo Jue was quicker, pulling her hand skillfully, and both stood up from the ground.  As soon as they stabilized, they both punched out, hitting each other hard and fiercely, and both stepped back.  Shi Yi supported her waist, and Ye Wei managed to stand upright. Both were panting, looking disheveled.  Mo Jue's face, beautiful as a celestial being, was beaten to a sorry state, and Ye Wei wasn't much better off.  Everyone knew Mo Jue had returned to his original self by his expression.  Truly a world of difference.  "You two are really intense." Bai Ye's voice was light, the first time he saw Ye Wei beaten like this, Bai Ye truly thought it was a spectacle, definitely a spectacle.  Although he had the intention to watch the drama, his fists were clenched, ready to fight at any moment.  Ye Wei smiled seductively, like a blood-stained rose, "Mo Jue the beauty, I can't beat you, but how about a group fight?"  Mo Jue snorted, "You can try if you want?"  "Big White brother, no... Mo Jue, you're quite arrogant. Even if we overlook Wei Wei, just Shi Yi and I, you won't be able to leave this estate." Bai Ye laughed coldly, "As long as Wei Wei is willing."  Shi Yi snorted, "He won't be able to leave."  He dared to beat Wei Wei to this state; he can't think of leaving.  Cheng An Ya suddenly suggested, "Ah Chen, you go fight him. If you can't beat him, he still dies."  The virus, what a good weapon.  Bai Ye gave a thumbs up, "Good idea."  But Ye San Shao looked towards Ye Wei.  Suddenly, a tear gas grenade came through the broken window, shooting into the room. The glass shattered instantly, and white smoke rose within the room. Everyone quickly left the room, closing the door behind them.  When they entered again, there was no one left.  "Mo Lao Da is here." Xiao Nai Bao said. Since Mo Jue had disappeared, chasing him would be futile.  Shi Yi's brow furrowed, and Ye Wei suddenly clutched her abdomen, vomiting another mouthful of fresh blood, fainting in Shi Yi's arms.  "Wei Wei..." Ye San Shao and Cheng An Ya rushed forward in panic but dared not touch her, extremely anxious.  Ye San Shao looked at Bai Ye, "Bai Ye..."  "Let's go to my room first." Shi Yi said, and Bai Ye carried her to Shi Yi's room.  Ye San Shao wanted to follow and check, but Xiao Nai Bao entered Ye Wei's room. Ye San Shao and Cheng An Ya, fearing for their son's safety, could only stay behind.  Xiao Nai Bao avoided the debris and wood chips on the floor and jumped onto the bed.  "Ning Ning, what are you doing?" Ye San Shao asked in a deep voice, curious.  Everyone looked at the computer screen.  Mo Jue: Drinking?  Mo Lao Da: After drinking, your wife will love you even more.  Mo Jue: Is that so?  Mo Lao Da: Be good, trust your brother.  Ye San Shao's eyes twitched, and Miss Cheng asked the heavens silently, is this the so-called abduction?  "Damn, Mo Lao Da is too talented, just like that he summoned Mo Jue back?" This is obviously a blatant abduction.  The struggle between the big grey wolf and the little white rabbit.  Clearly, the little white rabbit lost.  "Mo Lao Da, truly Mo Lao Da." Xiao Nai Bao stroked his chin, his hands flying over the keyboard, and suddenly the screen seemed to crash, a flood of English scrolling rapidly.  Finally, it stopped at one place.  "Daddy, do you remember when we just came back and saw a car parked outside?" Xiao Nai Bao suddenly asked.  Ye San Shao nodded.  "Mo Lao Da is right there."  Ye San Shao was about to say something when suddenly his arm experienced a sharp pain, followed by pain in the liver area, as if fine needles were stabbing his liver. His limbs began to hurt severely, spasming, and he suddenly collapsed on the bed, convulsing.  "Ah Chen..."  "Daddy..."  "Go call Su Man quickly." Cheng An Ya said urgently, and Xiao Nai Bao jumped off the bed and ran out quickly.  "Ah Chen, hold on, it will be okay." Cheng An Ya wasn't sure if she was speaking to him or to reassure herself, her uneasiness growing, always fearing that she might lose him.  Her hands trembling with fear, Cheng An Ya's face was pale.  Didn't Su Man say it would act up tomorrow? Why did it happen earlier?  "Ah..." Ye San Shao suddenly screamed, his forehead's veins bulging, his delicate features twisting together as if bearing inhuman pain, and after reaching his limit... he fell into a coma. Chapter 376 Untitled  Ye Sanshao's virus acted up ahead of time, causing Cheng Anya to panic and feel as if she were sitting on pins and needles. She originally wanted to accompany Ye Sanshao, but Su Man suggested that it would be better for her not to go to the laboratory. Su Meiren always spoke with an irresistible authority, and even though Cheng Anya was worried and panicked, she listened to him and did not rush to the laboratory.  "Mummy, don't worry, Daddy will be fine," the little bun comforted Cheng Anya. His small, tender face bore a calmness and determination uncharacteristic of his age. He smiled elegantly, as if nothing had happened, impressively composed.  "Baby, Mummy isn't that helpless. There's no need for you to comfort me now, it's all right." Miss Cheng understood her son best. She smiled and asked him not to worry, although she was very concerned.  However, no matter how worried she was, she would still consider her son and not get so flustered that she couldn't even care for her son's emotions. If she were to panic, wouldn't it be embarrassing for her to be comforted by the little bun, who was also scared and worried? Hasn't she always been the most valiant mummy to the little bun?  Mother and son went together to see Ye Wei, who was seriously injured and unconscious. Bai Ye had already examined her and instructed someone to prepare medicine, and also administered painkillers to her.  Cheng Anya felt a little heartache looking at Ye Wei. She was so badly injured. Bai Ye's expression was calm, "The injury is severe for an ordinary person, but for Ye Wei, it's nothing serious. She'll recover in a few days."  "This isn't considered serious?" Cheng Anya was astonished. Would it only be serious if someone was beaten to death?  In Ye Wei's room, there were drips of fresh blood, and her clothes were also stained with blood. It was apparent she had been beaten until she vomited blood. To have caused Ye Wei to be seriously injured to the point of unconsciousness was already a very severe injury.  "It's all right, she'll be fine after a few days," Bai Ye said with a light laugh, as Shi Yi carefully applied medicine to her.  "What kind of deep hatred do they have with each other, that they fight so fiercely as if trying to kill each other? It's not necessary, right?" Bai Ye stroked his chin, pondering seriously, feeling that the situation was very strange. Was Mo Yu angry out of embarrassment?  "When have they not fought like it's a matter of life and death?" Shi Yi said coldly with a snort, now more curious about why Mo Yu suddenly got better. It was too sudden, "Bai Ye, when do you think she'll wake up?"  "She should be awake by tomorrow morning," Bai Ye said, poking Shi Yi's shoulder and asked, "Shi Yi, did Wei Wei really fall for it?"  "What do you think?"   "Did she fall for Big White Brother, or for the beauty Mo Yu?" Bai Ye was more curious about this issue.  The little bun tilted his head, pondering for a moment, "Probably for the beauty Mo Yu?"  "Why?" Shi Yi and Bai Ye asked in unison. Bai Ye thought to himself, Ning Ning baby, you also understand what it means to fall in love? The times are advancing too fast.  "It's a feeling," said the little bun. Mo Yu's personality is more appealing to Ye Wei. And Big White? Because it's Mo Yu, after he turned into an idiot, Ye Wei would willingly follow him. If it were someone else, she would have shaken him off long ago. When all is said and done, it's still because it's Mo Yu.  "Poor Wei Wei," Bai Ye looked at her injuries, feigned a sigh, crossed his arms and laughed, casual and free, "I'm a bit looking forward to seeing how Wei Wei will win over such a formidable beauty as Mo Yu."  Cheng, who had been silent, couldn't help but speak up, "I've never understood, Big White and Mo Yu, is there a difference? Aren't they the same person?"  "Mummy, it's almost the same, isn't that too much?" the little bun retorted. Bai Ye agreed, and so did Shi Yi. They never regarded them as the same person.  One devil, one angel. Different races, different factions, they cannot be compared.  "No, but your daddy, occasionally he's also very serious, and sometimes he's an idiot, isn't he? People have many sides to their personality, so why can't Mo Yu?" Cheng Anya said with a smile, sharing her view, "It's all the same person."  "Not the same."  "The same."  "Mummy, three against one, the minority is subordinate to the majority. You lost, stop struggling," said the little bun with a smile, looking like a little gentleman from the upper class of England, endearing to no end.  "......" Cheng Anya was speechless, damn, that was too undemocratic.  As if seeing what Cheng Anya was thinking, the little bun smiled again, "Mummy, democratic choice, have you ever seen when it was truly democratic? You say society is harmonious, but when has society ever been harmonious?"  Bai Ye and Shi Yi raised their thumbs up, strong, just one word.  Cheng Anya was aggrieved, "You're a grown man, you shouldn't bully a weak woman like this."  The little bun, "......um......"  The group chatted and laughed as they left Shi Yi's room. Bai Ye said with a smile, "They really are an extraordinary mother and son."  "Their whole family is extraordinary," Shi Yi succinctly commented. Every single one of them is an extraordinary freak.  "Mr. Su, the master asks you to go to the laboratory," a maid came hurriedly to invite Bai Ye, and everyone was startled. Bai Ye nodded and went to the laboratory with her.  "Ning Ning, what's wrong?"  "Su Man asked Bai Ye to go to the laboratory," explained the little bun. Cheng Anya's heart sank. Could it be that Ah Chen's condition has worsened? Her heart thumped wildly, and Cheng Anya's face instantly turned extremely pale.  She sat alone in the courtyard, and the little bun originally wanted to accompany her, but it was already very late, and Cheng Anya asked him to go back to sleep. The little bun could only return to his room to rest.  It was also very hot in the evening in Liya, with almost no wind, and the outdoor temperature was unbearably high. Even wearing a short-sleeved shirt would feel too hot. However, Cheng Anya's limbs were unexpectedly cold, with a thin layer of cold sweat on her forehead, and she felt no warmth at all.  Cold. A kind of cold that seeped out from inside to outside, extremely uncomfortable. This feeling was like when Louis told her that she had a virus in her body, and they were waiting for Ye Sanshao to come. It was very frightening.  The night grew heavier, and it was already late. She wanted to go to the laboratory to have a look several times but didn't dare to get close. She knew very well what the virus looked like when it acted up. When it happened to her, it was unbearably painful, and she always felt it was very hard to endure. But she didn't suffer long before Louis would inject her with a reagent to relieve the pain. However, she had seen with her own eyes how Zhang Bo hit his head against the wall until it was bloody in that small house because the pain was too much and chose to kill himself.  The more she thought of Zhang Bo's tragic state before his death, the colder Cheng Anya felt, her heartbeat sped up, and that ominous premonition once again surged in her heart.  The night was very quiet, with only the sound of water spraying from the fountain in the courtyard. She used to find it soothing, but tonight it made her feel irritable.  She walked in the courtyard for a while, then sat down again, crossed her arms in thought, looking particularly serene, as if she had merged into the night, quiet as if she didn't exist.  After a while, she suddenly stood up, as if she had made some decision, and headed towards the direction of the laboratory.  The closer she got, the more terrifying it felt. She was afraid to hear Ye Sanshao's howling, but unexpectedly, it was very quiet. Cheng Anya reassured herself that maybe it was nothing. Bai Ye's medical skills were so high, and Su Man was a virus expert. This wasn't like when Zhang Bo was ill; maybe there was a turning point. She shouldn't scare herself.  She resolutely opened the door to the laboratory and walked straight in.  Bai Ye was recording and studying the data on the screen, the first to notice Cheng Anya. He raised an eyebrow, "Anya, why are you here?"  Su Man was experimenting with two reagents, not even lifting his head, and was analyzing the combination with a microscope, very focused and oblivious to anything else. Cheng Anya said softly, "Continue with your work, I won't disturb you. I'll just accompany him."  Bai Ye glanced at Ye Sanshao on the operating table and nodded.  The laboratory wasn't very large, but the equipment was complete. Cheng Anya felt it was like a modern research center, as if it was a scene only seen in movies.  On the operating table, Ye Sanshao was in isolation clothing, wearing an oxygen mask, and his limbs were shackled with handcuffs and leg irons. His arms, chest, thighs, calves, and even his head were pierced with many needles, connected to several bottles of liquid Cheng Anya did not understand, which steadily flowed into his body.  Cheng Anya lowered her eyes and held his hand, but unexpectedly found a pool of blood on the floor. Following her gaze towards her feet, there was also a large patch of fresh blood on the floor. Cheng Anya looked at his wrist, where the handcuffs tightly clasped.  Due to struggling, there were two obvious wounds on his wrist, bleeding profusely.  She suddenly bit her lower lip, holding back the tears in her eyes, imagining how he had struggled and how he had hurt himself. Without looking, there would probably be wounds on his ankles as well. He must have tried to break free.  Ah Chen...  Through the isolation clothing, she held his hand. Cheng Anya looked at the unconscious Ye Sanshao, her heart aching in waves, wanting to cry but unable to shed tears. She couldn't cry; he must get better.  Evil begets evil, good begets good, the one who should be punished is Louis, not Ye Chen who has suffered all his life.   Ah Chen, don't be afraid, I will be with you, always with you. Even if we go to hell, I will be with you and never let you be alone.  Cheng Anya remembered that she once swore that from then on, she would be Ye Chen's guardian angel. But she didn't fulfill her promise, and it was because of her that he almost lost his life. What kind of guardian angel was she?  More like a disaster star.  Cheng Anya was a bit annoyed, holding Ye Sanshao's hand tightly, biting her lip to hold back the tears that wanted to come out, just quietly accompanying him.  Ye Sanshao was deeply unconscious, his pale face looking very peaceful. His breathing was very weak, his heartbeat faint, his hand slightly warm, which made Cheng Anya feel somewhat relieved.  He was still alive, and that was good.  As long as he lived for a second, she would accompany him for a second. If he lived for a day, she would accompany him for a day. Chapter 377 Untitled  Cheng An Ya had been accompanying Ye Sanshao in the laboratory until late into the night. After Ye Sanshao was given a sedative, he fell into a groggy sleep. In the research lab, there was only the sound of electronic equipment blinking and the clinking of test tubes and the reaction of reagents—very quiet indeed. She indeed fulfilled her promise. Despite the fear in her heart, she did not bother Bai Ye and Su Man, fearing that she would affect their work.  The two men, one conducting experiments and the other analyzing data, worked in perfect collaboration, exchanging information and then busying themselves with their own tasks, with hardly any conversation.  She sat quietly by Ye Sanshao's side, extremely tired yet unable to feel sleepy. She watched his face intently and occasionally looked up at Bai Ye and Su Man, gauging the progress of the situation from their expressions.  Later, Bai Ye could not stand it anymore and said, "An Ya, you should go back to rest. Ye Sanshao won't wake up after taking the sedative until we have prepared the antidote. Your staying here is not helping."  "It's okay, I'm not tired," Cheng An Ya said, insisting on staying with Ye Sanshao.  Bai Ye smiled, "I'm not worried you're tired, but I'm worried that the virus in your body will become more unstable and act up earlier."  Cheng An Ya opened her mouth but said nothing, still holding onto Ye Sanshao's hand, unwilling to let go. She knew Bai Ye was right, but she did not want to leave.  "You can't just not eat or sleep and stay with him for days and nights," Bai Ye advised, knowing that Ning Ning's mother was even more stubborn than Wei Wei and it was hard to persuade her. Seeing the stubborn look on her face, he felt that talking would be in vain.  "Just a little longer," Cheng An Ya said, wanting to stay as long as possible, as there was nothing else for her to do if she went back.  Bai Ye shook his head, allowing her to have her way, knowing that she would leave when she was tired.  He really didn't quite understand what love was, why intelligent people could also become foolish, and why they would choose such a silly act that was not at all helpful.  Bai Ye handed over the analyzed data to Su Man, just in time to exchange for Su Man's experimental data.  Su Man slammed the materials down on the table to one side, his cold gaze sweeping across the room, seemingly causing a gust of cold wind to rise. He said indifferently, "Having a woman here annoys me, it's counterproductive."  Bai Ye, "..."  Su Meiren, you're ruthless!  To say such a thing, with such an indifferent tone and an impatient and cold attitude, it seemed quite convincing. Then Bai Ye thought of his sexual orientation and fell silent. Maybe there was something to it.  Otherwise, he wouldn't avoid a beauty like Wei Wei.  Cheng An Ya slowly stood up, her lips twitching, and wanted to bang on the table in frustration, "Su Meiren, you don't have to be so gender-discriminatory."  Su Meiren's face was expressionless, with an air of 'I am gender-discriminatory, what can you do about it?', self-righteous and arrogantly proud, without any sense of chivalry.  Miss Cheng floated out of the research lab like a ghost.  She had to leave; Su Man had said he didn't want to see women around because it annoyed him. She couldn't stay, as it was a small matter that their research might be affected, but not finding the antidote was a major issue. Whether true or not, she really couldn't stay in the lab any longer.  Bai Ye gave a thumbs up, "Strong."  Su Meiren raised his brows and snorted coldly, continuing to work. Since time was urgent, Bai Ye didn't have the mood to dawdle and went back to analyzing data on the screen.  This was the most difficult disease he had encountered since he started practicing medicine; he had to pay full attention to keep up with Su Man's pace.  There was competition, which was inevitable. Su Meiren had been arrogant and presumptuous from the beginning, and his attitude of disdain for everyone was annoying. Bai Ye, known as a genius doctor, could not tolerate such disdain and was determined to make him acknowledge his abilities.  His title of genius doctor wasn't just for show.  "Su Meiren, I curse that you fall into the hands of a woman someday," Cheng An Ya muttered.  Would a lover of male romance not like women? It was her first time hearing such a thing. He must have said it on purpose to drive her away. If lovers of male romance were all gender-discriminatory, then fujoshi and fans of male romance would be so heartbroken.  The world was almost conquered by fujoshi. Thinking back on her years of dominance online, she knew many fans of male romance, each of them turning pale at the mention of it, ferocious like wolves, quite terrifying, and she herself was a genuine fan of male romance.  The feeling of being despised was really damn unpleasant.  Suddenly, an image crossed her mind. People often say that when a man and a woman are alone together, sparks fly, but what if it's just men? Especially if one of the men is gay. Bai Ye was reputable and capable, not to mention handsome and refined, which was...  Suddenly, she imagined them in a loving embrace, and Miss Cheng felt disheveled in the wind.  Ah, she must be sick to have such thoughts. Su Meiren looked like someone who would kill anyone who crossed him, with a cold and harsh appearance. Just a glance at his proud and arrogant, noble and untouchable demeanor made one feel like they were desecrating a celestial being. How could he possibly have an affair with Bai Ye?  It was his gender-discriminatory comment that had stimulated her, causing her thoughts to stray.  o(╯□╰)o。  Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, seven days passed. Ye Wei's injuries were healed, with no sign of bruising on her face, completely back to normal. Her little nephew jokingly called his aunt an indestructible cockroach, as she recovered too quickly.  She had been almost crippled by Mo Yu last time and recovered very quickly, and this time was no different.  One would expect her to feel some loss, but since waking up, Ye Wei had been all smiles, behaving as usual with no sign of anything unusual, as if she had never met Mo Yu.  She didn't mention Mo Yu or Big White Brother at all. It was as if this person had disappeared forever from her world, not worth mentioning. There were some issues with the first terrorist organization, but since they were not managers, Ye Wei and Eleven simply stayed in Liyade.  During this time, the outside world was calm, except for Melilia, where Chu Li was furiously bombing Prince William of Country R over a desert, leading the most elite air force of the first terrorist organization. Considering that Ji Wei was also in the castle, he dared not carry out a sweeping bombardment, but could only circle around with advanced munitions. Even more viciously, Chu Li, not content with half measures, poisoned the water supply near the castle, directly cutting off their source of life.  He sent the air force to circle above the castle every day, as if to say, 'I have all the time in the world to wear you down, let's see who can last longer.'  Such a barbaric and domineering approach could indeed only be done by terrorists. Given Chu Li's cunning, cutting off the water supply was already mild. If not for considering Ji Wei, the war would have been even more twisted and cruel.  On Dragon Gate's side, Lin Yixuan won the lawsuit and was released. The senior officials of City A personally confirmed it was a misunderstanding.  Tang Si's condition was also improving, and Dragon Gate had someone in charge.  On behalf of Ye Sanshao, the little baby was involved in Dragon Gate's affairs in North America, coordinating with terrorists to prepare for supporting Chu Li at any time, and dealing with the Spanish, Italian, and other governments' crackdowns and suppressions.  The baby suggested moving as much of the Middle East's power as possible to avoid the limelight, because Chu Li's actions were clearly a provocation to Country R. Whether willing or not, neighboring countries had to help, if not with people, then with condemnation.  With the recent clash with the mafia also alarming many, in short, countries came with aggressive intentions, hoping to use this opportunity to weaken the first terrorist organization's power.  Chu Li remained defiant, circling the desert daily, teasing Prince William, completely ignoring the government's encirclement and suppression, even arrogantly stating that it was a private grudge between him and Prince William, and anyone who intervened would be unlucky.  Given this person's usual behavior, most small countries indeed only dared to speak out, not take action.  During the first terrorist organization's clash with several governments, it should have been the golden opportunity for the mafia to act. The baby thought Luis would definitely mobilize the mafia to suppress the first terrorist organization and take the chance to unify the dark forces.  Unexpectedly, the mafia seemed to have disappeared. Except for a few small-scale military actions in the Middle East in cooperation with the government troops, there was no trace of the mafia's activities.  The baby was puzzled and only found out upon investigation that Luis was only trying to use the authorities for a proxy killing, hence the clash. He himself, however, stayed out of it, watching the snipe and clam fight.  Eleven said in a deep voice, "This doesn't fit Luis's usual style."  Ye Wei nodded in agreement. Although they didn't deal much with the mafia, Luis's usual style would not be so low-key. Even if he were using a proxy, he wouldn't be so quiet.  "Could it be the Mo brothers?" Cheng An Ya suddenly asked, having been discussing these matters with them for the past few days and gaining a general understanding.  "What are they trying to do then?" Ye Wei sharply pointed out the crux of the issue, and even the baby couldn't figure it out for a moment.  "Joining forces with government troops won't last long."  Ye Wei laughed enchantingly, "The commander said last night that the anti-terrorism organization has started to intervene, and government troops will soon disband. They never dreamed of it. War, that's the enemy of anti-terrorism."   Chapter 378: There's an Affair!  Little Bun was silent for a moment, recalling how the officer had blasted them in the group chat last night, and reluctantly told them to retreat quickly to the designated area to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. That feeling was indescribable, it was so delightfully chaotic. This time, it was the first terrorist organization's largest and most influential military operation in history. The counter-terrorism organization had been eager to get involved, even during the incident on Deadly Island where they tried to arrest people. This time, the threat extended to country R, which had very good relations with South American and European countries, so it was natural for them to intervene.  The most likely outcome was the dissolution of the joint government forces. If they got involved, the most likely result would be mutual destruction. To rescue country R and maintain peace, the best approach would be to dissolve the government forces and frame the whole dispute as a personal grudge over jealousy and competition for a woman between Chu Li and Prince William.  That way, the matter would come to an end, and peace could be maintained.  "It looks like it's going to take half a month. If the officer uses his connections to shake up the mafia, that would be even better," Little Bun said, touching his chin and smiling slyly. He too wanted to sit back and watch the fight between the snipe and the clam.  But as hot-tempered as the officer was, he was still very smart. It wasn't easy to scheme against him.  Eleven agreed, "If you want the officer to do something, you have to offer something of equal value. Think about whether he wants to catch someone or solve a case, otherwise you can't move him."  "The officer just likes to make a fuss. All he needs to do is say the word to Ningning for any information," Ye Wei said with a smile. "Chu Li better hurry up and win his woman over, otherwise if the mafia launches an attack, he'd be caught unprepared. Ningning, haven't you been able to find any news on the mafia?"  Little Bun touched his nose and smiled, saying, "I guess it'll take a few more days."  Ye Wei nodded, and Little Bun's lips curled into a teasing smile, his eyes sly and sparkling. "Auntie, you just want to hear about Uncle Bai's news, right?"  "I'm eagerly awaiting his news so I can make a move," Ye Wei smiled charmingly, playing with the luminous cup in her hand, appearing completely unconcerned, as if Mo Yu and Big Bai had no effect on her at all.  Cheng Anya laughed, "Weiwei, don't pretend to be strong, you won't be able to beat him."  That was the absolute truth. She had been beaten up and had only just recovered. She probably wanted to dismember Mo Yu, but strength spoke for itself, and she had to admit, Mo Yu was just too strong.  Ye Wei raised her eyebrows, her smile resplendent as a rose. She hooked her arm around Eleven's shoulder, "I have a great partner. Alone I can't beat him, but together we surely can. If a fair fight doesn't work, we'll gang up on him, right, Eleven?"  Eleven was as cold as frost and simply shook her head, "Mm, alright, we'll cooperate next time."  Cheng Anya smiled warmly, looking as fresh as a blooming lily, her pure beauty and bright eyes hiding a hint of amusement as she innocently asked, "Weiwei, don't you have a gun on you? Why do you need to fight with your hands?"  Little Bun pursed his lips and smiled. Mommy, spot on. You're always so sharp, yet you seem so harmless.  Even Eleven couldn't help but look at Ye Wei sideways. What Anya said made sense. Ye Wei was known as a sharpshooter who could use both hands to shoot with exceptional agility. Even in a fight, she could quickly draw her gun. That day, Mo Yu had no hidden weapons or firearms. If Ye Wei wanted to kill him, it would have been easy.  That day, she had seen Ye Wei's hand almost reach the gun handle, but ultimately she did not draw it. Although the movement was as quick as lightning, the many years of tacit understanding were not fake. Ye Wei knew every move in a fight like the back of her hand.  Beaten up like that and still not drawing a gun to kill – what else could that explain?  The Ye Wei they knew would rather dismember someone than take a punch. Yet she ended up being beaten half to death by Mo Yu.  Ye Wei's expression remained unchanged, her smile becoming even more enchanting, "Sister-in-law, you don't understand. I prefer to move my muscles. Close combat is the quickest way to find the opponent's weakness. This is called tactics."  Little Bun was silent. Auntie, you really have the nerve to say that after getting beaten to death. Why bother understanding tactics then?  Cheng Anya nodded as if she understood, "That's right. When you came to kill Achen, you shouldn't have shot from above. You should have looked for his weak spot up close, right?"  "Sister-in-law, you're really vicious. If Third Brother fought me, I guarantee you wouldn't recognize his face," Ye Wei said cheerfully, feigning complete innocence.  Cheng Anya laughed as well and didn't continue to question.  Ye Wei lowered her eyes and swayed the luminous cup in her hand. The wine inside swirled, and from the side, it looked like a dazzling light entered the liquid. Indeed, grape wine under the luminous cup was one of life's great pleasures.  So, whatever Mo Yu, whatever Big Bai, get lost.  In the clear wine, a pair of calm eyes were reflected.  "Has Third Brother shown any signs of waking up?" Ye Wei suddenly asked. She hadn't gone to the lab, and these past few days while recuperating, she rarely left her room.  Cheng Anya also stayed away. Ever since Su Man said that women would only annoy him and hinder his work, regardless of whether it was true or not and how worried she was, Cheng Anya was truly waiting for news and didn't disturb them in the lab.  But she knew that Third Young Master Ye had not yet awakened.  The virus was too powerful.  "Not yet. Su Man said that until the antidote is developed, he has to continue like this, relying on nutritional supplements, sedatives, and some other reagents I don't understand," Cheng Anya said with a gentle smile. She had gone from being worried to being calm.  "Third Brother really is plagued with misfortune," Ye Wei said with a bit of heartache. If she had to say who she loved most in this world, it definitely wasn't Big Bai or Mo Yu, but Third Young Master Ye.  Cheng Anya felt the same. Everyone understood that Third Young Master Ye's vitality was dwindling by the day. The seven-day deadline had passed, and he could only rely on these medicines to maintain his heartbeat.  Although she was heartbroken, she felt helpless. Why was it that she was fine, but Third Young Master Ye was in critical condition?  "Mommy, Auntie, I believe that Daddy will be fine," Little Bun said with an elegant smile. "With me and Mommy in the world, Daddy won't want to leave. Otherwise, if Mommy marries someone else with me, he would jump out of his coffin even as a ghost."  Ye Wei and Cheng Anya couldn't help but laugh, and even Eleven's lips curled up a little in amusement. It was indeed very much in Third Young Master Ye's style.  Originally, Cheng Anya thought that Ye Wei and Eleven must have a lot to do and suggested they leave Riyadh first, but Ye Wei insisted on staying. No matter how the outside world was in turmoil, Riyadh remained calm. Since it wasn't suitable for too many people to guard the place, the two of them took responsibility for the safety of the Ye family.  They had failed their duty last time, leading to a series of events. This time, Ye Wei and Eleven wouldn't possibly leave, as history wouldn't repeat itself on them.  Suddenly, Eleven asked, "Anya, since Louis can touch you, could his blood be the antidote?"  "Ba Ye also mentioned this issue. If we analyze his blood, it might be faster. But, Louis must have thought of this too. He's disappeared without a trace, and we simply can't find him," Cheng Anya said, still feeling creeped out when mentioning Louis.  "Where could he have gone? I always feel like this is the calm before the storm, and something is bound to happen."  "Mommy, don't think too much. Last time's events won't happen again. You can rest assured."  Although there weren't many people here, Su Man's mansion was impregnable. Even Mo Ye could only watch from the perimeter and couldn't get close; others couldn't even dream of coming in.  This place was like a fortified manor, with only exits and no entries. It was completely safe.  "I'm not worried about that. Anyway, I can't explain it."  "Sister-in-law, I'm actually curious about something. Why hasn't the virus on you acted up?" Ye Wei squinted her eyes and asked. "Counting the days, there are only a few days left in the one-month deadline. Even if it's not the death deadline, the virus should have acted up already."  "I don't know either."  Cheng Anya herself was puzzled. These past few days, she was fine, completely normal. Su Man and Ba Ye were both devoted to saving Third Young Master Ye and hadn't paid much attention to her.  After all, if she had an outbreak, she would be lying on the operating table just like Third Young Master Ye, either waiting for death or waiting to wake up.  "Actually, I find it strange too." Little Bun smiled and then adorably raised his index finger. "Of course, Mommy, I don't want you to have an outbreak."  "Sister-in-law, you must be a mutant." Everyone laughed.  While they were joking, they heard footsteps. Ba Ye and Su Man came out. The two had stayed in the lab for two days. There was a bit of weariness between their brows. When they came back, Cheng Anya and the others immediately surrounded them.  Su Man's complexion looked really bad. Despite looking exhausted, his cheeks were slightly flushed. The flames leaping in his cold eyes made Ye Wei involuntarily pinch her own arm. Huh, no fantasy? Even the beautiful Su Man could change color. What's going on?  She vaguely felt that she had missed a good show.  "Su Man, is the antidote ready?"  "Ba Ye, how is Achen?"  ...  "Tomorrow," Su Man said succinctly.  Ba Ye waved his hand, took a seat, and took a sip of tea before saying, "We're missing the last ingredient. Success or failure depends on tomorrow."  Cheng Anya's heart, which was hanging by her throat, finally settled. She thought their expressions meant that hope was slim and didn't know how long they would have to wait, but it turned out to be good news.  Her pale face flushed with color, and her eyes almost teared up. Although she had acted normal these past few days in front of Little Bun, only she knew how worried she was at night, always looking in the direction of the lab.  She prayed to God more than a hundred times, only hoping for his safety.  "That's great."  Little Bun's face brightened with relief, and the child's nervous emotions also eased.  Su Man rubbed his head, his expression relaxed a bit, and his tone softened, "Worried sick, huh?"  Ye Wei couldn't help but be annoyed. It's true that children are favored. Su Man had never spoken to her so tenderly. She despised Little Bun, this latecomer. Ye Wei was very conflicted.  "Worried." Little Bun grinned, glanced at Su Man, and then at the very calm Ba Ye beside him. He sensed something was odd, "Su Man, Ba Ye, if it's good news, why did you come in with such scary expressions?"  Something's not right.  Ba Ye opened his mouth to say something, but Su Man swept a sharp glare over, and Ba Ye raised his hand, smiled, and made a zipping gesture over his mouth, continuing to drink tea.  Everyone was puzzled. Ye Wei's eyes rolled between Ba Ye and Su Man's faces. In fact, everyone including Little Bun had overlooked the slap mark on Ba Ye's face.  The hall fell into a deathly silence.  Su Man gave a cold snort, his eyebrows sharp as knives, and that cold aura was truly frightening.  Ba Ye smiled, and everyone thought Su Man was about to kill him next. Who knew he just swept a cold glance over Ba Ye and left with a flick of his sleeve.  Everyone looked at his retreating back, exchanging bewildered glances.  What happened?  Little Bun hopped into Ba Ye's arms, his small palm touching the slap mark, his dark eyes blinking. "Ba Ye, what happened to your face?"  "Swatting mosquitoes. The mosquitoes in Riyadh's summer are much bigger," Ba Ye said calmly, putting down the teacup and rubbing Little Bun's head. Little Bun was very frustrated. Why did everyone like to touch his head?  Ye Wei squinted her eyes and hummed. Little Bun compared his own fingers with the slap mark, very practically verifying, "Ba Ye, your fingers don't seem that thin."  Everyone nodded in agreement, their eyes fixed on Ba Ye's face.  They all had the ultimate expression of seeking the truth from Ba Ye.  Knowing that the virus was about to have an antidote, Cheng Anya's heart was also relieved, and she couldn't help but pay attention to the beautiful slap mark on Ba Ye's face. It was hit just right, with a lot of force.  One could tell at a glance that the hand was beautiful, slender, and delicate.  "Stop pretending, it was Su Man who hit you, right?" Ye Wei laughed with a hint of danger. The expression seemed to be gnashing teeth, very conflicted.  "Why did he hit you?"  "Ba Ye, what did you do?"  "You didn't indecently assault him, did you?"  ...  Everyone expressed their doubts almost unanimously.  Ba Ye calmly put down the teacup, "So tired, I'm going to sleep."  Everyone watched Ba Ye's graceful retreating back, then thought of Su Man's cold and compelling beauty, and they all sensed a hint of an affair.  Ye Wei was aggrieved, clenching her fist, "Ba Ye, you better not go gay aaaah..." Chapter 379: Pregnant  Ye Wei, the beauty, was showing her fangs and claws, really wanting to rush forward and tear Bai Ye into shreds like hand-pulled beef. Her gorgeous features were twisted together, looking particularly terrifying, like a vengeful ghost. It seemed as though Little Bun could even see the ghostly figure of Ye Wei with her flowing hair.  "Vivi, stay calm, stay calm, don't freak out," Miss Cheng said with a light smile, but the teasing in her eyes couldn't be hidden. Anyone could see that the beautiful Vivi had lost her composure.  Eleven looked up at the sky speechlessly; when it comes to genius, Vivi was the strongest. Fortunately, Bai Ye didn't turn his head when he heard this, truly calm, not something ordinary people could compare to.  Little Bun weakly raised his hand and asked, "Auntie, I have a question, what does 'bent' mean?"  Miss Cheng's smile twisted, stiffening for a moment.  Eleven observed from the sidelines, as unmovable as a mountain. Ye Wei turned her head and gently patted Ning Ning's head, saying with heartfelt instruction, "Good child, you're definitely not 'bent,' so you don't need to know."  Little Bun tilted his head adorably, smiling with an innocent face. Although he didn't know the specific meaning of 'bent,' he knew it certainly wasn't a pure word, judging by the reactions of the women.  "Mommy said learning has no end."  "Darling Ning Ning, you should know that not 100% of what elders teach is correct; otherwise, there wouldn't be so many murderers in the world," Ye Wei said seriously.  Ah, she was not calm anymore.  Eleven shook her head, very puzzled, "Mo Jue has no influence on you at all? You still have the mood to compete with Su Man?"  This woman was becoming more and more secretive.  "Who does he think he is? How could he compare to Su the beauty? I'm really struck by this," Ye Wei lamented with a sad face, seeking sympathy, "You're all too much for not sympathizing with me."  "Do you need people's sympathy?" Cheng Anya was very eager to watch the drama, "It's normal for you to go berserk."  Indeed! Thinking about it, Ye Wei had been chasing Su Man for so long without any reaction, but Bai Ye and Su Man had only been together for a few days and it seemed like there was a hint of an illicit affair in the air. This jq (affair) was blatantly floating in front of her, naturally she felt struck.  Although Su the beauty's reaction wasn't great, at least there was a reaction, and it was such a fierce one. Would any random person stay calm in this situation? Impossible.  "Third sister-in-law, Eleven, did Su the beauty blush just now?" Ye Wei asked in confusion, her smile becoming more twisted.  "Seems like it," Miss Cheng said with more subtlety, while Eleven nodded directly; both of them looked at Ye Wei.  Ye Wei blinked her eyes and, unexpectedly to the two women, didn't go berserk but instead stroked her chin and asked, "Why?"  "What 'why'?" Ye Wei rolled her eyes, "Bai Ye likes women, right? Su Man likes men, right? So when a single man and a widower get together, the one who should be in danger is Bai Ye. So if there's a hint of an affair, it should be Bai Ye who is furious, Su the beauty should be calm. Why is it the other way around with Bai Ye calm and Su the beauty freaking out?"  "Right." Miss Cheng thought about it too, she hadn't thought about it carefully before, but after Ye Wei brought it up, she found it a bit strange, "Did Bai Ye tease Su the beauty? Otherwise, why would he get slapped?"  "Not at all." Ye Wei and Eleven denied in unison. Bai Ye wouldn't do such a thing; he didn't like men, although Su the beauty's looks could captivate many, even men might throw themselves at him.  However, Bai Ye was not so superficial. They had known each other for more than ten years, what kind of scenes hadn't they seen? They also understood Bai Ye's character, he absolutely wouldn't do such a thing. He wouldn't even tease women, let alone men.  "Then why would Bai Ye get slapped?" Cheng Anya asked again, the three women looked at each other, all with questions in their eyes.  "It should be for taking liberties that he would get slapped," Eleven said, "But Bai Ye isn't that kind of person, so that assumption is negated."  "Then it's impossible." Miss Cheng tilted her head, very puzzled.  "Could it be that Bai Ye directly exercised his rights over Su the beauty on the spot?" Ye Wei said something shocking, and everyone was stunned by her words. If Bai Ye wouldn't tease, how could he possibly skip the steps and just pounce on someone? It's a matter of procedure.  "If Su Man had been 'had,' it would definitely be the other way around, she would have 'had' Bai Ye and then sent him to see the King of Hell. Would she only slap him once?" Eleven said coldly, deeply dissecting Su the beauty's twisted personality.  "Besides, Ye Chen was also in the lab at the time." The three women fell silent once again, with Little Bun weakly raising his hand, "Aren't you supposed to consider that I'm here too?"  "Why are you still here? When you hear us discussing these adult topics, you should immediately leave," Miss Cheng glared at him righteously, as if it was his fault for hearing and it had nothing to do with them.  "Exactly."  "Agreed."  Little Bun, "......"  Women, indeed, are very frightening creatures. Still, his Nono is the best.  "Ah, I can't stay calm anymore. Why is my rival in love a man..."  Ye Wei completely lost it and turned to head toward the central courtyard. Her figure seemed to float over, looking particularly horrifying.  Dinner time.  Everyone gathered, Miss Cheng, Ye Wei, Eleven, and Little Bun's four pairs of eyes kept drifting between Bai Ye and Su Man, their expressions a bit conflicted.  Miss Cheng was a senior lover of Danmei (boys' love) and was extremely content now that the antidote was in sight. Naturally, she had the leisure to enjoy the affairs of others. In fact, from her many years of experience in the Danmei world, Bai Ye and Su Man were definitely a well-matched pair. Su Man was white as snow, cold and proud, while Bai Ye was graceful and elegant.  The two of them were a rare sight of good looks, standing together very eye-pleasing, very much like a match made in heaven. A pair of strong attack and strong receive type, which she liked the most.  The palm print on Bai Ye's face had faded after an afternoon, and he was now dining with a light breeze, very modestly accepting the unanimous attention of everyone. His calmness was not something ordinary people could compare to.  Ye Wei pulled her chair closer to Su Man and asked with a grin, "Su the beauty, why did you slap our Bai Ye brother?"  Bai Ye brother? Everyone shuddered, Su Man didn't lift an eyelid, "No comment."  "No comment, ah, don't be so stingy," Ye Wei clung to Su the beauty's sleeve and acted coquettishly, "Did our Bai Ye brother bully you? I'll help you beat him up. I know you can't beat him, no worries, I can."  "No need to trouble yourself." Su Man snorted coldly. Indeed, he was not as skilled as those special agents, but to put someone down, Su Man had plenty of ways without relying on force.  "It's no trouble, no trouble. Actually, I've found him very unpleasant to look at, and I've been wanting to beat him up for a long time. It's not troublesome at all," Ye Wei continued with a smile.  As Little Bun questioned the heavens for the nth time for having such an aunt, without the most shameless, only more shameless, ordinary people really don't have this kind of adaptability.  "Then please do as you wish." Regardless of what Ye Wei said, Su the beauty dismissed her with the four-word mantra, and even Ye Wei felt that the guy's mouth was too tight. It was even less likely to dig out any inside story from Bai Ye.  "You're all too much for not entertaining the public with such excitement. It's better to be happy together than alone," Ye Wei protested dissatisfied.  Eleven agreed.  Miss Cheng continued to dine, and Little Bun stayed out of the firefight to avoid collateral damage.  "Bai Ye brother, you're straight, right?" Ye Wei blinked her eyes and asked innocently, "I remember last year that Miss World was still revolving around you, a Russian beauty, ah, I even saw you kissing, you should be straight, right?"  Bai Ye paused for a moment, his brows raised slightly, "You really are omnipresent, you even saw that?"  "I just said that figure looked like you. It turns out it was," Ye Wei clapped and laughed, "Since you're straight, I'm relieved. Don't covet Su the beauty."  Bai Ye smiled without responding, and Su the beauty, unlike her outburst at noon, seemed like nothing had happened, calmly telling Miss Cheng, "You should rest early, we need to take blood samples tomorrow, don't eat anything before entering the lab."  After saying that, he stood up and left. Everyone looked at his plate, which was almost untouched.  Cheng Anya responded, asking Bai Ye, "Is the last ingredient for the medicine my blood?"  Bai Ye nodded, "Yes."  Cheng Anya felt relieved, success or failure would depend on tomorrow. Bai Ye said it, and she didn't doubt it at all. His tone was relaxed and confident; she should be half at ease.  "Third sister-in-law's blood, eh? I thought we needed Louis's blood to do it," Ye Wei pondered, "Hurry up and get well, I miss him."  "There should be an 80% chance."  "By the way, Bai Ye, why hasn't third sister-in-law's virus acted up yet? She looks almost the same as a normal person, why is third brother so serious?" Ye Wei asked curiously.  "The first virus carrier is naturally more stable than the second carrier, that's not strange. Besides, there are still several days left before the one-month deadline, I've given her a mitigating agent, which can alleviate it for more than ten days, so the virus is under control, there's no problem," Bai Ye said with a gentle smile.  "I see." Cheng Anya nodded, no outbreak was always a good thing.  Eleven looked at Bai Ye's plate, which was empty, and she raised her eyebrows, "If I remember correctly, you two haven't come out for two days, why do you eat so much, and Su the beauty eats so little? Is it because of a bad mood, no appetite, and he's ironclad?"  Ye Wei poked Bai Ye's arm, "What exactly did you do to him? It's a rare thing for Su Man to physically attack someone."  Several pairs of eyes fixed on Bai Ye's face, and Bai Ye smiled lightly, "No comment."  "Eleven, we haven't exercised for a long time." Ye Wei twisted her wrist with a threatening smile, Eleven indicated that she received the message, they could move tonight, suppress by force, see if he would speak.  Bai Ye raised his hand, he had a golden pass to avoid death, "I have to detoxify Ye San every day."  Everyone, "......"  "Then it's easy to handle, break your legs, you can still detoxify in a wheelchair, we need your brain not your legs."  "Auntie, you're ruthless!" Little Bun gave a thumbs up.  Bai Ye automatically treated these words as if they were wind by his ear. The maid served them abalone soup, sparing a portion for each, and Diana said, "This is what the princess sent to the master last time. It's very delicious. The master asked me to prepare it for everyone to taste."  Ye Wei propped her head and smiled, "Diana sister, your lips are getting sweeter and sweeter. Su Man would never instruct you to do this, it must be your idea."  "Vivi Miss is smart," Diana smiled, beneath the black veil only a pair of bright and black eyes could be seen, shy and timid, very beautiful. Although her full face was not visible, judging from these eyes, Diana was definitely a beauty.  Ye Wei smiled; Su Man liked plain tastes and didn't like seafood. Abalone, if left in the mansion, would only fatten the mice. Moreover, it was sent by the princess, it must be a good thing.  "This flavor is a bit strange," Miss Cheng fanned herself and frowned, smelling very uncomfortable.  "It's alright, very fragrant," Little Bun said.  Diana spared a bowl for everyone, and when placed in front of Cheng Anya, she suddenly felt nauseated. But because they were all there, it wasn't good to be too rude, so she could only barely hold back. The smell kept drilling into her nose and she couldn't hold back anymore, covering her mouth and rushing out of the dining room, retching non-stop...  Diana and the others were stunned, Little Bun and Ye Wei quickly put down their chopsticks and chased after her. Cheng Anya leaned against the pillar and vomited non-stop, everyone looking at each other with puzzled faces.  "Mommy, are you not feeling well?"  "Third sister-in-law, what's wrong with you?"  ...  Cheng Anya couldn't stop vomiting for a good while and finally stopped, the whole person feeling a bit floaty.  Bai Ye had a frown on his forehead, and after Cheng Anya cleaned herself up, he wanted to take her pulse. Cheng Anya smiled, "It's nothing, I may not be used to the smell."  "Give me your hand." Bai Ye smiled gently, and Cheng Anya could only extend her hand. Bai Ye took her pulse through a thin layer of paper. After a while, his brows raised, and he looked at Cheng Anya with a strange expression.  Little Bun was anxious, "Bai Ye, what's wrong with my mommy? Is the virus acting up?"  "It's not the virus." Bai Ye murmured, "She's pregnant." Chapter 380: Should We Keep the Child? Pregnant?  Cheng Anya’s eyes widened in shock, her mind went blank as if struck by lightning, leaving her at a loss. It felt as surreal as hearing about aliens invading Earth. Bai Ye also found it odd, as if he couldn't believe it. He took her pulse several times and finally confirmed it, looking at Cheng Anya with a strange look in his eyes, as if contemplating something.  "Bai Ye, are you sure you didn't get it wrong? Is Third Sister-in-Law really pregnant? They've been on the run and took two flights. If she was pregnant, the child would have been lost by now. How could it possibly still be alive?" Ye Wei also felt it was fantastical. There had been many vigorous actions along the way; was it that the child had a strong fate, or...  Shi Yi did not express an opinion, and the little milk bun, touching his chin, also pondered seriously about what kind of situation this could be.  "It's indeed a pregnancy pulse; she is pregnant," Bai Ye said definitively, looking at Cheng Anya with a bit of surprise. Cheng Anya was still in shock, sitting dazedly as if the pregnancy had nothing to do with her.  Everyone looked at each other, not knowing what to say.  The little milk bun waved his hand in front of Cheng Anya, and she finally snapped back to reality, her face a bit pale, "This child..."  Seeing her look like this, Ye Wei and the others couldn't help but think that the child might be Louis's. If it really was Louis's, that would be really... complicated. Louis coveted her and had captured her for so many days. It wouldn't be strange if he had touched her without restraint and had thoughts of doing something to her.  It seemed like the pregnancy wasn't that far along, a logical conclusion. Seeing the peculiar look on Cheng Anya's face, Ye Wei and Shi Yi couldn't help but think the worst, but the little milk bun quietly watched his mommy.  "It's been less than two weeks, about ten days or so," Bai Ye said, his expression becoming even more peculiar.  "What?" Ye Wei exclaimed, her eyes suddenly taking on a peculiar look, her lips twitching, "Third Brother isn't lustful, is he?"  Ye Wei was very quick to react, quickly thinking of the time when Ye Third Young Master contracted the virus and when they escaped. About ten days or so definitely ruled out Louis; it had to be Ye Third Young Master.  Considering that Ye Third Young Master had worn gloves the whole way to avoid physical contact with her, everyone assumed that they had collided with each other while parachuting in the desert and then contracted the virus.  But the truth seemed to be so shocking.  Ye Wei's expression easily led others to speculate, and Cheng Anya's face turned red with embarrassment. Wei Wei, aren't you being too direct?  Shi Yi also felt the situation was very shocking. For the first time, he was amused, "So it goes, 'A man's true nature,' no lies there."  Ye Wei followed suit in a well-coordinated manner, speaking in clichés, "To die under a peony is to be a romantic even in the afterlife. Third Brother... really has the guts. Brains full of lust, what an idiot..."  She finally understood what 'preferring beauty over life' meant.  "It's not what you think," Cheng Anya hurriedly waved her hands, but it seemed as if it was just as they thought. As soon as she spoke, everyone's gaze fell on her, filled with insinuation and a kind of 'no need to explain, we understand' look.  So, Miss Cheng calmed down.  Alright, since everyone thinks so, let's just leave it at that. Since Ye Third Young Master had always given off such a fierce impression, she simply stopped talking to avoid making things worse.  How could she be pregnant? Cheng Anya couldn't clearly define her feelings. There was a bit of joy, a bit of hesitation, and even a bit of fear. Getting pregnant at this time wasn't a good thing.  That time at the castle, she had been infected with the virus, and Ye Third Young Master, regardless of the consequences, did what he did without any contraception because they had to escape. They hadn't thought too much about it, and an accident had happened.  It was really a matter of life and death. Cheng Anya was very conflicted. Why was her success rate so high? Twice, both times successful? If she got pregnant every time in the future, wouldn't she set a Guinness World Record? Cheng Anya's thoughts were in disarray. Her imagination ran wild to the extent that she was unparalleled, truly powerful. She imagined a situation where a dozen children surrounded her, calling her mommy.  Cheng Anya finally understood what it meant to be 'startled into alertness,' coming back to her senses with a gulp. Too frightening.  Ye Wei, Shi Yi, Bai Ye, and the others had already been shocked by the range of emotions on her face, enjoying a silent mime show. As exciting as it was, the little milk bun weakly asked, "Mommy, what are you thinking about?"  Cheng Anya shook her head, quickly returning to her usual smile, without even blinking, "Nothing."  They didn't know the situation, so naturally, they didn't know what she was thinking about. She herself had been thunderstruck, and if she told others, they would laugh for three days and nights. Perhaps only such an extraordinary pregnant woman would think of such a mess of things upon learning of her pregnancy.  However, it wasn't a 100% hit rate either. That day, Ye Third Young Master had fought for almost a day and a night, and both of them didn't know how many times...  Cheng Anya felt psychologically balanced.  "Bai Ye, could there be any problems with the child?" Cheng Anya brushed away the messy thoughts in her mind. What she was most worried about now was the health of the child. She became pregnant in an unhealthy condition, and her body had been injected with several kinds of relief agents, which could likely harm the child. If a child was born with missing limbs or was mentally disabled, it would be better not to have them from the start.  Although it was hard to let go, how could she bring a child into the world if they weren't healthy?  "Right, could the child be infected with the virus?" Ye Wei and Shi Yi asked in unison.  Bai Ye pondered with a serious expression, "The specific situation is not yet clear. After all, it's still too small. We must wait until the child grows a bit before we can thoroughly examine it. The virus will definitely infect the child."  It was just a question of how much or how little. Cheng Anya's pregnancy seemed to complicate the detoxification process.  He had to consult with Su Man about this.  Cheng Anya clenched her fists anxiously, her heart pounding. This pregnancy felt different from the last time when she was pregnant with Ning Ning; there was more joy last time, but now there was more panic. She was afraid she couldn't keep this child.  Ye Wei saw her thoughts and spoke softly, "Third Sister-in-Law, don't worry too much. The virus will be cured tomorrow. Since the child is still small, maybe when your virus is cured, the child's virus will be cured too. Even if the child is not healthy and has to be aborted, it's not a big deal. You and Third Brother are still young; there will be plenty of opportunities to have children in the future."  The little milk bun's face, tender and pink, showed reluctance, "I want Mommy to give birth to a little brother or sister."  "We want that too, but they have to be healthy to be born," Ye Wei said, feeling a bit heavy-hearted. It seemed like it was really hard to say. Generally speaking, without even checking, they knew the child wouldn't make it.  Cheng Anya also thought about this, her face losing its luster, her dark eyes dimming, a trace of pain crossing them. Really, must she abort it?  She didn't want to be too pessimistic; she hoped to keep it. She couldn't bear to abort the crystallization of love.  "Anya, don't worry for now. Let's wait until the virus in your body is cleared, and then we can talk about the child. There might still be a chance," Bai Ye said. His smile was always distant but so warm, making people feel comfortable, especially in his white doctor's coat, which reassured people even more.  Cheng Anya nodded, smiling, "I know."  Ye Wei turned her head, pondering for a moment, and asked, "Bai Ye, Third Sister-in-Law has always been in good condition without any other symptoms. Is it possible that the virus has all transferred to the child?"  Cheng Anya also thought about this. Her body had always been healthy. Was it possible that it had really transferred to the child? If so, the child definitely couldn't be kept.  "There is that possibility," Bai Ye furrowed his brow. But Cheng Anya's blood analysis definitely still showed the virus; it wasn't possible that all of it had transferred to the child. If it had transferred to the child, then the child definitely couldn't be kept.  "I'll go consult with Su Man," Bai Ye said, leaving the hall for Su Man's room.  His brow was unusually heavy.  Cheng Anya had a foreboding feeling, as if the little life that hadn't been with her for long might be a fleeting encounter, and in the end, it was just false happiness. Her heart ached like it was being pricked by needles.  "Mommy, don't worry. Once Bai Ye and Su Man discuss it and check you thoroughly, we'll know," the little milk bun said with a smile. He didn't like to see Mommy with a worried face.  "Right, Third Sister-in-Law, don't worry too much. Maybe we're worrying over nothing," Ye Wei said with a smile.  Cheng Anya smiled, "Don't worry, I'm fine. I was just wondering if it's a boy or a girl."  The little milk bun quickly raised his hand, "I like a little sister."  Little sisters are the cutest. He could be the little sister's protector, and he would definitely be a good big brother.  "Why don't you want a little brother?"  "A little brother is fine too, but I still prefer a little sister," the little milk bun said with a smile, somewhat excited, "If the little sister is fine, she can come out soon."  "Ning Ning, baby, I bet with you, it's definitely going to be a little brother."  "I bet on a little sister."  "Then you're definitely going to lose. According to the Ye family tradition, yang prevails over yin," Ye Wei said, touching her chin, speaking earnestly.  Cheng Anya, "...It seems so."  "I still want a little sister." Chapter 381: The Beauty Under the Moon  Cheng Anya went back to her room alone, sitting there uneasily. She wasn’t sure if it was just her imagination, but she felt that the child in her belly was growing strong, and there was a sense of connection between their hearts. Earlier, with so many people around, she didn’t feel anything particularly different; she was just shocked. Now, standing alone on the balcony and looking at the bright moon in the sky, her heart surged with emotion.  It was as if wave after wave of warmth was engulfing her, and she had a strong maternal feeling, even more touching than when she first found out she was pregnant with Ning Ning. Perhaps this child, conceived out of her love with Ye Chen, held even more significance than Ning Ning did at the time.  Ning Ning was her pillar in a foreign land, while this child was the crystallization of her love with Ah Chen. Moreover, she didn’t know if the child would have a chance to be born or if it would be healthy. This uncertainty would make any mother pay more attention and love to their child. There was no doubt about that.  Whether the child would be healthy and could be kept safe was now the biggest issue. Every mother in the world has the same mindset: to love their child and treasure them, hoping they can survive and grow up safely. Cheng Anya was no exception.  Tonight, in the city of Liya De, the moon was full, and the soft moonlight was clear and gentle, shining on the world, enveloping the brightly lit city as if it were wrapped in the tender embrace of a mother. She couldn't help but pray that heaven would give her child a chance to survive.  Cheng Anya was not a fatalist, but she couldn't help thinking that if prayers really worked, she wouldn't mind praying devoutly every day, sincerely asking for blessings.  “Mommy.”  Ning Ning appeared quietly on the balcony, his smile warm and gentle. His face had thinned, no longer as chubby as before, and he carried a more grown-up appearance. As a mother, she felt an extreme tenderness for him and wished he could always remain cute and pink.  "Why haven't you gone to bed yet? It's so late."  Cheng Anya, afraid of impulsively embracing him, moved a bit to the side. Ning Ning pouted in dissatisfaction.  Cheng Anya glanced at him, "No protesting."  "Mommy, don't be so cautious."  "I’m a natural germ, stay away from me."  Miss Cheng rebutted with a single sentence.  "What's wrong, can't sleep?"  "A little bit, Mommy. Will I really have a little sister?" Little Bun's eyes gleamed as he looked at Cheng Anya with the words "little sister" practically written in his gaze, clearly longing for one.  Cheng Anya didn't know how to respond. If she told the truth, she might disappoint Ning Ning; if she lied, it wouldn't be what she wanted. After hesitating for three seconds, Cheng Anya chose to tell the truth, "It's not certain yet, don't get your hopes too high. With daddy and mommy here, it's not just a sister; you could have a brother too."  Little Bun chuckled, "Mommy, don't be so funny, okay? And I don't want a brother, I want a sister."  He then recalled a saying, "Love will come, and so will bread." o(╯□╰)o.  "Alright, then it will be a sister."  Cheng Anya smiled and said, hoping more than Little Bun that the child would be safe and healthy. Once Ye Sanshao woke up, he would surely be surprised. Cheng Anya imagined that he might even exclaim that his hard work overnight wasn't wasted.  Cheng Anya was embarrassingly stunned.  "Mommy, I've noticed you're a bit biased towards boys."  "Nonsense."  She preferred daughters; they were pretty, and she could dress them up and make them look beautiful, which felt like an accomplishment, "I like little sisters too."  "Then why do you always mention brothers?"  Little Bun scorned Cheng Anya, pointing out the most direct evidence. From the beginning, he never heard her mention a sister, let alone liking one. It was a deception.  "Didn't your aunt say? The Ye family tradition is that males thrive and females do not."  Cheng Anya argued righteously, saying if she was biased, it was entirely Little Bun's fault.  Who made her own son more beautiful and adorable than girls, and more considerate and filial than daughters?  "Then, Mommy, just keep having babies. If you have ten or eight, surely you'll have a sister."  Little Bun spoke seriously, and Cheng Anya's face darkened. He nodded earnestly, thinking his idea was very good.  "Am I a sow to you, so you wish I wouldn't live?"  If she could move people at will, she would have slapped him already.  Little Bun smiled with his eyes narrowed, feeling very cheerful, and Cheng Anya’s worries about the child were somewhat dispelled by Little Bun, "Haven't you thought that Mommy might not be able to keep this child?"  "With Bai Ye and Su Man, there will surely be no problem."  Little Bun smiled, "I trust them. Even if a sister comes out looking like Ultraman, they can turn her into Snow White."  Cheng Anya, "..."  What a fierce theory and vivid metaphor.  My son, this is blind trust, Miss Cheng silently asked the heavens.  Little Bun said, "I still hope you can be safe soon, and then I can settle the score with Louis properly."  Mentioning Louis, Little Bun's voice carried a hint of bloodthirsty fierceness, and his whole demeanor seemed to don a sharp coat. This domineering and murderous aura was evident, and only in front of Cheng Anya would he be so unrestrained.  "Louis, huh..." Cheng Anya looked up at the bright moon, "Didn't he disappear without a trace?"  "I'm working hard to find him. As soon as my abilities improve a bit more, I won't need to be wary of Mo Ye and Mo Yue."  Little Bun said solemnly, currently Louis could hide without a trace, and the mafia could disappear because Mo Ye and Mo Yue had perfect hiding abilities. He had been exploring his limits these past few days, trying to break through his own boundaries.  He would not give up so easily.  "Alright, just take good care of yourself."  Cheng Anya said lightly. She knew that Xu Nuo's death had to be avenged, and Ning Ning had put all the blame on Louis. Without dragging Louis to accompany Xu Nuo in death, he would not stop.  "You can also leave Liya De now."  Cheng Anya said, "It's fine here with daddy and mommy. If necessary, we can call Black Hawk and others over as well."  "How can that be? I can only rest easy when you are safe."  Little Bun smiled, "In my heart, daddy and mommy always come first. How can I neglect you just for revenge? That's not acceptable."  "Fine, don't try to cheer mommy up. You’ll forget your mother when you get a wife. Later, I'll focus on training your sister."  Cheng Anya half-jokingly said.  Unexpectedly, Little Bun didn't deny it, instead saying, "Women will also forget their mothers when they have husbands. Mommy, you’re like that, and you still want to teach your sister?"  Cheng Anya was left speechless by Little Bun, struggling to respond, "So, in this world, parents are the most tragic."  Little Bun, "..."  Well... that's a bit serious.  "Mommy, in this world, I still love you the most."  Little Bun said earnestly.  Cheng Anya's heart ached. Yes, she knew her son loved her the most because his most beloved was no longer there.  Cheng Anya didn't feel like her son was stolen from her. Instead, she felt very heartbroken.  "I know."  Cheng Anya smiled, "Baby, you have such a sweet mouth tonight."  "Mommy is pregnant, I'm happy."  Little Bun laughed, and Cheng Anya shook her head.  "I hope your daddy wakes up tomorrow. I'm somewhat looking forward to his reaction."  "Daddy will probably say, 'Damn, I haven't enjoyed enough of our two-person world, and here comes another light bulb.'"  Little Bun imitated Ye Sanshao's cursing, and Cheng Anya laughed so hard she collapsed on the balcony railing.  "Baby, you're too good at this."  ......  Su Man's manor resembled that of an ancient noble estate, with modern designs as well as classic courtyard styles. The courtyard where Su Man lived alone was like a small courtyard-style garden. The exterior of the house had an ancient charm, resembling a bungalow, but with an elegant appearance, white jade walls, glazed roof tiles, and many white jade lotus lanterns under the eaves, providing an elegant atmosphere.  The courtyard was filled with various exotic flowers and plants of strange breeds. Bai Ye, upon one glance, was startled to realize that he couldn't even name a single purple-blue flower there.  He felt an exotic fragrance filling the air, refreshing and invigorating.  "What kind of flower is this?"  Bai Ye curiously squatted down and examined it closely. It looked a bit like a rose, but not quite. He had never seen a purple-blue rose before. As he reached out curiously to touch it, he heard Su Man's distinctively cold voice carried over by the night breeze, "If you don't want to die, you'd better not touch it."  His voice was as cold as an ice spring in winter, enough to chill someone even in the heat of summer. Bai Ye drew back his hand. Really deadly, a poisonous flower? Who would plant poisonous flowers all over their own garden? Such an odd temperament.  "What brings you here?"  Su Man asked coldly. Standing in the moonlight, his figure was even more tall and straight, his demeanor sharp, noble, and otherworldly, like a deity. His beauty would make even men pause for a moment.  The beauty under the moon, unparalleled in elegance.  Bai Ye mused to himself that this cold demeanor must be directed at him. He was well aware that despite their warming relationship over the days, it had unexpectedly deteriorated again, which was... quite unexpected.  With a gracious smile, Bai Ye said, "I came to discuss something with you. Cheng Anya is pregnant." Chapter 382: The Innocent and The Scheming  Su Man was taken aback, seemingly not expecting Cheng An Ya to be pregnant. His brow furrowed coldly; after the flash of astonishment, Su Man's piercing gaze swept towards Bai Ye, sarcastically saying, "Don't you pride yourself on being a genius doctor? How come you didn't find out a few days ago? A false reputation indeed."  Bai Ye smiled gently, comforting like a spring breeze, his tranquil brows seemingly lifting a warm wind as well, not minding Su Man's ridicule in the slightest. "Why are you blaming me? You didn't notice it either."  The last time he checked on Cheng An Ya was 8 days ago, and at that time, she was only about two days pregnant. The symptoms were not at all obvious. Moreover, their attention was all on the virus, so how could they notice her pregnancy? Even with the most thorough check, Su Man's lab was for virus research, and blood analysis didn't include such detailed responses. It wasn't an obstetrics and gynecology department, so it would have been strange if they had detected the pregnancy. This matter had nothing to do with his medical skills.  With a cold humph, Su Man responded, "I'm not a doctor."  Su Mei Ren pushed all the responsibility away with just one sentence. He indeed wasn’t a traditional doctor, so it was very normal for him not to diagnose Cheng An Ya's pregnancy. But Bai Ye is a genius doctor who also didn't diagnose it; that definitely meant his medical skills were lacking.  Bai Ye kept silent in his heart, thinking that Su Mei Ren should be more generous as a person.  It was obvious that Su Mei Ren didn't know how to write the word "generosity," and he sipped his lips lightly, "Pregnancy and the virus outbreak aren't too closely related. Detoxification should proceed as usual. What's there to discuss?"  Bai Ye shook his head, a hint of firmness in his smile, "You can't say that. An Ya is pregnant, and the child is very likely to be infected with the virus."  "Abort it," Su Man stated matter-of-factly, cutting the conversation short, "This is a cellular virus. The child is infected with the virus right from the womb, who knows what kind of monster will be born."  Bai Ye's eyes narrowed slightly, a trace of solemnity on his face. He had also considered this issue. A cellular virus is different from other viruses; it can change the genes of the human body, and indeed, there are concerns that the child might be a bio-human or a mutant. That would certainly be a tragedy.  But now, everyone was looking forward to the birth of the child, and suddenly saying to abort it would be too cruel.  "What if the child is not infected with the virus?" Bai Ye asked.  Su Man scoffed coldly, "You still need to ask such a stupid question? What kind of genius doctor are you if you don't even understand this basic medical knowledge? The child is growing in a pool of viruses, and you are still hoping against hope that there's no infection?"  "Su Mei Ren, medical judgments are not necessarily one hundred percent accurate, there might really be a chance," Bai Ye said unafraid of Su Man's mockery, lightly putting forward his judgment.  Su Mei Ren's face darkened, his gaze chilling and ominous, "If you call me 'Su Mei Ren' one more time, I'll poison you to death."  Bai Ye kept silent. Su Man stood against the wind, dressed in white surpassing the snow, his ink-black hair tied with a silver ribbon, his hair fluttering in the moonlight, beautiful like a dream or a fantasy, like a celestial being stepping out of ancient tales. Indeed, a beauty in name and reality.  Besides, people like Ye Wei, the little milk bun, and others call him 'beauty,' so why can't he call Su Mei Ren the same?  Apparently sensing what Bai Ye was thinking, Su Man's aura grew even colder, that unangry yet imposing aura quite frightening.  Bai Ye, knowing the situation, decided not to call him that anymore. Su Man may not have the same skill, but he had plenty of poison on him, and Bai Ye was pondering what kind of poison powder might come his way with a flick of Su Man's hand.  "I came to talk to you about An Ya and the child. Ning Ning really wants this child, you wouldn't bear to let him down, right?" Bai Ye played his trump card; all of these people doted on Ning Ning. Indeed, the child's young age had its advantages, but more importantly, this child was indeed very lovable, otherwise, Bai Ye wouldn't be so desperate to protect Ye San and Cheng An Ya.  Su Man indeed quieted down, "We have to wait for the child to grow a bit before we can be sure. If the child is infected with the virus, it's mostly not advisable to keep it. This type of virus is extremely unstable and might mutate during the entire pregnancy period, causing other effects. Of course, if they want to take a gamble, I have no objections."  To gamble, this virus could combine with cellular layers to produce a superhuman child, perhaps even more terrifying than Ning Ning, but the chances of that are very slim. Even adults cannot merge cells with the virus, and for an unborn baby, the chances are even slimmer.  Bai Ye fell silent; he understood everything Su Man said.  "If the child is infected with the virus, will the antidote work?" Bai Ye asked.  "There's an eighty percent chance it won't work. This is not the first or second wave of infection; it's a natural virus carrier, the antidote is useless," Su Man said indifferently, like someone born and raised on poison, becoming a poison person, for whom the antidote is useless.  Bai Ye was startled.  "Don't you have a solution?" Bai Ye raised an eyebrow and asked, touching his chin and smiling somewhat wildly, "Who was it that said I was all talk and no action? You're not much better. There are specialties in every field, and this is not my forte."  Su Mei Ren's gaze flashed sharply but did not directly answer, "I got it, we'll talk tomorrow."  He stood straight in the moonlight, his whole being blending into the layer of cold moonlight, appearing extremely chilling, his brows filled with a cold indifference that clearly showed he was seeing off the guest.  Bai Ye remained standing, watching Su Man, his face smiling, his handsome face calm as the surface of a lake in March, as if he hadn't heard his words.  Su Man sneered, his brows frosty, "Anything else?"  "Why are you still angry? As a grown man, you shouldn't be so petty, right?" Bai Ye said lightly, "I didn't do it on purpose, and you've hit me already. You should have let off your anger."  His tone was light but carried a hint of an awe-inspiring pressure, not inferior to Su Man's.  He knew why Su Mei Ren was being so unkind.  Bai Ye was very restrained by nature; he hardly ever lost his temper, either indifferent or smiling, gentlemanly like jade, elegant and free-spirited. That was the impression he gave to others. But by nature, he was extremely domineering and arrogant, just integrated into his indifference, giving people the wrong impression of a gentleman.  And Su Man, he was too lazy to pretend. He was noble and arrogant, also a restrained character, but not the kind integrated into a smile like Bai Ye. His restraint was covered with a layer of frost.  Cold and intimidating.  "Enough with the nonsense, please leave," Su Man said coldly, extremely unkind.  Bai Ye smiled, his robe flowing like jade, his demeanor even more tranquil. His brows teasingly raised, "Could it be, you really care that much?"  Su Man's cold eyes swept over sharply, the pitch-black pupils carrying a sharp danger. Bai Ye met this with a light smile. The icy atmosphere seemed to encounter a warm breeze, Su Man's expression growing even colder, while Bai Ye remained silent and smiling.  The two unconsciously recalled the accident in the lab today.  For nearly 8 days, they had been alone together, working in unison to research the antidote for the virus. With Bai Ye's assistance, Su Man had saved a lot of effort. His detoxification ability was indeed good, but in some areas, he truly wasn't as good as Bai Ye. After all, there are specializations in every field, and the two of them had different research directions, so they complemented each other.  Su Man initially looked down on Bai Ye because he felt that Bai Ye was trying to compete with him. He thought it was beyond Bai Ye's capabilities, after all, Su Man had the arrogance to be conceited, looking down on Bai Ye's title of 'genius doctor.'  But gradually, over a few days, he also knew that Bai Ye was not unworthy of his reputation. Bai Ye was indeed talented in medicine, and their cooperation was very tacit, gradually warming their relationship.  Heroes tend to cherish each other, especially those who have always been unsurpassed in their own fields like them.  Once people become familiar, there are no taboos in speaking. That day, when they suddenly brought up the topic of homosexuality, two grown men, one of whom is homosexual, bringing up this topic was extremely awkward.  Su Man obviously didn't want to say too much, and Bai Ye was tactful, so he didn't ask further.  Who knew, Su Man accidentally broke a vial of reagent, and as Bai Ye was cleaning up, he slipped...  There is always such a scene in TV dramas where the male lead, due to some accident, suddenly falls, topples the female lead, and very accurately kisses the female lead's lips. As a result, a secret affair begins.  This is a cliched shot used in TV and movies until it's worn out, and the audience is almost numb to it, while the actors are still enjoying their performance. This is a classic love scene. But applied to Su Man and Bai Ye, it's completely inappropriate. Why? Even if the ground was covered in oil, Bai Ye could walk on it as if nothing happened, not to mention falling down. Even if he did fall, he could stand up before hitting the ground,  However, Bai Ye was somewhat stunned when he realized he was falling on Su Man, and that moment of distraction was the cause of the trouble. Su Man was caught off guard and really was toppled by him.  Actually, being toppled was no big deal, it was an accident, and Su Man wouldn't be angry about it. The most important part of this classic scene was missing, which was the kiss. Without the kiss, it wouldn't be a classic scene at all. This was not an accident; Bai Ye had deliberately kissed him.  And from falling to kissing, there wasn't even a pause, realistically making it seem like it was an accident, but Su Man was not someone to be fooled. He was very clear about how much Bai Ye weighed. He was shocked for four seconds, then raised his hand and slapped Bai Ye.  That moment, Su Man was so angry. He clearly felt Bai Ye's gaze change midway, and he knew it was not good, but he wanted to push him away, and it was too late.  For the first time in his life, he was taken advantage of like this.  This was different from Ye Wei's seduction; at least Wei Wei had never kissed his lips.  A kiss in exchange for a slap from Su Mei Ren, the deal wasn't actually that bad. Su Mei Ren's first kiss was taken, that was his first kiss, and Bai Ye was slapped for the first time. Both were firsts, so it was even. Who knew that Su Mei Ren would turn his face and not recognize anyone in anger, treating him as someone to be shunned again.  "You, are you seeking death?" Su Man narrowed his eyes dangerously, his aura intimidating, remembering the incident and thinking of the amazement and pause in Bai Ye's eyes. He felt deeply insulted.  If he was seeking death, he wouldn't mind obliging him.  They had just discussed homosexuality, and Bai Ye had joked that homosexual lovers almost never last long, everyone just seeking novelty. This view had already displeased Su Man.  But it cannot be denied that what Bai Ye said was the truth.  He also knew that Bai Ye was different from him; he liked women and was a true straight man.  So what was it that he kissed him? Seeking novelty, coveting beauty?  Su Man was a dignified man and was not ashamed of being homosexual, but being treated as a woman by another man, one can imagine how furious the always proud and haughty Su Man was.  For the first time in his life, he was so unsettled.  Bai Ye raised his eyebrows and smiled, "No, I want to live a long and prosperous life."  Su Man coldly humphed, the flames of anger leaping in his cold eyes, "Get out, or don't blame me for being ruthless."  With that, he left, leaving Bai Ye with a cold and indifferent silhouette.  Bai Ye stood with his hands behind his back, handsome and upright, modest as jade, the smile on his lips growing more intense. He, a genius with both talent and looks, why would he be disliked?  Bai Ye was quite perplexed.  Today, why he kissed him, Bai Ye himself was not clear, it seemed like an uncontrollable impulse. The moment he fell, all he could smell was the familiar cold fragrance that he had become accustomed to these past few days.  It's a disgrace for a man to have a fragrance, but Su Man was always messing with flowers and plants, and the yard was filled with this cold scent. It had long blended with him, seemingly innate, particularly enchanting.  Being so close, maybe it was the fragrance that was too tempting, or maybe the lips were too captivating, he had been bewitched, thinking that the kiss would probably feel good. In the blink of an eye, before Bai Ye could even realize what he was doing, he already felt the warmth on his lips, and he had kissed him.  To say it was an accident was an understatement; he did it on purpose.  Bai Ye glanced once more at the splendid garden, a bit bewildered in his heart, unable to understand why he had acted that way. He left Su Man's courtyard thoughtfully, not noticing that Su Man's cold gaze had been following his departing figure.  Humph!  Su Man coldly humphed, daring to take advantage of him, then he would have to exchange something of equal value.  The lips of the noble and unparalleled beauty curved into a hint of a smile. It was as if he had already seen his prey walk into the trap. Chapter 383: The Poison is Cured  The next day, in the laboratory. Cheng Anya watched as Bai Ye injected the antidote into Ye Sanshao's body. The transparent liquid flowed like an icy spring, making her feel a bit cool-hearted, to the extent that her limbs felt a bit cold, and her palms were sweating profusely. She watched nervously for Ye Sanshao's reaction on the operating table.  This was not the first time Su Man and Bai Ye had developed an antidote. In the past few days, they had tested three different antidotes, all of which were first tested on lab rats. The first two times, the rats died, but the last time, there was no reaction in the rats.  This time, there was a reaction in the lab rats, and after Su Man's analysis, the toxins in the blood had all disappeared within an hour.  That is to say, this was an antidote, at least it was effective on the lab rats.  Because Cheng Anya was pregnant, they could not predict the reaction of the antidote on a human body, so they had to test it on Ye Sanshao first since his time left was very limited.  The antidote had to be injected.  Ye Wei, Eleven, and others were present, as well as the little bundle of joy. This was the most critical day. If the antidote failed, they would inevitably have to look for another way to save them, which would waste even more time.  Given Ye Sanshao's condition, he simply couldn't hold on for much longer.  The little bundle of joy and Cheng Anya both knew this was their last chance. Success or failure depended on today.  After the antidote was injected into Ye Sanshao, everyone quietly watched the diagrams on the screen. The supply of sedatives had been temporarily stopped, and at the moment, Ye Sanshao only had an oxygen mask on him.  The rest of the reagents had been withdrawn, and now it all depended on the reaction to the antidote this time.  Bai Ye took Ye Sanshao's pulse, his expression solemn. Judging from the pulse, it was very calm, because the sedative had just been withdrawn, and he had not shown signs of waking up, so the pulse appeared calm.  But after half an hour, there was no obvious reaction.  The screen showed that the virus had not been eliminated. Cheng Anya couldn't understand such diagrams; she only knew that the screen showed the virus devouring cellular bodies, which were internal views of Ye Sanshao's body.  Bai Ye had explained to them that the black areas indicated the regions invaded by the virus. From the diagrams, Ye Sanshao's liver, stomach, and spleen were all infected with the virus, and it was very serious.  The body was almost filled with terrifying viruses, all in a free and mutating state.  After the antidote was injected, red bubbles appeared on the screen, constantly striking against the black areas. Cheng Anya and others had just watched the demonstration on the lab rats. After about ten minutes, the black areas would slowly fade and gradually disappear.  This represented that the virus was being eliminated, disappearing.  But after half an hour, there was no change in Ye Sanshao's body, only the red bubbles continuously struck against the black areas, like a struggle between good and evil.  Good wanted to kill evil, but was powerless and helpless.  Bai Ye wrapped his arms around his chest and watched the screen, almost holding his breath. For the first time, he felt his heartbeat was so tense. Could it be that the antidote was wrong? He drew a cold breath in his heart. According to his precise calculations, there should have been a reaction after fifteen minutes. Why was there no reaction at all?  The lab rat had started to assimilate the virus after only ten minutes. Something was wrong.  A fine sweat appeared between Bai Ye's indifferent brows.  Su Man sat calmly in front of the computer, his eyes coldly staring at the screen. He seemed very calm, not showing a hint of panic, as if it was normal to have no reaction for half an hour.  But Su Man's palms were also sweating. He knew very well that if the antidote was ineffective this time, Ye Sanshao would surely die.  Even if he and Bai Ye raced against time to research the antidote, there would definitely be no results within three to five days.  Cheng Anya could wait, but he absolutely couldn't wait any longer.  The man's noble features were very solemn. He didn't need to turn his head to know the expressions of the people behind him.  Cheng Anya and others did not dare to disturb Su Man and Bai Ye, fearing to interrupt their train of thought. Ye Wei and Eleven pursed their lips, also nervously waiting. The little bundle of joy stayed with Cheng Anya, afraid that his mommy wouldn't be able to endure such torment.  The wait between life and death was the most exhausting. In such a situation, most thoughts turn to hopelessness.  The little bundle of joy looked at his daddy on the operating table not far away, his gaze showing pain. He had only recognized his daddy for less than half a year. He didn't want to lose him. Fortune-tellers on the streets always say when reading someone's palm that you will surely have lost a loved one before the age of ten.  Later investigations showed that most people had lost their beloved family members before the age of ten, whether it was a grandfather, a mother, a grandmother, etc.  He had already lost Nono.  So, he also counted as having lost a loved one.  So, daddy, you must live on.  If he died, his mommy would probably become a walking corpse, never happy for the rest of her life.  Daddy, you have to hold on.  He had always had confidence in Su Man and Bai Ye, but only at this critical moment did he realize how nervous he was.  Cheng Anya stood alone on the side, her hands supporting the edge of the table, her eyes like torches staring at the screen, fearing to miss any detail. She prayed desperately for the antidote to take effect quickly.  "Bai Ye, increase the dosage," Su Man said in a deep voice.  Bai Ye's brows furrowed heavily, and without asking further, he injected another dose of the antidote.  In fact, this antidote was also a poison. If there was no virus in Ye Sanshao's body, just the antidote alone would be enough to poison a person to death within a minute.  So increasing the dosage also carried a certain risk; a slight miscalculation could result in death by the antidote.  "Bai Ye, what's the situation? Why is there no reaction?" Ye Wei asked nervously, "Could it be ineffective?"  "Wait," Bai Ye uttered one word, firm and resolute.  Time passed slowly, and this kind of waiting was the hardest. He told you that he would wake up within an hour. If he didn't wake up, he would die.  But you have waited almost an hour, and he hasn't woken up yet.  It's like hope is slipping away through your fingers.  Suddenly, a clanging noise came from the operating table. Ye Sanshao's wrist moved; he seemed to want to break free from the handcuffs but was stuck.  He became anxious, pulling hard, his movements very large.  Everyone was startled, and suddenly, Su Man also rapidly analyzed his body's various functional indicators on the computer. Ye Sanshao first groaned as if in pain, his head shaking constantly, his body also struggling fiercely to break free of the restraints. Cheng Anya and Ye Wei wanted to go over but were stopped by Bai Ye.  Suddenly, Ye Sanshao let out an angry roar, "Ah..."  His eyes, which had been closed for nearly ten days, suddenly opened wide, his black pupils filled with blood, frighteningly red. His limbs began to struggle violently, continuously shouting and screaming, as if crazed.  Cheng Anya watched with her eyes about to split, "Ah Chen..."  She tightly covered her mouth, her heart twisted with pain, unable to bear to look, and lowered her eyes to the table. Yet, his crazed voice still echoed in her ears.  Ah Chen...  "Daddy..."  "Third brother... what's wrong with you?" Ye Wei also panicked, "Su Man, what's wrong with my brother?"  "The antidote is starting to react," Su Man said calmly. "He was bound to suffer unbearably once the sedative was withdrawn, and now with the antidote devouring the virus, the two reactions are clashing. It's a normal reaction."  "Moreover, we've increased the dosage, so he will suffer even more," Bai Ye added.  "Daddy won't have any problems, right?"  "As long as there is a reaction, he won't die," Su Man said, his hands busily testing all of Ye Sanshao's indicators, while commanding Bai Ye to inject him with several other reagents.  So ruthless, so resolute.  Upon hearing that death was not imminent, everyone's hearts eased a lot.  Cheng Anya and the others were laymen and didn't understand but could see that Ye Sanshao's suffering seemed to have lessened somewhat.  The kind of screaming that seemed to want to dig out his internal organs was a bit terrifying.  Ye Sanshao's appearance was indeed a bit frightening, his features distorted, his voice hoarse, his hands and feet were scraped by handcuffs and shackles until they were bloody, deep enough to see the bone, as if they were going to embed into his bones.  Cheng Anya's heart ached.  "Daddy, it will be okay, you hang in there," the little bundle of joy clenched his fist, cheering for Ye Sanshao.  "He can't hear you," Bai Ye said with a smile. In Ye Sanshao's current state, he temporarily couldn't feel anything except pain and the dizziness of being close to death. This situation lasted for nearly ten minutes.  The antidote then quickly began to merge with the black virus areas, slowly clearing the virus from Ye Sanshao's body. Ye Wei and Eleven, familiar with various modern technologies, had never seen such a vivid full process before.  They could clearly see the antidote sweeping through Ye Sanshao's body, the black virus gradually fading, then slowly disappearing.  At the same time, Ye Sanshao's body slowly broke out in a layer of sweat.  His roaring slowly softened, turning into uncomfortable groans.  In the end, Bai Ye injected him with serum, completing the final step of detoxification. Ye Sanshao, exhausted, fell into a deep sleep.  Cheng Anya was anxious and wanted to go over, but Bai Ye quickly stopped her.  "Anya, he's just been detoxified. Don't get poisoned again, next it's your turn."  Cheng Anya's footsteps faltered, "Detoxified, really? He's alright?"  "Yes, it was successful."  "That's great!" Ye Wei and Eleven high-fived, the laboratory erupted in cheers, even Su Man's lips curved into a slight smile.  After such a terrifying process of detoxification, the little bundle of joy was anxious, "Will my mommy also suffer as much as daddy did?"  "No," Bai Ye said with a smile. Chapter 384: Children Under the Virus  Cheng An Ya's process of detoxification was not painful at all, similar to a regular injection. After the antidote was administered, she felt somewhat drowsy and then lay on another operating table. From the internal view, it could be seen that the virus in Cheng An Ya's body was almost entirely concentrated towards the direction of the uterus.  Everything was as Bai Ye had expected. Ye Wei had mentioned before that Cheng An Ya's condition was very strange, not at all like someone who had been infected by a virus. He also asked her, when they were on the isolated island of Louis, it wasn't like this at all. She would have attacks, feeling weak and sore all over, with piercing pain in her internal organs. This situation started from when they were at Prince William's castle, which is to say, the child was slowly absorbing the virus, growing up soaked in the virus.  Su Man was right, he didn't even need to look at the internal view to know that the child must have been infected.  "Could it be that this child is treating the virus as nourishment to absorb?" Ye Wei looked at the internal view, extremely shocked, her eyes wide open with disbelief. Little Bun, however, was a bit worried. The image was a bit frightening.  "That should be correct." Bai Ye said, feeling a bit uneasy. The child was conceived during the time Cheng An Ya was infected with the virus, and now this child was naturally a carrier of the virus. Not to mention what impact the virus would have on him, if he were to be born, would everyone be unable to touch him?  Su Man's brows furrowed, a rare sight of the beautiful Su Man looking worried. Ye Wei, Eleven, and Little Bun all felt the situation was serious. Ye San Shao was quietly sleeping on the side, completely unaware. Cheng An Ya was also asleep, without any sensation. Their hearts, however, were thumping wildly with worry.  "Su Man, how is it?" Little Bun asked.  Su Man patted his hand and said indifferently, "For now, it's unknown. The infection is certain, but whether there are problems can only be known once the child grows a bit bigger. Your mommy will be fine."  The antidote was taking effect, slowly eliminating the virus in Cheng An Ya's body. She did not experience the intense pain that Ye San Shao did, just lying there quietly, as if asleep, her face still with a trace of tranquility.  "Bai Ye, I heard from the old witch that the Grey Wolf once experimented with poison people. Is it the same principle as with this child?" Ye Wei suddenly asked, recalling events from many years ago, her brows furrowed even tighter.  "Poison people?" Su Man raised an eyebrow.  Bai Ye nodded, indeed such a thing had happened, "The Grey Wolf once used infants as poison people for cultivation. From their birth, the food they consumed contained strong poisons. At that time, there were more than a dozen children; over ten died, and only three survived. Later, their food was all laced with extreme poison, and during their growth, two more died, leaving only one survivor. This child was different from normal children. He was a carrier of poison. Anyone who touched him would be poisoned; the severe cases would result in death, while the lighter cases required immediate injection of serum and several months to recuperate. Even the air he exhaled was poisonous."  "How cruel." Little Bun frowned. How could there be such cruel people? His Nono had been in the hands of the Grey Wolf since he was young, but thankfully, the Grey Wolf did not cultivate her as a poison person. Such pain was definitely not something ordinary people could endure.  "Indeed very cruel. Later, the old witch imprisoned the child, and because of this, she fell out with the Grey Wolf. It's been many years, Wei Wei wouldn't remember if she hadn't mentioned it. This kind of success rate is extremely low, many people died to cultivate one. Moreover, the food for the poison people must contain strong poison; eating normal food for a long time would lead to death due to lack of toxins," Bai Ye said gravely. They had only heard about these things, but in the special forces camp, they had to believe whatever they heard; it was definitely true.  "If that's the case, if the virus disappears, will the child die?" Eleven raised her own question. This matter was really too complicated; she felt it was very profound and difficult to understand.  "This is something I've heard about too, but it's different from the child's situation," Su Man said indifferently. "If the child can grow, then it means the virus has already fused with the child's cellular layer. Look at him, although he's not yet fully formed, he is indeed growing. Viruses and poisons are different; congenital carriers may also be able to control the virus. If he dies without the virus, then it means he is destined to have no fate with this world," Su Man spoke lightly. The virus in Cheng An Ya's body had almost completely disappeared, and it was being expelled through her sweat. Bai Ye also injected her with serum.  Except for Bai Ye, everyone else listened in a daze, but at least the virus was finally resolved, which was a good thing.  Ye Wei carried Cheng An Ya back to her room, Bai Ye carried Ye San Shao back, and they ordered the maids to help them clean up, especially Ye San Shao, who needed to apply medicine to his wrists and ankles, as he had struggled quite fiercely.  Su Man and Little Bun walked at the back, Little Bun smiling and saying, "Su Man, you really worked hard this time."  "It's just a small matter," Su Man said indifferently, his hand on his shoulder, "We're our own people, no need for formalities."  Little Bun grinned, Su Man pulled him to sit down on the long bench in the central courtyard. It was a cloudy day in Riyadh, and the temperature was a bit low. The open-air courtyard did not feel stuffy, and the presence of such a big fountain actually added a few touches of coolness.  Su Man asked, "When are you leaving?"  They certainly couldn't stay long. Dragon Gate, the first terrorist organization, and the Mafia were in the most chaotic and tense phase; no one knew who would have the last laugh. They must not stay too long. Some of them were core members of the terrorist organization, some were core members of Dragon Gate; they all had to find ways to deal with the crackdown by the Mafia and the joint government forces. The second half of the year was expected to be turbulent.  "I was just about to ask you this question. Will my mommy have any more problems? If the child carries the virus, could it be released to infect my mommy again?" Little Bun thoughtfully raised this question.  "No, they both have antibodies in their bodies now. The same virus no longer has an effect on them," Su Man said. "I've considered this issue a long time ago, rest assured. If anything happens, it's mostly likely to be the child that's affected; the adults won't have issues. The worst-case scenario is to terminate the pregnancy."  Little Bun nodded, feeling relieved.  "I'm just worried about my mommy. We must be fully prepared this time. I will not let Louis succeed again." Little Bun's face turned slightly somber as he mentioned Louis' hiding place, which he was close to discovering.  "In terms of strength and seniority, the first terrorist organization is the boss, the Mafia is the second, and Dragon Gate is the third. The second wants to take down the boss; alone, it's definitely not possible, so they must pull the third one in," Su Man said with a smile. He never left his house, yet he had a clear understanding of the world's situation; these things couldn't be hidden from him.  Little Bun also nodded in agreement, understanding this better than anyone, "He definitely can't win over Dragon Gate, so there's only one way: to merge with Dragon Gate, and level the entire North America. At one point, the Mafia had divided North America's forces, and even the terrorist organizations had to give them some respect. If it really turns into a two-tigers-on-one-mountain situation, it'll be too late to act. Of course, the premise is that he can swallow North America."  "Indeed," Su Man replied with a smile.  Little Bun was visiting for the first time, and he had been busy with the virus the entire time, not having much opportunity to chat. It was almost time to leave, and Su Man felt a little reluctant to part with him. But he was, after all, a carefree person; as for partings and reunions, it was all up to fate. Besides, they would surely have many intersections in the days to come.  "Riyadh really is calm, huh? Mo Yu has also been gone for so many days. Louis should know that my daddy and mommy are in Riyadh, yet he hasn't made a move, which is strange," Little Bun said with a smile. He had wanted to set a trap for Louis to walk into, to withdraw all the people from Dragon Gate and the first terrorist organization from Riyadh, leaving only Ye Wei and Eleven. Surprisingly, Louis did not act, which was unexpected to him.  "Having conquered the world, what's a beauty or two?" Su Man said indifferently.  Little Bun thought about it and agreed. Su Man suddenly asked, "That batch of firearms hasn't been forged yet, has it?"  "Are you talking about the high-speed magnetic wave gun? They've forged one," Little Bun said with pouted lips. "The thing you designed is too difficult to forge; many turned out to be failures, with only one successful piece. But it might be easier to forge more in the future."  "Not bad, I thought it would take another month or two to forge one. The reserve forces of your organization are really strong."  "Of course," Little Bun said proudly. "Speaking of which, Bai Ye was the first person to test the gun. The power is really fierce; it can blow up a fighter jet in high-speed flight. It's unbelievable."  "Almost approaching the speed of light," Su Man said with a smile. This was the result of three years of his hard work, creating his most proud work. If it were sold on the market, it would definitely be at a sky-high price. Yet, Little Bun tricked him and took it away. Bai Ye was actually the first person to test the gun—how cheap for him.  Little Bun covered his mouth and laughed, his dark eyes sly, revealing a bit of cunning, "Su Beauty, why do you have such a problem with Bai Ye? Our Bai Ye is considered the calmest, most handsome, and best-tempered person in the terrorist organization. 'Flowers bloom on the street, and the gentleman is like jade,' what a fitting and apt description."  "Are you promoting your family's unsellable goods?" Su Man turned his head, his noble face also revealing a smile. Because of the angle, he was already beautiful, and now he showed a breathtaking beauty. Little Bun couldn't help but exclaim, "Demon!" His hands couldn't resist reaching for Su Man's chest.  It was hard.  "You cheeky kid, you're quite daring," Su Man said with a smile, allowing him to touch, his face showing a slight indulgence. "You and Ye Wei are indeed from the same family; even the way you act is the same."  Ye Wei didn't know how many times she had touched his chest just to confirm whether he was male or female.  "Su Beauty, you really are too much of a femme fatale," Little Bun said with a giggly voice.  "What unsellable goods? Our Bai Ye is a hot-selling item," Little Bun blinked. "Product quality, appearance, practicality, are all beyond reproach, and it's a multifunctional product."  Su Man laughed loudly at this metaphor. Little Bun felt satisfied as he saw Su Man laugh out loud for the first time, revealing his teeth.  This scene, seen by Ye Wei and Bai Ye on the balcony of a distant villa, seemed like a scandalous affair. Su Man was laughing indulgently, and Little Bun was almost clinging to him. Ye Wei watched in great indignation, "Su Man is too immoral, to have such improper thoughts towards my Ning Ning. This is too much."  A lolicon, oh a lolicon.  "You're overthinking it. Are you sure it's not Ning Ning who's molesting him?" Bai Ye laughed, and went downstairs.  Ye Wei's eyebrows twitched, she quickly followed, her arm hooked around Bai Ye's shoulder and asked, "Bai Ye, do you have a thing for Su Beauty?"  "I like beautiful women."  Ye Wei, "......I should suggest Su Beauty change sex or something."  "Even if he changes sex, he's not a beautiful woman."  A beauty, this is different from a beautiful woman.  "Forget it, don't contradict yourself."  "Don't you want Su Beauty and switch to embrace Mo Yu's beauty?" Bai Ye raised an eyebrow and smiled, letting Ye Wei circle his neck. He wasn't unaware of the excessive intimacy; it's just that he, Chu Li, and others have never seen Ye Wei and Eleven as women.  Otherwise, with Ye Wei and Eleven being both talented and beautiful, after spending more than a decade with them, how could they possibly not be moved? When they were younger, Jason even liked Eleven, but later it just fizzled out. It was better to be family than lovers.  Because they met too early.  "Nonsense." Ye Wei snorted, "I still prefer Su Beauty a bit more."  She didn't mention Mo Yu. Bai Ye, however, reminded her, "When Ye San Shao and An Ya wake up, it's almost time to leave Riyadh. There will definitely be a tough battle, so you better be psychologically prepared. I know you won't let emotions get in the way, but it's still good to have a heads-up, so you don't end up in a hopeless situation."  Bai Ye was also concerned for her. Da Bai was fine, obedient. Mo Yu was too dangerous; he always felt something terrible would happen.  "Are you so distrustful of me?" Ye Wei pinched his arm, "Do I look like someone who would betray you?"  "Don't play dumb with me; I'm worried about you," Bai Ye said gently. "Mo Yu seems very dangerous; it feels like you're not his match."  "The hell, I'm not his match?"  "In terms of scheming, men are still a bit stronger than women," Bai Ye said with a smile. "Look at An Ya, she's so smart, but I think when it comes to big issues, Ye San Shao is more calculating."  "You're being sexist."  "I'm just despising you. Anyway, be careful."  "Got it, I won't let you down," Ye Wei said with a grin. As they happened to reach the central courtyard, Ye Wei leaned in, flirtatiously kissed Bai Ye's cheek, and whispered, "That's your reward."  Bai Ye was at a loss whether to laugh or cry, and when he looked up, he saw both Su Man and Little Bun watching them. Su Man's expression remained unchanged, his eyes stern, losing the gentle smile he had in front of Little Bun, and he just coldly snorted. Chapter 385: The So-called Caught in the Act  Cheng Anya woke up to find that it was deep into the night. The faint moonlight leapt in from the balcony, scattering silver light across the floor. Inside the room, a white jade lamp was lit, emitting a soft and white glow that wasn't harsh on the eyes. It was like a thin veil brushing past, filling the room with warmth and softness.  The poison had been neutralized, she understood in her heart. She had thought while Bai Ye was injecting the antidote that if she couldn't wake up and remained asleep, passing away unknowingly and painlessly, it would be akin to the so-called euthanasia that people often spoke of. She laughed at herself for having such fanciful thoughts at that time, but in that moment, she felt relaxed.  After all, she knew that Ye Sanshao would be safe and sound. Even if she were to die, the only regret would be the child.  One death, two lives was not a good thing.  She smiled, shifted her body, and saw that Ye Sanshao was sleeping beside her. The bed was warm and cozy, warming her to the bone.  The corners of her lips curved slightly, and only after a closer look did she realize that the room was still theirs, but the bedding had been changed. The silk comforter was warm in winter and cool in summer, and with the warmth of a human body, it felt very comfortable.  Perhaps it was a psychological effect, because after the poison was neutralized, she no longer needed to worry about infecting innocent people or causing the death of loved ones. In those few short days, although Cheng Anya appeared relaxed and talked with them as usual, her heart was extremely heavy. Since Zhang Bo's death, this heavy stone had been pressing on her heart, suffocating her in the middle of the night.  This was a kind of heart disease. She almost wanted to isolate herself from the crowd, fearing innocent deaths. Now that the heavy stone had been shattered, her heart felt much lighter, and only now did she realize that the feeling of lightness was truly comfortable, as if reborn.  Beside her was the shallow breathing of Ye Sanshao. During the detoxification, the image of his fierce and crazed face had already faded away. All she knew was that he was now peacefully asleep and safe.  Everything was worth it. Cheng Anya often heard people say that one who survives a great disaster is destined for good fortune later on.  They had endured several hardships this time: jumping out of an airplane in the desert, getting stranded for two days, nearly being killed in a castle, almost being blown to pieces at sea, hovering between life and death several times, and being plagued by a virus. Now that they were safe and sound, could they expect a smoother path ahead?  She hoped so.  Cheng Anya knew that Luis was not dead yet, the mafia's whereabouts were unknown, and there had been many changes at Dragon Gate recently. All of these were being manipulated by someone behind the scenes, attempting to stir up trouble once more. She didn't need to inquire further; just by listening to Xiao Naibao and Ye Wei's analysis and discussions, she understood a thing or two.  After this detoxification, an even bigger storm awaited them. She just hoped that Ye Sanshao, who had already experienced so much pain in the world, had endured all the hardships he would have to face in his life.  From now on, may everything be smooth.  With a sigh, she touched his eyebrows.  Ye Sanshao's eyebrows were thick and nicely shaped. His closed eyes and long eyelashes made for a beautiful side profile, slightly curled, casting a thin shadow under the eyelids. A tall nose and beautiful lips, his delicate features were like a masterpiece crafted by God. She had long known that Ye Sanshao was incomparably handsome. Although he wasn't as breathtaking as Su Man, Mo Jue, and others, his appearance was rare to find in this world.  Her slender fingers traced over his lips, which felt slightly dry. Remembering the heat of these lips, Cheng Anya was momentarily stunned, then withdrew her finger, thinking that if Ye Sanshao knew she had touched him like this while he was asleep, she wondered what the narcissistic man would think.  She rarely looked at his features so intently. Thinking of his domineering, angry, scheming, and pretended grievances... and many other expressions, Cheng Anya couldn't help but smile.  The laughter spilled from her lips.  "Do I look that funny?" The voice that had been absent for many days was hoarse and carried a hint of displeasure. Cheng Anya was taken aback, meeting a pair of pitch-black eyes. The previously closed eyes were now open and staring at her angrily.  Cheng Anya was delighted in her heart. He was awake? Everything was finally alright. She then secretly wondered when he had woken up. Recalling how her long fingers had brushed over his features, her fingertips felt warm, and her face flushed.  "Did you wake up earlier?"  "Tell me, what were you laughing at?" Ye Sanshao's eyes darkened as he suddenly grabbed her hand, pulling at the wound on his wrist. He let out a muffled groan, covering the wound while causing pain to the other side, furrowing his brows.  "Don't move." In a panic, Cheng Anya quickly helped him sit up. Fortunately, the pull wasn't deep, and the blood hadn't seeped through the gauze. Cheng Anya wanted to unwrap it and reapply the medicine, but Ye Sanshao stopped her.  "It's just a flesh wound," he said, looking at the wounds on his wrists and ankles. With bits and pieces of memories flashing through his mind, it wasn't hard to guess what had happened.  He vaguely remembered his own madness, the sound of metal clashing in his ears. At that time, the pain seemed trivial, and he didn't remember much.  "Flesh wounds also need medicine. Don't move around." Cheng Anya took the medicine, unwrapped the gauze, and reapplied it to him. Only then did Ye Sanshao realize how terrible the wounds on his wrists were.  He was shocked and quickly looked at Cheng Anya's wrists. Seeing she was unharmed, Ye Sanshao abruptly asked, "What about the poison on you? Is it resolved?"  Cheng Anya nodded and recounted the situation, omitting the matter of the child. She was still uncertain how to tell Ye Sanshao about it. After applying the medicine, she wrapped it up again.  "You haven't answered my question." Ye Sanshao nudged against the head that was close by.  Daring to laugh at him while he was asleep deserved a punishment.  Cheng Anya rolled her eyes at him. "Can't I be happy? The poison is resolved, and that's something to be happy about. Why can't I laugh?"  "Liar." Ye Sanshao hummed and leaned in to kiss Cheng Anya. "How many days have I been asleep?"  "Nine days," Cheng Anya replied.  She had been anxious for nine days. Especially today, when the antidote was administered, the feeling of desperation was deeply imprinted in her heart. She would never forget the agony of waiting, more unbearable than any other moment.  Ye Sanshao looked at her, his eyes deep, and suddenly said, "It's been so long. You should kiss me, like a prince kissing Sleeping Beauty."  After saying that, he pouted his lips and leaned in for a kiss.  Cheng Anya pushed him to the other side with a slap, laughing and scolding, "Where do you resemble a princess?"  A narcissist indeed.  Ye Sanshao also laughed, lightening the previously heavy atmosphere instantly, spreading joy all around.  Cheng Anya turned her head, seeing his shallow smile, and snuggled closer. Ye Sanshao turned his head, naturally kissing her lips. Cheng Anya extended her tongue, delicately tracing the shape of his lips.  Suddenly, he pressed her into his arms, taking control. He kissed her deeply, sweeping over every inch of her softness, twirling his tongue, sucking and nibbling, enjoying the joy of resurrection after death, the thrill of regaining what was lost.  Everyone prepares to never wake up again when they fall into a deep sleep, carrying complex emotions of parting from life. At this moment, being alive, who wouldn't be moved and joyous?  The treasure in his arms became even more precious.  Cheng Anya closed her eyes, enjoying his kiss. The familiar scent in her nostrils, the gentle breeze brushing past her brows, filled the room with tender affection.  It seemed like he could never get enough of kissing, Ye Sanshao was not satisfied. Just as he let her take a breath, he covered her lips again, kissing her dominantly. His lips were as domineering as his personality, strong and assertive.  The moonlight was soft and white, the beauty was like jade, embraced in his arms, and naturally, they both fell onto the bed.  Cheng Anya was kissed into a daze, feeling only the nibbling and teasing on her earlobes. The hot breath drilled into her ears, this heat seemed to penetrate through the ear canal into the central nervous system, then plunging down.  A slight agitation in her lower abdomen, embarrassingly hot.  This feeling was a bit unfamiliar, yet somewhat familiar. In the desert castle, that day and night, she had felt this way countless times, her fingertips becoming powerless in his arms, melting into a puddle of spring water. Her face was as tender as a rose, her eyes were enchanting like silk.  At his mercy.  "Anya..." His low and hoarse voice rose slowly, hot breaths spraying on Cheng Anya's delicate neck skin, her skin flushed pink. His wet kisses traveled down, opening her clothing, but when he touched the wound, Ye Sanshao briefly groaned in pain.  The entangled Cheng Anya instantly sobered up, her eyes clearing from confusion, stopping Ye Sanshao's head, "Ah Chen, stop it, your hands and feet are not convenient."  "It's nothing." Ye Sanshao dismissed it with a word, not minding his own wounds. Just as he was about to tear open Cheng Anya's clothes, she quickly got up but was pressed down by him, "Don't move."  "It's alright, we didn't die, and there's no rush in these one or two days." Cheng Anya looked down on him. Desire, once tasted by either man or woman, was irresistible, especially for someone like Ye Sanshao, a top-notch lecher.  But even a lecher should consider the situation.  "How about you come on top?" Ye Sanshao was unwilling to give up, blinking suggestively with eyes that carried a dark green glint of anticipation, seeming very eager for Miss Cheng to take the lead.  Cheng Anya's face flushed red, pushing his shoulder to signal him to get off, "I don't know how."  "I'll teach you."  "..."  Miss Cheng's cheeks reddened even more. Ye Sanshao leaned over and whispered in her ear, making Cheng Anya nearly kick him off the bed. Her face was flushed with embarrassment, "You sex fiend, don't even think about it."  Ye Sanshao suddenly leaned in and kissed her deeply. Cheng Anya struggled for a moment when suddenly there was a clattering of dishes. Both of them turned their heads, only to see two figures, one big and one small, trying to flee.  Ye Wei and Xiao Naibao slowly turned around. Ye Wei saw her sister-in-law's swollen lips and a face flushed with spring, her eyes enchanting, while her brother looked unsatisfied, his eyes fierce. She... for the first time felt that interrupting others felt so... exhilarating.  Xiao Naibao waved in a very ladylike manner. Ye Wei said, "Brother, sister-in-law, you two have good stamina, very good... Continue, continue, we'll come back later..."  "Mhm, continue, continue..." Xiao Naibao echoed.  The two figures, one big and one small, stood still without any intention to move. They held trays in their hands, watching the scene innocently.  If it weren't for Ye Sanshao's injury, Cheng Anya would have kicked him off the bed long ago. Oh my, how embarrassing...  Thunder, strike me now!  So this was what being caught in the act felt like, (⊙o⊙)...  "You two really have no sense of timing." Ye Sanshao snorted coldly before finally getting off Cheng Anya. Fortunately, he hadn't been too hasty to tear off her clothes, or there would have been an even more embarrassing scene.  Ye Wei thought to herself, how could she blame them? Who else would think of doing such a thing after lying down for so many days with such severe injuries? You were just too fierce, brother, don't blame us.  Originally, she and Ningning had timed their visit well. They hadn't eaten all day, and Ye Wei had asked someone to prepare some easily digestible food to bring over. She had intended it for her brother and sister-in-law's health, so they wouldn't have to ring the bell for service. Who would have expected to walk in on such a scene?  Even Xiao Naibao was surprised; although she deeply understood that her father had been hungry for a long time, she didn't expect him to be so fierce. Thinking that he wanted her mother to take the lead because his hands and feet were inconvenient was really... polluting the pure hearts of minors, Xiao Naibao also felt conflicted.  "Brother, come on, drink some iced milk, cool down, cool down." Ye Wei took out the drinks, porridge, and side dishes from the tray, smiling and beckoning her brother to come over and cool off.  Unsatisfied men can be very scary.  After the initial embarrassment, Cheng Anya didn't feel much. Living with the Ye family required a strong heart, and this little incident wasn't enough to make her panic. Fortunately, her clothes weren't disheveled, or it would have been more embarrassing.  "Mommy, I can finally hug my treasure." After putting down the tray, Ningning jumped into Cheng Anya's arms without caring about her father's jealous gaze, clinging to Cheng Anya and not letting go, "Mommy..."  "You're so good." Cheng Anya smiled, casually pinching Ningning's little face, giving him a big kiss on his cheek, making Ningning beam with joy.  "Mommy, you smell so good. No wonder daddy loves to nibble on you." Xiao Naibao turned his head around. Cheng Anya was mortified, slapping the back of his head, "Asking for a spanking, aren't you?"  "You're really violent." Xiao Naibao laughed, pulling Cheng Anya to the dining table, "Mommy, it's been a long time since you tasted my cooking, right? I prepared all of this."  Ye Sanshao had already devoured his food like a whirlwind.  He was extremely hungry, suffering from a double hunger. Chapter 386: Going Separate Ways  The virus is resolved, so it's time to discuss leaving Riyadh. Ye Wei Eleven and Bai Ye had discussed it; they need to return to Rome, step up their efforts, and quickly deal with the grievances between Prince William and Chu Li. The main task at hand is to deal with the mafia; Prince William is most likely being used by Louis to weaken the power of the first terrorist organization and to divert attention. They can't afford to be entangled with Prince William for too long, as it would be a loss.  Bai Ye had contacted Chu Li, and after he returns to Rome to take care of some things, he will start mobilizing the international forces of the first terrorist organization, using the international situation to force Prince William to capitulate. They have come this far; he doesn't believe William would rather go down with Chu Li than to give in, which is the quickest way to resolve the situation.  Eleven and Ye Wei naturally have their own matters to attend to; they need to find the whereabouts of the Mo brothers and Louis. Little Bun said, "Daddy, Mommy, this time I want to go with Bai Ye, may I?" This was the main reason he and Ye Wei went upstairs to find his parents. If it weren't for the recent changes, Little Bun would have already found a way to join the first terrorist organization. This opportunity was perfect for training, and he didn't want to miss it.  Being with them would allow him to learn more, and he was determined to follow this path to the end, learning all the skills necessary. He couldn't always stay by his parents' side, and most importantly, he wanted to avenge Nono. He didn't want to let go of either Louis or Cang Lang.  Ye San Shao had no objections. He tilted his head, indicating that the person his son needed to convince was his mother. "Mommy, what do you think?" Little Bun asked Cheng An Ya. "I know that you've just recovered, and it might not be appropriate to discuss this, but Mommy, please just indulge me this once, okay?"  Cheng An Ya leaned back and looked deeply at Little Bun, silent for a moment while Little Bun quietly looked back at her, very persistent. Cheng An Ya sighed in her heart. What use was there in stopping him now? She had already decided when she was fleeing that she would let go and let her son fly.  She indeed couldn't provide him with the skills he needed for growth; someone else would have to do that. "If you've decided, I have no objection," Cheng An Ya finally agreed.  Ye Wei felt relieved. If it had been before, it would have been difficult to convince Cheng An Ya, but after this incident, it was easy, and she wasn't sure whether she should thank Louis for giving Cheng An Ya such a shocking lesson.  "Mommy, you're the best," Little Bun hugged Cheng An Ya's neck tightly, "Thank you, Mommy."  Cheng An Ya kissed her precious son, "Do what you want to do, you've grown up, and Mommy trusts your judgment."  Through this incident, she had grown. Her son had also grown. It was time for her to let go.  Her son was a kite in the sky, and she was the string, forever tied to him, preventing him from flying beyond this patch of sky. Only by loosening the string could he possibly fly higher and farther. The more the string was loosened, the farther he could fly, and that was alright, as long as the son didn't fall. She could reel him in, and eventually, he would return.  Ye San Shao looked at the mother and son, smiling in comfort. The greatest fortune of his life was meeting Cheng An Ya, falling in love, and having such an excellent son. This was the blessing of several lifetimes that he had to cherish.  "Daddy, Mommy, what about you?" Little Bun asked, a bit worried, "Going back to A City?"  Ye San Shao nodded, "I need to go back. I've been away for a month. Lin Da and Tang Si are very worried. The three of us need to discuss how to combat the mafia. Louis's next move is to try to swallow up North America, and Longmen will bear the brunt."  Little Bun nodded, holding Cheng An Ya's hand tightly, and suddenly said, "Mommy, why don't you stay in Riyadh? This is Su Man's home, sacred ground. With Su Man here, no one can bother you. Wait until the situation stabilizes a bit more, then you can return to A City, okay?"  Cheng An Ya shook her head, "I won't. I'll go back with you. There's no room for discussion."  Little Bun understood his mommy's character. Since she said so, there was definitely no room for negotiation. He couldn't help but look towards Ye San Shao.  Ye Chen gave a faint smile, "This time I will be with her 24 hours a day. There won't be a repeat of the same situation."  Furthermore, Longmen's assassins would also protect them around the clock, and they wouldn't be as negligent and passive as last time. Louis would find it difficult to approach A City.  "This seems feasible. Staying with Third Brother is not much different from staying with Su Man. Currently, A City is a peaceful area, whereas Riyadh has become a bit unsafe. Although they fear Su Man, if Third Sister-in-law is alone, Louis might not care about mutual destruction," Ye Wei calmly analyzed. "We still have no news of Louis and Old Master Mo. Ning Ning, you're checking their whereabouts. Once there's a discovery in A City, notify us as soon as possible."  "Of course," Little Bun said firmly, holding Cheng An Ya's hand, "Mommy, your baby won't let you be frightened again."  Before Cheng An Ya could say how good he was, Ye San Shao sent a fierce punch his way, flattening Little Bun, who then covered his sore head, looking at Ye San Shao with big, aggrieved eyes.  "Daddy, are you trying to turn me into an idiot?"  "I was the one who said that. When did you start stealing my lines?" Ye San Shao narrowed his eyes and glared.  Little Bun sulkily curled his lips; he had always been saying that. Protecting Mommy and being her guardian angel was his natural duty, especially since Daddy had not been around for so many years. It was quite rude to suddenly cut in line.  He wisely chose not to say that.  Cheng An Ya rolled her eyes and imitated his earlier action by punching him, "Shut your mouth."  Ye Wei couldn't help but laugh out loud. "You're being rebellious."  Ye San Shao pretended to raise his hand to strike, but Cheng An Ya wasn't afraid at all, completely ignoring him and speaking to Ye Wei, "Wei Wei, I'm leaving Ning Ning in your care. Please look after him for me."  "Don't worry, Third Sister-in-law. He's so cunning and shrewd, he definitely won't have any problems," Ye Wei replied with a modest smile from Little Bun.  "Since it's decided, I'll arrange for a plane later," Ye Wei said. "Third Sister-in-law, if you feel unwell, notify Su Man immediately. He said there won't be any danger for the time being."  "Don't worry, I know."  "Hasn't An Ya been detoxified?" Ye San Shao's voice deepened, his heart skipped a beat, and he looked at Cheng An Ya with a burning gaze, a flicker of panic crossing his face.  "Didn't Third Sister-in-law tell you? She's been detoxified, but there's still no reaction from the one in her belly," Ye Wei blurted out, and Cheng An Ya couldn't stop her in time.  Ye San Shao was stunned. Chapter 387: Conversation Between Father and Son  Ye Shaoshao took a good ten minutes to digest the meaning in Ye Wei's words. By the time he came back to his senses, Ye Wei and Ningning had already left, leaving the space to them. When he snapped back to reality, Cheng Anya had already drunk two cups of hot tea.  Was he dumbfounded with happiness, or with anger? Cheng Anya was curiously pondering. The child's arrival was indeed sudden and not in their plans, but after all, had come, and she was extremely happy in her heart.  And him?  Seeing how much he adored Ningning, Cheng Anya guessed that he must also be extremely fond of children. But the reaction arc of this soon-to-be father was too long. She almost had to nudge him awake to get some other reaction out of him.  He had the same expression on his face for too long. It wasn't tiring for him, but she found it difficult to watch.  "Pregnant?"  "Um, that night in the desert."  Cheng Anya said indifferently. Suddenly, her wrist was gripped tightly, and she was pulled into his warm embrace. His large palm pressed against her spine and against his chest. Bending down, his kiss landed, capturing her lips.  He kissed her domineeringly, his tongue prying open her tightly closed teeth, delving deep into her mouth, almost reaching her throat, sweeping over every tender spot inside her lips, tasting and plundering without satisfaction.  It was a stormy kiss, and she had no resistance to him. Now that she was in his arms, she naturally responded.  Ye Shaoshao twisted her hand backward, manipulating it into an angle that was very accommodating to him, and kissed her hard and fiercely.  It wasn't the first time they kissed, and Ye Shaoshao was never gentle. However, this kind of roughness was a first, and she could even taste a hint of salty blood between her lips and teeth due to the excessive force.  She sighed, this man would never learn what's called gentleness.  Excitement was not supposed to be like this.  Her breath was nearly taken away by him, the kiss lasted too long. Cheng Anya slightly turned her head to dodge his scorching kiss, but he unsatisfactorily kissed her cheeks, her tender earlobes, his hot breath all over her neck, a warm current in her lower abdomen, restlessly stirring.  She was extremely embarrassed, her skin turning a light pink.  In a moment, Ye Shaoshao turned her face back towards him and covered her lips again, this time much gentler.  Cheng Anya's gaze swept by, the light was soft and white, the man's brows full of tender affection, and at this moment, she actually felt a sense of tranquility and distance.  As if eternal.  She was content. Although they expressed their joy differently, she admitted without pretense that she quite liked Ye Shaoshao's consistently action-oriented way of showing it, her heart filled with honey, sweet.  The child, he liked, no doubt.  If it could be kept, how good would that be. She couldn't help but think, if Ye Shaoshao had known she was pregnant with Ningning seven years ago, what would his reaction be? Most likely, he would have been cold-faced, brutally ordering to get rid of it, he didn't need it.  The difference between having feelings and being heartless was really huge.  "Anya, I'm very happy," Ye Shaoshao said after a long time, his chin resting on top of her head, speaking slowly.  Cheng Anya smiled, "I'm also very happy."  In Ningning's room.  In recent days, besides paying close attention to the situation with Ye Wei and the others during the day, exchanging messages with Chu Li, and studying strategies, the little bun spent the rest of the time delving into computer technology.  He had to admit that there was indeed some distance between him and the Mo brothers.  It's extremely difficult for a person's ability to ascend when facing a barrier.  Like having already scored 100 on a test, there's no room to rise any further, the only difference is the perfection of the test paper.  Sometimes more effort is required.  Ningning was luckier than others, being a genius, he was destined to move faster than others, able to overcome any challenge with half the effort, as with this time, although he still hadn't reached the level of the Mo brothers.  But at least, he could now know whether the information given by the Mo brothers was true or false. With a little more time, he was sure he could beat these two brothers. In this field, he would be the ultimate king.  When Ye Shaoshao came over, he was still busy.  "Daddy?" Ningning stopped his work, tilting his head to look at the clock, it was already past midnight, "Daddy, why haven't you gone to sleep?"  "What about you? Aren't you also not sleeping? What are you doing?"  Ye Shaoshao sat next to Ningning, and upon seeing the computer, he understood. He rubbed his son's head, "Don't push yourself too hard."  "It's okay." The little bun smiled brightly, "I'm contending with the Mo brothers, I'm not tired at all, on the contrary, I'm very passionate. Daddy, I'll be able to overtake them soon. Then, taking down Louis won't be difficult."  He had trouble falling asleep at night; once asleep, he would dream of Xu Nuo, in a red dress with a soft whip, like a fiery rose, with a cheerful demeanor, yet he couldn't touch her. Waking up to a sense of desolation and loneliness, he was extremely afraid of this feeling, hardly sleeping at night except with the help of medication.  Just as well, he had time to compete with the Mo brothers.  Ye Shaoshao smiled, "Daddy believes in you."  "Why aren't you with Mommy?"  "She's gone to sleep," Ye Shaoshao said, looking at his son. Ningning smiled knowingly, "Daddy, you have something to say to me?"  Otherwise, his daddy wouldn't have come to find him so late.  "This time away from us, be careful with everything, understand? With the Louis matter, I know you hate him, but don't focus on revenge, or you'll lose your way," Ye Shaoshao cautioned. He always had an uneasiness in his heart. Cheng Anya could feel that the son had changed, so how could he not feel it? Even if he was as adorable and clever as ever in front of them, his nature had changed.  He was always worried that the hatred in his heart was too heavy, and it would ultimately harm himself. The heavier his heart's desire to kill Louis was, the more satisfying it would be when he achieved his goal, and the deeper the confusion in his heart would be.  Being too obsessed with one thing always brings some negative effects. When he has completely accomplished it, what will support him to keep living?  Xu Nuo could not possibly be resurrected, and his heartache could not be healed. He feared that his son, in the path of revenge, would go too far and ultimately harm himself.  This was his heartfelt advice.  He had not spent a day out of the shadows for many years, not a day of happiness, until he had them, mother and child. He didn't want Ningning to walk the path he had taken, to be lonely for life.  "Daddy, what are you talking about? I don't understand," Ningning said with an elegant and light laugh, his slightly childish fingers tapping aimlessly on the keyboard, his gaze drifting out the window, not looking at Ye Shaoshao.  How could he not understand? But his heart knot, no one could understand.  Without having lost, one could never understand that kind of despair that gnaws at the heart. Occasionally, he would sit alone on the balcony and look at the sky of Liya, thinking that slaughtering the mafia might lessen the hatred in his heart.  His heart had become cruel.  "Really don't understand?" Ye Shaoshao asked sternly, his son was too smart and too mature. The way father and son got along had always been friendly and familial. He had never had such a serious conversation with Ningning nor had he ever been angry with him.  This son was too perfect.  He wouldn't make you angry, was obedient and filial, smart and lovable. He wouldn't have any flaws for you to catch and educate him on. His thoughts were meticulous, rigorous, and sensible.  Because he was too smart, it was even more worrying when he was stubborn.  Ningning remained silent, his youthful face had already lost its babyishness, and his profile was completely engulfed in the night. He lacked the warm, elegant smile of the daytime and the gentle and adorable softness he showed in front of Cheng Anya.  His demeanor was cold and intimidating, with thoughts swirling in his eyes.  It was very quiet in the room. The moon in Liya was rarely full, always missing a bit, and the moonlight seemed much colder. Such pouring down made one feel a chill.  "Ningning, you've grown up, and you don't listen to my words anymore?" Ye Shaoshao's voice contained a hint of anger.  Ningning's silence hit right at his guess.  "Daddy, I know my limits," Ningning said softly. Too much malice was not a good thing; he indeed had the intention of a massive killing spree. What did it matter if it was cruel? But...  "Ningning, if you punish yourself, then Xu Nuo's death will have no meaning," Ye Shaoshao said gravely, "If it were your mommy, she definitely would not want me to become a cruel person who only understands hate and not love."  Doesn't understand love? Maybe, it's said that one who hates for too long really doesn't know how to love anymore. Even if Louis died, it might not relieve the hatred in his heart, but afterward, who would he go on to hate?  For the first time, Ningning felt the image of Ye Chen in his heart become so grand. The hand resting on his shoulder also seemed so powerful.  "Daddy, I understand."  Ye Shaoshao patted Ningning's shoulder, speaking earnestly, "I hope you really understand and come out of the shadows soon."  After saying this, he stood up and left.  Ningning watched as Ye Shaoshao's figure disappeared at the doorway, remaining silent. Since Xu Nuo's death, it was the first time someone had talked to him like this. He didn't know what to feel.  A bit angry, but that person was his daddy; he couldn't be angry.  A bit shocked, it turned out daddy had always been silent, but he saw right through his heart knot.  Also a bit moved, because he felt that no matter how old a child is, how smart they are, in the eyes of their parents, there's nothing to hide, all emotions are exposed.  Before, he thought that not having a dad was no big deal, he could make Cheng Anya's life worry-free.  After knowing Ye Chen, he liked this daddy. He did everything to matchmake them, wanting a complete family. In fact, for him, having a daddy meant having one more person who loved him, and also one more person for him to love.  He wasn't sure what the warm feeling in his heart was at the moment. It wasn't until many years later, when he looked back, that he realized how important the role of a father is in a son's life.  Subconsciously, he took his words to heart, which is why he didn't go to extremes and take a deviant path.
