Prologue: The Legend Ends  Dark clouds shrouded the sky, and the ground was dim and lightless, surrounded by a mess. The spiraling staircase, bodies stained with blood, armor, weapons, everything was so chaotic, desolate, carrying the scent of death and danger.  Rhode took a breath, but he couldn't feel the coldness and the blood in the air—it was, after all, just a game.  Thinking of this, Rhode gave a wry smile and shook his head, then he turned around to look at his comrades who were sitting on the ground not far below him, quietly resting and recovering their strength while repairing their weapons.  It seemed no different from any other day, but Rhode knew very well that this battle was not as easy as the ones before.  "How many people are left?" he asked in a deep voice.  Hearing the question, the people exchanged glances, and then, a skinny mage stood up.  "Ninety-six, captain. The Void Dragon dungeon is more dangerous than we imagined. Many brothers fell in the previous traps. The only good news is that our job classes are still well-rounded."  "That's good." Rhode nodded in response, not saying anything more, and the others also fell silent.  If it were an ordinary team, they might have already lost their courage and become chaotic, because what they were about to face was the most powerful, most terrifying boss in the game, the one that had never been conquered by anyone—the Void Dragon. It is the final boss of the third chapter of the online game Dragon Soul Continent and, until now, the most terrifying existence.  Facing such a battle, a normal guild would have to organize at least ten teams to dare to come and try to challenge. And now, Rhode only had ninety-six people, not even enough to form a complete team. But even so, there was no trace of panic or confusion in their eyes, only calmness, confidence, and trust.  The man they trusted so much was standing on the stairs not far in front of them, looking up at the sky with a face as firm as a rock, and a cold scar running down from his brow, giving a deterring feeling.  His armor shone with the glow of magic, covering his majestic body like an unyielding wall.  Of course, it wasn't because of his serious appearance that they trusted him. No matter how tough the appearance, after all, it was just a character setting in the game, and the scar between the brows was just an accessory in the game's facial features.  What was truly intimidating was the countless halos and achievements behind this man.  The first player to reach the top level.  The first player to reach the pinnacle with the most difficult profession, the Summoning Swordsman.  Since the first chapter "Dark Descent" of Dragon Soul Continent, leading the guild with his own abilities, and the terrifying familiarity with all professions, he swept through three whole seasons of content, taking down all boss first-kills as the leader.  Each dungeon video would be reposted by countless players, revered as a holy scripture for teaching, the president of the first player guild in Dragon Soul Continent—Rhode.  He personally ended "Dark Descent," ushered in "Era of Turmoil," and once again conquered the "Era of Turmoil," reaching "Void Judgment."  And now, he will once again use his own hands to end this "Void Judgment," but the new era will no longer be started by him.  How many years has it been?  Rhode retracted his gaze from the distant sea of clouds flickering with Thunder Serpents and asked himself.  It had been seven years since his sister passed away and he entered the Dragon Soul Continent. In these seven years, to force himself to forget those painful memories, he set almost unattainable goals for himself time and time again, reaching them over and over. Only the immense excitement and glory brought by those moments could dilute the pain deep in his heart.  But it could only go this far.  A month ago, Rhode's parents were abroad on a business trip when a hurricane caused a plane crash, taking their lives. Rhode could no longer remember what he felt when he heard the news, but now he had made a decision.  To leave this game and return to real life, not just for his parents, but Rhode knew it was time for a change.  "Guild... Guild leader?"  A timid voice rang out, interrupting Rhode's reminiscence. He looked up, and saw a female mage in the crowd timidly raising her hand, her bright eyes fixed on him.  "Are... Are you really leaving?"  "Yes." Rhode nodded, then collected his complex emotions, shook his head, and looked back at his companions, his memories and friends gained during the seven years of struggle.  But now, he will leave them, and though in the game, he could guess their intentions with just a gesture, once he took off his gaming helmet and returned to the real world, he probably wouldn't recognize them anymore.  "I sent out my resume yesterday, hoping to find a company that will take me."  "If I received your resume, I would arrange for you to be a department manager directly, don't worry!" A knight waved his greatsword, and his words lightened the somewhat somber atmosphere, making everyone laugh.  "Thanks for your kindness, but unfortunately I didn't write those down in my resume. You know our guild has many enemies, and if someone from another guild received it, I would be in trouble."  Rhode also smiled and answered, then coughed and became serious.  "I think everyone knows how we got here over the years."  Hearing this, everyone who was laughing just now closed their mouths and quietly began to listen to him.  "We also know that on the forums, on the internet, many people criticize us. They say we've disrupted the balance of the game, monopolized all the boss first-kills, making competition meaningless... Frankly, I think they're right, but..."  At this point, Rhode clenched his fist and swung it hard.  "But, what does that have to do with us! We are the strongest guild, we are the strongest team! We have the power! So we have to do it, to grab it! Other guilds are not strong enough and lose, that's their own problem. If they were strong enough, they could break our monopoly. Our monopoly on boss first-kills is not based on rules, not on status, not on flattering the game company, but on our own strength! We never give up, we never admit defeat, we never slack off, so we have this achievement and everything, we deserve it, it's that simple."  Rhode paused, then continued.  "I love this guild, and I also cherish the seven years we've spent together, but all good things must come to an end, and I should also find my own life. But I will never forget everyone, nor will I forget the guild. It bears my most painful memories, and my happiest ones, I will keep remembering it here."  Saying this, Rhode pointed to his head.  "Many people say the guild can't play without me. I guess many guilds know this news now, and they must be planning to wait for me to leave and then rush to take the guild down and break our record, but that's underestimating us. Dragon Soul is not a game with only one person, I alone can't build the guild, I alone can't organize a team, and it's not possible to kill the boss and get first kill alone. So I hope after I leave, you can show those who have bad intentions why this guild is so strong, why Starlight has the true strength to occupy the first place in the Dragon Soul Continent guild rankings!"  "Yes!"  "No problem, guild leader!"  "Leave it to us, by that time we'll give those idiots a perfect answer!"  "Good." Hearing everyone's answer, Rhode nodded, then turned to the right side of the crowd.  "Old Liu."  Hearing Rhode's call, the tall and thin mage walked out of the crowd and came to his side. Rhode looked at the mage in front of him, silent for a moment, then took off the badge on his chest and placed it in his hand.  "The next era is yours."  Rhode let go, his voice very calm, without any change.  "So, I leave this battle to you to command."  "Okay, no problem, Rhode." The mage nodded, but soon he spoke again.  "So, as the guild president, as the team leader, I order you to lead the team."  "Old Liu?" Rhode frowned in surprise.  At that moment, the tall and thin mage smiled quietly, then patted Rhode's shoulder.  "You started this era, so end it well, Rhode, that's the way of a man."  Hearing these words, Rhode fell silent. He looked up at his companions who were ready in front of him, waiting for his command as always.  Rhode clenched his sword, then turned to face the high platform not far in front. There, thunder raged and flashed with bright light.  Then, Rhode raised his long sword and pointed forward. He had started out as the most ordinary, so let it end as the most ordinary.  "Pull aggro!!"  The Void Dragon was indeed extremely powerful.  Rhode had clashed with almost all the significant bosses in Dragon Soul Continent, including other Dragon Soul existences in the setting, but none were more troublesome than the Void Dragon before him.  Its attack patterns were more complex, almost without pattern, its damage several times higher than ordinary bosses, not to mention speed, response, and even defense—all at top-notch standards.  It was indeed a difficult opponent to conquer.  Rhode held his long sword, gritted his teeth and focused on the huge beast before him. The fight had reached the final moment, and he was the only survivor, but even so, Rhode's health was almost depleted, the glaring red warning that his life force had reached its limit.  And wasn't the Void Dragon in the same state?  Looking into the blood-red, angry dragon eyes, Rhode suddenly had a strange feeling. He seemed to understand the Void Dragon's mood—as the strongest boss in the game that had never been conquered, it was now facing such a fall, it must be feeling terrible.  So, let me accompany you to the end.  With that thought, Rhode raised his left hand.  Accompanied by a loud cry, Rhode's sword suddenly burst into flames, spiraling into a flying firebird, soaring towards the Void Dragon. Faced with this attack, the Void Dragon also roared and raised its front claws, crashing down.  Rhode felt his body shake violently, a powerful force rushing towards him. The firebird screamed before dissipating, but before it vanished, the intense explosion forced the Void Dragon's claw away, leaving an opening.  Rhode bit down hard, the red in front of him becoming more and more dazzling, indicating the damage he had suffered was at a critical point. But now, this was no longer within his consideration—it was the final chance, succeed or wipe.  He raised his long sword and thrust it forward, but the Void Dragon had also recovered its strength. It roared, and once again swung its claw down, while at the same time, Rhode threw his long sword.  Thunder Strike, activate.  The long sword turned into a dazzling light, shooting straight at the dragon's chest. Rhode focused on it, watching the lightning-mixed light penetrate the gaps in the Void Dragon's claws, then effortlessly tearing through the dragon's scales.  A deafening dragon roar erupted from the ground, and then, the massive dragon's claw hit Rhode hard.  The world turned almost completely red before Rhode's eyes, blinding him to the scene before him. But from the corner of his eye, the system prompt was still clear as ever.  It was finally over.  Staring at this line of system prompt, Rhode showed a trace of relief.  And at that moment, a bright column of light suddenly descended from the sky, enveloping the high platform.  The pure white light instantly lit up the originally dark sky, dispelling the lingering clouds.  At this time, the others who were reviving from the graveyard and heading towards the high platform suddenly stopped, and the world channel, which was buzzing with the news of Starlight Guild's latest first kill record, also suddenly fell silent.  For a moment, only one message remained there—a system announcement.  A legend that had dominated three gaming eras, thus concluded. Chapter 1: A New Journey  A fierce wind swept through the canyon, causing waves of ripples across the grassland. The bison grazing on tender blades of grass lifted their heads to look at the sky. There, a wooden merchant ship, dozens of meters long, was suspended in the air, with its sails billowing in the wind, moving forward slowly.  "No matter when you look at it, this wind tide is always so spectacular," said a middle-aged man in leather armor, standing by the deck and looking down at the endless grassland and beautiful scenery.  "For us merchants, this is also a rare business opportunity," said a somewhat portly merchant standing next to the middle-aged man. He had a head of peculiar curly hair, was dressed in a merchant's robe, and his small eyes were slightly squinted as if calculating something as he watched the scenery before him. It looked as if he was even thinking about selling the beautiful scene in front of him.  "If it weren't for it, I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to transport the goods to the central region so quickly."  "To be honest, when I first planned to expand this market, there were objections, but now it seems that my choice was indeed correct."  "But, forgive me for speaking frankly, you didn't choose the major shipping routes, but took this way instead. Although it saves time, the danger is also increased."  "I've heard that it's not peaceful on the other side lately. And, I think you've also been warned by the captain that there have been wind snakes spotted nearby recently. If by any chance..."  The man's expression became a bit solemn as he turned his head towards the nearby mountain range. The towering peaks blocked his view, and he couldn't see what was behind them. However, he could vaguely see that the sky in the distance was not pure azure but tinged with a somber darkness. That was not a world they should enter.  "Don't worry, there are not so many 'what ifs.' Fortune favors the bold; that's why I paid so much to hire you all!"  "Just a few snakes, right?"  The merchant extended his hand and patted the man's shoulder.  "By the way, how is the young man we rescued doing now?"  "He's not dead yet."  "Rijie has bandaged his wounds. He is currently unconscious but should not be in any danger to his life."  "That's good."  Hearing the man's response, the merchant nodded in satisfaction. Then his brows furrowed.  "But what exactly is the injury that the young man has suffered? Judging from the wound, it looks like it was caused by a large lizard—but are there such strange creatures in the northern part of Pafield?"  "I'm not sure, sir, but it must be a very ferocious beast. Let's hope we don't encounter it."  As he spoke, the man subconsciously glanced at the entrance to the cabin, then turned his head back to look forward.  Rhode opened his eyes.  What happened?  He stared blankly at the ceiling, his mind foggy.  He remembered that he had been leading his team on the ruins platform, fighting against the Void Dragon, the most powerful boss in the Dragon Soul Continent, and had successfully achieved the first kill. He was sure that he had received the achievement and system prompt, and then, the Void Dragon's final blow also took his life.  Originally, according to the plan, Rhode should have resurrected in the graveyard and then logged out. However, at the moment he was killed by the Void Dragon, the whole world immediately turned pitch black as if it had been forcibly isolated. Then, Rhode lost consciousness.  How could this be?  Was there a problem with the game?  Rhode struggled to turn his head and could see the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. Where was he? What was this place? What had happened? Was he still dreaming? Or was he still in the game?  At least Rhode was certain that this place was definitely not his cramped rental apartment.  With this thought, confusion immediately surged in Rhode's mind. He frowned and then tried to sit up.  "Ouch!!!"  At that moment, a sharp pain suddenly came from Rhode's chest, making him grit his teeth and stop moving.  Only then did Rhode realize that his left shoulder and chest were completely wrapped in bandages. Although he didn't know what had happened, the bloodstains seeping through them indicated that he was seriously injured.  This was definitely not a game!  Rhode could be sure of that; he knew that although technology had advanced considerably, and Dragon Soul Continent, the world's first virtual reality MMORPG, used a lot of high-tech, players were not supposed to feel pain according to the rules. This was designed to distinguish reality from the game and also to lower the threshold for players.  When players were injured, instead of pain, the game would use a decrease in the player's movement speed, a red screen representing danger, and other methods to disrupt normal gameplay to warn and remind players, rather than truly simulating pain.  There had been considerable debate about this practice when holographic simulation technology first emerged, and the operating company of Dragon Soul Continent would certainly be aware of this.  Rhode lowered his head to look at his right hand, which was not the muscular and wild body he had crafted in the game. Instead, the arm before him was slender and weak, and the skin was sickly pale due to the lack of sunlight. This was his real body, and he was very clear about that.  But how did he get injured? And this place did not look like a hospital, did it?  Rhode looked up; the room seemed to be a cabin with no lights, no telephone, and no call bell. A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed to the wall were all the furnishings there.  For some reason, Rhode felt as if he had seen this scene somewhere.   As Rhode carefully observed the room, the door suddenly opened. A blonde girl in a white robe walked into the room. She looked at Rhode, who was half-sitting up, with surprise in her eyes.  "You're awake? That's great!"  The girl didn't speak Chinese or English, but Rhode understood her perfectly. This surprised him; he knew this language. It was Nim, one of the official languages of Dragon Soul Continent!  "How do you feel? Are you okay?"  But the girl didn't pay attention to Rhode's expression; she quickly came to his side and carefully examined his left shoulder and chest.  "Your injury is really serious. To be honest, I was a bit worried about whether you could survive..."  "This is..."  Rhode frowned, not knowing what to say. He turned his head to look at the mirror on the wall, which clearly reflected his own face. That was indeed his face, but it shouldn't be here.  "Did you forget?" The blonde girl blinked her eyes, puzzled, and her ponytails swayed slightly with her movements. Her blue eyes were clear and lively.  "Two days ago, you were found in the Pafield Plateau with severe injuries."  "If it wasn't for the 'Silver Libra' merchant ship passing by, it would have been really bad."  "I don't know what you were fighting with, but your left side was severely injured. It was really dangerous at that time."  Wait, the left shoulder?  Rhode paused for a moment, then immediately remembered that he had been hit on the left side in his last battle with the Void Dragon.  But that was his character in the game that was injured; it shouldn't have anything to do with the player himself. However, now he was injured in reality?  Although the situation was chaotic, Rhode quickly calmed down. This was his psychological quality as a top player and the leader of the world's most powerful online gaming guild.  From his conversation with the blonde girl, Rhode also learned about his current situation. He was severely injured and found on the Pafield Plateau, and the Silver Libra merchant ship happened to pass by and rescued him.  According to the blonde girl, Rhode's initial condition was not optimistic, but his recovery ability was quite good.  "My name is Lijie Noelle. I'm a member of the Star Moon Mercenary Group, a spiritist. You can call me Lijie."  The girl introduced herself to Rhode straightforwardly.  "My name is Rhode Alander."  Although Rhode was still unable to make sense of the current situation, he hesitated for a moment before giving his identity and ID from the game.  "I come from the Eastern Plateau, an adventurer."  "An adventurer, I see. So that's why you were alone in those remote mountains."  Hearing Rhode's response, Lijie was not surprised. In this continent, many adventurers liked to explore alone, so there were no issues with the identity Rhode gave.  "But what exactly were you fighting?"  "Why were you so severely injured?"  "I remember that there shouldn't be any particularly frightening monsters in this plateau region."  Hearing the girl's question, Rhode smiled awkwardly. What could he say? Could he tell Lijie that he was injured while fighting the Void Dragon, one of the five dragons of creation?  "Because I was attacked at night, I didn't see clearly what it was. They were numerous, and they were fast. I think, maybe it's something from 'over there.'"  "I understand."  Although Rhode did not explain in detail, Lijie seemed to understand, nodding her head slightly. After she carefully examined Rhode's wounds, she stood up.  "You haven't eaten for two days. I think you must be very hungry. Please wait, I'll go get some food for you right now."  "Ah, right, I also need to report this to the leader. I think he will come to see you soon."  After saying this, the girl politely nodded to Rhode and then left the room. Chapter 2: The Holy Sword Deck  "Phew..." It was only at this moment that Rhode finally let out a sigh of relief and lay back down.  After the chat with the young girl, Rhode could confirm that this was indeed the world of Dragon Soul Continent. Moreover, this was not the era he had experienced before, but a more distant past—the Twilight Years, which, converted to game time, was when the Dragon Soul Continent game had just begun its open beta.  How did he come to be here?  Rhode sighed, shook his head, and stopped thinking about these strange and mysterious things. No matter what, he was already here, and that was a fact.  So what should he do next?  First of all, Rhode decided to try what he could currently do. With just a thought, a clear and familiar system prompt appeared before his eyes, displaying his current status and attributes:  Rhode Level 1 Race: Mixed Blood (??) Talent: Unsealed Race Reward: Unsealed Race Trait: Unsealed++ Occupation: Summoning Swordsman (Heroic Occupation) Occupational Skills: Spirit Summoning Art (Proficiency E) Owned Swordsmanship: Moon Shadow Swordsmanship (Proficiency E) (Usable Skill—Shattered Blade) Part-Time Job: Alchemist (Arcane Creation Specialty) Owned Skills: Concentrated Shaping (Proficiency E)  This was a very normal yet abnormal attribute list, especially the first item almost made Rhode cry out.  Mixed blood? How could it be mixed blood? On the Dragon Soul Continent, so-called mixed blood didn't refer to racial intermarriage like on Earth. Instead, most who had the attribute of mixed blood were produced from marriage between humans and non-human races.  But Rhode knew very well that he was human, and even as a player character in the game, he had not chosen any other race. But why now did his attribute list have an added mixed blood? And the question marks in brackets indicated that his bloodline had not fully awakened, so the race rewards and race traits were sealed.  This meant that Rhode had to understand what kind of blood he had and awaken the dormant power within his bloodline before he could receive them. This was a hassle for Rhode because normally, race rewards were provided after character creation.  For example, the human race reward was reduced time for learning skills, and depending on the specific human race, there were different bonuses such as poison resistance and increased reputation.  But now, Rhode was cut off from these rewards and traits.  However, there were also surprises. In the swordsmanship and alchemy section, Rhode discovered that, in addition to the necessary skills at level one, the dozen or so swordsmanship and alchemy skills he had learned as a player were not forgotten but quietly listed below. However, they were all in a dark color.  This indicated that with Rhode's current abilities and level, he was not yet able to learn and use them. But Rhode was not worried about this because as long as his strength improved and he met the conditions, he would be able to regain the right to use these swordsmanship and skills.  Of course, the only downside was that the proficiency of these swordsmanship and skills had been reset to the lowest E rank instead of SS rank. But Rhode did not dwell on these minor issues because he valued the skills not for their proficiency, but for their origins. Many swordsmanship techniques were quite difficult to learn. Not only did they require level advancement or attributes, but many times a series of quests had to be completed, or one's reputation had to be raised, or it was just a coincidence that hidden items were found.  All of these required a lot of money, time, and even luck. In the game, it wasn't until Rhode's last year on the Dragon Soul Continent that he finally fully crafted his character, which gave him the confidence to challenge the Void Dragon.  Unfortunately, there were joys and sorrows. The issue with swordsmanship was resolved, but Rhode soon discovered that not only were his experience, level, and proficiency reset to zero, but also the existence most crucial to a summoning swordsman—the summoning spirit.  In the game of Dragon Soul Continent, the summoning swordsman was a controversial occupation. Initially, it was introduced as an exclusive occupation for players and drew much attention. However, after actually trying it out, summoning swordsmen were criticized for their mediocre attributes due to their dual focus on magic and combat, the complexity of needing to summon spirits to assist in attacks, and the consumption of experience points during leveling, which made players call it one of the most troublesome occupations.  At first glance, there seems to be no difference between the summoning art of summoning swordsmen and that of mages. However, the two are completely different in reality. Mages summon creatures from sub-dimensions by using their power to tear through space and use the force of magic to forcibly constrain them to serve. Summoning swordsmen, on the other hand, lack the ability to tear through spatial dimensions, and all their summons come from the present world.  One of their abilities is to reawaken the souls of ancient and mysterious items filled with soul power through the unique "Spirit Summoning Art" of summoning swordsmen and reseal them for use through contracts.  Although it sounds powerful, there are many troubles. In fact, many players were initially confused by this skill and chose the summoning swordsman. They thought that by buying some broken ancient artifacts at a low price from relics or guilds and using the Spirit Summoning Art to call out the souls of those weapons for sealing, they would easily obtain a divine weapon without any effort.  Sadly, dreams are wonderful, but reality is cruel. Not to mention that only high-level Spirit Summoning Art can activate the sleeping souls of ancient-level weapon remnants, and because they lose their material form as soul entities, their strength is much weaker than before.  Take "Dragon King's Fury," a quasi-divine weapon Rhode once used in the game. He only extracted the soul from a weapon remnant after reaching max level, but the weapon's power was not even as strong as that of a weapon forged by a master blacksmith. Rhode then spent two years traveling around the Dragon Soul Continent, going through heaven and earth to reactivate the souls of all the weapon fragments and restore them to their original state. Not to mention the time, the dangers along the way were enough to deter many people.  Moreover, spirit weapons require the consumption of soul power during use, and the summoned spirits also consume soul power. However, the amount of spiritual power stored by summoning swordsmen is far less than that of mages, so many summoning swordsmen would rather choose ordinary weapons than use these "seemingly beautiful" spirit weapons that are not very helpful in reality.  There are three other sources for summoning swordsmen's spirits: one is to awaken the soul core condensed after the death of a magical creature and make it a summoning spirit; the second is to defeat non-human creatures and, under certain conditions, sign a contract with them for use as summoning spirits; the third is to awaken attribute adjustment talents after level ten, merging several summoning spirits to produce higher-level spirits. This method controls the uncertainty of summoning spirits to a certain extent. As long as one is familiar with the characteristics, races, and attributes of summoning spirits, one can generally predict what the merged summoning spirit will look like. However, the disadvantage of this method is that the level of the newly created summoning spirit is uncertain; it may result in a level one spirit after merging two high-level ones, or a spirit too high-level to use. If it is the latter, it is fine; just work hard to level up. If it is the former, then one might as well delete their account...  The experience of a summoning spirit is deducted from the owner, which is why summoning swordsmen level up slower than other occupations. The same amount of experience that other occupations only need to care for themselves, summoning swordsmen must share with their summoning spirits for leveling up, and it's difficult to balance this allocation. Distributing experience to one's summoning spirits can ensure their level increases and evolve after a certain point, but as mentioned, the evolving spirit is influenced by the environment, the holder's will, and external factors, so sometimes the evolved summoning spirit may not be what the holder wants.  Because of these "troublesome" characteristics of summoning swordsmen, they were voted the "number one most troublesome occupation" on the official forum of Dragon Soul Continent. Some people vividly described summoning swordsmen as either newbies who had never played the game and were tricked by introductions and CG promotions, leisurely players who didn't seek progress, gamblers who loved to bet on luck, or... Rhode.  The fact that Rhode's game ID went from a simple name to a representative of a phenomenon shows what players felt when Rhode, as a summoning swordsman recognized as extremely troublesome, achieved numerous server firsts and even conquered three new eras.  Most players don't like such random methods that make them feel out of control, but Rhode enjoyed it. Because of the unknown, there was a challenge, which is why he chose the summoning swordsman occupation. In fact, during his long gaming career, he encountered almost all of the "troublesome" performances of summoning swordsmen, but Rhode was undaunted because conquering such difficulties gave him a greater sense of satisfaction.  But now, the dozens of top-level summoning spirits he had cultivated over seven years were all gone. The mysterious summoning magic circle on the back of his right hand still existed, but within it, Rhode could no longer sense any trace of the spirits.  However, upon reflection, it wasn't surprising since this body was not the same as the one in the game, and he couldn't demand too much.  However...  At this thought, Rhode's heart stirred, and he reached out to touch the pocket on his chest. Sure enough, he soon touched a card.  It was a white card, depicting a long sword entwined with thorns, spotlessly white. It was engraved with complex and flourishing inscriptions, and the guard was a pair of beautifully closing wings. Merely looking at it was pleasing to the eye. In the four corners of the card, there were four different symbols. In the upper right corner was a white semicircle, while in the upper left corner was a small 'X'. Looking further down, the lower left and right corners each had two small numbers—3.  Turning the card over, mysterious and elegant text slowly emerged on the back.  [Eternal Holy Sword, Tenth Rank: Star Mark, No Attribute, Fusable—Even the dust of history cannot bury its dazzling brilliance.]  It's still here?  Looking at the card in his hand, Rhode was slightly startled. This was the exclusive equipment of a summoning swordsman, the summoning card. And he was very familiar with this one; it was a rare card souvenir given to him by the officials during a game event, after he led his guild to win the server championship for two consecutive quarters. To commend this incredibly strong top player, the game company specially made this card for him.  Of course, similar collectible cards were already too numerous to count, but for Rhode, he didn't have the leisure to waste money on things that could only be looked at and not used. So this was the only award card he had, which he carried as an amulet, as it didn't take up much space anyway.  Originally, this was just an ordinary commemorative prize, with the only distinction being that it was the only one in the world. But now, Rhode saw it emitting a faint glow on its surface, shimmering in his hand.  Should he give it a try?  Rhode hesitated for only a second before gripping the card with his right hand. Then, the magic circle on the back of his right hand suddenly lit up, and blue magical lines spread from it, extending to each finger of his right hand. Next, the white card burst into a dazzling white light and then turned into specks of dust, completely disappearing into the air.  At this moment, a system prompt also appeared before Rhode's eyes.  [You have obtained 1/10 of the Eternal Deck, Eternal Holy Sword, Tenth Rank—Star Mark.]  "Sigh..." Staring at this system prompt, Rhode let out a complicated sigh. Although he didn't know why the ordinary card from the original world here had the function of a summoning card, for Rhode now, this was definitely the most useful aid he could have—  In the game, it was rare to find a weapon with a +2 ability before level fifteen, and "Star Mark" actually had an initial +3 attribute, which was enough to compare a half-crippled summoning swordsman to a standard swordsman.  In addition to its fusable nature, it also meant that as long as he found the right spirit, he could turn it into an attribute weapon. Although as a summoning card, it required the holder to consume soul power to use, which made it somewhat inferior to normal weapons, but just in terms of attack power, it was already a rare and powerful equipment at the time.  However, Rhode was really unable to get completely excited right now, because for him, the situation he was involved in was too strange.  Is this a game? Or reality?  If this is reality, then what should he do?  "Knock knock."  Just then, a knock on the door sounded.  Rhode looked up and saw a middle-aged man entering through the door. He was dressed in an adventurer's leather armor, with a head of bright red hair casually combed back. Seeing Rhode, the man smiled slightly.  "Hello, sir, I am the leader of the Star Moon Mercenary Group, Carter." Chapter 3: Attacked  "Hello, Mr. Carter," Rhodes raised his head and greeted the man in front of him with a smile. "Thank you for coming to our rescue."  "It was nothing, don't mention it." The man was muscular and tall, with disheveled crimson hair that flowed back. Judging from his physique, he seemed to be a Lycatus from the northwestern desert. A long and a short sword hung quietly on either side of his waist, and his chiseled face exuded determination and scrutiny, proof that this man was no ordinary character.  While Rhodes observed the man, Carter was also quietly sizing up the man in front of him. At first glance, one might easily mistake him for an uneducated noble's son because of his slender build, pale skin, and somewhat feminine face, complemented by his attire, which didn't seem fit for adventure travel. He looked more like a wealthy second-generation looking for thrills and bored with leisure. However, Carter believed there was more to this young man than meets the eye, especially because of the peculiar and mysterious magic circle on the back of his right hand. As a spiritualist, Lijie could sense magic from it, indicating that it was not a fake, but in his many years of experience, Carter had rarely seen someone directly engrave a magic circle onto their body. This suggested that the young man's identity was far from simple.  Moreover, from their brief conversation, Carter noticed the young man's demeanor was neither servile nor arrogant. He was calm, and even after waking up from unconsciousness just minutes before, he was able to calmly assess his situation. This alone made him much stronger than those arrogant nobles who were uneducated.  "I heard that you come from the eastern mountains?"  "Yes," Rhodes nodded lightly.  "So, where are you planning to go?"  "I'm just traveling around," Rhodes shrugged. "I am an adventurer. Living freely and adventuring is my life. Of course, rest assured, I won't cause any trouble for you."  "That's good." Since Rhodes was cooperative, Carter didn't say much more. They were still on a mission and didn't want to complicate matters. After a few more words to comfort him and let him rest, Carter soon took his leave. As a mercenary captain, he had many things to do and couldn't afford to waste time here.  The following days were uneventful for Rhodes, although the food that Lijie brought up did pique his interest. Despite it being just ordinary white bread and jerky, and having eaten it many times in the game, it had always been "pretend eating," only restoring life and soul power without any taste or filling his stomach. Now he finally experienced the taste of white bread and jerky as described in the annotations, a novel experience. But it must be said, the taste wasn't as good as described in the annotations.  "How do you feel? Does the wound still hurt?" The blonde girl sat beside Rhodes, looking at the young man with a worried and serious expression, her eyes filled with a touch of sorrow as they rested on his shoulder.  "It's fine now," said Rhodes, clenching his left hand. The pain from his sternum had lessened since the beginning when even breathing felt difficult, but now it was much better.  "That's good," Lijie's tense expression relaxed on hearing Rhodes's response. "But you should rest more. Once we reach Deepstone City, the conditions will be much better, and perhaps your wounds will heal faster." Her expression was very serious. Although the man lying in front of her was a stranger she had just met, her expression showed she didn't mind such details.  "Thank you."  "No need to thank me; it's what I should do." Lijie stood up, her golden fluffy ponytail swinging playfully as she moved.  "Then..." Lijie's words were cut off because, at that moment, the ship suddenly shook. The girl's figure wobbled, almost falling on the bed. Fortunately, she extended her hand to the bedpost at the last moment, managing to stabilize herself.  The two exchanged glances, both seeing a trace of doubt in each other's eyes. Although airships relied on the powerful winds of the tide to move, and the sky didn't have reefs or whirlpools like the sea, it wasn't without dangers. The current situation was clearly not normal.  "I'll go take a look. Rest here; don't worry," Lijie said softly, then immediately turned and left, closing the room door. Watching her leave, Rhodes opened his mouth to speak but said nothing. He was probably older than her; was it necessary for her to talk to him in such a condescending tone? But the next moment, a figure that flew past the window made Rhodes's expression turn serious. He turned his head slightly, carefully watching outside the window. Soon, three or four green figures flashed by, and at the same time, a series of low hums appeared faintly.  "Hiss—" Hearing this sound, Rhodes's heart sank. They were in big trouble!  At that moment, the deck was in chaos. "I never thought we would encounter these damned things." The red-haired mercenary captain with dual swords stood at the forefront, his face stern as he watched the green figures circling the airship. They looked like snakes with bat wings, about a meter long. Although their slender bodies appeared fragile, the sharp fangs revealed in their wide-open mouths could overturn such impressions in the shortest time. Wind snakes.  "It looks like we have entered the territory of wind snakes," the fat merchant hid beside the mercenary captain, his face pale, wiping sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. "Damn it, that cunning Bick, I knew it, I knew there was a problem with him giving me such a route for so little money! This is murder! When I get back, I will let him know what I'm capable of!"  "Let's get out of this encirclement first!" Carter interrupted the merchant's hysterical shout. Looking around, there were hundreds of wind snakes surrounding the merchant ship. At first, he could order his men to use crossbows to attack, hoping to scare off the creatures. But the wind snakes' kamikaze spirit was beyond his imagination, or rather, the death of their companions only incited their ferocity. They had now occupied the outside of the deck and began to breach inward. The mercenaries had also abandoned their crossbows and were wielding their weapons in close combat.  "You, get inside, tell the captain we need to leave quickly!" Carter pushed the fat merchant into the captain's cabin behind him, then stepped forward, his swords flashing, cutting down a wind snake that roared in attack. But soon, another charged at him. There were too few hands on deck! Carter frowned, scanning the deck. He had only taken six people on this mission, and only these six were left. Although the merchant ship had its own guards, their experience was insufficient. In fact, a third of the merchant ship's guards had fallen in the first wave of attacks, and now only half remained, and seeing their panicked and clumsy state, they probably wouldn't last much longer.  Looking at the terrifying creatures, Carter's face was serious. He had faced wind snakes before, but facing such a number was a first, making him a bit nervous. He stepped forward again, his body turning half a circle nimbly, then his swords slashed to the side, heavily striking a wind snake. The injured creature fell to the ground with a few unwilling hisses before becoming a cold corpse. Carter looked up, scanning his surroundings, then his heart leaped.  "Lijie! Be careful!!"  The girl didn't react immediately. She had just finished treating a mercenary's poison wound and was still dazed from the exertion—although she had only been on deck for a few minutes, several people had already been injured. As the only spiritualist with healing power, Lijie naturally took on the responsibility. Hearing Carter's warning, she turned back in confusion. Then, all she saw was a gaping mouth with sharp fangs. In that instant, the girl's blood seemed to freeze. She stared blankly at the wind snake in front of her, her mind blank, not knowing how to react. In her eyes, Lijie could clearly see the sharp, gleaming fangs and the flesh-colored inner walls, and even the foul smell was so distinct. At that moment, a hand suddenly reached out from behind, grabbed Lijie's collar, and pulled her away just in time. Chapter 4: Fierce Battle  The wind serpent bit into thin air. It almost succeeded, if not for the sudden appearance of Rhodes from behind.  "Mr. Rhodes?" Lijie, who had escaped death, raised her head and was surprised to find Rhodes standing behind her, with her leaning into his arms. She was so soft all over, possibly due to being overly frightened, that she couldn't muster any strength.  She instinctively tried to stand up, but her legs gave way, and she sat down instead.  "Lijie!" Seeing Lijie escape death, Carter also breathed a sigh of relief, but soon, his heart tensed up again.  Because at this moment, the wind serpent that had missed its attack had turned around, spread its wings, and raised its head, preparing to launch another attack.  Damn it! He held his twin swords and ran towards the two, hoping to make it in time—but no matter how he looked at it, it seemed too late.  Looking at the wind serpent again, the girl held her breath. She wanted to do something but didn't know what she could do. As a spirit master, she didn't need to use weapons, and she didn't carry any with her.  So, what now? "Leave it to me."  Just as Lijie panicked, she heard Rhodes' voice. Then, she saw him step half a step forward, shielding her.  Was he planning to confront the wind serpent bare-handed? While Lijie was puzzled, she saw Rhodes extend his right hand.  At that moment, Lijie noticed a complex and gorgeous magic circle on the back of Rhodes' right hand, shining with a bright and clear magic glow. Lines spread from it, extending to each finger. A translucent, card-like object slowly emerged from the palm of Rhodes' hand.  Then, Rhodes grasped it with the back of his hand. A dazzling white light suddenly appeared. The invisible magic power released the seal, transforming into a tangible wave of air that spread out in all directions, with the wind serpent at the forefront screaming and flapping its wings, trying to maintain balance under the onslaught of the raging air currents.  But before it could take any further action, a dazzling light burst from the midst of the air currents and struck the serpent's body hard, sending it flying away.  "Phew..." Rhodes exhaled lightly. At this moment, the dazzling light had faded, and in its place was a beautifully exquisite, pure white longsword in his right hand.  He waved the Stardust Sword in his hand, and specks of light dust slowly fell from the sword, constructing a mesmerizing scene. He was completely oblivious to the fact that everyone else was completely stunned.  Lijie sat on the ground, looking at the man in front of her in disbelief, while Carter also slowed down, his eyes filled with surprise and wonder. Although he had sensed that Rhodes was no ordinary person, he had never imagined he would be this "extraordinary."  Although still sitting on the ground, Lijie couldn't help but admire the flawless white longsword. The slender blade was engraved with ancient patterns, emitting a faint glow, and the clearly visible light dust surrounding it was fantastically beautiful. The folded wings on the hilt were exquisitely detailed, with every feather visible.  While women generally showed little interest in weapons, this longsword far surpassed the category of weapons and could even be considered an art piece.  Lijie was purely admiring, but Carter's gaze was somewhat different.  As an experienced adventurer, Carter could swear he had never seen such a bizarre thing. In fact, when Rhodes summoned the weapon, Carter was stunned. Although he had seen some mages perform summoning, they mostly used crystals or such, and they needed to chant some strange incantations, then summon a few ugly monsters, which was not uncommon.  But summoning a weapon? He had never seen such a sight.  Although Carter was still unclear about what Rhodes held in his hand, he was very sure that ordinary people definitely couldn't use such a magical weapon. Only those of noble and special status were qualified to use it.  Now, seeing the lifelike wings on the sword handle, Carter furrowed his brow. He was well aware that on this continent, angels were a very noble race, with most of them being of prominent status or the backbone of important organizations.  For example, the ruler who ascended three years ago in the Mu'en Principality, Lidiya Pafielde Mira Franrica, was an angel.  Although the young man's true identity was still unclear, the sword was enough to confirm that he had some connection with that noble race.  These thoughts flashed through Carter's mind, and at that moment, he had already reached the two of them.  "Are you alright?"  "I, I'm okay."  Lijie's face was still somewhat pale, which could not be blamed on her being faint-hearted. After all, if Rhodes hadn't pulled her out of the way from behind just now, the girl would have been dead for sure. The fear of narrowly escaping death was not something ordinary people could experience.  After making sure Lijie was unharmed, Carter immediately turned his attention to Rhodes beside him.  "Mr. Rhodes, are you alright?"  Rhodes shook his head, indicating he was fine. Although his left side was still in pain from the movement, it didn't affect the battle much. Instead, he was more concerned about another matter.  "What are you planning to do?"  The number of wind serpents was increasing. Although the airship was moving at full speed, it still couldn't escape the attack of the majority of the serpents. Not only had their situation not improved, but it had also gotten worse.  "We plan to break out of their territory. Until then, we can only keep going."  If it were on land, Carter might have other methods, but they were in the air, and apart from this idea, he had no better solution to the current problem.  But Carter had barely spoken when he saw the young man in front of him frown.  "It's too late, Mr. Carter."  "Oh?"  "Wind serpents have an absolute advantage on plains. Even if you speed up, we won't be able to leave before the airship disintegrates."  "Really?"  Carter was not stupid. The reason he made this decision was that he was not familiar with this place. Once Rhodes brought it up, he immediately understood the severity of the situation.  "So, what should we do?"  "Descend immediately."  Rhodes didn't hesitate to give the answer, then he pointed to one side.  "Then we rush in there."  Carter followed the direction of Rhodes' finger, and then, he widened his eyes in surprise.  "You mean we should rush into the Twilight Forest?"  "To get rid of the harassment of the wind serpents, this is our only way. Moreover..."  As he spoke, Rhodes looked around.  "We don't have much time."  The situation was indeed deteriorating. The threat of the wind serpents was not only their poisonous fangs, but the corrosive venom was equally deadly, and they were small and agile. Once a frontal attack failed, they would immediately change their target.  There were already many wind serpents that had broken the glass and drilled into the cabin from below, but there was no way to fend them off in such a situation.  Although the narrow space of the cabin limited the flexibility of the serpents, their threat did not decrease. Therefore, the cabin was in chaos, and the billowing smoke from several breaches indicated the situation was extremely bad!  Carter did not hesitate any longer and immediately turned and left.  Rhodes, holding the Stardust Sword, blocked the front breach.  "Hiss!" A wind serpent flew in from the right, opening its mouth wide to attack Rhodes, but in the instant it charged, Rhodes had already moved to the left, and his white longsword swept up sharply, hitting the serpent's chin and sending it flying while blocking the hastily ejected venom.  Then Rhodes quickly turned around, his silver-white sword drawing a light curtain in the air, accurately piercing another serpent trying to attack from behind. As it lost balance, he delivered another strike, ending the serpent's life.  But the onslaught of the serpents did not stop. The smell of blood unmistakably aggravated them. As Rhodes pulled his longsword from the body of the now dead serpent, dozens of wind serpents pounced on him. They layered upon each other, looking from a distance like a green fog or a monstrous beast opening its maw, ready to swallow its prey in an instant.  "Mr. Rhodes!" After helping another mercenary dispel toxins, Lijie turned around to see this scene and couldn't help but cry out.  Streams of acid shot out like torrential rain toward Rhodes. If he were hit, he would likely be seriously injured or killed.  But at that moment, Rhodes swiftly retreated. The acid, reeking of decay, brushed past him, landing on the deck and corroding small holes with rising green smoke. But almost at the same time, the serpents had reached Rhodes, ready to tear apart the dangerous man in front of them.  If it was an ordinary person, they would have been terrified, but Rhodes was very calm. Facing the serpents surging forward to tear him apart, all he did was raise his sword and thrust forward.  Activate the Blade of Breakage. The white blade burst among the serpents, splitting from one to two, two to four, and several blades quickly shot forward, piercing one serpent after another. The powerful air currents swept up like invisible hands, cruelly tearing apart the bodies of those who were lucky not to be hit.  Almost in an instant, the green fog was torn apart by the dazzling light, leaving only scattered flesh.  Everyone held their breath at that moment. Chapter 5: Critical Moment  The fierce offensive of the wind serpent swarm paused momentarily, and on the deck that was originally chaotic, filled with angry shouts, calls, and screams, there appeared an instant of silence. Everyone looked at the young man with eyes of disbelief, completely unsure of what to say. Just a moment ago, almost everyone thought the young man was done for; they had never seen anyone retreat unscathed from the attack of dozens of wind serpents. Of course, that might have been possible for high-level professionals or fully armored shield warriors. But the young man didn't appear to be very old, and aside from the white longsword held in his hand, he had no other protective gear. Yet, he had done it.  At this moment, not only the mercenaries but also Lijie and Carter were stupefied as they looked at the young man, their hearts tumultuous. Who exactly was he? Perhaps it was the intimidation of Rod's attack that caused the wind serpents, which were originally attacking the airship desperately, to scatter and retreat. For a while, the deck was so quiet that nothing could be heard except the howling wind.  The mercenaries were shocked by Rod's performance, but for Rod himself, he didn't care about what he had done. Instead, looking at the pile of corpses at his feet, he felt a sense of relief in his heart. Though wind serpents are among the lowest level of monsters and aren't particularly strong, they are creatures that triumph through numbers. Rod's class as a summoning swordsman excelled in solo battles, but was not as effective when it came to dealing with large groups. In fact, the reason for his smooth success this time was mainly due to the initial +3 trait of the "Stardust" in his hand, which meant that while holding this sword, Rod's attributes could be increased by three points. An increase of three points was enough to change the danger level of a monster from red to green. Therefore, it wasn't particularly surprising for Rod to defeat this group of wind serpents.  However, Rod still found it strange. If his attributes were calculated based on human standards, then even with "Stardust", he should not have had such a sweeping victory and overwhelming advantage. He originally estimated that Blade of Breaking would at most leave the wind serpents critically weakened, so he was prepared to finish them off with additional attacks. Unexpectedly, the power of Blade of Breaking was far beyond his imagination; it actually wiped out the group of wind serpents entirely.  Is it possible that his attributes were not calculated based on human standards? With this thought, Rod subconsciously tried to access his attribute panel, but regrettably, since his race had not yet been determined, his attributes were hidden and could not be checked. Fortunately, this battle granted him 1900 experience points—surprisingly, there were indeed experience points to be gained, which Rod found quite astonishing.  Of course, for Rod, this only took a couple of seconds. To the onlookers, he merely gazed silently at the pile of corpses at his feet for a moment, then lifted his head again. It was then that Rod noticed the eerie silence around him, which was not due to the shock of the others, but the presence of an even more dangerous and lethal being. Where had the wind serpent swarm gone?  This thought flashed through Rod's mind, and then it seemed he remembered something. He swiftly turned around and yelled, "Everyone be careful...!"  At that moment, the airship suddenly shook violently. The intense shaking caused many people to fall to the ground, and two unlucky ones who failed to stand firm in time slipped and fell off the ship. Simultaneously, a crisp cracking noise came from the deck at the bow, followed by a giant serpent's head bursting forth. "Be careful, it's the wind serpent lord!" Carter finally appeared, shouting loudly, then drawing the twin swords at his side and rushing towards the huge wind serpent.  The other mercenaries also quickly got up, and although they were already battered and bruised, they clenched their teeth and followed their leader, trying to launch an attack against this colossal creature. However, Rod was quicker than all of them. He crouched down and lines of system prompts immediately appeared before his eyes.  [Experience points 1900/200, level up available, skill point gained: 1, level 2] [Experience points 1700/400, level up available, skill point gained: 2, level 3] [Experience points 1300/600, skill point gained: 3, level 4] [Experience points 800/1000, skill point gained: 4, level 5] [Consume 1 skill point, upgrade Moonshadow Sword Technique 1/3, proficiency E] [Consume 1 skill point, upgrade Moonshadow Sword Technique 2/3, proficiency E] [Consume 1 skill point, upgrade Moonshadow Sword Technique 3/3, proficiency E] [Consume 1 skill point, upgrade Moonshadow Sword Technique 1/4, proficiency D———Shadow Flash unlocked]  Activate.  Rod leapt into action. In that instant, everyone only saw a blur before their eyes, then saw the young man on the ground transform into a black shadow, slicing through the sky like a blade charging forward. Even the enormous wind serpent lord had no time to react. When Rod soared up and arrived in front of it, the serpent lord even seemed somewhat puzzled—it had never encountered such a bizarre situation where prey jumped up and delivered itself to its mouth.  Rod raised his longsword, and the radiance of stardust seemed to be drawn by an invisible force, condensing on the immaculate blade in that moment. Then he aimed for the wind serpent lord's eyes, as large as bells, and thrust down forcefully. "Blade of Breaking!"  Faced with the oncoming sword light, the wind serpent lord's first reaction was to dodge. After consecutively upgrading Moonshadow Sword Technique four times, the quantity and power of Blade of Breaking had surged dramatically. Dozens of silver-white blades erupted from the sword, spiraling and shooting forward.  One, two, three...  At first, the serpent lord's tough scales barely withstood the initial sword light, but even with its lord-level protection, it only held up until the twentieth blade before completely collapsing. The following sword lights easily tore through the scales and flesh, piercing its body.  Although the wind serpent lord was massive, Rod smartly chose a point to break through. Under his control, the blades did not scatter as before but concentrated on the serpent's neck, successfully breaching its defense. The wind serpent lord let out a piercing shriek, then heavily fell downwards. However, it did not give up on attacking. Even with its left neck severely mutilated, the lord still abruptly lifted its head, fixating on Rod, and then suddenly opened its wide mouth.  Rod's figure flickered, and once again, he turned into a phantom and quickly retreated. As he pulled back, a foul-smelling venom shot upwards, narrowly missing Rod's afterimage and hitting the mast behind him. Quickly, under the venom's corrosion, the originally thick and sturdy mast melted away within seconds and then collapsed with a crash.  BOSSes are still BOSSes after all. Based on Rod's experience in games, the average level of wind serpents is around level three, while their leaders are generally level ten. This BOSS in front of him should not exceed level ten. Although with Carter and the mercenaries' cover, defeating this BOSS wouldn't be difficult, Rod realized that this was probably not an ordinary lord-level monster but an elite. After all, an ordinary lord-level monster would have lost its wings to Rod's previous strike.  But the reality was that despite Rod's full effort, he only left a deep wound on the lord, which was very telling. "Attack its wings and try to stay away from its mouth! Attack from the side!" Rod commanded Carter and the other mercenaries while entangling with the wind serpent lord. As a summoning swordsman, he wasn't the main tank, but it seemed that the others lacked experience in combat with the wind serpent lord.  In the game, a team wipe due to lack of experience could be redone, but here, Rod didn't want to take that risk—his previously healed wound on the left chest was now burning with pain, as if it had split open again. If he were to die here due to a team wipe, it would be an embarrassing joke.  Moreover, although he was only level five now, Rod believed that as long as the opponent's level didn't exceed level fifteen, he had the confidence to fight. After all, in the Dragon Soul Continent, three classes are known for defeating monsters above their level: mages, rangers, and lastly, summoning swordsmen.  Mages are known for their unpredictable spells, rangers excel with their long-distance "kiting", and summoning swordsmen are essentially about outnumbering enemies. For these three classes, even a level difference of more than five levels is as easy as eating and drinking, until they reach non-elite BOSSes of up to ten levels apart.  Even so, these three classes also have their flaws—mages without mana are just targets; even a group of low-level fairies could beat them to death. Rangers, when approached closely, face complete tragedy, while summoning swordsmen have too much randomness and are complicated to the point where there's no template to follow. That's why these three classes haven't caused a big stir in the game. This also reflects the more realistic setting of the Dragon Soul Continent—either take an unconventional path and gamble, or move forward steadily and safely. Players can freely decide their fate and future.  The Night Raven Lord in front of him was a level ten elite BOSS, but due to the bonus from the Stardust in his hand, its defense was at most on a level six or seven standard. So Rod wasn't worried about insufficient damage in defense, but in terms of attack...  "Whoosh!" A fierce wind suddenly arose. Rod's figure abruptly flickered, dodging and retreating rapidly with a series of afterimages, narrowly avoiding the serpent's wing attack. The wing that missed struck heavily on the deck, smashing a large hole in the thick and solid surface.  It was indeed the attack power of a level ten elite. Rod wiped the sweat from his forehead; he was only level five now and had no equipment. If he were to be hit by that sweep, even the Lord of Heaven might not be able to save him. Although he was worried about Carter and the others, fortunately, it seemed that because he had caused significant damage to the wind serpent lord, it had focused its hatred on him. Unfortunately, being targeted by a BOSS with such high attack power put a lot of pressure on non-tank classes...  His soul power had dropped to a third, and Rod felt tired. Although he had anticipated a tough battle upon seeing the wind serpent lord, the current pressure was too great. He needed Shadow Flash to help dodge attacks because, with his current speed, avoiding the wind serpent lord's assaults was practically impossible. On the other hand, he also needed Blade of Breaking to inflict damage and take down this troublesome foe as quickly as possible. But it was not easy.  The airship was slowly losing altitude, but under the wind serpent lord's attacks, it swayed from side to side, like a small boat in a storm, making everyone's hearts leap. Two mercenaries had already been thrown off and were unlikely to survive.  Carter was still trying to drive away the wind serpent lord; his twin swords danced in front of him, attacking the serpent lord's side with agility, but to little effect. If it weren't for Lijie casting healing light on these mercenaries from time to time, they wouldn't have been able to hold on until now.  He must find a way, otherwise, before the airship could land, it might be torn apart by this damn snake. With this thought, Rod bit his lip. The wind serpent lord's attacks did not weaken; its wings stretched out long at its side, and the two claws on the edges were firmly grasping the edge of the ship's bow.  Although Rod's previous attack had inflicted considerable damage, as a lord-level creature, it obviously wouldn't retreat just because of those injuries. On the contrary, the cunning wind serpent lord seemed to have detected its enemies' weakness. Its sharp claws held fast to the airship's hull, shaking and pulling at its prey with force.  Although the airship's body was not fragile, it had already been battered in the battle with the wind serpent swarm. Coupled with the howling wind surges hitting the hull, it started to twist and deform. Even the deck had several alarming cracks, making a chilling sound of rupture.  "Oh my God! Oh my God!" Curled up in a corner of the captain's cabin, the fat merchant trembled as he stared at the terrifying wind serpent lord outside. His voice was twisted with nervousness and fear. "That damned Richard! Don't let me see him; I will surely take his life! To give me such a route, it's murder!" Upon saying this, the fat merchant shuddered violently and then turned his gaze to the captain beside him. "And you! With such a terrifying thing, why didn't you warn me earlier!?"  The captain did not respond to the fat merchant's angry shouts. At the moment, he was tightly holding the helm, his eyes fixed on the front. At the same time, he cursed this damn fool inwardly. He had warned him that taking this route at this time of year might provoke the wind serpent swarm, but the man had been indifferent.  Now, when death was imminent, he had the audacity to blame himself! If he had known it would come to this, he would never have taken on this job! Chapter 6 Fall Bad situation. Both Rod and Carter had the same thought at this moment, the lord of the wind serpents was really difficult to deal with. Although the airship was descending rapidly and the forest nearby could be seen clearly, if it continued like this, the airship might disintegrate in the air before it even had a chance to land on the ground!  "Ha!" Carter leaped forward, his twin swords in hand drawing two cold lights in the air, stabbing straight at the giant claws of the wind serpent lord in front of him. But just as he was about to succeed, the wind serpent lord suddenly opened its mouth, and Carter only felt a stench hit his face. He didn't even have time to confirm what it was and had to roll on the spot, evading the hiss of the wind serpent lord, which also meant the failure of his attack.  However, just as Carter stood up and tried to pull away from the space, the wind serpent lord seemed to find this little bug too annoying and suddenly struck out with its claw. Carter, who did not expect the wind serpent lord to let go of the ship's body, was caught off guard. He instinctively raised his twin swords to block, but was still knocked away. After sliding several meters on the deck, he finally stopped against the mast.  This couldn't go on. Rod frowned, then he looked towards the girl standing not far behind, her face anxious.  "Lije, I need your help!"  "Eh?"  "I will draw its attention. When it attacks me, I hope you can cast a protective shield on me!"  "Okay!" Hearing Rod's words, Lije didn't hesitate at all and nodded her head.  She clasped her hands tightly, a bright, gentle light emerging on her body.  Seeing this, Rod didn't say anything more. He just turned his head and then raised his long sword, thrusting forward violently.  Shattered Blade. The bright, snow-like blade of light once again swept across the air, heavily striking the body of the wind serpent lord. Although this time Rod did not intentionally concentrate the blade of light, but let them scatter and attack, so the power was smaller than before and did not penetrate the wind serpent lord's scales. However, the scattered attack tore several distinct bloodstains on the thin membranes of the wind serpent lord's wings, causing it to cry out in pain and anger, "Hiss!!!"  The wind serpent lord's movements halted abruptly. It quickly turned its head, its two red eyes burning with angry flames, staring intently at the young human on the deck, then it opened its mouth again and pounced towards Rod at great speed.  The wind serpent lord was indeed fast, in the blink of an eye, Rod could see its blood-red mouth appearing above his head, which made Rod tense his nerves. This was a very risky choice. He deliberately did not use Shadow Flash but maintained a relatively slow speed to lure the wind serpent lord into attacking. Although this would be very dangerous, when the enemy was fully attacking, its weaknesses would also become obvious—this was the opportunity Rod was waiting for!  The wind serpent lord's gaping maw was right in front of him, so close that in a few seconds, Rod would be swallowed by it. But it still could not achieve its goal. Because at that moment, a faint, white glowing egg-shaped barrier suddenly appeared on Rod, blocking the wind serpent lord's fangs. Although the wind serpent lord's actions slowed down, in the next moment it completely shattered the barrier, but it bit into nothing.  Because when the protective shield enveloped him, Rod had already activated Shadow Flash. He, like a ghostly shadow, dodged the wind serpent lord's bite, then raised the pure white long sword in his hand, slashing across its throat.  This was the weak point of the wind serpent lord, and also the most vulnerable part of its body. However, before this it had always been shrinking its neck, so it was very difficult to attack. But this time, the wind serpent lord, provoked by Rod, had completely opened up its attack, and therefore, it no longer had time to protect its most fatal weakness.  A sharp cry sounded, the wind serpent lord seemed to have been electrocuted, raising its head, and from its throat, filthy blood sprayed out, covering the entire deck. Then, its body softened and it collapsed heavily onto the deck, no longer breathing.  Just then, Rod saw a deep green color rapidly expanding in front of his eyes.  "Boom!!!" Then, he only felt a sudden shake of the ship's body, and his body seemed to float in the air for a moment. Afterward, Rod's vision went dark, and he completely lost consciousness.  When he woke up again, the first thing he felt was the bone-chilling cold wind.  "Where am I............" Opening his eyes, the first thing that came into view was a beautiful night sky. Unlike a normal night, the night here was very "bright", with soft moonlight shining down, casting every leaf's shadow on the ground.  In the night sky, in addition to the myriad stars, there were streaks of light, which condensed and converged into a ribbon of light, extending in all directions. This was a characteristic of the Dragon Soul Continent—according to ancient legends, this was originally a chaotic and dangerous space. Then, five giant dragons came here, creating the heavens, the earth, and everything with their bodies.  To suppress the evil chaos, after creating the world with their bodies, the five giant dragons also invested their souls into it, to suppress the evil chaotic forces and protect the order of this world. Each of the giant dragon's souls had its own unique form, like the sky above Rod's head now, representing the protected area of the Light Dragon Soul. Its characteristic is that even in the night, there would be light shining.  In contrast, the protected area of the Dark Dragon Soul is in darkness, even during the day, without any shadow of light. As such, the distribution of species on the continent is quite regular. In the area protected by the Light Dragon Soul, one can see various green plants thriving. But in the Dark Dragon Soul region, only traces of noctilucent plants can be seen.  Of course, this characteristic also affects the distribution of various races on the continent. Humans mostly gather under the protection of the Light Dragon Soul, followed by elves and angels. And undead, vampires, and nightmares and other dark races naturally become residents of the dark kingdom.  There are no gods on this continent. If one had to say, the five giant dragons that created heaven and earth are the objects of their worship. Similarly, this also includes the bearers of the Dragon Souls. Souls have their cores, even the giant dragons that created heaven and earth are no exception, and their soul cores will reside in someone's body, and this person can use this power to adjust the Dragon Soul's protection over the continent.  For example, if chaos is a virus, and the power of the Dragon Soul is a firewall, then the person holding the soul core is like a CPU. As long as the CPU can still compute, the firewall will not fail and is sufficient to completely repel all chaotic forces from this world. And these bearers of the soul cores are also regarded as the inheritors of the Dragon's Soul.  However, for Rod now, this doesn't mean much.  Rod slowly stood up, the intense pain sweeping through his body, especially the injury on the left side of his chest, now seemed even more serious. Before, Rod could still barely move his left hand, but now he couldn't move it at all. Even just moving a finger, he would feel as if his entire arm was soaked in a sea of fire.  But this made Rod relieved. If there was feeling, it meant his arm was still there. If there was no feeling at all, that would be a big problem.  Looking up, with the help of the bright moonlight, the first thing Rod saw was the wreckage of the airship, the tall trees around indicating that they were in a forest. With this, it was clear what had happened.  Although Rod killed the wind serpent lord, the airship, already fragile, was destroyed because it could not withstand the violent impact during the descent.  At this moment, the forest was silent, not even the sound of insects could be heard. Rod looked around and saw bloodstains and bodies everywhere on the ground, both of wind serpents and humans. And not far from Rod, a small figure was lying there, motionless.  "Lije!" Rod hurried to the girl's side, bending down to closely observe her condition. Fortunately, although the girl looked pale with her hands tightly clenched, her breathing was still even, and after Rod called to her, it didn’t take too long for the girl to open her eyes.  "Where am I........." Lije opened her eyes confusedly, staring at the man in front of her, and after a while, she seemed to regain her senses. It seemed she had taken quite a fall.  "I'm still alive?"  "That's right." Seeing Lije respond to his words, Rod was relieved, and the girl slowly stood up. She shook her head, bit her lip tightly, seemingly not fully recovered yet. But for the girl, there were more important things to do now.  "Where is everyone? The leader? How are they?"  "..............." Rod didn't answer, but Lije didn't need one, because at this moment, she had already clearly seen the scene around her. The originally pale face of the girl was now exceptionally stiff.  "How could this be......... Krite! Shal! Leader!" The girl rushed to the bodies of the mercenaries, desperately calling their names, but no one responded. However, Lije didn't give up, she squatted down and carefully checked the mercenaries in front of her, and after confirming that they were dead, she didn't cry but bit her teeth and ran to the next person.  But the girl's efforts did not get the deserved return. Facing those bodies that were already cold and stiff, she could do nothing.  Although Lije kept insisting, when she saw Carter's figure, she couldn't help but fall to the ground with weak knees. The leader of the mercenaries, who was previously in high spirits, had now also become a cold body. Half of his body was stuck in the gap of the deck, a broken wooden stake piercing through his abdomen.  "Leader...... Leader......" Seeing this, Lije sat dumbfounded on the somewhat damp ground, the flame of hope completely extinguished from her eyes, replaced by confusion and sadness. In the end, the girl lowered her head. Although she didn't speak, the faint sobbing carried by the night wind still reached Rod's ears.  Looking at the slightly trembling shoulders of the blonde girl in front of him, Rod could only silently stand behind her, unable to say a word. During the battle because of the matter of life and death, he had not paid attention to these. But now, when everything was over, looking at the corpses all around, Rod still felt complicated emotions.  He had seen bodies before, but those were only simulated scenes in the game. In the game, people could be resurrected with magic, or run back as a soul, but this was not a game. There were no resurrections, and no running back after death. Dead, meant dead.  At this moment, Rod seemed to recall that night seven years ago, he could only watch helplessly, unable to do anything—death resolutely passed by his side, but he couldn't even stop it.  Just as he was about to say something to comfort the girl in front of him, suddenly, a faint cry for help came.  "Hey......... Is anyone there? Help me........." Chapter 7: After the Disaster  Mace sat awkwardly by the fire, his plump face revealing feelings of helplessness and gloom. He wanted to lash out in anger, but he didn't know at whom to direct it.  On the other side of the fire, Rhode leaned quietly against a tree trunk, resting with his eyes closed.  Lize, silent and speechless, was preparing food. Although her expression appeared calm, her swollen eyes told a different story.  It was uncertain whether it was luck or misfortune, but the portly merchant ended up being the only other survivor of the disaster besides Rhode and Lize. As a merchant who often traveled, he had some magical artifacts for self-preservation. During the airship crash, the protective amulet in the merchant's hand exhibited its excellent and stable function, making him the least injured among the three.  Rhode's previous injuries had not yet fully healed. After the intense battle and fall, his condition worsened.  Lize wasn't faring much better. It wasn't until the tension eased that everyone realized not only had her right arm been dislocated, but she had also hurt her foot.  The only injuries the portly merchant sustained were some scratches and a concussion, but otherwise, he was fine. For an ordinary person, such injuries would have been enough to keep them bedridden for months.  Fortunately, Lize was a full-time Spirit Master, and healing was her specialty. Under her treatment, everyone's injuries improved. However, Rhode still needed some time to recover fully. Given his original condition and the subsequent battle, he should have been either dead or crippled, but now he was intact except for some limitations in movement due to his injuries. This greatly surprised Lize; since they had rescued Rhode, she had been taking care of him and was well aware of his condition. However, even she hadn't anticipated his body to be so resilient.  Not only was Lize surprised, but Rhode was also secretly astonished. Even though he had realized during the battle that his body wasn't measured by human standards, he had not expected it to be so extraordinary. To have survived such severe injuries, the intense battle, and being thrown to the ground, and still be able to move... could his mixed heritage be that of a barbarian?  There was another thing Rhode did not voice: he was well aware of the exceptional nature of his body, even though he didn't yet know what it was. It was definitely not that of a pure human. But the golden-haired girl's performance was quite odd. By all accounts, as a frail girl and a non-combat class Spirit Master, she should have perished. He could survive and move about because his body was non-human, so what was the reason for her survival and agility? It couldn't just be luck.  Rhode's question was answered when he noticed a hint of gold in Lize's beautiful azure eyes—it seemed that the young lady's survival was indeed more than just good fortune.  "Mister Rhode?" Mace rubbed his hands, his chubby face showing a clear attempt at ingratiating himself. "What do you think we should do next?"  After rescuing Mace, the trio searched the airship wreckage again but found no other survivors. To prevent their companions' bodies from becoming food for the beasts of the forest, Lize suggested cremation. Although Mace was reluctant to part with his valuable goods, seeing Lize's sullen face and Rhode's indifferent attitude, he had to change his mind. He watched with a pained expression as the airship was burned to ashes—it seemed like he was the one most grievously injured.  Although the expensive protective amulet had saved his life, it was now shattered from the impact and had become a piece of junk. It was clear that Mace's losses were significant.  Afterward, the group rested in the forest for a day. Although they encountered no trouble, the attack by the serpent flock had turned the fat merchant into a scaredy-cat. He had previously claimed that serpents were a small probability event and not a concern, but now he changed his mind completely. Those small probability rumors now seemed one hundred percent accurate to him. "Look, they said this route might encounter serpent flocks, and we really did meet them! And I've also heard that the Silvermoon Forest has man-eating wolves and terrifying birds. We couldn't possibly run into those as well, could we?" Once bitten, twice shy, as the saying goes.  Thinking of these possibilities, sweat beads formed on Mace's forehead. As a merchant, he was decent, but he lacked adventurer experience. Now, looking around at the dense shrubbery and trees, his legs trembled. The casual conversations he had once heard from his guards about poisonous snakes in the grass and evil wolves now vividly appeared in his mind, leaving him on edge.  With his only life-saving item now worthless, he had no choice but to rely on others. He didn't consider relying on Lize; she was obedient and likeable but lacked decisiveness, and as a non-combat class, she wouldn't be of much help in an emergency. In the end, Mace decided to rely on Rhode.  Although he wasn't a fighter, Rhode's performance had been very impressive, showing he had outstanding strength. Mace didn't know how Rhode's adventure experience compared to that of the mercenaries, but it probably wasn't far off.  As for Lize, she still seemed immersed in the grief of losing her companions and didn't care about such matters.  "Don't worry, Mister Mace." Rhode shook his head at the anxious merchant. He didn't dislike Mace; after all, if Mace hadn't ordered the airship to stop, Rhode might not have been saved. So Rhode was somewhat fond of him.  "I'm very familiar with the Silvermoon Forest. Based on our current location, it's unlikely we'll encounter any particularly dangerous creatures. You can rest easy."  Rhode's statement wasn't without basis. In the game, the northern plains of Paphield were a gathering place for new players, so Rhode knew the distribution of monsters in the area very well. The most threatening creatures in the plain were the serpent flocks, which were the nightmare of many melee classes and non-solo classes. In the Silvermoon Forest, the most dangerous were the silver wolves. Unlike the serpents that relied on numbers, silver wolves mostly acted alone, making them easier to handle.  Moreover, after killing the serpent leader, Rhode gained 3000 experience points and reached level eight. Since the newbie area was capped at level ten, Rhode was confident that as long as he didn't encounter rare elite bosses, he could handle himself in this region. The likelihood of him blundering into some deadly monster den, as some inexperienced players might, was essentially nil for someone known as a "walking library" like Rhode.  "That's good to hear." Mace sighed in relief and wiped the sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. Due to the high stress, he had hardly slept properly all day. Even the sound of the wind through the trees sounded like wolf howls to him. Now that he had made his decision, he seemed much more relaxed and stopped worrying about anything. He curled up by the fire and comfortably closed his eyes. With that mindset, Mace squinted and soon fell into a deep sleep.  Once Rhode confirmed that Mace was sound asleep, he quietly stood up from his seat by the fire and walked into the depths of the forest. Chapter 8 The Ten Primordial Essences, The Card of Wind  Rhode certainly had no intention of abandoning the fat merchant. On the contrary, his reason for leaving was merely to inspect his spoils of war. During the previous battle, Rhode had gained a wealth of experience but did not obtain many spoils. Although for players, the crashed airship was a treasure trove, and with so many dead, there must have been a considerable amount of wealth on them. However, Rhode eventually dismissed this idea. After all, the other party had saved his life. It was somewhat indefensible to now go and loot the possessions of the deceased.  While experience was valuable, what made Rhode feel that he truly profited was something else entirely. It was the black primal stone he now held in his hand. According to the lore of the Dragon Soul Continent, this was a Soul Core formed from the condensation of a powerful magical creature's soul at the moment of its death.  Its properties were diverse; it could be used as a gem inlaid into weapons or melted down to forge a Soul Weapon. For spellcasters, it was also an excellent material for making magical tools. Additionally, since the drop rate of Soul Cores was very low, their price was always high in the world of the Dragon Soul Continent. For a Summoning Swordsman, they served an irreplaceable function. This was precisely the treasure needed to awaken summoning spirits.  At this moment, Rhode stood deep within a dense forest. He raised his right hand, revealing the Soul Core the size of a nut, emitting a rich dark aura, lying quietly in his palm. Surrounding him was the calm and gentle wilderness, with the midnight moonlight shining through the leaves, scattering specks of light upon the ground and bushes.  Subsequently, the summoning magic circle on the back of Rhode's hand lit up once more, with its streamlined magical brilliance quickly extending outward. Then, a system notification appeared before Rhode.  [Contaminated Soul Core detected. Would you like to purify it?] "Purify."  Soon after, the summoning circle on the back of Rhode's right hand once again emanated a pristine gleam, flowing like water down his fingers and enveloping the Soul Core at the center of his palm. As the holy power infiltrated the core, the strands of black mist wrapped around it melted away like snow under the sunlight, leaving no trace. With the disappearance of the black mist, the true form of the Soul Core was finally revealed—a translucent core emitting a deep blue radiance, trembling slightly as if it were an egg-shaped gemstone, struggling to break free.  [Soul Core purified. Would you like to awaken it?] "Awaken."  Following Rhode's command, the trembling of the deep blue egg-shaped gemstone intensified. Then, with a soft "pop," the gemstone shattered instantly. Streams of blue energy, smooth as water, burst forth, rapidly spinning and coiling before transforming into the shape of a card, which finally came to rest quietly in Rhode's hand.  A cool, comfortable sensation spread from within Rhode's body, causing him to shiver with pleasure. At that moment, Rhode also came to know what kind of existence had formed a contract with him.  He picked up the card; on the front was a greenish-blue spiritual bird soaring in the sky, with a cyan-blue half-circle in the upper right corner (representing the card's element), and a "V" in the upper left corner. On the bottom left and right corners were two small numbers—2.  Rhode flipped the card over, and soon, the back revealed rows of text shimmering with magical light.  [Soaring Spirit Bird (Wind Elemental Attribute): A flying fusion spirit with a 10% chance to trigger paralysis and penetration effects during attack, ineffective against magical protection— Holding Skill: Spirit Wind Illusion (Children of the wind soaring in the sky, an area-of-effect skill)] [You have obtained 1/10 of the Sky Deck, Soaring Spirit Bird]  What luck.  Rhode couldn't help but smile. A flying summoning spirit was essential for a Summoning Swordsman in the early stages, and its wind elemental attribute allowed it to pass through non-magical objects easily, rendering ordinary protection meaningless. Combined with a 30-meter effective range and special effects, Rhode could at least ensure that he wouldn't face too much danger. Even if he accidentally encountered mutant bosses, he had the confidence to battle them.  However, what troubled Rhode the most was his attributes. Until now, his strength, constitution, agility, and willpower remained hidden, which made him somewhat uneasy. Although it was his own body, the current state it exhibited far surpassed Rhode's normal level. He was certain that his attributes were above those of humans, but this feeling of not being able to grasp the details of his own condition was not pleasant.  You think you're going to die, but then you don't. That's a beautiful misunderstanding. But if you think you won't die, and then you do, that's a damned nightmare. Since he couldn't see his attributes, Rhode could only rely on his experience and guesswork.  Through the battle with the Wind Serpent Lord, Rhode had some clues. After all, he had studied the data of a boss like the Wind Serpent Lord in detail. From the battle, it seemed that his strength was roughly on par with a standard swordsmanship practitioner, and his constitution was quite robust. Since arriving in this world, although he had faced several crises, Rhode's body seemed to have withstood the tests, with the lowest alert level never reaching a critical state. As for speed, it wasn't much different from an ordinary human. But Rhode couldn't test his willpower—he couldn't just ask a mage to cast mental spells on him to see how much he could resist.  Just then, a slight rustling sound came from the bushes, and Rhode raised his eyebrows. He lowered his right hand, the glow of the summoning circle on the back of his hand dimming in an instant, and the card he was holding turned into motes of magical dust and disappeared.  Once sealed as a card and the relationship confirmed with the holder, the sealed cards no longer appear in physical form. They would quietly sleep within the summoning circle, in the ring known as "The Ten Primordial Essences," waiting for their owner to awaken them. Currently, only two cards were sealed within—the attributeless "Star Scar" and the Wind Elemental "Spirit Bird," both in the outermost ring of the "Kingdom."  Rhode had no intention of revealing his abilities too much in front of others. Although it was introduced in the game that Summoning Swordsmen were an exclusive class for players, having existed on the continent during the ancient times, and players were the sole inheritors of this profession, embarking on a journey to find and restore the glory of this once-heroic profession——  Of course, this was all nonsense from the game introduction. If put more practically, by observing the expressions of Lijie and Mess, Rhode could confirm that these people had no idea about the existence of such a profession. Thus, he wasn't inclined to say much more. Besides, maintaining a sense of mystery was not without its benefits.  As Rhode was about to turn around, he saw Lijie emerging from the woods.  "Lijie? Do you need something from me?" "Ah... No, it's nothing, Mr. Rhode."  Lijie shook her head, but her expression was somewhat uneasy.  "Well... I just wanted to ask how your wound is, and if there's anything I can do..." Her voice grew fainter towards the end, her hands tightly clutching the hem of her robe, giving off an exceedingly fragile impression.  In fact, Rhode had noticed Lijie's unusual behavior. Mess could see her traits because, as a merchant who traveled far and wide, he wouldn't have lasted long without keen observation. Rhode, on the other hand, could see through her character because of his experience as the leader of the first major guild in the game Dragon Soul Continent. Players in the online world hide behind their characters, making their behavior even more secretive than in real life.  In such a virtual world, it was crucial to be sensitive to gather collective strength, as most players come to the game for enjoyment, not to treat it like work. To ask them to log in on time, raid on schedule, and refresh records to achieve success—if one couldn't balance and handle these aspects well, it would be difficult to manage.  Therefore, observing the emotions and inner thoughts of one's companions was very important for a guild leader like Rhode. Now, Lijie's behavior clearly showed her lack of reliance, making the girl very insecure. Rhode could also see that losing her companions had a significant impact on her, not just because familiar people had left her side but also due to a sense of uncertainty and fear about the future.  During the previous battle, Rhode had taken the time to observe the girl. She did everything very well, applying healing spells to her companions in the shortest time, quickly dispelling their toxins, and the protective shield she cast on Rhode was timed to the second. Her abilities were quite outstanding for a support class.  Moreover, at that time, she was confident with a clear goal, unfazed and undaunted by danger. But now, this trembling girl had lost all her previous confidence. There was only one reason for this. Chapter 9 Departure  Looking at the young girl in front of him, Rhode let out a sigh. "Lydia, the person who should be most worried right now is you. From last night until now, you haven't had a proper rest."  Hearing the words "last night," Lydia's body suddenly shrank, as if she had once again remembered that incident. Despite this, the girl stubbornly bit her lip and then shook her head.  "No... I..."  "Slap!"  Before Lydia could finish speaking, Rhode had already raised his hand and delivered a heavy slap to her face.  What was he doing?!  Clutching her reddened cheek, Lydia couldn't believe it and opened her eyes wide in surprise, looking at Rhode in front of her. Yet, the young man just quietly watched her and then spoke.  "I can understand what you're thinking right now."  Hearing this calm statement, almost devoid of any emotional fluctuations, a surge of anger immediately erupted from deep within Lydia. She lowered her hand and clenched her fists tightly, as if she wanted to refute Rhode's irresponsible remarks. However, Rhode's next words completely drained her of the energy to do so.  "Just because you are different, you feel guilty for being able to survive. For a half-angel like you, such thoughts are not necessarily correct."  "!!"  Lydia was taken aback upon hearing this. She instinctively crossed her arms in front of her and took two or three steps back until she hit a large tree behind her and stopped. But even then, Lydia still didn't pay it any mind.  She just stared at the man in front of her, opened her mouth, but could not say anything.  How could he possibly know? No, it was impossible. She had never told him, and even within the mercenary group, only a few knew about this.  "How did you..."  "Your eyes."  Rhode extended a finger.  "Your eyes reflect a golden radiance under the light, which is the mark of an 'Emissary of Light,' an angel. But unlike pureblood angels, the light in your eyes is not dazzling, and this is the part that is obscured by your human heritage—is that not so?"  The girl did not speak.  Although she did not respond, Rhode had already confirmed that his guess was not wrong. The young girl standing before him was indeed a half-angel. In fact, he had been observing Lydia for some time. As a top player, throughout his long gaming career, Rhode was already familiar with judging opponent attributes through equipment and features.  This was not only useful in boss battles to formulate the most suitable tactics in the shortest time but also in PVP combat to take the initiative. It could be said that this was a skill that all seasoned players would inevitably master.  In fact, after Rhode and Lydia were rescued, he began to consciously observe the young girl, and soon he noticed her true identity. Although she was only a half-blood, the powerful healing and damage resistance abilities of angels did not disappear, which was why Lydia was able to survive after being thrown from the airship.  Lydia herself must have been very clear about this, which is why she was so depressed.  "So I said, I can understand your thoughts," Rhode shrugged his shoulders. "You clearly know why you were able to survive, but it's not luck; it's because of the differences between you and others that led to this outcome, and you can't accept it... If possible, you even wish you were just an ordinary human, facing death like your companions, instead of cunningly surviving."  "....................."  Lydia lowered her head, her hands tightly clutching her skirt hem.  "But this is not something you can decide."  Looking at Lydia's slightly trembling shoulders, Rhode's tone became much gentler.  "You can't decide your birth, nor can you stop all this. It's something beyond your power, never regret what you can't do."  "So............"  Lydia finally spoke.  "...What should I do?"  "This is your path, you should choose for yourself."  Hearing this, Lydia was silent for a moment, then she raised her head.  "I understand, thank you, Mr. Rhode."  "Don't mention it."  "......... But, that slap really hurt..."  Although the process was somewhat "violent," in the end, Lydia stepped out of the shadows of losing her companions and self-blame. When the sun rose the next day, the blonde girl's face no longer bore the previous sadness, replaced instead by her usual gentle smile.  This surprised Mays, who had woken up without any clue what had happened. He curiously looked at one and then the other, and finally, a meaningful smile emerged towards Rhode— As to what that meant, no one knew.  However, before the fat merchant could satisfy his curiosity, Rhode's words immediately plunged him into the abyss.  "I think, it's time to set off."  Set off?  This word sent a shiver down the well-fed, burping fat merchant who had just woken up from breakfast. He then remembered he wasn't in his comfortable and warm room but in this endless and dangerous forest...  Right, they weren't out here for a picnic, that damned wind serpent, and that damned captain...  Forget it, forget it, it's pointless to talk about these things now.  The most important thing is—how are they going to get out of this damned forest?  Thinking of this, Mays hurriedly looked up at Rhode.  Since the young man said he had a way, then there must be a very careful plan, after all, they were in the deep mountains, and it wasn't impossible to get lost, not to mention the many fierce beasts lurking within—  That was essential knowledge for wilderness survival, and he had to pay attention, making sure not to miss a single word, lest he died here due to negligence, which would be a great loss.  With this in mind, Mays slapped his face hard to dispel the last trace of sleepiness and then watched Rhode carefully as he stood up from the ground, casually dusted off the dirt on his legs, moved his wrists, and finally said.  "Let's go."  .......................................  "...... Wait, wait, Mr. Rhode!"  The fat merchant almost seemed to be sitting on a chair with nails facing upwards as he "sprang" up.  "Where are we going?"  "Northeast, there's a town. Once we get there, the rest of the journey will be much easier."  "Isn't there anything we need to pay attention to?"  "Nothing special to note."  It was not surprising for Rhode to say this. After all, as the newbie gathering area of the Dragon Soul Continent, the Paphield region had been thoroughly explored by players, especially under the influence of online novels. At the beginning of the game, many players deliberately ventured into uninhabited, dangerous, or hard-to-reach areas in hopes of finding legendary artifacts that could dominate the game. Then they could wield powerful weapons, be invincible, and create a mighty force, and eventually unify the continent...  Of course, reality is always cruel. Despite the relentless efforts of the players, some very rare and well-attribute equipment were indeed found, but none met the players' standards of "With the artifact in hand, I have the world."  After all, that standard was too high.  Although for Mays, this place was full of dangers, and every step could be fatal, for Rhode, this area was as familiar as his own backyard. In the game, as a guild leader, Rhode often brought newbies here to level up, so he knew where there were more monsters, where there were fewer, what quest equipment was suitable for which profession, and where the attributes were suitable for the most efficient training, etc.  These were all second nature to Rhode, and even if he was randomly thrown somewhere, he could find his way out with his eyes closed.  Therefore, for him, there was naturally nothing special to remind, and as for Mays? Rhode had done the quest to protect merchants hundreds if not a thousand times in the game, how could he care?  Hearing Rhode's answer, Mays' face immediately drooped like a frostbitten eggplant. He obviously didn't understand Rhode's thoughts, but this was too careless, and he began to reflect on whether he had made a wrong decision. After thinking about it, this young man was severely injured in the mountains. If he hadn't been injured, it would have been acceptable to be so casual. But now that he was injured, to be so careless...  Wasn't that seeking death?  Although deep down he was beginning to regret it a bit, there's an old saying that one rides a tiger only to find it hard to get off. For Mays, there was no other way out.  So, with no other choice, he clenched his teeth and followed the two, heading deeper into the forest.  Under the bright sunshine, the Silvermoon Forest was very peaceful, with sunlight filtering through the gaps in the leaves, casting specks of light on the ground. The crisp chirping of birds occasionally broke the silence, and in the underbrush, one could even see the traces of wild rabbits. The scene before them was so peaceful that even the originally tense fat merchant began to relax.  No longer as suspicious and uneasy as before.  Rhode walked at the front. Although it wasn't easy to walk through a forest without paths, his figure was incredibly agile as he weaved through the forest, neither vines nor plants with hooked stems could hinder his movement. Just watching his figure, it was hard to imagine that he had been seriously injured before.  Lydia, following closely behind, was also quick. It was clear that she was accustomed to this kind of outdoor action and living. Despite wearing an inconvenient long robe, Lydia still followed Rhode steadily, occasionally speaking up to remind the merchant behind her to be careful of the path underfoot.  And the deeper they went, the more amazed Lydia felt inside. Although it appeared that Rhode's direction was quite arbitrary—instead of going straight, he would sometimes turn left or right, occasionally taking a big detour—from the surface, one would assume he was leading them aimlessly. But few noticed that under Rhode's guidance, what was originally a forest full of obstacles revealed a flat path as if it had always been hidden within the forest, waiting for people to discover its existence.  Lydia had once heard her team leader mention that this was a very high-level skill. After all, it is incredibly difficult for ordinary people to find their way in the forest. Only elves in harmony with nature and rangers who had been active in the deep mountains for many years could master this skill. She had seen it personally once.  At that time, her team had lost their way in the forest, but the elf who came to their aid did not follow the existing paths but chose a completely opposite direction to move forward. At that time, Lydia was very worried.  But in the end, they left the forest quite smoothly, and it was then that Lydia learned this skill from her team leader. But...  Looking at Rhode's figure, Lydia tilted her head with some confusion. According to her leader, such a skill can only be mastered by experienced elves and rangers. Ordinary elves also have the ability to communicate with nature, but they can't take this step.  But looking at Rhode, he did so with such ease. He had never stopped to communicate with the plants around him, which meant he should not be an elf. But...  He doesn't look like a ranger, does he? Although Lydia hadn't dealt much with rangers, she knew that rangers' main weapons were bows, but looking at Rhode, he had never used a bow since she first saw him...  Who exactly was he?  At this moment, Lydia grew more and more puzzled in her heart.  Rhode stopped.  Through the bushes, he could clearly see the clear lake water not far away, which was the center of Silvermoon Forest, Moonlight Lake.  In the game, this place was considered a midway resting camp for players.  "It's fantastic!"  Seeing the clear water in front of him, Mays unconsciously licked his dry lips. Although they hadn't walked for too long since setting off, to the always pampered merchant, it felt like several days of hardship. Seeing such a good place to rest, the fat merchant immediately strode forward, intending to rest by the lake.  But just as he began to move, Rhode's hand pressed on the merchant's shoulder.  Mays looked puzzled at the young man in front of him, but Rhode said nothing. He only extended a finger, made a silencing gesture, and then pointed ahead.  Mays looked in the direction of Rhode's finger with confusion, and then his complexion turned extremely pale.  Because under the shadow by the lake, a white giant wolf was quietly lying there, resting with its eyes closed. Chapter 10: Finding a Way in the Forest  As a merchant who had traveled far and wide, Meis had certainly seen wolves before. However, he could swear to the heavens that he had never seen a wolf of such size in his life. Judging by its size alone, this giant wolf was as tall as a man. Its thick fur glistened, and at the moment, it was leisurely squinting its eyes, basking in the warm afternoon sun. Its sturdy tail swung back and forth behind it, looking very relaxed.  At this moment, Lijie had already shut her mouth, quietly following behind Rod. As a mercenary, Lijie of course knew how terrifying and dangerous these beasts could be. Although she wasn't as nervous as the fat merchant, to the point of not daring to breathe loudly, the girl was also casting her gaze towards Rod, waiting for his command.  Rod was also pondering. The Silver Wolf "Moon Soul," a level ten elite, was not a boss-level creature, but it was still troublesome. After all, on the Dragon Soul Continent, aside from humanoid creatures, the danger levels of monsters were divided into three categories: wild beasts, giant beasts, and magical beasts. Wild beasts were ordinary creatures, while giant beasts were those that had grown huge and fierce from living a long time, or had been stimulated in some way.  When they awakened their own soul power, they would evolve into magical beasts. By then, they would not only rely on their bodies to fight but would become even more difficult to deal with. Although the Silver Wolf in front of them was not as high in threat level as the previous Wind Serpent Lord, for Rod, killing it was not difficult, but...  Thinking of this, Rod subconsciously glanced around. If this had been in the game, Rod would not have minded casually slaying the opponent for some experience and materials. However, this was not a game, and there were only three of them. Lijie was just a spirit mage and did not have the ability to protect herself.  As for Meis, he was even less capable in combat. In such a situation, it was better to avoid trouble if possible. With this thought, Rod made a hand gesture, then turned and walked in another direction. After all, Lake Moonlight was not small; there was no need to take shortcuts and do thankless tasks.  Seeing his actions, Lijie and Meis exchanged glances, then followed behind Rod, intending to leave. Unfortunately, it seemed that luck was not on their side. "Crack." Just as the fat merchant turned around, he suddenly slipped, fell heavily to the ground, and crushed a branch underneath him.  At that moment, Rod, who had been walking in front, immediately turned his head and raised his right hand. Soon, accompanied by a crisp chirping sound, a green figure shot out from his hand, pouncing towards the back of the two people. "Boom!" With the sound of impact, a low howl came from behind them, and Lijie and Meis turned their heads to see, to their surprise, the black giant wolf that should have been a distance away was now behind them. Its massive body lay sideways on the ground, seemingly hit by some external force.  Then, a shadow flashed past the two. The moment the fat merchant fell, Rod knew something was wrong. After all, in the Silver Moon Forest, these giant wolves' keen senses were ranked in the top three. Luckily, Rod had encountered situations caused by NPC-like stupidity more than once in the game, and those experiences came into play now.  Although Rod's perception was not high enough to lock onto these giant beasts, he made a judgment based on his familiarity with the giant wolves. Even though the "Moon Soul," currently at rest, was unlikely to immediately attack them, it had definitely noticed their presence. With the characteristics of these giant wolves, they would probably quietly follow behind, waiting to attack after dark. They could afford to wait, but Rod could not.  Instead of being passively engaged with these creatures later, it was better to take the initiative and control the situation. Rod's judgment was very correct. The Moon Soul had not expected the opponent to launch an attack so quickly. Faced with the soul bird that was pouncing on it, it reacted instinctively but was still a moment too slow.  The green soul bird hit it precisely, and the shockwave from the impact sent it flying away. As the black giant wolf lay on the ground, not yet recovered from the shock, Rod, who had activated "Shadow Flash," was already at its side. He looked intently at the giant wolf before him, then extended his right hand. "Cage!" (Elven language: Transform)  The green bird flew back to his hand, turning into a card, and its color instantly changed from green to white. Without another glance, Rod turned his hand around, grasping the card tightly, and thrust it towards the Moon Soul's right hind leg. A white beam of light instantly pierced the Moon Soul's leg, nailing it heavily to the ground, and at that moment, a snow-white longsword had already appeared in Rod's hand.  The silver wolf let out a painful howl, its eyes wide, staring hatefully at the despicable human in front of it, trying to stand up. Just as it managed to steady itself, it swayed, forced to stabilize again. At that moment, Rod's second strike arrived.  Rod, who had seen the silver wolf's movements, secretly relaxed, knowing that the elites' most significant trait was their incredible speed. If he could not disable that trait right away, a tough battle would ensue. Now, with one of its hind legs crippled, the silver wolf could no longer rely on speed for battle as before, making things much simpler.  Although it had lost a hind leg, the silver wolf did not panic. It stared at its target, and as Rod's sword thrust forward, it also raised its front paw and swung it heavily at Rod. Although the silver wolf had counterattacked, Rod, who had anticipated its move, was not panicked. Instead, he flipped his right hand, and the white sword's edge slid along the wolf's paw, drawing a streak of blood.  As the silver wolf retracted its paw in pain, what it saw was only the sword's edge in front of it, even more dazzling than the sunlight. A critical attack! The dancing Shattered Blade pierced the giant body, effortlessly tearing through the tough fur. Accompanied by a painful howl, the black giant wolf flew into the air, hit a small tree, and then fell back to the ground.  Half of its body had been torn open by a bloody wound, revealing white bones and slowly oozing innards. The sight was indeed nauseating. Even Rod, who had planned to deliver the final blow, frowned. After all, in games, critical attacks were represented by data and not such vivid scenes. Although he had seen something similar in the battle with the Wind Serpent, such things were never easy to stomach.  The black giant wolf had reached a critical point after being hit by the soul bird and Rod's targeted attack. Its once-threatening howling had now turned into a low whine. It struggled to support its body, trying to stand up again. But Rod did not give it the chance. With a swift motion, he plunged the Star Scar into its brain, decisively taking its life.  Although it seemed lengthy, in reality, only a minute or two had passed. To Lijie and Meis, what they saw was the silver wolf being knocked to the ground, and then Rod appeared beside it, ending its life with a few swift strokes. This surprised them greatly. After all, this was a giant wolf, not so easy to deal with.  Lijie knew that even her mercenary group, even when fully staffed, would probably have a hard time killing a giant wolf so easily. But looking at Rod's performance, it was as if he was not killing a wolf but a chicken!  As for the fat merchant, his feelings were even more complicated. He knew what his fall meant and feared the wolf would notice their presence. He had guessed the process but not the outcome. Indeed, the silver wolf had noticed them, but before it could act on its appetite, it tragically became a corpse...  Although the danger had passed, the fat merchant still felt uneasy deep down, anxiously looking at the young man not far away. He understood it was his fault. What if the other party turned against him and left him here? Under normal circumstances, he wouldn't worry about these problems, as those surrounding him were guards hired with money, and he wasn't concerned about making small mistakes. But now it was different; this young man was not a guard or a mercenary. Their relationship was entirely equal, and if he became displeased, he could leave the merchant behind.  If that happened, it would be the end for him! "This... I... I didn't..." Thinking of this, the fat merchant felt a cold sweat on his back. He licked his cracked lips, trying to say something, but he couldn't speak.  At that moment, he saw Rod stand up, turn around, and look at him calmly. "Be careful when you walk." The fat merchant realized that apart from nodding, there was nothing else he could do... Chapter 11: The Lingering Shadow  Originally, Rod planned to rest near Moonlight Lake for a moment before continuing on his journey, but after encountering the giant wolf, he had to change his mind. Considering that the bloody smell of the corpses might attract more unnecessary trouble, Rod finally chose a relatively flat highland upstream of Moonlight Lake as the campsite when the sun set.  After dinner, Rod once again took on the role of a sentry. Although this was harsh on his body, considering that he was the only one among the three who was most familiar with the environment of the Silver Moon Forest, and also the only one with combat ability, it was something that had to be done.  Although the fat merchant Meis also volunteered to help, looking at his obese body, Rod and Lijie didn't say much, but their eyes fully revealed their attitudes.  So the fat merchant, who wanted to cry but had no tears, had nothing better to do than to sit beside and boringly sort out the gear they had salvaged from the wreckage of the airship.  Of course, Lijie was also not idle; at this moment, she was kneeling beside Rod, placing her hands on his left shoulder.  "AliyMia." (Dragon language: Heal)  With the girl's crisp chanting, a faint white light emerged from her palms and slowly enveloped Rod's body.  In the Dragon Soul Continent, casters generally use Dragon language to cast spells, as since the creation of the world, nearly seventy percent of magic has been passed down in the form of Dragon language and was widely adopted by humans in the era of great magic.  The remaining part is made up of Angel language, Elf language, Demon language, and Undead language. As the races that were originally created and protected by the progenitor dragons, they also inherited the dragons' magical talent and long lifespans.  This also became the dividing line of the social classes on the continent, whether in the Night Country (Country of the Dark Night Dragon), the Light Country (Country of the Light Dragon), or the Law Country (Country of the Judging Dragon), no matter what political system they adopt, their highest leaders are inevitably the holders of the Dragon Soul of the five great dragons.  Next are the non-humans, mainly angels, elves, demons, and undead, followed by humans.  Of course, due to different political systems, the composition of each country's classes is not quite the same.  As a monarchy, the class system of the Night Country is relatively strict, and there are no humans among its leaders.  In the Light Country, which practices parliamentary democracy, half of the senior members of the parliament are humans.  In the Law Country, the upper class of angels, elves, and humans is quite balanced, each occupying one-third. This is because the Law Country, which is ruled by religious authority, believes in the path of balance.  To them, balance is the perfect choice.  Rod knew the situation of this continent like the back of his hand and was worried about what would happen next.  In the game, players are, after all, players. If they cannot play, they can simply take off the helmet and walk away.  But now, it's different. He has become a part of this continent; facing the disaster that is about to happen, what should he do?  "Mr. Rod... Mr. Rod?"  "What's the matter?"  Lijie's voice woke Rod from his thoughts, and he looked up at the girl in front of him.  After that, Lijie finally returned to her usual self, although a trace of worry occasionally appeared between her brows, it was a lot better compared to the gloomy expression that seemed as though she was on the brink of suicide.  "It's like this." Lijie shook her head carefully, glancing at Meis, who was sitting by the fire with an expression as if he had been bitten by a snake, and spoke in a low and serious tone.  "During the previous battle... with the Wind Serpent, I felt something."  "Oh?" Hearing this, Rod raised his eyebrows. "What kind of something?"  "I felt a dark aura from that Wind Serpent Lord," Lijie said, biting her lower lip. "But, this aura is very faint, not like what a dark attribute creature should have... Mr. Rod, Wind Serpents aren't dark creatures, are they?"  Of course not; Wind Serpents belong to the wind elemental creatures and have no close relationship with dark elements.  "Are you sure?"  "Yes, I'm sure."  Hearing the girl's confident and affirmative answer, Rod couldn't help falling into thought.  He, of course, knew what happened during this period in history. Wind Serpent flocks continuously attacked the merchant ships on the Wind Tide Trade Route, causing considerable losses. The Light Country, after investigating, claimed that it was the nomadic tribes living on the southern border of Paphield, under the rule of the Dark Country, who directed and manipulated it.  Not long after that, the Light Country launched a military attack on that area, driving out and slaughtering the inhabitants.  As for the reaction of the Night Country to this action by the Light Country, they quickly dispatched troops to attack the Light Country's garrison, reclaiming the land they claimed as their own, and using this as a fuse, launched a full-scale invasion of the Light Country.  This piece of history occurred during the open beta period, and at that time, Rod and other players were busy getting familiar with the new environment, new systems, leveling up, and did not delve too much into this background.  By the end of the open beta and the official start of the game, with a large influx of players, the Light Country and the Night Country had already broken out in all-out war.  As for what exactly happened, players had different opinions.  Some people thought it was a tragedy that the Light Country tried and failed to recover its territory, while another faction of conspiracy theorists believed that it was the Night Country deliberately provoking and starting the war to achieve the purpose of expansion.  And many others believed that the Night Country had long coveted the Light Country, and this was a loophole caused by the Light Country's mishandling—of course, players have no stance, and it all depends on personal preferences.  As for these claims, Rod believed they all had some truth— the southern border region was rich in crystal mines, an important resource for any country, and the Light Country had no reason to let go.  And the Dark Night Dragon Ieon, who ruled the Night Country in that era, was indeed a very strong ruler. Even until the mid-war period, even the most cunning, shameless, and rogue players found it difficult to take advantage of him.  It was even rumored that he was not an NPC but a character played by a member of the game company.  As for the last claim, after all, during the war, the performance of the Light Country's parliament could only be described as pig-like teammates, which caused the players to complain. In the end, there were even bizarre scenes where players of the same faction actively defected to the Night Country to fight against the Light Country, which shows how tragic the situation was at that time.  But now it seems that the second faction's conspiracy theory is closer to reality.  Lijie's feeling couldn't be wrong, as a creature of the light element, angels are very sensitive to dark elements. Her being half-blooded should not be far off.  So, the attacks of the Wind Serpent flock on the Wind Tide Trade Route were indeed premeditated by the Night Country, as a precursor to a full-scale attack on the Light Country?  Things didn't seem simple.  "Lijie, don't tell anyone about this."  "Alright, Mr. Rod."  Hearing Rod's answer, Lijie nodded, withdrew her hands, and after carefully checking Rod's wounds again, a smile appeared on her fair face.  "Your wounds have also healed a lot, if it goes on like this, you should be able to recover in about five or six days."  "Thank you."  Rod nodded to the girl in gratitude, then lowered his head to look at the system information that appeared in front of him.  The health of his body had begun to gradually recover its green color, and it would not be too long before he could move freely again.  And now, there was still a lot of things to do in front of Rod.  What should he do first?  Rod frowned and fell into thought...  Meanwhile, at the site of the airship crash, two figures slowly walked out from the woods.  "Is this the ship you mentioned?"  The leading man spoke coldly, wearing a beautiful white streamlined armor with patterns carved by shiny gold lines. If Rod were here, he would recognize that this was the insignia of an officer of the Light Country's border defense force.  The person standing behind the man was wrapped in a black cloak, his appearance indiscernible, and in response to the man's question, he merely nodded his head.  "They killed my messenger."  The hoarse voice echoed in the night forest, giving an eerie and chilling feeling.  "To be killed by such a group of filthy and incompetent mercenaries, it seems your pets are really incapable."  "It's your fault!" The voice of the man in the black cloak suddenly rose. "If you could find me a higher-level... Dominant-level... no, Master-level lord, I wouldn't have to use such low-level creatures!"  "What a joke, Dominant-level?" The man snorted coldly. "What do you take us for? We're only responsible for providing resources; you have to handle your own affairs. If we could take care of everything, what would we need you for?"  Saying this, the man paused, then softened his tone. "How long will it take for you to act again?"  "At least half a month, do you think it's easy to find a Wind Serpent flock that can be manipulated?"  "I'll give you ten days, and we'll double the payment."  Hearing the other party's complaints, the man's expression darkened, and he reached into his bosom, took out a purse, and threw it over.  "In ten days, I want you to start acting again."  The purse fell to the ground, making a heavy metal clinking sound. The man in the black cloak bent down, reached out with a withered hand to open the purse, then closed it immediately.  "Alright, ten days, I'll keep the promise."  "I hope you understand that no third person will know about this."  "Of course I understand... By the way, looking at the condition of this ship, it seems that two or three rats have run away, do you need help dealing with them?"  "No need." The man waved his hand. "I have my own way."  Hearing his answer, the man in the black cloak laughed coldly. "Very well, then I'll see what you can do."  A dense shadow suddenly appeared from the ground, enveloping the man in the black cloak, and then disappeared.  As he watched the place where the man disappeared, the man's face showed obvious disgust. "Greedy undead, one day even your bones will turn to ash!"  After a cold snort, the man turned around, with a thoughtful expression on his face, glanced at the surrounding forest, then placed one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other to his mouth, blowing a loud whistle.  Soon, a gryphon circled down from the sky and landed on the ground.  At the same time, three figures emerged quietly from the depths of the woods.  The man glanced at them, then mounted the gryphon.  "Go find those three rats and get rid of them."  Then, he coldly issued the command. Chapter 12: The Willpower Ring  Shadows flitted through the forest, occasionally splitting up before coming together again.  "Found anything?"  "There are residual traces in the eastern direction. It's very likely our target, and judging by the time, it should be no more than a day old."  "They move so fast. Continue the mission, and be cautious. The one we're after can take down the lord of the wind serpents. Don't underestimate them."  "Yes!"  After conversing, the three shadows once more merged into streaks of black and disappeared into the depths of the jungle, their movements silent, not even startling the birds perched in the trees.  After the shadows had left, a quiet green bird perched on a tree branch finally spread its wings and flew high into the sky.  "Are we being followed?"  Hearing the report from the soul bird, Rhode's expression darkened slightly.  At this moment, the translucent green soul bird that had been sitting quietly on his shoulder was shaking its head and stretching its wings, looking no different from an ordinary bird.  Only its translucent body and the elemental glow surrounding it revealed that this bird was not a living creature.  Summoning the soul bird for surveillance was a method Rhode came up with on the fly during their journey. Typically, players in teams venturing into the mountains would have a rogue or ranger for scouting, ensuring there were no dangers ahead on their path.  But Rhode, lacking such conditions, had to resort to using his own summoned creatures to scout ahead.  Fortunately, the soul bird not only had an advantageous field of view but also possessed the innate soul-sensing ability of spirit element creatures, allowing Rhode to feel relatively at ease.  Initially, Rhode summoned the soul bird to check if they had attracted any trouble after killing a level ten giant wolf. However, he inadvertently stumbled upon a bigger problem.  Although the soul sensing couldn't show the specific form of the target, it could judge through the strength of the soul's glow. From the speed of the pursuers, Rhode felt something was amiss. In the forest, those who could move so swiftly were generally rangers or spies—either way, professions that shunned the light.  Furthermore, the orderliness of their actions made it hard to believe they were ordinary adventurers. Was it a coincidence, or were they specifically targeting them?  Rhode didn't want to take risks. If they had approached openly, it would have been one thing, but these professions hidden in the shadows were the toughest to deal with.  Moreover, the reminder from Lize made him feel that there was something fishy about the situation. If these people harbored hostile intentions, it was hard to imagine how things would unfold.  However, when Rhode saw Lize beside him, he couldn't help but brighten up. He already had an idea.  "Mr. Rhode, where should we go next?"  Handing a water bottle to the fat merchant sitting beside her, red-faced and sweating profusely, Lize asked.  Rhode had not said much, but the task of looking after the fat merchant had always fallen to Lize. According to the girl, her mercenary group had accepted the commission to protect this gentleman, so even if she was the only one left, she had to continue the mission as long as it was not yet complete.  And of course, the merchant named Mets was extremely grateful, but with his current breathless state, it seemed unlikely he would last much longer without rest.  "Mr. Rhode... I'm so tired... Can we rest... for a moment?" Mets, who had slumped to the ground as soon as Rhode stopped, clutched his briefcase as if it were a treasure, wiping the sweat from his face with a handkerchief, shining brightly under the sunlight like a giant light bulb.  "Holy Spirit bless... I haven't walked... this much in... years," he said between heavy breaths, followed by a severe cough that even shook his chubby face.  After a while, he recovered his senses.  "I feel... I feel like I'm going to die from all this walking!"  "Rest for five minutes."  Rhode glanced at the sky, then calculated the remaining distance and time in his mind before giving the order.  Upon hearing him, the fat merchant who had been sitting on the ground let out a cry before lying back down. Lize also exhaled lightly and sat down on a nearby rock.  Afterward, they encountered no particular dangers. With the soul bird leading the way, Rhode smoothly guided them away from many hazardous areas. Though this meant missing out on chances for rare equipment, Rhode was not concerned. In this world, unlike the game where players were plentiful, ordinary adventurers did not venture into forests and mountains so carelessly. He could always return to collect treasures after escorting the two out of the mountains.  However...  Rhode looked up at the mountain range nearby and stood up.  "Lize."  "Yes, Mr. Rhode, what are your instructions?"  "I'll go ahead and check things out. After resting for five minutes, take Mr. Mets up the mountain. Do you see that white rock? Go there, then into the shadows, and you'll find an abandoned mountain path. Wait for me there, I'll arrive shortly."  Lize looked up, following the direction Rhode was pointing to, and quickly spotted the white rock on the side of the mountain. She turned to Rhode, puzzled about how he knew of this place.  However, the girl just opened her mouth but didn't ask. After traveling together for a few days, she realized the man before her was highly reliable. Though she didn't know what he was up to, she nodded and watched Rhode turn and leave.  Rhode, of course, had his own plan. The stone was the entrance to Zennal Mountain Path. It was once a glorious trade route, carved through the mountain range by the ancestors of the northerners, connecting the plains with other regions, creating a moment of splendor.  But with the development of wind currents and the unobstructed sky evidently safer than the dangerous forests, the trade route was gradually abandoned, and those who relied on it for their livelihoods had long left in search of better lives, abandoning their homeland, until it reverted to wasteland.  The progress of civilization always renders past miracles meaningless, which is the same in any world.  But Rhode wasn't here to sightsee, appreciate nature, or contemplate philosophy.  He stopped in his tracks, and in front of him lay desolation.  And corpses.  Barely visible bones were nearly buried in dust, with only tattered leather armor and corroded weapons strewn about. This was the mercenary group known as "Tiger Fang," which had fallen victim to bandits and died here after a mutual defeat.  In the game, Rhode would first need to accept a quest from the mercenary guild, then follow clues to investigate their last commission, find this place according to the map, and then return with the token and treasures.  But that was in the game, where following procedures was necessary.  Even so, many veterans wouldn't make it so complicated; they would simply take the token and report back to the mercenary guild. This not only saved time but was also convenient and straightforward, avoiding many tedious steps.  But Rhode wasn't here to skip steps.  He walked deeper into the battlefield and immediately saw a skeleton lying against the mountain wall, dressed in corroded steel armor, with a black, rusty iron sword fallen beside it.  That was Rhode's target, the leader of the mercenary group.  Crouching in front of the bones, Rhode glanced at them and then reached in, quickly pulling out a mercenary badge—the token of the "Tiger Fang" group, essential for completing the commission.  Rhode carefully put it in his pocket, then looked down and found his target.  It was a dirty, worn ring on the skeleton's finger.  Rhode carefully removed the ring. At first glance, the ring seemed useless, no different from the scrap metal in a junkyard.  But the system prompt that appeared told Rhode otherwise.  [Black Iron Ring, unidentified, magical fluctuations detected]  "Resonance."  Rhode closed his eyes, held the ring in his right hand, and whispered. He then infused his soul power into it. The ring in his hand trembled slightly, and its faint magical fluctuations became clear. When he opened his eyes again, what lay in his palm was no longer the piece of junk from before.  Instead, a black ring engraved with ancient patterns rested quietly in his hand.  [Ring of Willpower, identified, can activate a willpower shield, lasts five minutes, immune to mental attacks, recharges in three days]  Done.  Rhode slipped the ring onto his right finger, relieved, and then looked around to ensure there were no more valuables. He turned and headed back to the mountain slope.  There, he could clearly see Lize and Mets struggling toward the white rock. The fat merchant clearly had no experience climbing mountains, gingerly following behind Lize. He looked like he would have begged to be carried up if it weren't for the gender difference and loss of face.  What a waste.  Rhode shook his head, about to go down and join them when the soul bird's alarm suddenly sounded in his mind.  "———!"  Rhode was startled and quickly looked toward the forest. He saw three shadows darting out from within.  This did not bode well! Chapter 13 The Ruins in the Mist  This time, the three silhouettes did not search for more traces because the two figures on the mid-mountain were an extremely obvious target. They just exchanged glances and quickly rushed toward the direction of the two. However, Rod's speed was not slow either. With a flash, he slid down from the mid-mountain, accompanied by a loud whistle, the soul bird that had been circling in the sky seemed to have received some kind of command and swooped down, charging at the three men in black.  "——!!" Faced with the sudden attack of the soul bird, the three men in black did not panic. They quickly formed a defensive formation. One person waved the twin swords in his hands and charged forward, while the other two continued toward the direction of Lijie and Mes without changing course.  Clearly, they had a clear division of labor and were very professional. They would not stop their steps for such a minor entanglement. If the opponent was really just an ordinary bird, indeed, they would not be able to stop them.  Unfortunately, that was not a physical entity.  Facing the cold blade, the green bird did not show any intention to dodge, but instead directly met it head-on. The man in black’s eyes revealed a hint of joy seeing this, but in the next moment, his expression turned to horror——because he clearly saw that the green bird actually passed through the sword edge and pounced straight at him!  Elemental creature!  The man in black was greatly shocked. He hurriedly twisted his body, narrowly avoiding the attack. Still, the soul bird passed through his shoulder, and the man in black felt as if half his body had fallen into an ice pit and lost sensation in an instant. The body that was trying to maintain balance staggered mid-air and then fell heavily to the ground, even the short sword in his hand flew out.  The other two fared no better. When the soul bird swept past them, they did not take it seriously. But soon, a bone-chilling cold wind followed, blowing across their bodies. The two felt their bodies become numb and stiff in an instant and had to stop their steps.  Although this strange discomfort quickly dissipated, the few seconds of delay allowed Lijie and Mes to reach the white stone. Seeing this, the leading man in black frowned and made a hand signal before pulling out a crossbow from his waist.  "What, what's happening?!" The fat merchant, who was already paralyzed from exhaustion halfway up the climb, stumbled under Lijie's guidance to the side of the white stone. Supporting himself on the stone wall beside him and gasping for air, before he could complain any further, suddenly several dark shadows brushed past the fat merchant and struck the stone wall beside him.  "Whoa!" Mes quickly crouched down holding his head, and Lijie also instinctively shrank her body and did not forget to pull the fat merchant out of the way, pushing him into the shadows to avoid further attacks.  "We must hurry." Just then, Rod appeared right behind them and spoke as he looked at the three dark figures not far down the mountain.  "Who, who are they? What happened? Why are they attacking us?"  "Probably spies." Although not too far away, the clear weather still allowed Rod to see that they were wearing the standard attire of spies, and the attire of spies under the guard of the Dragon Soul of Light was more or less the same across different countries. As for which country these people were from, that could only be known after killing them.  However, Rod currently did not have such strength. It was clear from the fact that even the special abilities of the soul bird could only freeze them for a few seconds. It was not that these people had too high a resistance to soul elemental attacks, but rather because his own level was too low, he could not achieve a better attack effect. Lingering was of no benefit.  "As for why they are attacking us, I think you can ask them yourself. Maybe if they're in a good mood, they'll tell you one or two things before you die."  Although Rod rarely made a joke, the fat merchant could not laugh. As a merchant who had been doing business for many years, he knew that those spies were not to be trifled with. If he fell into their hands, what would happen to him? Just thinking of the not-so-pleasant rumors circulating among his peers, he was already pale and sweating profusely. So although he was already too tired to feel his legs, he still forced himself to stand up and follow Rod towards the small path hidden behind the white stone.  The Zenal mountain trail was once a very glorious trade route; the wide road could accommodate two carriages side by side. But now it has been completely abandoned, with various rocks from both sides of the cliffs piling up on the road, making the originally spacious road rough and narrow.  The three stumbled forward but dared not stop. Rod occasionally looked back, but the situation had not improved—the footsteps of the pursuers behind them were getting clearer and clearer. If it wasn't for the terrain here, they would have been surrounded long ago.  "Mr. Rod! There's no way through!" Lijie's exclamation made Rod turn back, and indeed, the mountain path ahead was completely blocked by rolling stones, with no way to climb over or break through.  As expected.  Rod shook his head slightly. He had originally thought that doing this in the game was to force players to follow the system-set route, but now it seemed that was not the case———  Never mind, after all, this was not his original intention.  "Go to the right."  "Right?"  Hearing Rod's command, both were stunned, and they simultaneously looked towards the small path on the right, hesitating even more in their steps.  Although the main road was blocked, there was still a path nearby. What was most peculiar was that despite the clear skies, there was a dense fog in that path, and the sunlight passing through the thick mist brought an even more eerie atmosphere. Just looking at it made one feel that there must be something strange inside, and now, Rod was actually asking them to enter?  "Hurry up, there's no time." However, under Rod's urging, the two quickly entered the mist, and soon, their figures were completely obscured by the thick fog and disappeared from sight.  Seeing the two enter, Rod also breathed a sigh of relief, once again looking back. He then extended his right hand.  "Cage!"  The card that appeared in the center of his palm changed from green to white, and then the snow-white blade appeared again. Rod gripped the long sword and flung it at the cliff. The bright blade of light flew out from the sword, striking the unstable boulders above the cliff. Soon, under the loud rumbling, the shattered rocks and dust rolled down together.  By the time the three men in black arrived, Rod's figure had already disappeared into the depths of the mist, obscured by the smoke and debris.  "Damn it!" Staring at the chaotic mountain path in front of him, one man in black gritted his teeth and complained.  The road ahead was completely blocked by debris, making it impassable. Not to mention Rod's sword also triggered a chain reaction, and now the cliffs on both sides of the mountain path were trembling. Continuing on might be even more dangerous.  "What do we do?"  "There's nothing we can do." Another man in black stared intently at the now completely sealed path.  "We have to go back and report to the captain, send people to monitor all the nearby villages and towns. They must be planning to leave from the back. But I didn't expect, these guys really have some tricks."  "Elemental creature, is there a mage among them?"  "If there really is a mage, then it's not surprising. But based on our observations, there doesn't seem to be a mage among them."  As the two men in black exchanged opinions, another who had been silent and observing the traces on the cliff spoke up.  "One of them is a quite strong swordsman."  After saying this, the man in black turned his head.  "Let's go, these three targets are indeed not simple, but we haven't lost yet. Send the order down, immediately monitor the surrounding villages and towns. I believe they can't stay in the mountains without coming out."  For Rod and the others, the danger was not yet over.  "What is... this place?" The fat merchant stared blankly at everything in front of him. He thought he had seen everything after many years of traveling, but the experiences of the past few days told him that there were still many things in the world he did not know.  After passing through the dense fog, what appeared before them was a desolate and abandoned small town, completely enveloped in dense fog, making almost everything blurry. Even looking up at the sky, they could only see a gray expanse. It was no longer clear and bright, and the whole world looked dim and lightless, as if it were a completely different plane.  "This is the Ruins in the Mist," Rod casually replied as he followed from behind.  "As long as we get through here, we can reach the Alarak mountain pass, and then we can leave."  "But is this place... dangerous?"  Anyone with eyes could see that this place was not peaceful.  "Of course there's danger." Rod did not fully explain, the Ruins in the Mist in the game was the first ten-level five-person dungeon, and also the player's first dungeon. To say it was hard would not be accurate, but to say it was easy wouldn't be right either.  But for their group of three, it was very troublesome. After all, Rod was only level eight, and Lijie was only level six, and the merchant with only a combat power of five was not counted at all. In the end, it was essentially an eight-level summoner swordsman and a support class soloing a ten-level five-person dungeon———in the game, one would be considered a fool.  Rod was not a fool. In fact, it was only after seeing Lijie that he came up with this risky method. Otherwise, Rod would not have chosen this path———  And in fact, this path was now the safest. Comparing the risk probabilities.  "But as long as you follow my orders, there won't be too much risk. So............" Saying this, Rod turned his head to look at the blonde girl beside him.  "Lijie, it's up to you now." Chapter 14: Strategy for Two  "Me?" Hearing Rod's words, Lijie opened her eyes wide in surprise, and even Mes next to her opened his mouth in astonishment. As everyone knows, Spirit Masters on the Dragon Soul Continent are professions similar to pharmacists, doctors, and nurses. They are basically the support roles within a team, responsible for bandaging wounds, healing injuries, casting shields, and dispelling toxins, which are the most common tasks for a Spirit Master.  As for frontline combat? This kind of thing is probably unheard of!  "That's right." Rod nodded his head, the moment he stepped into this place, he seemed to have become the commander who once led teams to clear dungeons.  "In a moment, follow my command. This doesn’t require particularly complex techniques, but it does demand a high level of reaction and awareness from you. However, once you get used to it, I don’t think it will be too difficult... How is your control over energy right now? How many times can you use Sacred Radiance?"  Although he had roughly guessed her level through Lijie's previous healing spells, it was still better to confirm.  "I am a full-fledged Spirit Master, at the seventh layer of the outer circle. As for Sacred Radiance... it can only be used once a day, and it can last a full day... if my soul power is not consumed too much."  The classification of spellcaster professions is different from that of combat professions. In addition to professional levels, they also have divisions based on soul power, namely the outer circle, middle circle, and inner circle, with ten layers in the outer circle, seven in the middle, and three in the inner. This is because spellcasters believe their power comes from deep within their souls, and in common belief, the soul is seen by spellcasters as three intermingling circular existences. The deeper a spellcaster delves into their soul, the more powerful they become.  And Lijie's strength has already reached the seventh layer of the outer circle, which means that she is very likely to break through the limit of outer circle spellcasters and enter the ranks of the middle circle.  For a level six Spirit Master, this is truly rare.  But this made Rod even more confident.  "Good, remember, from now on, you don't need to cast Healing Light on me, even if I'm injured, it’s the same. Pay more attention to Mr. Mes, if he is in danger, give him a shield... Understood?"  "This... I understand, Mr. Rod."  Although Rod's words occasionally contained some terms that Lijie found inexplicable, she still understood his intentions after guessing and inferring, and she nodded slightly to show her understanding.  "Mr. Mes, how many days can our supplies last?"  "About three to four days." Holding his travel bag, the plump merchant thought for a moment and then answered, but his face carried a hint of solemnity.  "If we are sparing with our food..."  "Now is a good time to lose some weight."  If Rod had said this with a smile, then Mes might have taken it as a joke. Unfortunately, Rod's expression was very calm, without any hint of a smile, which made the plump merchant even more worried. He was about to say something else, clutching his travel bag, but Rod had already turned his head and issued an order to Lijie.  "Cast Sacred Radiance."  "Okay."  Faced with Rod's command, Lijie nodded slightly, then stretched out her hands and closed her eyes. Soon, a soft glow slowly emerged from the center of the girl's palms, the gentle white radiance spreading out in all directions. It might have been an illusion, but the plump merchant noticed that the thick fog that was originally close at hand began to retreat rapidly under the illumination of this radiance. After rubbing his eyes, he discovered that the surroundings, originally shrouded in dense fog, had now become much clearer.  Some ruins that could only be seen as vague shadows could now be clearly seen with broken walls and houses. This allowed everyone to breathe a sigh of relief; after all, clearer visibility is always safer.  "I'll go first, Lijie follow up, Mr. Mes you go last, don't stray too far from us, no matter what happens, don't act alone."  Silence reigned amidst the ruins.  The radiance full of positive energy dispelled the fog, but it did not dispel the danger that lurked within. Everyone slowly advanced under Rod's leadership, occasionally stopping to observe their surroundings before continuing—however, soon, Rod gestured with his hand, signaling for the two to stop moving.  If his memory was correct, they were already approaching the respawn point of the first wave of minor monsters.  Sure enough, not long after Rod stopped, several faint lights appeared in the mist ahead. They twinkled on and off, resembling eyes.  "What, what is that?"  Mes immediately tensed up.  "They are wraiths."  Rod extended his right hand and quickly, Star Trace appeared in his grasp.  "Be careful, they won't dare to come too close."  As soon as Rod finished speaking, everyone saw the fog in front of them suddenly contract and then spew out three strange creatures. They had humanoid forms but were wrapped in dense fog from head to toe. The three creatures stood together, and it was somewhat difficult to see their boundaries, only the three pairs of bright little eyes allowed people to confirm that these were not simply ordinary fog.  Perhaps even less simple.  "Lijie, cast Healing Light on the first one."  Healing Light? Hearing this command, a trace of confusion flickered in the girl's mind. That was a healing spell, why cast it on such a monster? However, this question was only a fleeting thought in Lijie's mind, and she quickly raised her right hand, casting Healing Light on the monster in front of her.  As a Spirit Master, Lijie's skills were quite good.  Healing Light is a mid-range healing spell, and as long as the target's position can be confirmed, it is not difficult to cast. For Lijie, it was even more effortless. Perhaps because the target was not a companion but a monster, the girl hesitated in her movements, but she still completed the spell quickly.  A stream of pure white light immediately appeared from the air and wrapped around the wraith. According to the original effect, the life enveloped by it would immediately recover from certain injuries and even invigorate spirits, belonging to the most basic of spells used by a Spirit Master.  But the wraith's reaction was completely unexpected to the girl; at the moment it was enveloped by the white radiance, the wraith let out a piercing scream that even she could hear clearly. Its originally standing body bent over as if punched, shaking continuously, and the mist enveloping its body disintegrated in that instant, melting away like snow under sunlight.  This greatly startled Lijie, who even subconsciously looked down at her own hands, unable to comprehend how she had released a spell with such destructive power.  Seeing the wraith's reaction, Rod remained very calm. After all, the positive energy produced by Healing Light was naturally the nemesis of negative energy entities like wraiths, especially since Lijie had half of a pure angel's bloodline. The positive energy condensed by angels differed in quality from that of ordinary humans. If the latter's positive energy was like scalding boiling water to a wraith, then the former's could be likened to high-concentration sulfuric acid. It was fortunate that Lijie was only a half-blood. If she were a pure angel, that wraith would have been obliterated long ago.  Lijie didn't understand why a healing spell would have such an effect, but in fact, players on the Dragon Soul Continent were quite aware of this. In their view, calling it "Healing Light" was merely a disguise; the essence of the spell was to release positive energy. However, this energy had a healing effect when encountering living beings, and for convenience, it was named as such, not indicating that it could only heal injuries.  In the early days of the Dragon Soul Continent, there was a joke among players: the most tragic thing for a necromancer was encountering a group of undead—because the spells of a necromancer were mostly derived from negative energy, and using them to attack undead creatures composed of the same negative energy would only have a healing rather than destructive effect.  This also made many former necromancers, who once dreamed of dominating the world with an army of the dead, shed tears as they had to learn some elemental spells to maintain their advantage over undead monsters—indeed, they sometimes also had to play the role of a healer.  Essentially, there wasn't much difference between necromancers and Spirit Masters; they mostly lived in environments where their abilities could not harm their own kind, only showing effect when encountering opposite attributes.  However, for necromancers, the chance of encountering living beings was relatively higher.  And for Spirit Masters, it wasn't until the mid-period of the war when darkness descended and the undead ran rampant that they shed the label of logistics personnel and became valiant warriors at the forefront.  Before that, the chance of a Spirit Master encountering undead was very low, and NPCs, unlike players, didn’t have access to so much information, so it was not surprising for them to stick to the rules.  But now was not the time to adhere to the rules.  "Attack the other two!" Rod's figure flashed, rushing towards the wraiths while giving orders to Lijie.  "Yes!"  Perhaps inspired by the scene in front of her, Lijie's response was also very spirited. Soon, two more surges of abundant positive energy descended from the sky, landing on the other two wraiths.  The soft light enveloped them, halting their attempts to advance. Taking advantage of this, Rod, who had activated Shadow Flash, had already reached the first wraith.  "———!" The wraith, scoured by positive energy, let out a shriek, and Rod in front of it became the target of their vented anger.  Quickly, the wraith in front lunged with a semi-transparent claw, "whooshing" at Rod. Although Lijie's power had weakened their defenses, their attack power had increased quite a bit, and if not handled carefully, it could lead to an unexpected defeat.  But for Rod, of course, he would not allow such an event to happen. His figure shifted, narrowly avoiding the wraith's extended claw, then his hand holding the pristine blade swiftly rotated, stabbing forward.  Critical attack!  Star Trace precisely hit the wraith's only semi-solid soul condensate within its ethereal body, causing the already tormented wraith under the positive energy light to let out a wail of despair. It desperately raised its claws, and then its body, already on the brink of collapse, completely lost form and dissipated into a pile of dust.  And at that moment, the other two wraiths also attacked. Chapter 15: Deep into the Ruins  "Phew..." Looking at the spirit dust scattered all over the ground, Rod wiped the beads of sweat on his forehead and felt somewhat exhausted. Along the way, the three of them had encountered quite a few ghosts – a total of about fifteen or sixteen. This wouldn't be much for a well-equipped team of five, but now Rod only had one combatant under his command. Naturally, he couldn't fight like he would in a normal dungeon run, finding a MT (Main Tank) to take the aggro while everyone else went all out with their damage output. Instead, he had to carefully lure each one over, then let Lijie cast positive energy to weaken the enemy's defense, followed by killing them as quickly as possible.  Since ghosts were at least level 10 elite monsters, even those undead weakened by having their defenses reduced were still difficult to deal with. To maximize the damage, Rod, apart from utilizing the attribute bonuses of the Stardust in his hand, could only aim to hit the enemy's vital points with every strike.  But humans are not machines. Even in a game, such high-demand attacks consume a lot of energy, not to mention that Rod was now using his own body. If he failed in the game, he could start over, but failure here could very likely lead to death.  This pressure made Rod feel almost unbearable. He lifted his head and looked at the ruins shrouded in mist ahead, and only after confirming that there were no more monsters for the time being, did he finally breathe a sigh of relief.  "Mr. Rod, do you want to rest for a bit?" The young girl following closely behind him looked worriedly at Rod. As a spirit master, she didn't quite understand the meaning behind each of Rod's actions, but she could still feel the pressure he was under.  "No... not now..." Rod shook his head. Although they had cleared the minor monsters in this area, he still had a faint sense of danger. He vigilantly watched his surroundings but could not figure out where this faint sense of crisis deep in his heart was coming from. According to the distance, they had not yet reached the territory of the BOSS, so they shouldn't encounter too much danger. Moreover, Rod was quite familiar with the distribution of undead creatures here. In theory, the monsters should have already been cleared.  So, where was this sense of danger coming from?  Rod looked around again but found nothing. Just then, the chubby merchant suddenly shouted.  "Ah!!"  "What's wrong?" Rod and Lijie quickly turned around, only to see Mace pale, clutching his travel bag with one hand and pointing with a trembling hand towards the thick fog behind him.  "Just now, there was a shadow there..."  "A shadow?" Lijie looked in the direction Mace was pointing but saw nothing in the fog besides the dim sunlight.  "There's nothing there..."  "Get down!!" At that moment, a light bulb went off in Rod's head; he finally understood where the danger was coming from. He shouted while forcibly pushing the girl's head down.  "Whoosh!" Almost at the same time, a dark shadow swiftly passed overhead. Rod could almost feel the icy claws grazing his scalp, even feeling a sharp pain.  Damn it!  At this moment, Rod's heart sank. He now knew what this sense of danger was – it was a gargoyle!  According to legend, the misty ruins were once a bustling and glorious town that was gradually abandoned following the decline of the trade routes. After that, a mage came here to save his beloved lover and chose to research forbidden death magic in this abandoned town. However, the research ended in failure, and the mage died as a result. But the death magic did not stop there, creating the dense fog and many undead creatures.  Among all the dangers in the dungeon, the gargoyle left by the mage to guard his relics was the most dangerous – a rare level 15 elite! If it were a team in the game, Rod would be very happy. Rare elites are indeed rare; sometimes you might not encounter one even after several dungeon runs. But now, he just felt a chill in his heart. The opponent was a level 15 rare elite and a flying monster at that. Not only was it agile, but it was also vastly different from the ghosts that relied on negative energy to condense into a form. At least Lijie's positive energy would not be effective against it.  Moreover, its body made of obsidian was exceptionally hard, and the damage that could be inflicted by ordinary attacks was very limited. It was clear that this was going to be a tough battle. Rod had run the misty ruins dungeon over thirty times in the game and had never seen a gargoyle, so he subconsciously forgot about this. But who would have thought that he would encounter one on his first visit here?  Was this good luck or bad luck?  But Rod had no mood to mull over such questions now because the danger was right in front of him. A direct confrontation was hopeless. After all, he was not yet level 10, and challenging a level 15 monster was almost an impossible task. Even with the bonuses from Stardust, his attack power was very limited.  "Let's go!" Without hesitating for too long, Rod immediately gave the order. He grabbed Lijie with one hand and shouted, "Follow me, keep your heads down, don't look up!"  Retreating was not an option; the only way was to find the gargoyle's control core and completely destroy it. Although escaping its attack range was also an option, Rod looked at his team's configuration and really couldn't find anyone who could easily lead the opponent away – it would be nice to have a ranger or a thief.  But now was not the time for complaints.  Under Rod's lead, Lijie and Mace kept their heads down and stumbled forward. The dense fog around them started to move again, clearly, their actions had attracted the attention of the ghosts. Four or five ghosts had drilled out of the fog and began to advance toward where the three of them were.  "Lijie, attack! Don't stop!"  "Yes!" Although casting spells while running was not easy for the girl, she still clenched her teeth and extended her right hand. Soon, three or four streaks of pure white brilliance emerged in the air and fell upon the ghosts. Following that, Rod immediately swung his sword and stabbed out. Accompanied by screams, those obstructing creatures soon turned to dust and vanished.  At that moment, a system prompt flashed before Rod's eyes.  [Experience points 1900/1800, can level up, level 8]  But Rod didn't have time to pay attention to this system prompt right now, as more and more ghosts were appearing from all directions. Although the holy light made them hesitant and slow, the numerical advantage compensated for this gap.  Compared to the less agile ghosts, the gargoyle didn't care about the holy light at all. Although it was also driven by negative energy, as the guardian of the mage, the gargoyle's hard obsidian exterior was enough to resist most of the holy forces' invasion.  After missing its attack earlier, it immediately identified the group as its target and followed closely behind the three, waiting for the moment to strike – compared to the undead that attacked instinctively, a man-made life form with a certain level of combat intelligence was indeed much more troublesome.  "Ouch!" Just then, Mace stumbled and fell hard to the ground.  The gargoyle, which had been waiting for a long time, immediately swooped down, its sharp claws striking lightning-fast at the fallen chubby merchant. When Mace turned around, all he saw was a shadow about to envelop his body.  "Oh my god..."  Although the gargoyle was indeed fast, and Mace had cooperated by closing his eyes, prepared to meet his end, its attack still fell short – a faint barrier shimmering with golden light appeared out of nowhere, blocking the gargoyle's sharp claws. Then several bright blades of light flew from the air, striking heavily on the gargoyle's body. With a series of loud "clap clap" sounds, the gargoyle, unable to stop its momentum, was sent flying backward, crashing heavily into the crowd of ghosts.  At that moment, Lijie had already half-dragged the fat merchant, who had been ready to bid farewell to this world and greet his relatives in the next, and continued to run forward.  "Here!" Rod finally shook off most of the undead under the "siege" of the ghosts, then looked up and quickly found his target – it was an abandoned church, the place where the mage had conducted his experiments. According to Rod's memory, the control center for the gargoyle should be there.  However, such a place was, of course, not easy to enter.  As Rod approached the church door, he felt a darkness before his eyes. He quickly activated his Shadow Flash to retreat, and then saw a dark gargoyle crouching at the spot where he had just stood, one of its hard claws smashing heavily into the ground, shattering the solid blue stone bricks.  "This is really bad." Rod cursed inwardly while quickly scanning the area and noticing that the original decorative stone statues on both sides of the church door had disappeared.  It was easy to guess where they had gone.  Two at once; it seems he could make a fortune if he bought lottery tickets today.  If he lives, that is.  "Get inside, find the control device!" Rod faced the gargoyle in front of him while issuing orders to Lijie and Mace.  "The ghosts probably won't bother you inside. I'll hold these two guys off, you take the opportunity to go in, find the control device, and destroy it. Watch out for traps."  "But... Mr. Rod, you..."  "This is an order." Rod coldly interrupted Lijie's words, then gripped Stardust and flung it forward. The white blade burst forth instantly, and the gargoyle screeched as it took flight, dodging his attack and also clearing the way to the church.  "Go now!" Chapter 16: The Talent Tree Opens  Black and white shadows crossed in the air, sparking bright flames.  "Oof!" Rhode quickly retreated, the pure white blade of his sword trembling non-stop. The tremendous impact from the blade shocked his upper body, causing him a faint pain.  Just like in Rhode's memory, the level fifteen gargoyles were indeed tough to deal with, especially when there were two of them.  The only upside was that these creatures did indeed possess some battle wisdom. Although that would not be a good thing on a normal day, right now the surplus of artificial intelligence made their movements less threatening.  Especially the gargoyle that had previously taken a hit from the Shattered Blade, now it immediately screamed and retreated upon seeing the white light emanating from Rhode's sword. Although the other one had not been hit, seeing its companion's actions, it also hesitated, giving Rhode a chance to catch his breath.  But this was only temporary.  Holding Starfall, Rhode clenched his teeth as he looked up at the two gargoyles hovering in the sky. Although the gargoyles were wary of his Shattered Blade and dared not attack aggressively, Rhode was certain that they would not let him off easily.  Although both sides were in a stalemate for now, this situation would not last long.  Upon reaching level eight, Rhode had already maxed out the proficiency of Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 4/4. Although the soul power consumed by Shattered Blade had been reduced after leveling up, frequent use could still cause problems.  Moreover, this was not the final battle. Rhode had to conserve some strength to deal with potential emergencies that could arise at any time.  After all, he was the only one among the three with fighting capabilities. If he exhausted all his strength here, it would be very troublesome.  Meanwhile, the two gargoyles did not just stare at Rhode. Instead, they dived back and forth, extending their claws to attack Rhode, and promptly retreated whenever they sensed his counterattack intentions.  This wheel-style battle put a high demand on physical strength. However, for the two alchemical beings entirely driven by magic, this was not an obstacle.  But for Rhode, it was entirely different.  Sweat slowly emerged on Rhode's forehead. His body had gradually grown weary from the continuous defenses earlier.  However, Rhode could not back down. He knew that with his current abilities, it was nearly impossible to take on two gargoyles at once, so he could only place his hopes on Lize. After all, there wasn't anything particularly dangerous to guard against in the church, but...  Did I forget to remind them to be wary of the protective magic formation?  After a moment of thought, Rhode shrugged his shoulders and refocused his attention on the gargoyles before him.  After all, no one would die.  "Arghhh!!" Accompanied by a "miserable" scream, Mess collapsed on the ground, convulsing non-stop.  "I'm dying! Help! Help!"  "It's just an electric shock! You're not dead, Mr. Mess."  While rummaging through the dusty, cobweb-covered old table, covered with time-eroded unrecognizable clutter, Lize nonchalantly healed Mess's pain with a healing spell without even looking back, then returned to her search.  Although a typical mage would cast many protective spells in their room to guard their secrets, this church was, after all, "in disrepair" for a long time. Plus, with the passage of time, the power of the protective magic formations had weakened by seventy to eighty percent, posing no significant threat.  As a half-angel, Lize's resistance to magic was also not weak, so the weakened protective magic formations did not affect her much. The traps that would normally burst into flames and lightning upon triggering only flickered a few weak magical glows in her hands before disappearing.  Unfortunately, the tragic Mr. Mess allowed these traps to regain some confidence. As an ordinary human, he had little resistance, so his performance made these protective magic formations somewhat threatening.  "This, this damn place is really annoying..."  Mess dusted himself off and slowly got up, muttering under his breath while stealthily scanning his surroundings.  In the dimly lit church, only the holy light emitted by Lize quietly floated beside her, illuminating the originally pitch-black world.  However, these scenes terrified Mess. With the light's illumination, he could clearly see the dark, strange magic formations on the floor and the chilling white bones.  All these were enough to make Mess's legs go weak, not to mention the bloodstains on the walls that almost made him turn tail and run the moment he entered.  If Lize hadn't been so calm, making him lose face, and considering the two more immediate dangers outside, the fat merchant would have fled long ago.  But now, he had to steel himself and stay, joining Lize in searching for the "control hub," which neither of them even knew what it looked like.  How could they find that strange thing in such a messy place?  Mess tapped the dust off himself and muttered softly. But seeing Lize's serious expression, he didn't say more and continued his search.  Meanwhile, Rhode was also not having an easy time.  "———!" The gargoyle screamed as it swooped down. Rhode twisted his body, narrowly dodging the attack. But this time, the gargoyle didn't leave after a failed strike like before.  Instead, it spun around, and its thick tail whipped down instantly!  Bad news!  Hearing the wind from behind, Rhode's heart sank.  He quickly turned around, and his long sword was immediately poised in front of him to block.  Rhode was quick to react, but the gargoyle's attack was also fast. He had just turned around when he felt a massive impact through the sword, bending the pristine blade and sending him flying away, tumbling several times on the ground before coming to a stop.  "Oof!" Rhode got up, feeling dizzy, with his blood churning and even half his body tingling, nearly dropping his sword.  He intended to shake his head instinctively to clear his mind, but a faint sound from behind made Rhode tense up immediately.  "Sss..."  With that barely audible sound, a cold breath materialized behind Rhode. Without thinking, he rolled on the spot, barely dodging the attack, and when he looked up, he saw three specters slowly approaching.  The gargoyle's previous strike hadn't injured Rhode, but it had sent him flying from the front of the church to the edge of the barrier.  While the specters could not approach the church due to the barrier's influence, they had not dispersed. Instead, they lurked around the invisible shield, waiting for an opportunity with their instincts.  And now, that opportunity had finally arrived.  Rhode certainly didn't intend to give the specters what they wanted. Facing the encroaching enemies, he bit down hard, abandoning the idea of conserving his strength. His long sword suddenly burst into a flash of white light, projecting forward.  A white blade of light shot out from Rhode's sword, spinning and scattering, heavily hitting one of the specters, tearing through its defenses. Then Rhode, without hesitation, lunged forward, his long sword drawing a perfect arc in the air, piercing the core of the specter's body.  As the unlucky specter screamed and turned to dust, Rhode had already passed through its body, returning to the protection of the barrier.  What should he do next?  Just as Rhode pondered this question, a system notification appeared before his eyes, causing him to pause.  [Experience Points 4000/1800, Level Up Available, Talent Tree Unlocked, Level 8]  I'm level ten already? But before entering the Misty Ruins, I was only level eight, wasn't I?  Rhode was momentarily stunned, then remembered that he had indeed received a system notification earlier that he had enough experience to level up. At that time, he had been ambushed by the gargoyles, so he hadn't paid attention.  Now it seemed that the experience from the specters he killed along the way was enough for another level up.  This was not surprising; after all, this was a five-person instance, and almost all the monster experience was obtained by Rhode alone. Plus, his level was low to begin with, and there were bonuses for killing higher-level monsters, so reaching level ten was normal——  The only strange thing might be the existence of experience points in the real world. But now was not the time to worry about these details. Rhode quickly opened his attributes, made his choice, and this might be his only chance to gain an advantage.  [Experience Points 4000/1800, Level Up Available, Talent Tree Unlocked, Level 8] [Experience Points 2200/2000, Level Up Available, Talent Tree Unlocked, Skill Point Gained, Level 9] [Experience Points 200/2500, Talent Tree Unlocked, Skill Points Gained: 2, Level 10] [Do you want to open the talent system?]  "Open!"  Without any hesitation, Rhode immediately responded. In less than a second, three different talent trees appeared before his eyes.  In the Dragon Soul Continent, every profession has three talent choices after reaching level ten. They can choose one as their main focus, or they can select attributes and skills from other talents for support.  These talent attributes are also acquired through skill points.  This can cause new players to be quite confused. Because characters only receive one skill point per level, and not to mention the talent tree, skills like swordsmanship and magic also require a lot of skill points to improve.  This means that players have very limited skill points to allocate in the early stages.  Fortunately, once players enter the mid-tier realm, they can obtain additional skill points by using a "Wake-up Scroll" or completing some high-difficulty tasks to enhance their skills.  Rhode's Summoner Swordsman also has three different talent routes— "Summoning Master," "Soul Messenger," and "Hell Lord."  "Summoning Master" increases the number of spirits that can be summoned with each level.  "Soul Messenger" focuses on strengthening the power of summoned spirits.  The special power of "Hell Lord" is that after killing non-human creatures, the holder has a chance to convert them into their summoned spirits, although they are limited to the undead attribute.  It can be said that each of the three talents has its own strengths and weaknesses. "Summoning Master" relies on quantity, "Soul Messenger" focuses on quality, but considering the rarity of magical beasts and the expensive cost of soul cores, "Hell Lord" is also a very good choice.  If it were anyone else, they would probably hesitate and find it hard to give up any of the options, but for Rhode, this was not a problem. After all, he had been playing the Summoner Swordsman profession for a full seven years, and all his insights and techniques related to Summoner Swordsman were already regarded as classic by many players.  Even in the game, nearly two-thirds of the players who chose Summoner Swordsman used Rhode's insights as a standard to build their characters.  So, what seemed like a difficult choice for many new players had already been decided the moment Rhode saw the talent tree. Chapter 17: Summoning Master  The first principle of a Summoning Swordsman—never fight alone at any time.  [Consume 1 skill point, enhance Moonshadow Sword Technique 1/5, proficiency C—Unlock Moonlight]  [Consume 1 skill point, designate talent—Summoning Master Awakening]  [First tier talent of Summoning Master unlocked: Soul Resonance (character can summon additional spirits every ten levels raised), Mind Call (share senses with summoned objects, increased duration of mental connection), Construct Harmony (can perform dual spirit fusion)]  [Acquire permanent skill: Soul Resonance LV1 (character can summon +1 spirit every ten levels raised)]  [Can summon +1 spirit]  As the last line of system text disappeared, a huge shadow flashed past the corner of Rhode's eye.  But he did not retreat, nor did he show any fear.  On the contrary, Rhode raised his long sword and swung it forward fiercely.  "Swish!"  A cyan figure shot out rapidly from the edge of the sword and pounced towards the incoming gargoyle.  The Bird of Soul.  [Rhode's current problem is that he cannot summon two summons at the same time, and unfortunately, as his weapon, Star Stain is considered one of the summons. Typically, a Summoning Swordsman, just like a normal swordsman, would only be equipped with one "normal" weapon. Rhode is an exception, although he has also considered using more normal weapons, he simply cannot give up the attribute bonuses of Star Stain. It is precisely because of this feature that Rhode can so easily kill monsters of similar or slightly higher levels than himself, gaining so much experience in the early stages.  However, conversely, this also makes it impossible for Rhode to adopt the Summoning Swordsman's unique method of "attacking in tandem with summoned creatures." From the outside, he looks more like a standard swordsman. This makes Rhode quite uncomfortable, but there's no other way. If he wants to summon the Bird of Soul, then he would have to give up Star Stain, but by doing so, Rhode would find himself in an awkward situation without a weapon. Although the focus is on summons, don't forget the last two characters are "swordsman," not "mage," so Rhode cannot act like those spellcasters who hide behind and do nothing.  But if he wants to use Star Stain, he must seal the Bird of Soul, and fighting like a normal swordsman is not ideal for Rhode. Because compared to a true swordsman, a Summoning Swordsman has a significant disadvantage—career penalty—all sword technique proficiency -1. This means that a true swordsman's sword technique proficiency can reach up to SSS. But no matter how hard a Summoning Swordsman tries, they can only reach SS at best. And from the beginning, the starting line is different for both. A true swordsman has all initial sword technique proficiencies at D level. But Rhode's Summoning Swordsman can only start from E level, which is a gap. In fact, from the time he arrived in this world until now, Rhode has been fighting quite hard.  If it weren't for holding Star Stain and his understanding of the Dragon Soul Continent, he would have been in a sorry state long ago. Because he had already been accustomed to the state of having summons fighting alongside him all the time, this current situation put a lot of pressure on him.  But now, after selecting the "Summoning Master" talent, he finally felt a weight off his shoulders. That's right, a Summoning Swordsman does not have the same strong individual attack power as a true swordsman, but they never fight alone either.  Facing the Bird of Soul pouncing towards itself, the gargoyle was stunned for a moment. It sensed the magical aura on the opponent but its unremarkable AI couldn't determine what exactly the thing rushing towards it was. Nevertheless, it regarded it as an enemy and swiped down with its claw.  But this time, the gargoyle missed. Just as it felt its claw hit the target, the previously solid form suddenly dissipated as if a snowball had been scattered by someone, leaving only a faint stream of air passing quickly through its claws, disappearing without a trace.  Before the gargoyle could react, Rhode had already caught up quickly, and then gripping his long sword, he swung it forward.  A silver crescent burst out from Rhode's sword, flying towards the target whose guard was down after the missed strike. This was the third skill of the Moonshadow Sword Technique—Moonlight.  Although it, like Blade of Breakage, was a move that condensed sword energy for an attack, the effects of the two were completely different—Blade of Breakage fired in the form of blades of light, with strong power and penetrating force, but the range it covered was too narrow, making it easy to dodge.  But Moonlight was different, with its crescent-shaped attack sweeping across, at least threatening a large area in front of it, making it difficult to dodge.  As expected, facing the oncoming sword light, the gargoyle instinctively tried to flap its wings hard to dodge the attack, but it was a step too slow and was hit by the silvery blade on its right wing. Along with several small stones flying off, the gargoyle's body, which had been floating in the air, suddenly tilted and lost balance.  However, it wasn't over, as it tried to maintain balance, Rhode had already stepped forward two steps, and then with a strange gesture with his left hand, the Bird of Soul, which had turned into a breeze and passed the gargoyle's attack, reappeared behind the gargoyle in a circling motion. As the wind engulfed and wrapped around the bird, it crashed heavily into the gargoyle's back, the strong gust of air immediately blowing the gargoyle away.  This angered the already furious gargoyle, which screeched in rage. But before it could express its anger, a series of gleaming blades appeared before the gargoyle's eyes.  One, two, three. The spinning Blades of Breakage hit the wounded right wing of the gargoyle precisely, and even wings made of basalt could not withstand the continuous hits. As the gargoyle suffered these impacts, web-like cracks spread across its wings, and soon, accompanied by the crisp sound of shattering, the hard-material wings completely broke apart. This caused the gargoyle, which had lost one wing, to scream and crash to the ground, creating a sizable hole in the blue stone floor.  Fight with numbers, bully with the crowd, combine quantity and quality—that's the style of a Summoning Swordsman.  Rhode finally found his sense of battle. In fact, if he had a normal weapon in his hand now, then after activating "Summoning Master," he would be able to control two summons at the same time. By that time, let alone two rare elites, even if the BOSS himself came, he would have the confidence to grind the opponent to death.  But unfortunately, there are no "ifs" in the world, and Rhode currently doesn't have a second Soul Core to awaken a spirit. So he had no choice but to give up the thought of pursuing victory and quickly retreat backward.  Because at that moment, the second gargoyle had already dived down.  Perhaps seeing its companion wounded, this gargoyle's attack was extremely fierce. However, now able to summon the Bird of Soul, Rhode naturally did not plan to clash head-on with it again. Faced with the black shadow that had embarrassed him earlier, all Rhode did was look up and whistle.  Following that, a gust of wind suddenly howled past, forcibly pushing aside the black shadow that wanted to attack Rhode, causing it to lose its aim and tumble several times before crashing into the church wall and stopping.  Of course, Rhode would not miss such a good opportunity. Under his command, a cyan tornado rose from the ground, and the soaring bird spread its wings, attacking the enemy once again.  For a moment, the tables were turned. The two gargoyles that had been strutting in the sky were now in a sorry state like drowned dogs, while Rhode, who had been under pressure earlier, was now singing triumphantly, having regained the advantageous situation.  He consciously let the Bird of Soul cooperate with him, forcibly separating the two gargoyles, ensuring that at any time, they could maintain a "two against one" situation, forcing one of them to be unable to come to the rescue in time.  Although the situation had changed for a while, Rhode could not achieve further results. This was because his strength had already been largely depleted earlier, and although in the game, players can be "fully revived with full health" after leveling up, it's obviously impossible to have such a good deal in reality. So, even though Rhode had reached level 10 and activated his talent, his soul power had only increased based on the original amount he should have had.  Just relying on these was not enough to kill two gargoyles. Moreover, controlling two summons at the same time consumed more of Rhode's soul power, and he even had to be more careful with his consumption to avoid "powering down."  After all, the level difference between the two sides was too great, and the gargoyle's defense was not to be underestimated. Rhode's previous attacks only managed to break one of their wings, without causing particularly serious damage to them. In this case, if Rhode went all out, he indeed had the possibility to kill one of the gargoyles. But then, having exhausted all his strength, he would have to face the other one alone unarmed—the outcome is predictable to anyone with a brain.  Now all Rhode could do was try to keep these two annoying creatures suppressed and wait for Lije and Meis to find that "control core." Otherwise, the situation would revert to the way it was before.  "——!"  Although one wing had been disabled, the gargoyle had not lost its threat. It crawled on the ground like a huge black stone dog, running on all fours like a ghost across the ground. This was the terrifying aspect of these alchemical creatures—if you think of them as monsters that only show off in the air, you'll be in for a huge loss.  Fortunately, Rhode had a deep understanding of them. Although he wasn't naive enough to think that just by knocking the gargoyles out of the sky he could have his way with them, this still made Rhode feel much less pressure, after all, he didn't have to worry too much about what was above his head.  The dark figure appeared behind Rhode, and the gargoyle howled as it extended its right claw toward Rhode's back. But at the next moment, Rhode sidestepped, and the immaculate blade in his hand turned into a lightning bolt, barely blocking the attack.  At the same time, Rhode extended his left hand, and the Bird of Soul circling around him immediately chirped and flew upon seeing his gesture, barely stopping the other gargoyle that was trying to attack from the air.  Although the Bird of Soul was not at a level where it could cause much damage to rare elites like gargoyles, as a pure elemental creature, it wasn't particularly difficult for it to simply block.  As time ticked by, Rhode's heart became more and more anxious. He felt his body tired and even his spirit somewhat wilted, which was a sign that his soul power was about to be exhausted. But there was still no movement inside the church—had they not found the control core yet?  "Huff!!" A piercing wind sounded beside Rhode, startling him. He instinctively dodged to the side, trying to activate Shadow Flash, but as he prepared to dodge, he stumbled, and the skill he was supposed to activate failed.  The soul power was about to run out! This sank Rhode's heart, but at this moment he had no time to think about anything else. He quickly turned around and thrust his sword backward.  The hard stone claw collided with the white long sword, emitting a harsh friction noise.  The gargoyle, missing its strike, quickly retreated, but Rhode could not pursue.  And at that moment, suddenly, a voice came from behind him.  "Mr. Rhode! We've found it!!" Chapter 18: The Gargoyle's Heart  "Mr. Rhod! We've found it!" Hearing this voice, Rhod immediately turned around and saw Mace standing at the church door with a surprised look, holding a beautifully carved small statue high in his hand. The statue depicted a curled-up gargoyle with two eyes made of ruby fragments, faintly emitting a dark red glow.  That was the control core!  Mace's shout also caught the attention of the gargoyles. As alchemical creatures, they certainly knew what the object in the opponent's hand was. Quickly, two gargoyles shifted direction and charged towards Mace.  "Whoa!" Seeing the two terrifying monsters rushing towards him, Mace couldn't help but let out a scream in fear. He instinctively wanted to turn and run, but at that moment, Rhod's voice had already reached him.  "Throw it over here!"  Despite facing the fearsome creatures, Mace, with a delusion that he was about to be completely torn apart the next moment, still steeled himself and threw the black, beautifully crafted statue. It must be said that the fat merchant's aim was indeed not very good. The object he threw described an arc in the air but veered off its intended course, not landing anywhere near Rhod but instead flying past the two gargoyles. To an uninformed observer, it might have seemed as though the fat merchant was in league with the two gargoyles.  Caught off guard by the unexpected gift, the gargoyle was momentarily stunned, but it still instinctively stretched out its claws, attempting to grasp the small statue. However, just as it was about to succeed, a breeze blew underneath it, and the nearly formless Soul Bird passed through the air with a series of translucent ripples, forcibly snatching away the statue.  This was Rhod's last bit of strength. Exhausted, he had to sheathe his longsword and raised his right hand, snapping his fingers. Accompanied by this sound, the Soul Bird elegantly traced through the air and then flew towards Rhod.  The two gargoyles, however, also immediately stopped in their tracks and changed direction.  "Swish!" The gargoyle running on the ground flipped over, its thick and long tail swinging fiercely and hitting the Soul Bird. Although it didn't cause much damage, the green wind element swirling around the Soul Bird was slightly disrupted, causing its form to wobble.  The green bird did not give up its advance. It continued to flap its wings desperately, quickly skimming over the ground, striving to reach its master. But it did not make it to its destination.  A stone claw descended from above, piercing through the body of the green bird. The chaotic elements of wind could no longer maintain the solidity of its body, and it dissipated instantly into its most primal form.  The black statue previously held in the bird's beak also flew out, but soon two dark shadows chased after it from behind. They extended their sharp claws, opened their mouths wide, and reached for the sculpture—until it quietly and steadily fell into Rhod's hands.  [The Gargoyle's Control Core has been obtained, identification complete.]  [Command——]  "Aig!" Rhod's voice was not loud, even somewhat low.  But at that moment, the attacking shadows underwent a change—their bodies, which had been glowing slightly, turned dull and dim in the blink of an eye. Their limbs, stretched out in mid-air, seemed to freeze and stopped moving, and the eerie red glow that had burned on the gargoyle's faces also vanished in an instant.  Then, the two shadows passed by Rhod and crashed heavily onto the ground behind him.  "Boom!!!" Along with the impact, the gargoyles, now devoid of energy, returned to their original statue form. They lay quietly on the ground not far behind Rhod, still in the posture of pouncing forward just moments ago. But having lost the support of magic, they were no longer as hard as before. With this collision, both gargoyles crumbled, turning from what were once artistic sculptures into worthless rubble.  "Phew............" It was only then that Rhod let out a sigh of relief.  At this moment, he felt weak all over, his legs soft from the excessive consumption of soul power, and even the fingers of his right hand holding the statue lacked strength. However, on the surface, Rhod still maintained a calm expression. He stood silently, and after a moment, he pocketed the statue.  "Mr. Rhod!" At this time, Lijie and Mace also ran to his side, looking at him with worried and anxious expressions.  "Are you alright!?"  "I'm fine." Rhod took a deep breath. He really wanted to sit down and rest for a while. Although in the game, excessive consumption of soul power would also show various symptoms, feeling it on his own body was still somewhat overwhelming. But he couldn't fall now.  Fortunately, the surrounding fog no longer showed the figures of those ghosts. It seemed that after failing to get close, they finally made the decision to give up and leave this forbidden area. Although this did not mean they had given up for good, it was still a good thing for now.  However, Rhod did not show much reaction, which was also a habit he had developed as a team leader. The commander of a team must always remain calm and cannot panic over every little thing. If one yells and screams at the slightest difficulty or becomes overly excited after defeating a strong enemy, it definitely would not bring any positive influence to one's subordinates.  Although Rhod was no longer the guild leader that commanded tens of thousands of players in the guild, this habit still influenced him. Nonetheless, seeing his calm demeanor, the somewhat nervous Lijie and Mace both let out a sigh of relief. After all, they had been worried about the outside situation while searching and feared that something might go wrong.  Lijie was very diligent, but in terms of identifying items, Mace was clearly more adept. They finally found the small statue in a little corner. It must be said that their luck was indeed quite good. Had they been a moment later, the situation could have been completely different.  Originally, Rhod's plan was to pass through the Mist Ruins as quickly as possible, but the appearance of the two gargoyles forced him to change his mind. After all, the gargoyles had almost completely depleted his strength. If he didn't rest and recover properly, the battles ahead would be even more dangerous.  Therefore, Rhod decided to rest in the church for the night and continue on the next day. He wasn't worried about any accidents occurring here. In the game's dungeon, this church was also a place where many players rested and sorted their loot, so there shouldn't be any major problems.  Although Mace looked at the pitch-black church and its creepy decorations with twitching legs, unfortunately, as always...  He had no say in opposing Rhod's decision.  The sky gradually darkened.  Thick fog lingered outside the church. Looking through the windows, nothing could be seen but a white expanse. The three sat in the center of the church, using the rotted and decayed benches and tables as firewood, which now burned in the fire, giving off their last bit of heat. Cold wind blew through the gaps in the broken windows and cracks in the walls, carrying a trace of chilliness.  Lijie carefully reached out her hand and began to unwrap the bandage on Rhod's left chest. Then she frowned slightly.  "It's split open again, Mr. Rhod."  "I know." Rhod nodded without saying much.  In fact, this wasn't the first time. After all, it was Rhod who had been fighting in the front all the way. Although he had been trying to avoid using his left hand due to the chest wound, when faced with particularly annoying troubles, he couldn't care less, which resulted in his wound splitting open from time to time. According to Lijie, an injury that would normally take two or three days of rest to heal was now likely to take more than ten days to recover due to this.  However, the girl couldn't complain about anything. After all, it was all for their sake. So all Lijie could do was help Rhod change to a clean bandage every day to prevent infection. Fortunately, before leaving the airship, as a spiritist, she had not neglected to bring these things.  After unwrapping the bandage, the sight of the wound under the firelight made everyone involuntarily gasp, with Mace even fearfully touching his own chest and looking at Rhod's wound with trepidation. There, on Rhod's chest were three black claw marks as thick as a forearm, covered in black scabs formed by dried blood. And due to the previous intense fight with the gargoyle, many of the scabs had been torn open, with fresh red blood seeping out and mixing with the black blood clots, chilling to look at.  Lijie took out a handkerchief, poured some water from a bottle, and pressed it to Rhod's chest. This caused the latter's body to instinctively twitch, and even Mace turned his head away, not wanting to watch any longer.  "Sorry, does it hurt a lot?"  "It's okay." In response to Lijie's flustered question, Rhod shook his head. Although it did hurt, it was not unbearable.  Hearing Rhod's reply, Lijie breathed a sigh of relief and continued to clean Rhod's wound. Meanwhile, the girl also began to secretly observe the young man slightly older than herself.  To be honest, when they first met, Rhod gave Lijie a very ordinary impression. Because he was very handsome and had fair skin, Lijie subconsciously regarded him as one of those noble sons. But because Rhod's demeanor was not as arrogant as the noble sons Lijie had seen before, she could accept him. However, at that time, she didn't take him too seriously. After all, a man who looks like a woman usually gives the impression of being weak.  But later on, Lijie's view slowly changed. Unlike those noble sons who were utterly powerless, this young man possessed considerable strength, no less than her own leader, and his character was very steady. Following him made one feel very safe, and even in the face of danger, he would not panic.  And different from his appearance, this was a very strong man.  Lijie knew how painful such injuries could be. As a spiritist, she had treated many people, and many tough men who wouldn't frown on the battlefield would scream during treatment. But Rhod had never made a sound from the beginning to the end. Not to mention that he still fought in the front with such a severe injury...  Lijie's hand paused for a moment.  What was she thinking?  What a mess of thoughts.  The girl shook her head, throwing those strange thoughts out of her mind, and continued with her work.  Rhod didn't notice the girl's unusual behavior. His attention was focused on his right hand. In the palm of his hand lay two gems emitting a dark red glow.  Those were the spoils of war Rhod had obtained from the battle, the heart of the gargoyle. Chapter 19: The Holy Sword Upgrades  As a caster's intimate guardian, the gargoyle can be said to be a favorite among all mages. However, since they are mages, most would choose to make the best use of everything. Although the gargoyle is quite good as a guardian, it would be a huge waste to use them only as bodyguards. Therefore, for many mages, in addition to using gargoyles as guards, they can also be used as—safes.  These two gargoyles were no exception. Among their fragments, Rhode found quite a few good things. As level 15 rare elites, the "drops" of the gargoyles were indeed very worthy of their rare elite status. In addition to gems, crystals, and a portion of gold coins, Rhode also discovered three magical items.  Frost Amulet [Elite Item]: When attacked, it can automatically trigger a frost shield to block 50~150 damage and is immune to water attribute attacks.  Oath Guardian [Excellent Item]: The bearer can increase spell effects by +5 and spell resistance by +5.  Ring of Mist [Excellent Item]: Every ten natural days, it can activate "Ethereal Transformation" once, lasting for half an hour.  These were very nice caster equipment, and if they were sold at the auction house, they would certainly bring in a substantial profit. Unfortunately, they are all caster equipment.  In the end, Rhode allocated these items to Lize. As a spirit master, although not an offensive caster, they were still beneficial for her, so Rhode gave her the Frost Amulet and the Oath Guardian, while he kept the Ring of Mist for himself. In the game, the skill possessed by this ring was of considerable help to those who solo dungeons, so Rhode unapologetically kept it for himself.  However, Lize was extremely surprised and puzzled that she got two pieces of equipment for doing nothing. She knew that in ordinary mercenary groups, although they would also gain quite a few magical items during their adventures, these items were generally sold by the group leader. The money from the sales was then used to maintain the operation of the entire mercenary group. It was almost unimaginable for items to be directly given to others like this. This also showed the gap between NPCs and players.  As part of this world, the ultimate goal of the mercenaries was only to earn money for a living. So even if they found rare equipment, most would not keep it. In fact, many small mercenary groups rarely take on tasks that are too difficult. They may even spend their entire lives doing third-rate tasks that don't seem very impressive to players because their goal is to make money to live, and that's it.  As for those qualified to obtain magical equipment, they are generally the respected and highly skilled individuals within the mercenary group.  And the less powerful mercenaries? They can only drool over it.  But players are different. Their goal from entering this world is to be better, to gain more experience, higher prestige, stronger characters. This is what players pursue.  So for them, magical equipment is not considered rare, and they are not worried about it rotting away—after all, when they find better ones, they can still sell the replaced ones.  Just like the three magical items in front of him. In Rhode's view, these items were just transitional equipment for levels 10~15, and then they would be meaningless. Although the attributes of the Frost Amulet were not bad, Rhode didn't need it. If he could have a high-level water elemental summoning spirit, he would also get the effect of being immune to water attribute attacks. Therefore, distributing such "low-end" equipment was not a big deal for him.  Unless it was something like the "Sword of the Heavens" or "Heart of the Saint," legendary or pseudo-legendary, or ancient-level items, he might consider it.  But for Lize, these items were extremely "high-end." Even the leader of a medium-sized mercenary group wouldn't have more than three to five pieces of magical equipment on them. There might be more magical equipment for mages, but as an auxiliary profession, it was very difficult for spirit masters to obtain equipment. Moreover, from their position and nature, they generally didn't need it.  And now, as a spirit master of a small mercenary group, she suddenly received two good magical items? This even made Lize wonder if she was dreaming.  However, compared to Lize, Mes, who was on the side, saw more from this. As a merchant who had traveled all over the south, Mes certainly understood how valuable a magical item could be. Especially these magical items, in Mes's view, even if taken to the bustling port of Kalag in the Northlands for auction, twenty to thirty thousand gold coins would not be a problem. But Rhode gave them away as if the items were a piece of bread and not equipment. This calmness was not the kind of pretense that a young man would deliberately show in front of a pretty girl, but a tranquility that came from the heart—that is, Rhode truly did not care about these magical items.  This was definitely not something ordinary people could do. Mes had dealt with many people, including mercenaries and nobles. However, for them, these magical items were also quite valuable, and few would throw them away so casually. And they would not look down on these items as Rhode did.  What did this represent? It meant that in the eyes of this young man, such magical equipment was simply not worth mentioning.  And this performance also indicated that this young man might come from an extraordinary background. If Mes had previously only considered Rhode to be just another member of the countless nobles on the continent, he had now begun to associate this young man with those historically prestigious noble families or royal families. Only those families would have so many magical items, and only they would look down on them as such—just as a person with countless wealth would not care about a small loss of money, which might be a huge sum that ordinary people could not obtain in their entire lives.  This thought made the fat merchant excited for a moment. As a small businessman, he usually had no chance to meet those historical noble families. After all, those big nobles all had powerful assistants, and his small commercial association couldn't attract their attention.  But now he had such an opportunity. If he could grasp it well, maybe there would be hope.  However, this thought was fleeting. Thinking of his pig-like performance along the way, although the young man had not complained too much, the fat merchant himself knew—he had not shown anything that would be deemed valuable by the other party, which made him deflate again.  Rhode indeed did not care about those three pieces of equipment. In fact, what he cared about the most now were the two heart-shaped gems in his hands.  Gargoyle's Heart. A condensed aggregation of an artificial soul.  This description might seem a bit complicated, but to put it in player's terms, if the gargoyle is considered a robot, then the Gargoyle's Heart would be its chip.  Its value goes without saying.  In the continent of Dragon Soul, alchemical creatures are a very high-end skill. Creating life is the prerogative of gods, and even mages cannot defy this. Artificial souls are their reluctant choice as the next best thing.  Because of this, complete artificial soul cores are very rare, and not every mage can learn to make them. But for mages, owning an artificial alchemical life form is one of their ultimate goals—just like a rich and handsome man must have a sports car to prove his value.  Such things are closely guarded by mages, rarely circulated in the market, and produced in small quantities, naturally making them very expensive. Normally, they could sell for over a hundred thousand gold coins at auction, and even more in the black market. Depending on the quality, the best artificial soul cores could even sell for several million, which is enough to buy a not-so-small territory.  Moreover, mages are very wealthy.  But Rhode was not very concerned about the money. His many years of player experience told him one thing: money can always be earned, and no matter how much you earn, it's never enough. But some things cannot be bought with money.  For example, the Gargoyle's Heart had another ability.  Forced upgrade of a summoned spirit's evolution +1.  The experience of a summon is shared with the holder. Generally speaking, during battle, if Rhode gained 1000 experience points, then he would actually only receive 700, with the remaining 300 points being gained by the spirits involved in the battle.  Although this one-third of experience doesn't seem like much, it adds up over time, which is why summoners have a harder time reaching the pinnacle compared to other professions.  In fact, according to the game rules, if Rhode were of another profession, then having consumed the experience of a level 10 five-man dungeon at level 8, he should have at least reached level 12 or 13 by now. But because the experience was shared with the Azure Bird and Star Mark, Rhode had just passed level 10.  As for his summons...  [The Eternal Holy Sword, rank 10: Star Mark, no attribute, can be merged—Not even the dust of history can bury its dazzling brilliance. LV: 5, Glory of Victory, Charge Forward, Blade Trait]  A summoned spirit's level can go up to level 10, after which they can evolve once. After evolving, not only will they undergo changes, but their level cap will also increase by another ten levels, until the third evolution arrives.  The Gargoyle's Heart's ability is to forcibly elevate a summoned spirit's level to 10 and then initiate evolution. This way, not only can he save some experience points, but also reduce the time needed to level up.  What is something that money can't buy? Time is something money can't buy.  Rhode didn't know the upper limit of Star Mark's level, but according to his experience, the summoning cards at the end of a deck generally don't have a very high level, and three evolutions are likely the limit. If he used the two Gargoyle's Hearts he had, at least when fighting monsters of the same level, the forcibly upgraded holy sword would not compete with Rhode for experience anymore.  But...  Rhode fell into thought. This set of holy sword cards was very unique. When he received this card from the president of B&M Company, he was clearly told that it was the only one of its kind in this world.  At that time, Rhode didn't take it seriously, but now that he thought about it, he found it strange. The only one of its kind? But the system prompt had clearly told him that he had only obtained 1/10 of the Eternal Deck, so how did it become the only one of its kind?  What about the remaining nine cards?  And this was the tenth, which meant there should be nine cards in front of it. But there was no such deck of cards in the game because it was just a keepsake in reality. In the background of the Dragon Soul Continent game, Rhode had not heard any information about the Holy Sword Deck.  Moreover, it could not be hidden in the game because the birth of this deck of cards was due to his victory in the competitive tournament. Since the guild he formed was called Starlight, the company specially designed this card as a prize and memento for him.  Such a rush job product could not possibly be incorporated into the game system.  But no matter what, it was worth a try.  Thinking this, Rhode extended his right hand and held one of the gems in his palm. Soon, a system prompt appeared before his eyes.  [Discovery of the Gargoyle's Heart (Magical Item), do you wish to use it?]  Use.  Rhode answered in his heart.  Following Rhode's answer, the summoning magic array that appeared on his right palm immediately flashed with faint magical light. Then, the dark red gem shattered under this light, turning into dust and disappearing.  Soon, new information appeared before Rhode's eyes.  [Target?]  Star Mark.  Rhode lowered his eyes and answered in his heart.  [Target—Star Mark—Forced Evolution]  [Level upgrade completed]  [Proceed with evolution?]  Yes.  The immaculate card once again appeared in Rhode's hand, its radiance attracting the curious gazes of Lize and Mes nearby.  And at this moment, a series of system prompts also emerged before Rhode's eyes.  [Evolution completed]  [The Eternal Holy Sword, rank 10: Star Mark, no attribute, can be merged—Not even the dust of history can bury its dazzling brilliance. LV: 10, Glory of Victory, Charge Forward, Blade Trait, Snow White Wings Protect All, Guardian Trait, Holy Light Dispels Darkness, Piercing Trait]  [Attached Skills: Blade Technique, Wing Protection, Star Beacon. Can be used three times per natural day]  Not bad!  Seeing this system prompt, Rhode nodded in satisfaction. Star Mark had three special skills, and these skills were all attached to the weapon, which meant that using these skills would not consume Rhode's soul power.  And the usage limit of three times per natural day was also top-notch, and it was imaginable that it would play a significant role in battle.  But the following system prompt made Rhode slightly startle.  [Detection of magic condensation] 
Chapter 70: The Master of Donglai Cave (Part 8)  This was precisely the question that Song Fu and the others wanted to ask. However, someone else had beaten them to it. They looked at each other, totally clueless as to what had happened and unable to provide an answer. Miao Yi immediately took to the air and flew towards the source of the loud noise, with Yan Xiu and the other two quickly following suit. Song Fu and his group exchanged glances and also followed to see what had actually happened.  Upon arriving at the mountain gate, under the moonlight, they saw that the stone archway engraved with the words "Donglai Cave" had been shattered to pieces on the ground, shocking everyone present. Someone had actually destroyed the mountain gate of Donglai Cave.  Miao Yi suddenly turned around, his face twisted in a ferocious expression, and sneered at Song Fu and the others, saying, "Very well! I've only just arrived today, and it seems someone can’t wait to challenge my authority! Good!"  Song Fu and the others were stunned. They understood the implication of his words, but they definitely weren't the culprits, as they had just been sitting together, discussing how to deal with Miao Yi when they heard the strange noise and ran out.  The group initially suspected it might have been Miao Yi's doing, but seeing his reaction, they felt that Miao Yi had no reason to smash his own mountain gate. After all, Miao Yi was the master of Donglai Cave, and having his signboard smashed on his first day in office would be an embarrassing matter.  This incident needed to be clarified, otherwise, if the blame was pinned on them and they couldn't bear the responsibility, Song Fu stepped forward with a serious face and said with a fist salute, "Master, this was certainly not our doing!"  The others also followed suit with a fist salute, seemingly treating Miao Yi as the master of the cave for the first time.  "Preposterous!" Miao Yi glared at Song Fu and said sharply, "I just assigned you to guard the mountain gate today. How could you not know if someone destroyed it? Could it be that you intentionally let it happen?"  Song Fu was at a loss for words; he hadn't been there at all. Now, he couldn't say that he didn't take Miao Yi's position as cave master seriously, so he could only 'honestly' reply with a fist salute, "Master, you may not know the situation since you've just arrived. The menial workers from Donglai City haven't been dispatched yet, and we all have to fend for ourselves for food. In order to fill our stomachs, I temporarily left for a bit, and I didn't expect such a thing to happen."  Wang Zifa and the others also stepped up one by one, affirming with a fist salute, "Master, we can vouch that Brother Song Fu was just having a meal with us."  Miao Yi pointed at the fallen archway and said sharply, "Are you saying it fell down on its own? Don't tell me it was blown over by the wind!"  Song Fu felt like he had a bitter taste in his mouth and, unable to argue, raised his hand and said, "Master, I swear on the ancestors of my Blue Jade Gate, this was absolutely not our doing. If there is a half-truth in what I say, may I, Song Fu, meet a terrible end!"  Miao Yi's eyes flickered as he scanned the group, his tone dark as he said, "Could it be that someone came to cause trouble in my Donglai Cave?"  Everyone was alarmed at the thought, quickly looking around.  "What are you waiting for here? Do you want to get your throats slit in your sleep? Spread out and search!" Miao Yi ordered angrily.  "Yes!" Yan Xiu and the other two men responded with a fist salute and quickly dispersed into the surrounding woods.  "Hmm?" Miao Yi snorted heavily through his nose, his gaze fixed on Song Fu and the others as if questioning why they weren't searching if they weren't the culprits. Did they know something?  At this time, it was important to show that they had nothing to do with the situation. Song Fu immediately turned his head and shouted, "Why are you not following the master's orders to search?"  The group saluted Miao Yi with a fist and also dispersed.  However, Song Fu was stopped by Miao Yi, "Song Fu, come with me!"  Song Fu paused and, with a fist salute, followed behind Miao Yi.  After everyone left, a figure like a shadow in the water appeared in the original spot. It was none other than the extraordinary figure of Old Bai. Old Bai looked at the fallen stone gate archway, slightly shook his head, and chuckled, "Life is like a game of chess, and a hot-blooded man should not only have the courage of a mere brute. I've always been worried that you're too kind-hearted and easy to suffer losses... A man should have his own methods when he strides across the world; a mere brute cannot ascend to heaven. Now I'm quite relieved."  With that, his figure wavered like ripples on water, quietly disappearing without a trace.  In the Great Hall of Donglai, candles flickered. Song Fu stood behind Miao Yi, one in front and one behind, inside the hall. The outside charcoal seemed to sense something and sneezed.  Miao Yi stared at his throne with no expression, his hands behind his back, facing away from Song Fu and not saying a word.  The atmosphere between the two was a bit tense. After waiting for a while, Song Fu couldn't help but ask, "Master, what do you wish to see me for?"  Miao Yi's tone was dark as he said, "Song Fu, do you know your crime?"  Song Fu's mouth curled into a sneer, and he glanced at the wine and food on the side table, replying indifferently, "This matter has nothing to do with us. What crime does Song Fu have?"  "I'm not asking about that!" Miao Yi suddenly turned around, staring at him, and asked coldly, word by word, "I ordered you to guard the mountain gate, why did you leave your post without permission? Do you not take my orders as cave master seriously?"  Song Fu thought to himself, what do you think? I never took it seriously to begin with.  Of course, he wouldn't say that aloud, "Song Fu has already reported to the master. It was truly unavoidable. I only left temporarily to eat, and I didn't wish for such a thing to happen."  Miao Yi asked, "Do you think the head of the house and the mountain master will believe your explanation after I report this incident?"  Song Fu chuckled and said, "People have two sides to their mouths. If the master insists on framing me, then please do as you wish. But don't forget, master, that I also have a mouth to defend myself, and I'm not mute."  Miao Yi snickered, "It seems you truly refuse to repent!"  As soon as he said this, Yan Xiu, Dan Biao Yi, and Qiu Shaoqun appeared at the door, coming in together and saluting Miao Yi, "Master, we haven't found any suspicious persons for the time being."  Miao Yi replied, "The suspicious person is right in front of us. What do you mean by saying you haven't found anyone?"  Dan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun seemed to have received a signal and quickly closed the hall door.  Song Fu was startled by the noise, quickly turned around, and saw Yan Xiu's furious axe strikes coming towards him.  Song Fu quickly drew his sword, a flash of cold light leaving the sheath, and swiftly parried the blows.  Dan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun also thrust their spears almost instantaneously, joining forces to attack Song Fu.  Yan Xiu and Song Fu were on par with each other in terms of cultivation, and with Dan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun joining in, Song Fu's situation immediately became precarious.  "You shameless traitors! How dare you plot to harm..."   Surrounded and unable to break free, Song Fu managed to hold his sword and fiercely confront Yan Xiu, his angry roar not yet finished when he was brutally pierced by the thrusting spears, breaking through his magical defenses and stabbing deep into his chest.  Song Fu's eyes were wide open as he struggled to look back at Miao Yi, his lips quivering, his eyes filled with indescribable rage.  He finally understood that it was a trap, the collapse of the mountain gate archway was not only meant to frame him but also to lure his fellow disciples away to prevent him from joining forces to resist. The main goal was to take his life. Chapter 71: Lord of the Eastern Cave (9)  Now is the time to kill, when else to wait! Yan Xiu's hand rose and the blade fell without mercy. With an axe, he 'pu' chopped off his head. Shan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun also pulled their guns from Song Fu's body at the same time.  The three, still somewhat shaken, retracted their hands and immediately turned to look at Miao Yi. Miao Yi did not intervene; instead, he cast a spell to protect the table of wine and dishes on the low table from being affected by the mana of the fight.  Now, having released his mana, he spread his five fingers and sucked a cup of wine into his hand, picked up the cup and drank it in one gulp, and said indifferently, "The show is complete."  The three bowed their hands and quickly flashed out behind the hall, disappearing.  Miao Yi then walked to the entrance of the great hall, opened the door, stepped over the threshold, and stretched out his hand to stroke the mane of Hei Tan, looking at the moonlight outside.  His gaze was cold, but the images in his mind were of himself leading the second child by the hand and carrying the third child, who was scared and crying, on his back, facing a group of adults who bullied their way to his door. In his helpless grief and indignation, he stabbed a knife into his own thigh, and blood gushed out...  "Second, third, I'm sorry, brother should not have sent you into such danger, it's all brother's fault, you must take good care of yourselves, brother's abilities are limited now, just give brother a little more time..."  Miao Yi murmured to himself.  A weak light flashed across the dark green bead around his neck.  Hei Tan shook his head and sneezed...  The sound of fighting and Song Fu's last cries of despair drew his fellow disciples back.  Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, two white lotus third-grade experts, were the first to fly over, with Shang Youlai, Hou Sheng, Wang Xiuqin, and Nan Sisi arriving one after another.  Yan Xiu, Shan Biao Yi, and Qiu Shaoqun were the last to arrive, apparently also drawn by the commotion.  A group of people wanted to enter the great hall to see what had happened but were blocked outside the great hall by Miao Yi, who was standing with his spear across the horse.  Miao Yi sat astride the dragon colt, holding a silver spear, standing upright on the steps at the entrance of the great hall, looking down at everyone from a high position.  Outside the great hall, the night sky hung low, and the stars and moon twinkled.  Inside the hall, behind Miao Yi, the bright candles flickered, creating a visual discrepancy in the light and shadow that made it a bit difficult to see Miao Yi's expression, adding a bit of mystery and a bit of majesty, while also conveying a murderous aura emanating from Miao Yi.  The disciples of the Blue Jade Sect looked at each other, and in the end, it was Wang Zifa who stepped forward and asked, "Lord, we seemed to have heard the sound of fighting just now, as well as Brother Song Fu's cries for help. May I ask if Brother Song Fu is inside the great hall?"  "He is! However, he is already decapitated!" Miao Yi did not hide anything, lifted the hand that was hanging by his thigh, holding someone's hair bun, and a head was lifted in his hand and thrown towards the crowd, casually tossing it to them.  The crowd, taken aback, instinctively stepped back to avoid it, only to see a fine head rolling and stopping at their feet.  On closer inspection, whose could it be if not Song Fu's?  The three behind them, Yan Xiu and the others, quietly exchanged glances, while everyone else was greatly shocked.  Wang Zifa suddenly pointed his finger at Miao Yi on the steps and shouted angrily, "Did you kill Brother Song Fu?"  Miao Yi, looking down from above, without any emotional color, said coldly, "I ordered him to guard the mountain gate, but he dared to leave his post and let someone destroy my Eastern Cave's mountain gate. I asked him if he knew his crime, not only did he not know his crime, he even dared to speak insolently to the lord of this cave. Such a reckless and ignorant man, treating the lord's orders as child's play, shouldn't the lord of this cave kill him?"  As soon as these words came out, Wang Zifa and the others immediately unsheathed their swords and pointed them at Miao Yi, with Wang Zifa asking loudly, "How dare you kill a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect!"  "How bold!" Miao Yi shouted angrily, warning, "I don't care which sect's disciples you are, since you've joined my Eastern Cave, you should forget the concept of sects and abide by the rules. Do you Blue Jade Sect want to challenge the million-strong army under the command of Lord Chenlu? Acting recklessly without knowing your own strength!"  His spear pointed downward, "Song Fu is not the first third-grade white lotus cultivator to die by my hand, nor will he be the last! Yan Xiu, Shan Biao Yi, Qiu Shaoqun!"  Behind everyone, Yan Xiu and the other two immediately revealed their weapons and responded in unison, "Present!"  "If anyone dares to commit insubordination!" Miao Yi, from his high position, pointed his spear at Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, "These two are for me to deal with, the other four are for you to resolve!"  "Orders received!" Shan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun, along with Yan Xiu, who was holding a pair of axes, shouted angrily, "Kill anyone who dares to commit insubordination!"  This was what they had agreed upon. Anyway, Song Fu, that troublemaker, Miao Yi had already made up his mind to kill him to set an example, no matter what.  As for the remaining Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, these two third-grade white lotus cultivators, Miao Yi did not have the confidence to kill them, but with Hei Tan's speed, it was no problem to entangle these two.  The other four second-grade white lotus cultivators, with Yan Xiu, a third-grade white lotus cultivator leading Shan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun, were enough to deal with them.  Once the fight really started, Yan Xiu and the other two would immediately join Miao Yi to deal with Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao after defeating the four, so there was a great chance of victory.  The disciples of the Blue Jade Sect looked at Miao Yi, who stood with his spear across the horse on the steps in front of them, and then turned their heads to look at Yan Xiu and the other three, who were eyeing them with hostility, and immediately fell into a dilemma.  During the battle at the Floating Light Cave years ago, as bystanders, everyone saw that Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao joining forces might not be able to defeat Miao Yi. If the battle dragged on, the other four second-grade white lotus cultivators facing Yan Xiu, a third-grade white lotus cultivator, with two others attacking, had a high probability of failure. They had no chance of winning this battle.  Moreover, they did not know that Song Fu's death was the result of Yan Xiu and the others working together. They were secretly alarmed at how quickly Miao Yi was able to kill Song Fu and could not help but feel uneasy.  "Miao Yi is here, who dares to fight me!" Miao Yi shouted again with his spear.  "You killed our Blue Jade Sect disciple, and the Blue Jade Sect will demand an explanation from you."  Wang Zifa said this, but he had already put down his sword and did not dare to act rashly. The others also slowly lowered their swords.  Seeing that he had suppressed the situation, Miao Yi snorted coldly, "I don't care about the Blue Jade Sect's affairs, I only care about the affairs of the Eastern Cave. If you don't feel comfortable staying in my Eastern Cave, feel free to leave, I won't stop you. If you want to stay and obey my orders, I won't mistreat you. From today onwards, any member of the Eastern Cave who obeys my orders, third-grade white lotus cultivators can receive three beads the size of rice grains each year, second-grade white lotus cultivators can receive two beads, and those who don't obey my orders won't even think about getting one, get lost at once!"  As soon as these words came out, everyone was surprised and stunned, including Yan Xiu and the other two, because Miao Yi had not previously mentioned this to them.  Everyone quickly calculated in their minds. The Eastern Cave controls about 120,000 believers, and can harvest about 120 beads of wish power each year, submitting 80% and keeping 20%, which is 24 beads. Now there are three third-grade white lotus cultivators, which would take up nine beads, and six second-grade white lotus cultivators would take up twelve beads. The 24 beads would already account for twenty-one beads. Could it be that the lord of this cave, having worked so hard to climb to this position, is willing to leave only three beads for himself? Chapter 72: The Cave Master from the East (10)  The disciples of the Blue Jade Sect were fawning over Yang Qing, but what for? Wasn't it for the Wish-Granting Pearls? The matter concerning Song Fu was instantly thrown to the back of their minds; what was more important was to clarify whether the words of this Cave Master were true.  After hesitating for a moment, Wang Zifa clasped his hands together and asked, "Cave Master, you can't be joking with us, can you? Are you aware that by doing this, you will be left with only three Wish-Granting Pearls? If we..."  Before he could finish his sentence, he swallowed his words, and even swallowed his saliva deeply, as everyone's eyes widened at Miao Yi, or more precisely, at what was in Miao Yi's hand.  A Wish-Granting Pearl the size of an ordinary pearl, translucent and emitting a hazy white halo, was particularly eye-catching in the night, held between Miao Yi's fingers, captivating everyone’s souls and making their eyes shine.  None of them was blind, and their eyesight far exceeded that of ordinary people. This was actually a Wish-Granting Pearl that had accumulated the wishes of ten thousand people over a year!  "Wish-Granting Pearls? Three, two, it doesn't really matter." Miao Yi flipped his finger, and the Wish-Granting Pearl was already stored inside his storage ring. Looking down at the people standing below, he said, "If you are willing to sincerely follow my orders, I have ways to obtain more. By then, the amount you receive each year will probably exceed what I have promised. Those who work for me and make achievements, I, the Cave Master, will not be stingy with rewards!"  Everyone was excited, their eyes shining!   If there were doubts at the beginning, they vanished when they saw the Cave Master casually take out a pearl-sized Wish-Granting Pearl. Their hearts beat faster at the sight. Such high-level Wish-Granting Pearls were not something that small towns could produce. Yang Qing, generous as he might be, probably wouldn't just reward the Cave Master with one. It seemed likely that the Cave Master truly had other sources for Wish-Granting Pearls.  Logically speaking, in a small cave dwelling like the one in Dong Lai, no matter what rank of cultivation the disciples held, if they had a bad relationship with the Cave Master, they would be content with receiving one pearl each year, and they had no say in the matter. Yan Xiu was an example of this during his time in the Fuguang Cave.  Now, if according to what Miao Yi said, the supply of Wish-Granting Pearls was to be doubled or tripled, then a third-rank White Lotus cultivator could condense a hundred years of practice into the span of three hundred years, and a second-rank White Lotus cultivator could make a hundred years of practice equivalent to two hundred years. What did this mean? It meant significantly shortening the time of cultivation, allowing them to quickly improve their cultivation level and strength.  Some even started to harbor malicious thoughts, wondering if it would be worth risking their lives to snatch the Wish-Granting Pearl from Miao Yi's hand.  But on second thought, they realized it was not appropriate. Individually, they might not be Miao Yi's match, and if they joined forces, who would the snatched item belong to?  Even if one person managed to get it, the pearl would only be equivalent to ten rice-sized pearls, which according to Miao Yi's promise, would only take a little over three years to obtain.  For a cultivator, a mere three years was not a long time in the grand scheme of a cultivating career. If they robbed him this time, what would they do after three years? Wouldn't they be cutting off their own wealth?  Suppressing the impractical thoughts of loss outweighing gain, Wang Zifa braced himself and asked respectfully with clasped hands, "Does the Cave Master's word count?"  Miao Yi looked down and asked, "You group of Blue Jade Sect disciples are all in this together. If I didn't keep my word, do you think that would benefit me in any way?"  Wang Zifa and Zhu Tian exchanged glances, then turned back to their fellow disciples, who were looking at them expectantly, and nodded.  Swish! Everyone sheathed their swords, stood in two neat rows, and shouted in unison, "We are willing to follow the Cave Master's orders!"  Miao Yi sat up straight, feeling that the situation in front of him was finally like being in charge of his own house, and this Dong Lai Cave truly felt like his own territory!  But empty words were easy to shout, and Miao Yi was not so easily appeased. He said, "It's not enough to just say it, you need to show real action."  After exchanging glances, the group once again led by Wang Zifa clasped their hands and asked for instructions, "Please give us your orders, Cave Master!"  Miao Yi indifferently said, "Song Fu has defied his superiors and disregarded the orders of Dong Lai Cave!"  Everyone understood his meaning; this was a call for them to take a stand on the matter. It was clear that benefits weren't so easily obtained.  Wang Zifa sighed and said, "Actually, we also feel that Brother Song's actions were inappropriate. We have advised him many times in private, but Brother Song wouldn't listen, and we could do nothing about it. After all, he is our senior brother. There are laws for countries, rules for mountains, and the Cave Master is just in carrying out the law, we have no objections!"  The others followed suit, bowing and clasping their hands, responding, "The Cave Master is just in carrying out the law, we have no objections!"  Yan Xiu and two others twitched their faces, looking at each other with a bit of hatred. These animals didn't seem so easy to talk to when they were bullying the three of them before. Now, they were all too obedient, pushing all the blame onto Song Fu's head.  The three looked at Miao Yi with a hint of awe in their eyes, seeing in this Cave Master the ability to turn the tide and change the weather with a flick of the wrist, and quickly changing the entire Dong Lai Cave, no wonder the mansion master Yang Qing would go against public opinion and let him be stationed in Dong Lai Cave!  "Although Song Fu is despicable and deserves to be killed, he is, after all, a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect. Now, during the cooperation between Nanxuan Prefecture and the Blue Jade Sect, it is not worth ruining the relationship between the two over one Song Fu. This matter will inevitably have to be reported and explained to the higher-ups," Miao Yi said.  He paused, sweeping his gaze over the crowd, and slowly added, "My word alone might cause doubts in the Blue Jade Sect. If you, as his fellow disciples, are willing to testify, it would naturally dispel the doubts of the Blue Jade Sect. I wonder if you are willing to write down your testimonies and report them to the mountain master along with me?"  Yan Xiu and the others couldn't help but curl their mouths in a suppressed smile, thinking that the Cave Master was quite ruthless with his tactics.  Wang Zifa and the others' expressions twitched, realizing what it meant to be a hypocrite; this fellow had killed someone from the Blue Jade Sect and didn't want to take responsibility, yet he wanted the people of the Blue Jade Sect to say that their disciple deserved to die. Aren't you unafraid of us, the Blue Jade Sect, and don't take us into account?  Seeing that they were silent, Miao Yi sighed, "If you don't want to write, I won't force you. But there's something you need to think clearly about. Once the Blue Jade Sect comes down to investigate this matter and finds out that you can get two or three Wish-Granting Pearls each year, I'm afraid no one will pursue my responsibility. After all, the face of the Wish-Granting Pearls is bigger than the face of the Cave Master. If someone else were the Cave Master of Dong Lai, they wouldn't be as generous as me. Maybe some of your fellow disciples will try to get you transferred away and then come to serve me. By then, I won't be able to stop them. What do you think?"  His words hit everyone's soft spot. What Miao Yi was talking about was not a possibility, but a certainty. There would definitely be people trying to replace them, and the disciples of the Blue Jade Sect who were assigned to the lowest level were originally those without much background, who couldn't withstand a little manipulation from more connected fellow disciples.  Nan Sisi, who was somewhat pretty, couldn't help but mutter in a low voice, "Brother Wang, Brother Song did not obey the Cave Master's orders, causing the sect's gate to be destroyed, indeed he cannot shirk his responsibility."  "That's right..." Several people responded in a low voice, not daring to be too obvious, but the meaning was clear, hoping that Brother Wang would understand.  Wang Zifa of course understood everyone's thoughts. No one wanted the benefits to be taken by someone else. But if they really did this, it would be deceiving their own sect. Once they boarded Miao Yi's pirate ship, there was no getting off, and they would have to work for him like cattle and horses. Chapter 73: The Lord of the Eastern Grotto (Part 11)  However, the temptation of the Wish-Power Beads turned out to be the greatest. Why else would everyone willingly come and bow their heads under someone else's control? Wasn't it all for the Wish-Power Beads! Under the muttering of his fellow sect brothers and sisters, Wang Zifa gritted his teeth and took it as a step down, sighing and saying, "I am acting in response to the opinions of my fellow sect brothers and sisters. This is not a decision I made alone."  "Of course!"  "Of course!"  Everyone nodded in agreement, acknowledging the difficulty of their senior brother's position. In such matters, it's tough for one person to take all the responsibility. Everyone must share it. Otherwise, there's no telling if someone might become discontent in the future and spill the beans. Only if everyone shares the responsibility will it be secure.  After reaching a consensus, everyone bowed their hands and said, "We are willing to follow the Lord's orders!"  Witnessing the earth-shattering changes, the three people, including Yan Xiu, looked at the Lord with utmost admiration. He had managed to get so many disciples of the Blue Jade Sect onto the same boat, and they couldn't help but admire him.  However, thinking back, they realized they weren't any better off. It was they themselves who had killed Song Fu. If the matter were to be revealed, they wouldn't be able to escape the consequences either. It seemed that everyone was on the Lord's boat, and no one could get off.  "Good!" Miao Yi's silver spear flashed in his hand, withdrawing into his storage ring. He dismounted his steed, stood with his hands behind his back on the steps, and put on a smiling face, saying, "There's still time. You might as well write down your statements now. If there are no issues after I review them, I'll have someone send them to Zhenhai Mountain to inform the Mountain Lord."  Everyone was speechless, realizing that this Lord didn't even want to give them a chance to regret, not even trusting them overnight.  What else could be done in such a situation? They could only nod and agree.  Miao Yi immediately raised his hand and said, "Yan Xiu, distribute the jade slips to everyone."  Yan Xiu obeyed the order, quickly ran into the hall, took out a stack of jade slips, and handed them out to everyone one by one.  So, a group of people stood under the steps of the grand hall, each casting spells to write their statements.  Some, after starting to write, felt awkward, wondering if it was really appropriate to do this to their deceased fellow sect brother...  After someone had finished writing, they stepped up the steps and presented their statement to Miao Yi for inspection.  Miao Yi looked it over and nodded slightly, saying, "Very good!"  Some who handed theirs over were met with Miao Yi frowning and saying, "The way you've written this, it seems like Song Fu's crimes do not warrant death. Isn't this a bit too lightly worded?"  The person apologized with a smile, "I'll rewrite it, I'll rewrite it."  After reviewing another one, Miao Yi shook his head and said, "This is written too excessively. Just stick to the facts. This makes it seem like the crime is so heinous that even I would want to kill him again... This mainly makes it hard for your Blue Jade Sect to save face. Lighten it up a bit."  The three, including Yan Xiu, also wrote their statements.  After everyone's statements were written and collected by Miao Yi, Miao Yi also wrote a memorial stating that Song Fu disobeyed orders, deserted his post, leading to the destruction of the sect's gate, and even dared to talk back to the Lord. He claimed that the execution was to set an example and maintain discipline.  He wrote his statement more modestly than everyone else because he felt it was necessary to show the magnanimity of the Lord. After all, with so many people speaking ill of Song Fu, the Lord's voice was just one among many.  After signing his legal seal on the document, he took the memorial, along with the one modified and copied by Yan Xiu from the East City Lord's memorial, in his hand, and looked up and shouted, "Dan Biayi!"  Dan Biayi immediately stepped forward with a salute and said, "At your service!"  "Set off immediately, deliver these items to Zhenhai Mountain overnight, and report to the Mountain Lord without error!" Miao Yi handed over the documents.  "Yes!" Dan Biayi accepted the order and quickly departed.  One wonders what expression Qin Weiwei, who had always been worried about Miao Yi's competence, would have upon seeing these memorials.  The group watched as Dan Biayi disappeared, thinking that he truly wouldn't even wait overnight.  After the official business was done, Miao Yi breathed a sigh of relief and said to Yan Xiu, "Inform the City Lord of Donglai to come see me tomorrow morning. Have him bring over the people that need to be sent. We can't affect everyone's normal lives or hinder their cultivation."  This was met with everyone's approval, and the group immediately saluted, "The Lord is wise!"  "Don't celebrate too soon." Miao Yi glanced over the Blue Jade Sect disciples, "Don't think I'm unaware of the scheming you all did with Song Fu. Song Fu failed to protect the sect's gate, causing its collapse, and you all share in the blame. I don't want to see the reputation of my East Grotto being tarnished when people arrive tomorrow. You all must work overnight to quarry stones and rebuild the archway to make amends. Do not take this lightly; it must be well constructed and imposing!"  Now no one opposed, and they could only agree. Those guarding the sect's gate tonight had plenty of company.  Miao Yi waved his hand to dismiss everyone, then turned to Qiu Shaoqun and said, "Clean up the grand hall."  Yan Xiu then led Miao Yi to the private cultivation and sleeping quarters of the Lord in the rear hall. Black Charcoal, unconcerned with any rules, also followed along.  Along the way, Yan Xiu couldn't help but ask in a low voice, "Lord, isn't it too much to release so many Wish-Power Beads to everyone every year?"  He considered himself a close confidant and showed concern for the Lord.  Miao Yi raised his eyebrows and said, "Why do you think I asked Dan Biayi to send the items overnight? It's to establish the facts first. When the time comes, if I don't give it to them, what can they do? They wouldn't dare to face the Blue Jade Sect's pursuit of their responsibility, let them try to turn against me!"  "......" Yan Xiu was dumbfounded.  "Don't overthink it. I was just saying. As long as we collect enough Wish-Power Beads every year, I will keep my word."  Patting Black Charcoal beside him, Miao Yi sighed, "After going out and handling affairs, I've come to understand the truth in the saying 'A horse that never grazes at night will not get fat.' It's not enough for us to stay here and receive a fixed income. We need to find other ways to increase our revenue."  He wasn't speaking idly; he truly felt that way. Not to mention the Wish-Power Beads gifted by the charming proprietress, he also gained a little by killing Mo Shengtu and Zhang Shucheng, and he even snatched one from Huang Baolong. He was eager and itchy to organize and do something bigger with the people in East Grotto, as one's personal strength is never enough.  Black Charcoal felt a bit unwilling as it was stopped at the courtyard between the front and rear halls. The front was where Lord Miao's sleeping and cultivation areas were, and it indeed wasn't convenient for such a large creature to enter. It had no choice but to lie down at the doorway, exuding laziness.  However, the courtyard here was serene, with ancient trees, potted plants, cool pavilions, small lofts, flower gardens, and ponds, making it an elegantly high-class environment, far better than lying outside.  Stepping into his private space, Miao Yi couldn't help but click his tongue in appreciation. He discovered that the treatment of a Lord was indeed extraordinary. Beneath his feet was a thick carpet, surrounded by various exquisite furnishings. Luxury and elegance were integrated, a sight he had never seen before, and today was truly an eye-opening experience.  Yan Xiu's thoughts, however, were not on the surroundings but rather on the alternate income sources mentioned by the Lord. He was also curious about where the Lord got the Wish-Power Bead that accumulated the wishes of ten thousand people over a year, and he tried to ask, "What is the Lord's plan for seeking alternative ways to increase income?"  Miao Yi laughed and said, "The best way, of course, is to do like the mansion owner and take over the entire region of Nanxuan."  Yan Xiu was shocked and waved his hands repeatedly, saying, "That's not possible. Our strength is not yet sufficient to swallow the surrounding territories." Chapter 74: Master of the Donglai Cave (Part 12)  "Of course I know that. If we go to snatch someone else's territory now, I'm afraid we might not only fail to grab their territory but instead provoke them to snatch ours," Miao Yi said with a hint of self-mockery, shaking his head. He then turned around and sat down on a thick, carved, furry couch, asking, "What do you think about us taking a trip to the Starry Sea?"  "Starry Sea?" Yan Xiu suddenly widened his eyes, as he was the one who had told Miao Yi about this place.  "What are we going to do at the Starry Sea? That place is within the demon nation of the Demon Saint Ji Huan. The Starry Sea is a place where groups of demons run rampant. Almost every human cultivator who has intruded there has never returned."  "Didn't you say that demon pills of no grade can be exchanged for a Thousand People's Wish Pearl?" Miao Yi asked.  Indeed, this was what Yan Xiu had told him after witnessing the great battle between Yang Qing and Lu Yu.  Demon pills and Yin pills can be refined into magical treasures, which are also the source of power in magical treasures. However, after all, a magical treasure is a magical treasure. Since one cannot cultivate it, each use reduces the contained energy a bit. The more powerful the use, the more energy is consumed, and naturally, it needs energy replenishment.  Therefore, low-grade demon pills and the like have become the best source of energy replenishment for magical treasures. If there's a market, there is value, whether exchanging for money or Wish Pearls.  Yan Xiu said with a pounding heart, "Master, the alternative plan you mentioned, it wouldn’t be to go hunting in the Starry Sea, would it?"  "Hehe, I was just saying that casually. Look how nervous you are; I'm just joking," Miao Yi dismissed it with a laugh.  After letting Yan Xiu leave, Miao Yi went into his cultivation chamber to check it out.  This was an underground space, not small, with thick polished stone slabs on the floor and walls, and a copper lamp providing moderate brightness.  In front of a stone couch for quiet meditation, there were also three large baths made of jade stones, with carved animal heads spewing water. One pool drew mountain springs, another drew hot springs, and the two springs met in another pool, mixing to create a pool of water with a suitable temperature, a good place for a bath.  Miao Yi stripped off his clothes and soaked in the pool water, humming comfortably...  The next morning, Miao Yi, accompanied by a group from Donglai Cave, went to inspect the newly constructed mountain gate archway.  Miao Yi was immediately pleased. He had vaguely heard the sounds of chiseling and hammering throughout the previous night. Six cultivators had worked together to rush the job, and the archway they had built was indeed extraordinary.  The main archway was over three zhang tall and carved with lifelike birds and beasts, with auspicious clouds coiling around. The words 'Donglai Cave' were prominently inscribed, and below it, there were stone carvings of coiling dragons and crouching tigers guarding each side.  The whole mountain gate archway was impressive and eye-catching. Miao Yi nodded in approval, "Not bad, not bad. It's even more imposing than the mountain gate archway of Nanxuan Mansion. It seems that even if the people of Donglai Cave don't cultivate, they could be good stonemasons when pulled out."  Seeing him pleased and fearing that he would deliberately make things difficult, the disciples of Lan Yu Sect, who had been apprehensive, breathed a sigh of relief. They had racked their brains over the archway the night before.  Hearing the master's words, everyone laughed heartily, and the atmosphere among them became much more harmonious in an instant.  However, Miao Yi then pointed to their blue clothes, "These clothes of yours, how come they look so glaring to me? People who don't know any better might think Donglai Cave belongs to Lan Yu Sect. I don't mind if you wear them back at Lan Yu Sect, but while you're at Donglai Cave, you should uniform the color of the clothes.  Yan Xiu, later go to the city and find a tailor to change everyone's clothes to black."  "Yes!" Yan Xiu bowed and took the command.  The disciples of Lan Yu Sect looked at each other.  Miao Yi didn't care whether they were willing or not; he continued to admire the archway with his hands behind his back.  While everyone was admiring the archway, Yan Xiu suddenly pointed towards the mountain road by the lakeside, "Master, it looks like the Lord of Donglai City has arrived."  Everyone looked and saw a procession winding along the lakeside mountain path, with many palanquins, as well as horses and carts, appearing to bring a lot of things.  Miao Yi glanced casually, but his gaze lingered on the large lake at the foot of the mountain, saying, "Yan Xiu, later have someone put more fish and shrimp in the lake to breed."  Yan Xiu took the command, knowing that this was probably for the preparation of Black Charcoal. Unlike other dragon colts, that creature liked eating fresh fish and shrimp and enjoyed playing in the water. With such a big lake here, it had become Black Charcoal's paradise.  "Prince Fa, arrange someone to guard the gate. From now on, you'll be in charge of arranging the personnel for this area of the mountain gate. If it gets smashed again, I'll hold you accountable! Everyone else, back to the main hall."  Miao Yi waved his hand and turned to leave. The Lord of Donglai City was not worth everyone standing here to welcome.  Prince Fa wouldn't be so blind as to arrange Yan Xiu and other confidants of the master to guard the mountain gate. He left his fellow disciple, Shang Youlai, on duty.  Not long after the others returned to the Donglai Main Hall, the fat and big-eared Lord of Donglai City, Xu Xinyang, had already arrived at the mountain gate, dismounted from his horse, and politely requested Shang Youlai to announce his arrival.  There was no need for any announcement; the master already knew they had come. Shang Youlai let them in.  No one dared to ride horses in anymore, and the mounts were all left outside. Only the large quantity of goods pulled by horses and carts followed Xu Xinyang and stopped at the plaza outside the main hall.  Sixteen palanquins carried by bearers were gently set down, and no one dared to neglect them, as the palanquins contained maids to be presented to the immortals.  It is an old rule that one cultivator would have two maids. The rules of the cultivation world would not allocate more, and if every cultivator wanted more, given their ability to come and go without a trace, the secular women would not be enough to spoil. This would affect the believers, and affecting the believers would lead to a loss of willing power, so naturally, it needs to be regulated.  Other people, without permission, were not allowed to enter the main hall. Only Xu Xinyang, who wiped his sweat and wore official robes, cautiously carried a box up the steps.  It was not that he was afraid of what the immortals would do to him, but every time the master of Donglai Cave was replaced, it was also the most insecure time for his position as the city lord. If the master took a dislike to him, it was possible that he would be replaced.  Inside the main hall, Yan Xiu and others stood to the left and right. Xu Xinyang, who entered carrying the box, did not dare to look up directly. He walked to his spot, immediately set down the heavy box, knelt down, and bowed his head, saying, "Lord of Donglai City, Xu Xinyang, pays respects to the Master!"  Seated above, Miao Yi smiled and said, "Lord Xu, we meet again."  Hearing this, Lord Xu was stunned, looked up, and recognized the person. He suddenly realized that this was the immortal who had saved Mrs. Ji. He did not expect him to be the newly appointed master of Donglai Cave. The new master looked so young!  "Stand up and talk," Miao Yi said with a casual wave of his hand.  Lord Xu immediately got up, took out a small box from his sleeve, and together with the large box, he held them up and presented them, "Master, this is a little token of appreciation from the people of Donglai City. I hope the Master will accept it."  Having had the experience with Chief Huang before, Miao Yi knew what was inside without looking. He nodded slightly to Yan Xiu, who immediately went to take the items. Chapter 75: Qian'er and Xue'er  Miao Yi did not make things difficult for the city lord. After conversing for a while, he found that the city lord was quite familiar with the livelihood of Donglai City. Thus, he encouraged him a bit and let him step down. The two parties did not have much common language to continue the conversation.  After the relieved City Lord Xu left with his people, Miao Yi asked Yan Xiu to bring over the gift to open it. Indeed, inside the small box was a grain-of-rice-sized pearl radiating a soft halo. Miao Yi, without any politeness, directly put it into his storage bag.  Inside the box was five thousand gold crystals, which was not a small sum at all. It was the hard-earned wealth of the people of Donglai City. For Miao Yi, who came from a common background, there was some reluctance at the bottom of his heart to accept such things, but he had no choice. The entire Donglai Cave was not just for him alone; so many of his subordinates relied on the believers from Donglai City for support.  However, Miao Yi did not keep any for himself. He had Yan Xiu distribute a portion of the gold crystals, giving two hundred to each person of the Third Rank White Lotus and one hundred to those of the Second Rank. The rest was kept for the cave's expenses and handed over to Yan Xiu for safekeeping.  Yan Xiu was in a good mood, as he had not enjoyed this kind of treatment as a trusted member of the management when he was in Fuguang Cave.  Afterward, everyone left the great hall and came to the plaza, where sixteen beautiful young girls stood in a row, trembling with fear. They were all young and waited for the immortals to choose. The two leading girls were even more stunning, standing gracefully with their heads bowed, like two shy and budding flowers, refreshing and pleasing to the eye. The only flaw seemed to be their age; their bodies were not yet fully developed, lacking in some curves here and there, and not quite sensual, but they had a different charm, and perhaps some people liked this kind.  Led by Miao Yi, everyone looked over the girls. Miao Yi was also a bit restless, curious about what kind of maid Yan Xiu had personally selected for him. Yan Xiu, standing next to Miao Yi, beckoned to the two girls at the front and said, "You two come here; this is the Cave Master you will be serving!"  The two girls glanced at Yan Xiu, then quickly looked at Miao Yi, lowered their heads, and carefully stepped forward. They both bowed and said with voices as clear as orioles, "Zhao Qian'er, Liu Xue, greet the Cave Master!"  The other maids could not help but sneak a glance, all with a hint of envy. Although they were all maids to immortals, anyone with a brain knew that being the maid of the master of the place was different from being the maid of someone else.  "Lift your heads," Yan Xiu ordered the two to lift their heads for Miao Yi's appreciation, while explaining to Miao Yi, "Both of them are fifteen years old. This one is slightly older, named Zhao Qian'er, skilled in dancing. That one is named Liu Xue, skilled in playing musical instruments. Both have qualifications for cultivation. I wonder if the Cave Master is satisfied?"  One for dance and one for music? Miao Yi glanced at Yan Xiu a bit more. He was no longer the ignorant man he used to be. Finding a maid who was young, beautiful, skilled, and with cultivation qualifications was not easy, and Yan Xiu obviously put a lot of effort into it.  Seeing that he did not respond, Yan Xiu tentatively asked, "If the Cave Master is not satisfied, we can change them!"  Miao Yi pondered for a moment. Although any normal man liked beautiful women, he had made up his mind that regardless of the conditions, he would not indulge in female company until he found his second and third brothers. What if, at this very moment, they were suffering while he, as the eldest brother, was enjoying himself...  Still, he nodded and said, "No need to change, let them stay!" Having two people to serve him could reduce some distractions and be conducive to his cultivation.  After the Cave Master finished choosing, it was the turn of the others to choose. Even Shang Youlai, who guarded the mountain gate, was called over.  After everyone had chosen, two maids were left. Yan Xiu said to Qiu Shaogun, "Take these two back to help Dan Biao."  Qiu Shaogun nodded.  However, at this point, everyone realized that two maids seemed to be missing. Miao Yi was also a bit surprised. This was arranged by Yan Xiu himself with Donglai City; how could he have overlooked himself? He asked, "Where are your maids?"  Perhaps others had not noticed, but Miao Yi instantly felt a sense of unusual loneliness flash through Yan Xiu's eyes.  Yan Xiu forced a smile and bowed slightly, saying, "Yan Xiu is old and used to being alone."  Wang Zifa and others immediately joked with him, "Not old, not old, still fit for romance."  Nan Sisi and Wang Xiuqin also smiled, and everyone seemed to be in a good mood today, having received benefits.  Yan Xiu smiled awkwardly with embarrassment and pleaded with everyone with a clasped hands gesture.  That woman who could not bear the humiliation, who took up arms and rode into battle, seeking to earn the first merit to wash away the disgrace, was ultimately beheaded...  Suddenly, that image flashed through Miao Yi's mind. He silently stared at Yan Xiu for a while, then slowly turned his head away, saying nothing more.  But he understood what Yan Xiu had done. To tell the truth, because of Luo Zhen's death, he had some complaints about Yan Xiu in his heart, but today it seemed he understood that some things in the heart of this old man accustomed to flattery and fawning might be difficult to erase.  Qiu Shaogun, also a demoted soldier from Fuguang Cave, glanced thoughtfully at Yan Xiu, remaining silent...  After everyone had taken their maids and left, Yan Xiu also called two maids to follow behind Miao Yi.  The well-fed Heichan still lay dozing at the back hall's doorway, his sleek snake tail occasionally flicking the ground, living quite leisurely, which was also this creature's old habit.  Hearing the movement, he only opened his eyes to look. Seeing that it was Miao Yi returning, he sneezed and then closed his eyes again.  The group stood still in the courtyard. Zhao Qian'er and Liu Xue carefully surveyed their new surroundings, curious and nervous as newcomers.  Miao Yi turned around and said, "Yan Xiu, these two have just arrived and are not familiar with the situation. Help them get settled with what needs to be done. I'm going to take Zhu Tianbiao for an inspection of the territory."  This was also something every new Cave Master should do. It was not possible to rule over a place without being familiar with one's own territory. The time needed at the beginning still had to be spent.  Hearing that he was going out, Heichan's eyes opened wide, his ears perked up, and he half-raised his head to look.  Yan Xiu quickly stopped Miao Yi, who was about to leave, and pointed to the two girls, reminding him, "Cave Master, you haven't given them names yet."  Miao Yi was taken aback, "Don't they already have names?"  Yan Xiu smiled and said, "Those were their former secular names. Now that they belong to the Cave Master, they are supposed to be given new names by the Cave Master, signifying a transcendent new beginning. This is the usual practice for everyone."  "Oh, I see!" Miao Yi scratched his head. Although he had learned some culture from Old Bai, his knowledge was limited, and naming was not his forte. In the end, he could only laugh and say, "Zhao Qian'er, Liu Xue, from now on you will be called Qian'er and Xue'er!"  He chose names that were convenient. Yan Xiu was taken aback but had nothing more to say. He turned to the two maids and reminded them, "Haven't you thanked the Cave Master for the names?"  The two girls quickly bowed and expressed their gratitude, "Qian'er, Xue'er, thank the Cave Master for the names!" Chapter 76: Qin Weiwei in Disarray (Part 1)  Miao Yi waved his hand, not saying much, and did not pay much attention to the two maidservants, directly leaving them to Yan Xiu's supervision, before turning and striding away. Outside the grand hall, Zhu Tianbiao, who had been notified in advance, was already waiting in a change of clothes.  As soon as Miao Yi came out, Heitan rushed from behind, bit onto Miao Yi's clothes, and tugged without letting go. Zhu Tianbiao frowned upon seeing this, feeling that Heitan, this beast, was a bit too much. This was the grand hall of Donglai Cave where discussions were held, but the creature treated it as if it were a horse pen, running in and out. The misbehavior of the creature was due to the indulgence of its master, a few harsh whips would have made it behave.  However, Miao Yi wouldn't bear to whip it. Not to mention that it had saved his life, being able to run faster than others was an advantage, and it could also be used for miscellaneous tasks like catching fish. Only those who have used it know its benefits. He turned back and patted Heitan's head, "I have matters to attend to and can't take you with me. Go play in the lake by yourself, there's fish and shrimp to eat." He raised his hand and pointed in the direction of the lake.  Heitan let go of his mouth, shook its head and sneezed noisily, then sprinted wildly across the plaza, running off.  Zhu Tianbiao, who inwardly resented Heitan's lack of discipline, still complimented on the surface, "The Cave Master's mount even has some intelligence, it understands when spoken to directly, unlike our mounts. It's all due to the Cave Master's excellent training."  Miao Yi chuckled, knowing these were just pleasantries. He was aware that Heitan's temperament was not pleasing to outsiders; for example, Qin Weiwei wanted it dead. However, occasionally enjoying the feeling of being flattered wasn't too bad, even though this flattery wasn't particularly good.  Outside the mountain gate, there were two fine horses left by the Lord of Donglai City. Riding the Dragon Colt into the city would be too conspicuous, preventing him from seeing the things he wanted to see. Miao Yi also wanted to assess Xu Xinyang, the city lord's capabilities. If he was not up to par and delayed the submission of the Wish Power Pearls, his position as cave master might not last long, and if necessary, a change of city lord would be needed, regardless of the gifts sent.  Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao left the mountain gate and sped away on their horses...  At Zhenhai Mountain, Qin Weiwei, who was sitting in meditation in the quiet room, slowly finished her practice and pressed her palms on her dantian. A six-petaled lotus flower shimmered on her forehead, lifelike. As she opened her eyes, the waiting maidservants, Hongmian and Lüliu, bowed joyfully, "Congratulations to the Mountain Master for advancing to a higher level of cultivation."  Qin Weiwei withdrew her magic power and exhaled the Wish Power Pearl she had in her mouth, "It's only a breakthrough to the sixth rank of the White Lotus."  Though she said so, the uncontrollable joy on her face revealed her true feelings. The two maids smiled silently and reached out to help her loosen her clothes.  As her clothes fell aside, her voluptuous body with jade-like skin was soon exposed in the quiet room, so enticing that even women would probably have their hearts racing at the sight. Her flawless jade feet slowly stepped into the warm water pool, and she sat down, the water just covering her full, blushing chest, which was very tempting.  Hongmian and Lüliu helped her untie her hair, and together they began to wash her slowly. As Hongmian's hands passed over Qin Weiwei's full chest with a white towel, she chuckled, "The Mountain Master truly has a good figure; it's a pity not to find a dual cultivation partner with such a fine body."  "That's for sure," Lüliu giggled in agreement, "It’s truly a waste!"  Qin Weiwei's face blushed, and she scolded, "You two shameless girls!" She immediately set about dealing with them. The bathhouse splashed with water as the two girls dared not fight back, only continuously begging for mercy.  After the playful scuffle, Hongmian said seriously, "Mountain Master, I have a secret to tell you. The Lord of the Mansion called the two of us aside to ask some questions."  Curious, Qin Weiwei extended her arms for them to dry as she asked, "What did the Lord of the Mansion ask you?"  Lüliu giggled softly, "The Lord asked us if you had any man in mind, saying if there was one, to tell him immediately, and he would arrange things for you in secret."  Qin Weiwei's face turned red again, and she spat, "My father is so improper! With so many important matters to attend to, he's fussing over such trivia. Next time he asks, you tell him I'm not looking; I'm fine on my own!"  Hongmian laughed, "We dare not speak to the Lord of the Mansion like that; he might think we're the instigators. It's better to wait until you find a man you like, then we'll give him the reply."  "I'm not looking!" Qin Weiwei scoffed, "What's so good about men? Not a single one is decent." She looked around and added, "You two are lucky to be with me. If you were with a man, look at how they treat their maidservants; they are said to be maids, but in the end, they all become concubines. Just thinking about it makes me sick!"  Lüliu quietly stuck out her tongue, not daring to reply, as this included a rebuke of the Lord of the Mansion as well. Hongmian suggested, "Then Mountain Master should wait a little longer. We'll keep an eye out for you and see if there's a man of suitable status who doesn't sleep with his maids."  "Shameless, are you two in heat? One day I'll send you off to be concubines!" Qin Weiwei threatened coldly, then changed the subject, "Is there nothing else going on outside?"  When the real issue was brought up, Hongmian became serious, "Nothing much. It's just that Donglai Cave sent a message overnight, and the messenger is still waiting inside the mountain, awaiting the Mountain Master's instructions for a reply."  "Donglai Cave? That guy just left, and he's already sent a message? Isn't he taking me lightly?" Thinking of Miao Yi, Qin Weiwei was displeased and turned around, "Bring me the message."  "Yes!" Lüliu quickly got up from the bath, dried off, put on a long robe to cover herself, and left swiftly.  She returned soon after with a sealed box containing the message, opened it on the spot, and placed it beside the pool.  Qin Weiwei pulled her black hair to one side, resting on her snow-white shoulder, and leaned back against the edge, reaching into the box...  Why were there so many messages? Did that guy write a lengthy poem or article? She took out a jade slip, infused it with magic power to read it, and quickly moved on to the next one after finishing the first.  She was fine until she read them, but then she was stunned, her expression becoming more and more disordered. After reading them all, she thought she had read it wrong and went through all the messages again, carefully this time.  Still unsure after a second read-through, she meticulously checked again for any trickery. Finally, she placed the jade slips on the edge, Qin Weiwei frowned tightly, her eyes flashing with confusion and puzzlement, and she muttered, "What is this guy up to..."  Hongmian and Lüliu, not daring to disturb the Mountain Master's official duties, noticed something was off with Qin Weiwei. They didn't know what Miao Yi, the Cave Master, had written to put the Mountain Master in such a state, but they didn't see her getting angry either.  Hongmian and Lüliu exchanged glances, noting the substantial number of jade slips and messages. A single report from Donglai Cave was equivalent to all the reports sent by the various cave masters of Zhenhai Mountain. Chapter 77: Qin Weiwei in Disarray (Part 2)  After waiting for a long while and seeing that Qin Weiwei did not respond as she was lost in thought, Hongmian tentatively asked in a soft voice, "Mountain Master, has something happened at Donglai Cave?"  "......"  Qin Weiwei, who had come back to her senses, still had somewhat chaotic thoughts and didn't know what to say. She slightly lifted her hand and said, "You two take a look and help me analyze what exactly is going on with Donglai Cave."  Because of their status as maidservants, such matters were not something they dared to look into without the Mountain Master's command. Due to Qin Weiwei's discomposed appearance, both maidservants were also very curious about what was written on the jade slip. Now that the Mountain Master had commanded, they eagerly took the jade slip to examine it.  They were oblivious at first, but after reading it, both women were also thrown into disarray.  After examining the jade slip back and forth and exchanging it between themselves, they clearly shared Qin Weiwei's doubts, worrying whether it was a forgery, and checked it again and again.  However, the ten memorials were clearly written by ten different people with different magical powers, and the magical signature seal that was applied was impossible to fake, as unique as each person's fingerprint.  In the end, holding the jade slip, Lüliu said in a daze, "That Miao Cave Master is so amazing! He subdued the entire Donglai Cave faction overnight!"  Qin Weiwei, who was thinking, couldn't help but roll her eyes upon hearing this and sarcastically said, "With his level of cultivation, do you think that's possible?"  Hongmian muttered, "It is a bit strange!"  Both maidservants had been by Qin Weiwei's side for a long time and were also aware of the current situation in Nanxuan Prefecture.  For the Prefecture Master Yang Qing, bringing Lan Yumen under his jurisdiction was like harboring a wolf in one's home. In fact, Yang Qing was not in a hurry to rebel at first and wanted to slowly accumulate strength, but the former Prefecture Master Lu Yu could not watch Yang Qing grow stronger. Lu Yu issued a decree to transfer Yang Qing to his side for an appointment, intending to undermine him.  Yang Qing knew that once he went to Lu Yu's side, Lu Yu would no longer give him a chance to stand out.  It was precisely because of Lu Yu's actions that Yang Qing was forced to make a decisive decision, agreeing to cooperate with Lan Yumen and in one fell swoop, killing Lu Yu and taking over Nanxuan Prefecture.  Yang Qing and Lan Yumen indeed both benefited, but some matters were clear to both sides.  Lan Yumen knew that Yang Qing was not someone who would be content with being subordinate and would definitely find a way to cut off Lan Yumen's influence over Nanxuan. And Yang Qing also knew that although Lan Yumen currently did not dare to act rashly, once they took advantage of this entry and gradually established connections up and down, they would definitely find a way to replace him, Yang Qing.  Yang Qing dared to rebel also because over the years, he had cultivated some connections within the system, and there were people beside the Palace Master who would speak for him. Otherwise, even if Yang Qing took over Nanxuan, without the recognition from the Palace Master's side, Nanxuan would not be his share, and he might even have to bear the crime of rebellion.  Lan Yumen dared not act rashly, lacking exactly this kind of connection, and did not dare to confront the vast systemic power.  But if the relationships were straightened out, the people under Lan Yumen's influence in Nanxuan Prefecture were more numerous than Yang Qing's people. Once they made a move against Yang Qing, it would be difficult for him to resist.  Both sides understood that the cooperation was temporary, at most another fifty years. It was likely that they would turn against each other, depending on who had the upper hand at that time. It was either the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind over the east.  Because Yang Qing lacked people, although all the major positions in the vast Nanxuan Prefecture were controlled by his own people, the more numerous secondary positions were almost all occupied by people from Lan Yumen.  Not only other factions but Zhenhai Mountain itself was currently facing this situation. Qin Weiwei was also facing covert non-compliance from the people of Lan Yumen below her. However, because Qin Weiwei was Yang Qing's goddaughter, the disciples of Lan Yumen directly under her jurisdiction did not dare to openly oppose her, and currently had to give Yang Qing some face.  But the Cave Masters under Qin Weiwei did not have this privilege. The memorials they sent were all complaining to Qin Weiwei, saying that the people from Lan Yumen were secretly non-compliant and that things were difficult to handle.  The nine Cave Masters below her all sent memorials of grievances, yet the one with the weakest strength sent the only piece of good news.  The Cave Master with only a White Lotus first-grade cultivation level had just taken office when he killed a disciple of Lan Yumen with a White Lotus third-grade cultivation level. This matter could have caused a storm between Lan Yumen and Yang Qing.  But what happened? Lan Yumen unanimously accused the person named Song Fu of deserving his punishment, listing the numerous misdeeds of Song Fu. With unanimous condemnation, they fully supported the actions of the Cave Master, and Lan Yumen probably had to suppress their objections.  Seeing this good news, Qin Weiwei was not the least bit happy but full of doubts instead. That bastard had just arrived, and overnight, he managed to manage the entire Donglai Cave so tightly?  Especially the disciples of Lan Yumen closely rallying around Miao Cave Master... What a joke? It was nauseating to even think about.  What was this all about? Was it slapping the faces of the other nine Cave Masters, or slapping her face, Mountain Master Qin Weiwei? Were they all not as capable as Miao Cave Master? Was it foolish of her, Qin Weiwei, to not want Miao Cave Master to take up the post in Donglai Cave initially?  But to say it was all a sham, the testimonies of these people could not be faked!  Could it be that the person named Song Fu was truly so detestable?  But how detestable must one be to make all the disciples of Lan Yumen feel displeased?  Qin Weiwei shook her head slightly, feeling that it was not right. Even if Song Fu was extremely detestable, it was impossible for all the disciples of Lan Yumen to submit memorials condemning him and expressing support for Miao Cave Master.  That bastard had just arrived, and with such a low level of cultivation, where did he get such great prestige?  To say it was some kind of overwhelming aura that subdued others, Qin Weiwei would not believe it even if she were beaten to death.  Hongmian and Lüliu also furrowed their brows tightly, looking utterly puzzled.  "No need to wash, change my clothes, and summon that messenger to see me!"  Qin Weiwei stood up from the water with a splash, and with a spell, a mist burst from the mutton fat jade bottle, instantly drying the droplets of water on her body.  The two maidservants immediately helped her put on her clothes and shoes, and her hair was quickly done up, with six white jade hairpins arranged in the shape of a butterfly securing the bun at the back of her head.  In the grand hall of Zhenhai Mountain, the cold-faced Mountain Master Qin Weiwei sat high above.  The single messenger, Dan Biao Yi, was questioned until he was trembling with fear, but no matter how Qin Weiwei asked, he insisted that it was because Song Fu did not obey the Cave Master's orders, which led to the destruction of the mountain gate, and he was disrespectful to the Cave Master, leading to his execution as a warning to others.  Regarding Miao Yi's possibility of killing a White Lotus third-grade cultivator, Qin Weiwei did not need to have much doubt. The battle at Fuguang Cave had been witnessed, and she had also heard of Miao Yi's deeds in eliminating ghost cultivators. Two White Lotus third-grade cultivators had died, and it was that man who had completed the task and returned alone, so it was entirely possible for Miao Yi to kill Song Fu.  But she was not a fool. Was it so simple to get all the disciples of Donglai Cave from Lan Yumen to submit memorials together to help Miao Yi escape responsibility?  "Dan Biao Yi, are you sure you're not hiding anything from me?" Qin Weiwei stared down and snorted coldly.  People at the bottom were not clear about the struggles at the top. Dan Biao Yi only knew that he had personally participated in the killing of Song Fu. Once he admitted it, not only would the people from Donglai Cave not tolerate him, but Lan Yumen's people would also seek revenge on him. Moreover, it was related to the acquisition of merit beads in multiples.  So he could not tell the truth even if he died. Dan Biao Yi adamantly maintained that this was the case, leaving Qin Weiwei somewhat helpless. She vaguely felt that Donglai Cave had indeed been managed by that bastard into a solid unit overnight.  It couldn't be said that the bastard was just born lucky, happening to encounter a large group of people dead set on loyalty, right? That would be closer to deceiving ghosts! Chapter 78: Qin Weiwei in Disarray (Part Three)  "Go ahead and leave!" Qin Weiwei said with a cold face, dismissing Shan Biaoyi. After Shan Biaoyi had left, Hongmian, who was beside her, asked, "Mountain Master, should we report this matter to the Mansion Master?"  "How can I report it when the situation isn't clear yet?" Qin Weiwei shook her head and rejected the idea, then immediately sent Lüliu to randomly summon a Blue Jade Sect disciple.  Shortly after, a Blue Jade Sect disciple entered the hall to pay respects to the Mountain Master, and Qin Weiwei asked, "Do you recognize your fellow sect member, Song Fu?"  "Song Fu?" The newcomer was startled, not knowing what had happened, but still nodded and said, "I know him."  Qin Weiwei then asked, "What is Song Fu's character like?"  The person paused again, unsure why the Mountain Master was asking this, but nonetheless replied with a bow, "Junior Brother Song is honest and simple-natured, respects his teachers and values the Way, and his character is impeccable!"  Regardless of what had happened to Song Fu, or whether he got along with him, when facing outsiders, it was natural for sect members to stand up for each other. In unclear situations, saying good things was definitely correct.  After Qin Weiwei waved him away, pointing to the departing figure outside the door, she said to Hongmian and Lüliu standing by her side, "Did you see that? That is what fellow sect brothers should say, unlike the people from Donglai Cave, which is completely unreasonable!"  Hongmian asked, "Mountain Master, what do you plan to do?"  Qin Weiwei suddenly stood up and said, "Hearing is false, seeing is believing. I will go to Donglai Cave myself to see if the followers there really support our great Miao Cave Master as they claim! If he dares to cause me any trouble and disrupt the current situation, I will not spare him!"  Lüliu tentatively asked, "What if they are truly supportive?"  Qin Weiwei firmly insisted, "That's impossible. There must be something fishy going on. If they were truly supportive, I would let him take my place as Mountain Master. If he really has the ability, let him deal with those Blue Jade Sect disciples at Zhenhai Mountain, that would also ease the Mansion Master's mind!"  Hongmian and Lüliu exchanged glances and stuck out their tongues, knowing the Mountain Master was just speaking angrily and not to take it seriously. However, it seemed a bit... to immediately check on him after he had just taken office.  Not long after, Shan Biaoyi, who had received a reply, could finally return to Donglai Cave. However, he couldn't relax and was instead on tenterhooks the whole way because the Mountain Master Qin Weiwei was coming along with several people!  The Cave Master had just taken office and had already managed to summon the Mountain Master. Ah... Shan Biaoyi sighed in his heart, praying for divine protection along the way, hoping that the Cave Master had arranged everything well and wouldn't reveal any flaws.  It's difficult to disembark once you board a ship of thieves! Although there might be holes everywhere and water leaking, those who are on the ship must unite and row forward desperately. If they don't row forward, they will drown; rowing forward there might be a glimmer of survival.  Miao Yi didn't understand the entanglement between Yang Qing above and the Blue Jade Sect, and that's just how it is for those at the bottom. Besides, he had only recently surrendered to Yang Qing and did not know much insider information.  From his point of view, he was the legitimate Cave Master of Donglai Cave, and the people of Donglai Cave naturally had to listen to him. If they didn't obey, he naturally had to deal with it immediately. Why would he drag it out? Quickly and firmly taking control of the entire Donglai Cave was the sensible thing to do, otherwise, what would be the point of being the Cave Master?  He had no idea that his swift actions in taking control of the entire Donglai Cave had caused anxiety above. However, not knowing had its benefits, at least for now he was spared from worry.  At that moment, Miao Yi, dressed in fine clothes, was leisurely strolling down the streets of Donglai City. Zhu Tianbiao was still a silent type, not speaking unless spoken to, and his occasional attempt at flattery was not impressive. He only knew to follow behind with a treasured sword in hand, like a guard.  Miao Yi had taken him out precisely for protection. Having a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator with him would provide a shield in case of any trouble.  Ahead by the roadside was a festively decorated building with a large crowd gathered around. It seemed that a well-to-do young lady from some family was throwing an embroidered ball, attracting the attention of Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao as they passed by, but they did not linger.  The young lady in the building held the embroidered ball, her shy eyes scanning the crowd for her ideal gentleman. Her gaze quickly locked onto Miao Yi as he passed by. Miao Yi might not be a paragon of men, but as a young man who had just ascended to the position of Cave Master, he was riding high on success. Coupled with the aura of a cultivator, his presence was not something ordinary folk could match.  Moreover, with a guard following him, it was clear he was someone of status. The young lady, biting her lip, threw the embroidered ball with force and accuracy, showing her prowess as someone who dared to throw the ball, perhaps having practiced a bit, lest she accidentally hit an unsuitable old man and cause a great deal of trouble.  As the ball flew out, the crowd below reached up to grab it, but it flew over their heads. Miao Yi, walking ahead, didn't even look as he flicked his hand and the incoming embroidered ball flew back to the building.  Zhu Tianbiao simply turned his head to look and silently followed behind Miao Yi, brushing past the crowd without a word. The young lady holding the returned embroidered ball was dumbstruck, watching the two men walk away calmly. Biting her lip, she felt a great loss of face; it was unheard of for a thrown embroidered ball to be thrown back.  The crowd below was also stunned, craning their necks to watch the two men walk away, then turned back and started to shout, "Miss, throw again, throw again..."  But the young lady bit her lip, turned her head, and disappeared inside the building...  In Donglai City, there was a river that ran across, and Zhu Tianbiao, after inquiring about the boat fare from the boatman, boarded a black-canopied boat with Miao Yi. The boatman rowed, taking the two of them along the river.  Miao Yi stood at the bow with his hands behind his back, while Zhu Tianbiao held his sword at the rear. Not far from the departure, a sound of horse hooves was heard on the shore. Looking back, they saw the young lady who had thrown the embroidered ball, leading several strong men galloping toward them.  "Stop right there!" shouted the young lady, pointing at Miao Yi who was standing at the bow of the boat.  Miao Yi looked around and, taking advantage of the moment when no one was paying attention, displayed the lotus phantom on his forehead to the other party, hoping they would back off upon seeing it. Unexpectedly, the other party continued to chase after him fearlessly, not afraid of immortals? Miao Yi was surprised and then realized that he had used Ling Yin Mud on his forehead, making it invisible to the other party.  He had become addicted to using this substance because his cultivation was a bit low, and being a Cave Master, he was afraid of being looked down upon, so he simply hid the lotus phantom on his forehead, so as not to be laughed at by others.  He then secretly signaled Zhu Tianbiao with a mental message. Zhu Tianbiao suddenly turned back and stared coldly at the young lady, revealing the lotus phantom on his forehead. The sight shocked the young lady and her companions, causing them to halt their horses and not dare to act rashly.  The young lady woke from her dream, understanding why the other party had disregarded her. She felt the vast difference between them and bit her lip in frustration...  For Miao Yi, this was just a minor interlude. Chapter 79: Qin Weiwei in Disarray (Part 4)  On both banks of the small river, green willows swayed gently. Occasionally, one could see women squatting by the riverside washing clothes and vegetables. There were also buildings of the pleasure quarters, where girls clad in bright dresses waved handkerchiefs and cooed in soft, charming voices from the balconies, trying to attract tourists passing by on the boats at the front.  Further ahead, along the riverbank, young noblemen recited poetry and composed verses in hopes of drawing the attention of groups of young women out for a spring outing. The women, blushing, sneak glances at the young lords standing at the prow of the canopy boats with an impressive demeanor.  On the flower boats brushing past the canopy boats, heavily made-up madams loudly invited the noblemen at the front of the boats to come aboard for a drink. In the taverns, wealthy patrons called out to friends, exchanging punches and toasting with hearty drinks.  On the shore, peddlers and porters bustled back and forth, and children chased and played with each other. Living by the water is human nature; traveling by boat, one could truly witness the prosperity of Donglai City.  Although the people of this world have to dedicate three hours each day to contribute their spiritual energy and pay taxes, they do so in exchange for the protection of cultivators, who eliminate demons and drive away ghosts and spirits to ensure peace in the region.  The Six Saints of Heaven and Earth also rely on the cultivators scattered across various regions to accumulate spiritual energy bit by bit. Otherwise, even with their great power, they would not be able to manage such a vast area.  It is precisely because of these cultivators that the officialdom and the powerful do not dare to oppress the believers too much and disrupt the collection of spiritual energy. The cultivators would be the first to not let them off the hook.  Although cultivators do not often appear openly, they undoubtedly stabilize the world's order.  Of course, not everyone living along the riverbanks has to contribute three hours of spiritual energy daily like ordinary people. Those with power and influence can find someone to complete the task on their behalf at places like the "Benevolent Wishes Bureau" or even hire others to do it for them.  Thus, those who should toil still toil, and those who should indulge in luxury remain unaffected. Some are busy while others are idle; such is the rule of life in this world.  Regardless, for Miao Yi, who stood at the prow inspecting his territory, seeing his followers live and work in peace allowed him to temporarily set aside the worry of not being able to successfully hand in the spiritual energy beads at the end of the year...  As night fell, Shan Biao Yi's heart was in turmoil as he galloped under the stars and moon.  Seeing that they were about to reach Donglai Cave, Shan Biao Yi braced himself to speed up and run ahead, falling slightly behind Qin Weiwei. He clenched his fists and said, "Mountain Master, I will immediately go ahead to the cave dwelling to inform them, so they can welcome the Mountain Master's divine presence."  In reality, he wanted to signal everyone, so the cave master and the others could mentally prepare themselves.  Qin Weiwei looked back at him, snorted coldly, and said, "No need."  Then she ordered the people following her at high speed, "Keep an eye on him and don't give him the chance to signal ahead. I want to see what kind of tricks Donglai Cave is playing!"  Shan Biao Yi's heart skipped a beat as two cultivators of the White Lotus Third Grade quickly caught up and flanked him on both sides.  The group of five, under the moonlight, burst through the gates of Donglai Cave at a speed as fast as lightning.  The gatekeeper, Shang Youlai, suddenly emerged from the shadows, blocking the way at the gate with a spear pointed forward and shouted loudly, "Dismount!"  The booming voice echoed, serving as a warning to others in the cave dwelling.  As soon as the alarm was raised, people from their respective practice residences quickly appeared and rushed towards 'Wolong Valley.' Six figures, armed and riding six steeds, sped towards the scene to prepare for any emergency.  Qin Weiwei, however, would not do something as brash as charging through the gate and breaking the rules. She had already motioned for her followers to stop, and the five of them quickly steadied their steeds, halting in front of the gate. Anyone else would have been thrown off instantly.  On the other side of the gate, another six fierce steeds quickly assembled and charged forward.  Qin Weiwei was somewhat surprised, not expecting such a quick response from Donglai Cave. This efficiency was exceptional.  This was because Miao Yi had previously warned that if the gate was smashed again, they would have to settle accounts with the prince. Miao Yi had also said that those who disobeyed would not receive a single spiritual energy bead and would even be driven away!  Where could one find such generous treatment in any other cave dwelling? Besides, everyone's weaknesses were in Miao Yi's grasp, and everyone was eager to work hard to avoid Miao Yi's questioning.  Upon recognizing Mountain Master Qin Weiwei, the gatekeeper Shang Youlai immediately shut his mouth and saluted with a fist.  The emergency responders, including Yan Xiu and others who had hurriedly come to prevent any unforeseen incidents, looked at each other in bewilderment. They quickly dismounted and walked quickly to the gate, greeting her with clasped fists.  Many glanced towards Shan Biao Yi, who had accompanied Qin Weiwei, seemingly questioning why there was no advance notice of the Mountain Master's arrival.  Some even secretly transmitted messages to Shan Biao Yi inquiring about the situation. However, Shan Biao Yi was in a difficult position, as the two people on either side of him were prepared to prevent him from sending any messages, casting spells to interfere in front of him.  Qin Weiwei looked up at the archway of the mountain gate and snorted, "This archway is even more imposing than that of Nanxuan Prefecture!"  The crowd sensed the ill intent in her arrival; nobody knew what to say.  After scanning the crowd, Qin Weiwei led her followers directly into the cave dwelling and dismounted outside the main hall. Shan Biao Yi, held captive, followed Qin Weiwei into the main hall.  There was no one in the main hall, so Qin Weiwei proceeded directly to the courtyard where the cave master resided. In the courtyard, Black Charcoal lay lazily by someone's door, casually wagging its tail, which occasionally tapped lightly on the ground. Upon seeing Qin Weiwei, Black Charcoal's eyes widened in alarm and it sprang up, seemingly unsure where to hide.  With no other choice, Black Charcoal leaped dozens of meters high and landed outside the courtyard, hastily fleeing.  That beast! Qin Weiwei was both amused and annoyed. Was she that frightening? Although she disliked Black Charcoal, she wouldn't go so far as to storm into her subordinate's home in the middle of the night and slaughter her subordinate's mount. If she were to commit such a petty act, she couldn't afford to lose face.  There was no sign of Miao Yi outside, and she barged into Miao Yi's private chambers and meditation room without notice, only to find them empty.  Upon exiting the chambers and looking around, Qin Weiwei noticed a brightly lit room to the side. She immediately went over and kicked the door open with a 'bang.'  Inside, two beautiful maids dressed in revealing clothes screamed in fright, hugging each other and trembling at the sight of Qin Weiwei who had barged in.  Obviously, the maids living in the cave master's rear quarters were Miao Yi's personal attendants.  Qin Weiwei glanced at her own maid, Hong Mian, who had followed her, with a mocking look in her eyes, as if to say, "Look, all men are the same."  Hong Mian smiled without a word. This time, only she had come along; Lü Liu had not.  After searching the room and finding no sign of Miao Yi, Qin Weiwei stared coldly at the two trembling maids and asked, "Where has your cave master gone?"  The two maids shook their heads silently.  "Hmph!" Qin Weiwei disdainfully left the two maids alone, walked out, and led her people back to the main hall. She went straight to the high seat and sat where Miao Yi would normally sit, looking out at the door and shouting, "Yan Xiu!"  Yan Xiu, who had been waiting obediently outside the main hall, immediately ran in, bowing and scraping. Chapter 80: Drag Him Out and Behead Him  Qin Weiwei asked, "Where has Miao Yi gone?"  Yan Xiu apologetically said, "The cave master has gone to inspect the territory."  Qin Weiwei was taken aback, realizing that the guy was really confident about his home affairs, daring to leave the cave dwelling to inspect the territory shortly after arriving.  She asked again, "When will he come back?"  "This..." Yan Xiu shook his head, "I also don't know when the cave master will return."  Qin Weiwei coldly snorted, "Then immediately find him and bring him back to me."  Yan Xiu looked like he was about to cry, "Mountain Master, the Donglai Cave territory is so vast..."  He dared not finish his sentence, implying that with such a large area, where could they possibly go to find him?  Qin Weiwei thought about it and realized that it was indeed a bit difficult for them, so she didn't dwell on it and started to call in people one by one to ask about the killing of Song Fu and the matter of everyone submitting letters of condemnation.  "Did Miao Yi use any means to threaten you?"  "Why would Mountain Master think so? The cave master definitely did not threaten us. It's just that Song Fu really didn't know the immensity of heaven and earth. Although he was from the same sect, I really couldn't stand it..."  Even if Qin Weiwei sealed the mouth of Dan Biaoyi, it was useless. No matter how she beat around the bush or how she threatened and tempted, it was useless. Everyone stubbornly refused to say anything else, only talking about Song Fu's faults, resolutely defending Miao, the great cave master, making Qin Weiwei so angry that her teeth itched. If only all of Zhenhai Mountain were like this, but unfortunately, there was only one Donglai Cave.  There was obviously something fishy going on, but these people, whether it was Yan Xiu, whom she had personally sent, or the people from the Blue Jade Sect, were all as tight-lipped as can be, refusing to give in.  Qin Weiwei planned to settle accounts with Miao Yi when he returned.  However, after waiting for three days without seeing Miao Yi return, she had no idea when that guy would come back.  What left her speechless was that even though the cave master was not there, a group of subordinates still managed the affairs of Donglai Cave in an orderly manner.  The disciples of the Blue Jade Sect, who were reported by other cave masters to be unwilling to guard the mountain gate and do chores, were nowhere to be seen in Donglai Cave. Instead, it was Miao Yi's trusted subordinates like Yan Xiu who didn't have to do these things, and all the disciples of the Blue Jade Sect were loyally performing their duties.  Moreover, people like Wang Zifa were obviously very polite to Yan Xiu, which showed what their attitude towards the great cave master Miao would be.  Look at the great cave master Miao, who in just one night managed Donglai Cave so well, holding high prestige in the eyes of his subordinates.  The people she personally appointed couldn't manage the affairs of the caves properly, each one coming to her to complain, while the person she was reluctant to appoint managed everything perfectly. Who was being slapped in the face?  Qin Weiwei could barely hold back her frustration, wondering if she was judging a gentleman's belly with the heart of a villain?  Now, being in a time of trouble, she couldn't possibly stay here forever, who knows when Miao Yi would come back.  After waiting for three more days, she finally left with her people, not knowing what she intended to do, but she took Dan Biaoyi with her.  This left Yan Xiu and the others who were at the mountain gate to send her off feeling very anxious, each of them signaling to Dan Biaoyi with their eyes, "You must hold on!"  Everyone knew clearly that once Dan Biaoyi couldn't hold on and spilled everything, whether they could get the wish-granting beads from Cave Master Miao was secondary. The key point was that the people from the Blue Jade Sect would not let them off.  Yan Xiu and the others had killed disciples of the Blue Jade Sect.  And the people from the Blue Jade Sect were equivalent to committing an act of betrayal against their sect.  Now that they had caused such a commotion, the people from the Blue Jade Sect were very afraid and regretful, regretting why they had boarded the thief's ship in the first place, causing them to face Qin Weiwei's promise of great rewards and still not dare to leave the ship. They had to desperately paddle the leaking ship that was about to sink without turning back to shore.  Qin Weiwei, noticing everyone's expressions out of the corner of her eye, kept a cold face, becoming even more certain that there was something fishy going on.  Her maid, Hong Mian, glanced at her mistress and couldn't help but suppress a laugh, thinking that regardless of whether there was any trickery, being able to stick together like this clearly showed that the cave master Miao had indeed managed to get these people to obey him thoroughly. No wonder others dared to leave the cave's affairs to run around elsewhere. If other cave masters had this ability, the affairs of Zhenhai Mountain would be easy to handle.  It's just that she didn't know if what the mountain master said about giving up her position to Cave Master Miao if he truly won the support of his subordinates was true...  Qin Weiwei obviously saw what she was thinking and glared at her fiercely, could a rhetorical question also be taken seriously?  Qin Weiwei, who hurried back to Zhenhai Mountain, did not rest. After asking if there were any urgent matters, she took Dan Biaoyi and went straight to Nanxuan Prefecture.  Yang Qing, who had handpicked a trusted subordinate, had killed a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect shortly after taking office. This matter could not be concealed and would inevitably be exposed. Whether or not the Blue Jade Sect would react, they would at least inquire about it, and Qin Weiwei had to personally report the details to ensure Yang Qing was prepared.  Dan Biaoyi was somewhat panicked upon learning that they were going to Nanxuan Prefecture again. Was it necessary for the situation to escalate like this?  The lower ranks did not know the high-level affairs, which involved complex behind-the-scenes struggles. If they had known, they might not have dared to act as they did.  After arriving at Nanxuan Prefecture, Qin Weiwei did not need to be announced to see Yang Qing.  Following behind Qingju, she came to the pavilion on the highest peak of the back mountain and saw Yang Qing, who was meditating.  "Qin Weiwei pays respects to the Prefecture Master!" Qin Weiwei, dressed in white like snow, saluted.  In the presence of others, Qin Weiwei always maintained the etiquette of a superior and subordinate with Yang Qing, only calling him 'father' in very private situations.  Yang Qing slowly ended his meditation and opened his eyes, exhaling a wish-granting bead the size of a quail egg from his mouth, smiling and asking, "Why has Weiwei come?"  He rose and sat down by a small table on the side, stretching out his hand to indicate for her to sit and talk, "What's the matter?"  Qin Weiwei sat down on the chair on the other side of the small table, "Prefecture Master, the cave master of Donglai Cave you personally appointed seems to have caused you trouble."  Yang Qing uttered an 'oh' and frowned slightly, "Miao Yi? What trouble has he caused?"  "Prefecture Master, please see for yourself." Qin Weiwei placed the box carrying the memorial tablets she brought with her in front of him.  After Yang Qing opened and looked through it, he was also confused.  Under the gaze of Qingmei and Qingju exchanging glances, Yang Qing quickly rechecked the jade tablets one by one.  He was a person capable of handling matters and did not react as dramatically as Qin Weiwei did at first, only expressing some curiosity by asking, "Weiwei, what's this situation about?"  "I also don't know what happened. To verify this, I specifically made a trip to Donglai Cave, only to find that Miao Yi had gone out to inspect his territory..."  Qin Weiwei detailed the situation she had witnessed at that time.  After Yang Qing listened, he tapped his fingers lightly on the table, pondered for a long time, shook his head as he couldn't figure it out, and eventually said, "Call over the person you brought, I'll ask him myself."  Dan Biaoyi was quickly summoned, and being face to face with a high-ranking person like Yang Qing for the first time, coupled with the guilt in his heart, made him extremely nervous.  However, he did manage one thing: no matter how Yang Qing asked, he just repeated the same old story.  Yang Qing did not ask as evasively as Qin Weiwei did. He got up, walked slowly to the railing of the pavilion, gazing at the distant mountainscape, his hands slowly clasped behind his back, his expression emotionless, and calmly said, "Drag him out, behead him!"  Qingmei and Qingju moved instantly, simultaneously seizing Dan Biaoyi's shoulders, restraining him from moving, and directly dragged him out. Chapter 81: Captured  This is no joke; both Qingmei and Qingju possess the cultivation of the White Lotus Seventh Rank. When the two of them take action together, even Dan Biao Yi, who is merely at the White Lotus Second Rank, doesn't stand a chance to resist. He was captured without the opportunity to fight back, resistance was futile.  Qin Weiwei glanced at Dan Biao Yi being dragged away without uttering a word. After all, Miao Yi was appointed by Yang Qing, and she had to give face to Yang Qing if not to Miao Yi. It wouldn't be good to recklessly kill Miao Yi's subordinates without any evidence. However, Yang Qing could do it, and if he did, nobody could say anything about it.  Dan Biao Yi was stunned and only after regaining a bit of his clarity did he realize he had been forcibly dragged outside of the pavilion, which scared him to the point of losing his soul. He knew that Yang Qing might be trying to scare him, mainly wanting to pry out the inside information, but he also knew that once Yang Qing had spoken, if he couldn't give a satisfactory answer, Yang Qing wouldn't change his statement for a small fry like him. To kill him would mean nothing to the other party.  "Master of the house, I was wrong, I'll speak, please give me another chance, master of the house, I'll speak, I'll speak..." Dan Biao Yi, dragged outside the pavilion, struggled and screamed for mercy, his complexion turning pale with fright.  Yang Qing, leaning on the railing and gazing at the distant mountains, didn't turn his head, just lightly raised his hand from behind.  Qingmei and Qingju looked at each other and both released Dan Biao Yi.  Dan Biao Yi, still in a state of shock, stumbled back into the pavilion, knelt down with a thud behind Yang Qing, his face ashen as he said, "Master of the house, I'll speak!"  Yang Qing, with his back turned, calmly asked, "Why did the people of the Lan Jade Sect all submit a joint memorial to condemn Song Fu?"  "It was... It was forced by Cave Master Miao!" Dan Biao Yi managed to say these words with great difficulty. If Miao Yi remained the Cave Master of the Donglai Cave after this incident, he knew that he would no longer be welcome there.  Qingmei and Qingju listened intently.  Qin Weiwei's gaze flickered, wondering if the mystery was finally about to be unraveled. Anyone could guess that the people of the Lan Jade Sect were definitely under some kind of pressure; it was just unknown what means Miao Yi had used to exert such pressure.  "Explain the cause and effect clearly!" Yang Qing said without the slightest ripple in his tone.  Despite facing away from Dan Biao Yi and speaking calmly, he exerted immense pressure on Dan Biao Yi, who understood that if the listener detected anything amiss, the other party could decide his life or death in an instant, and he wouldn't have the slightest chance to resist.  "Reporting to the master of the house, indeed, it was the people of the Lan Jade Sect who were rude first. Before Cave Master Miao arrived at the Donglai Cave, the disciples of the Lan Jade Sect did not obey the temporary leadership, instead, they were defiant and confrontational everywhere. With their overwhelming numbers, we were powerless against them. On the day that Cave Master Miao took office and arrived at the mountain gate of Donglai Cave, he found no one guarding it and with a roar..."  Dan Biao Yi recounted the whole story honestly and in detail. From when Yan Xiu and three others rushed to the mountain gate upon hearing the news, to Miao Yi scolding the lack of guards at the Donglai Cave's gate, and to Yan Xiu complaining about the Lan Jade Sect's misdeeds.  Song Fu and others from the Lan Jade Sect arrived late and even ridiculed Miao Yi with their words. Hearing this, Yang Qing, with his back to everyone, slightly narrowed his eyes, a cold light flashing through. Miao Yi was the person he had sent, and everyone knew that Miao Yi was his confidant. Even his confidant, upon taking office, was treated with such contempt by the Lan Jade Sect, which indicated the situation elsewhere.  "What did your cave master do at that time?" Yang Qing asked indifferently.  Dan Biao Yi immediately continued, "At that time, the cave master didn't say a second word, directly ordering his subordinates to rush to Zhenhai Mountain to report to the mountain master, claiming that the Lan Jade Sect had rebelled. This frightened the Lan Jade Sect disciples, and they reluctantly paid their respects to Cave Master Miao. However, Cave Master Miao showed no courtesy, and on the spot ordered Song Fu, who was at the cultivation of White Lotus Third Rank, to guard the mountain gate. Regardless of whether Song Fu agreed, he directly charged at them with his dragon steed!"  Yang Qing, standing with his hands behind his back, showed a hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth. He could imagine how domineering and aggressive Miao Yi was at that time, giving no quarter and not taking the Lan Jade Sect's people seriously at all. That was indeed like the confidant he, Yang Qing, had personally appointed to go, which made him proud.  "And after that? How did you end up killing Song Fu?" Yang Qing asked.  "Actually, Song Fu wasn't killed by the cave master, but by me, Yan Xiu, and Qiu Shaoqun working together..." Having said this much, Dan Biao Yi naturally wouldn't keep hiding the details, and continued to narrate. He mentioned that Miao Yi gathered the three of them to discuss the matter, predicting that Song Fu would act contrary to the orders and not guard the mountain gate. Thus, he instructed Qiu Shaoqun to secretly smash their own mountain gate, planning to take the opportunity to deal with Song Fu. At the time, everyone thought it was a serious matter and feared it would cause trouble, but Miao Yi insisted on using Song Fu as an example.  Afterwards, Qiu Shaoqun smashed the mountain gate, causing a commotion. Miao Yi seized the opportunity to lash out, and while searching for the enemy, he dispersed the Lan Jade Sect disciples. Then he summoned Song Fu to the Donglai Main Hall to be questioned. Song Fu refused to admit any wrongdoing, and the already prepared Yan Xiu, Dan Biao Yi, and Qiu Shaoqun had secretly returned. Following Miao Yi's command, the three joined forces and killed Song Fu inside the main hall.  Subsequently, Miao Yi intimidated and lured the Lan Jade Sect disciples, forcing everyone to write a memorial and pressuring the Lan Jade Sect disciples to rebuild the mountain gate overnight. He also spoke about how everyone was afraid afterward and banded together to deal with Qin Weiwei, revealing everything thoroughly.  After finishing, Dan Biao Yi bowed his head and said, "That's all there is to the events."  Qingmei and Qingju exchanged looks, realizing they had underestimated Cave Master Miao. Describing him as both intelligent and brave was not an exaggeration. In just a few hours after arriving at Donglai Cave, he had managed to get the entire place under control with his thunderous methods. Truly impressive.  Qin Weiwei bit her red lips slightly, the mystery now unveiled. She felt as if now that she knew, she almost wished she hadn't found out. Having heard about that young man's display of power made it seem as if he was the only capable person in the entire Zhenhai Mountain, which annoyed her greatly.  After mulling it over for a while with his eyes closed, Yang Qing slowly turned around and looked at the kneeling Dan Biao Yi, saying, "Get up!"  "Thank you, Cave Master!" Dan Biao Yi stood up with a bitter expression, unsure of what his fate would be.  However, Yang Qing didn't make things difficult for him. Instead, he said, "Don't let anyone know about what you said today. Pretend nothing has happened, and no one will hold you accountable. If anything else happens in Donglai Cave in the future, I grant you the right to report directly to the Zhenhai Mountain Master in secret. Do you understand what I mean?"  Dan Biao Yi was stunned, then his face showed joy as he understood Yang Qing's meaning. He was being told that he wouldn't disclose the matter, and that he had been personally designated as an inside man for Donglai Cave, indicating that he had caught Yang Qing's eye. It was unexpected that what seemed like a bad situation had turned into a good one.  "Your subordinate understands, your subordinate will obey!" Dan Biao Yi said with joyful fists clasped.  This sequence of fear, terror, and then joy was too much of a contrast, almost too much for him to adapt to. Chapter 82: The Wise Cave Master  "Reward him!" Yang Qing nodded with a smile. Qing Mei immediately took out a grain of rice-sized pearl that emitted a soft halo from the storage ring and rewarded it to Dan Biao Yi.  "Thank you, Cave Master, thank you for the reward!" An overjoyed Dan Biao Yi thanked him repeatedly.  "Dismissed!" Yang Qing waved his hand.  After Dan Biao Yi had gone far down the mountain, Yang Qing chuckled twice and shook his head, "He just took office and secretly smashed his own sect's gate. This kid really dared to do it. It's a loss he came up with such an idea. Ah! With both wisdom and courage, he can be of great use. If he becomes the master of a mountain, he can solve many troubles for me. It's just that his cultivation is a bit too low. To be a cave master is already a stretch, promoting him further would be too much. I had previously sent him, a White Lotus first rank, to preside over the Dong Lai Cave just to see how many in Nan Xuan Prefecture would listen to my words, to see if I could make a decisive impact. It wasn't out of impetuousness, but to see who would step out to stop it. I was worried about whether it was right or wrong to actually put him in Dong Lai Cave. But now it seems that the kid is quite capable, and I was worrying too much."  Qing Mei and Qing Ju looked at each other and both saw Yang Qing's increasing appreciation for Miao Yi. They knew that as soon as the time was right, he would surely be reused. As maids, the two of them also understood that they should not be too distant towards that Cave Master Miao in the future.  But Qin Weiwei pouted, seemingly a bit displeased.  Little did she know, Yang Qing had already smiled and directly called out to her, asking, "Weiwei, the Dong Lai Cave Master I personally appointed for you didn’t disappoint, right?"  His words were laced with teasing as he obviously knew about the friction between his daughter and Miao Yi.  However, Qin Weiwei did not like hearing this. She stood up, walked over to him, and said unpleasantly, "He's having fun now. I want to see if he can still be as carefree when it's time to fulfill his promises to his subordinates with the Wish Fulfilling Pearls!"  Yang Qing laughed heartily, shook his head at her, and said, "You! You! The person I appointed for you, you just look down on him, don’t you? It’s just that he killed your mount, and you’re stuck on that. Have you thought about it? Those people are all being blackmailed by him, even betraying their own sect. Even if he doesn’t fulfill his promises afterward, what can they do to him?"  "......" Qin Weiwei suddenly realized and was speechless!  Yang Qing sat back down in his chair and sighed, "If Nan Xuan Prefecture had a few more talents like that kid, Blue Jade Sect wouldn't be a concern, and the affairs of Nan Xuan Prefecture would be easier to handle."  Qin Weiwei frowned and said, "Lord Prefecture, after this incident, don't you think that kid is too scheming?"  Yang Qing shook his head lightly, "If he were really scheming, he wouldn’t have confronted you directly as soon as he took office. He would have communicated with you first, arranged everything behind the scenes, and then made his move after avoiding taking responsibility. The way he did it shows that he thinks what he did is justified, which is why he went out to patrol like nothing happened after the deed."  Qin Weiwei was still unhappy and muttered, "No matter how I see it, I just think that guy is a bit despicable and shameless. It's just because you appreciate him; you find him agreeable."  Yang Qing chuckled helplessly, "Whether you find him disagreeable or whether I appreciate him, that’s not important. In the battle at Fuguang Cave, he dared to face a powerful enemy and fought to the death without retreating with only White Lotus first rank cultivation – a tiger general is no more than this. I sent him to Changfeng Territory to eliminate ghosts, and both White Lotus third rank cultivators under Xiong Xiao died, only he came back alive and completed the task. I sent him to preside over the Dong Lai Cave, and within the jurisdiction of Zheng Hai Mountain, among all the cave masters and even the entire Nan Xuan Prefecture, only he swiftly stabilized Dong Lai Cave with thunderous methods. The other mountain masters and cave masters, however, feared the power of the Blue Jade Sect and only knew how to complain, unable to come up with a viable response. Is this how they handle things for me? In short, Miao Yi has never let me down, doesn’t this prove his capability? Weiwei, as a leader, sometimes you can’t only consider your own preferences. You need to learn to appreciate the strengths of your subordinates. There is no perfect person in this world, knowing how to make use of people is what a leader should do!"  Qin Weiwei remained silent. She knew that what Yang Qing said was right, but she couldn’t deny her dislike for Miao Yi. In short, she just found the guy unpleasant!  A father knows his daughter best! Seeing her reaction, Yang Qing shook his head, knowing that it would be hard to change his daughter's mindset in a short time. Such things can’t be forced...  At the docks of Dong Lai City by the sea, there was an endless view of the blue ocean, with vast skies and soaring seagulls overhead.  After spending a few days walking around, Miao Yi quietly returned to see Ji Xiufang once before coming to this place where he had originally landed from across the sea.  The dock was still bustling, with various seafood being unloaded from fishing boats and sailboats arriving from afar docking at the shore.  After asking around for information, Miao Yi got back on his horse with Zhu Tianbiao and left.  After a few days of patrolling, Miao Yi had a rough understanding of the situation in Dong Lai City. As the two left the dock, Miao Yi said with a smile, "That Xu Xinyan turns out to be a decent city master, it seems there's no need for a replacement."  Zhu Tianbiao immediately flattered, "Cave Master is wise!"  "......" Miao Yi was speechless and rolled his eyes. What does this have to do with me being wise or not? The city master was chosen by someone else, what does it have to do with me? He couldn’t even flatter properly.  The two rode along the coastline. Miao Yi had lived on an island for ten years and was quite familiar with the sea, able to discern the depth from the color of the water.  When they reached an area with towering rocks, both of them stopped. Miao Yi dismounted and leaped onto the rocks to survey the terrain.  Zhu Tianbiao came next to him and asked, "What is the Cave Master looking at?"  Miao Yi asked in return, "Have you heard that there is a type of sailing ship in the cultivation world that can travel far across the sea without human power?"  "Yes," Zhu Tianbiao explained. "For cultivators who have reached the Red Lotus realm and can fly, it's not necessary, but it's used by those below Red Lotus."  "Is it difficult to build?"  "Not difficult! Actually, it doesn't look much different from normal sea ships, except that there's a spiral paddle crafted by artisans at the stern, connected to a transmission device to drive it forward. If possible, a magical treasure is used to power it; otherwise, the power of a dragon horse running on a wheel at the stern is used to drive it. Its speed is much faster than that of ordinary human-powered ships. Cave Master, why do you ask?"  Ignoring the question, Miao Yi pointed to the spot and said, "Right here. Excavate a small dock and build a sea ship exclusively for our Dong Lai Cave's use. Later on, have Yan Xiu contact the local workers in Dong Lai City to construct it."  Zhu Tianbiao saluted, "Cave Master is wise!"  "I mean..." Miao Yi was about to ask why he was being praised as wise without even asking what his intentions were, as if his mind wasn't quite right. However, realizing that he and Zhu Tianbiao had no common language and that it would be like playing the lute to a cow, he decided not to waste his breath. He took out a silver spear and marked the rocks, then waved his hand, "We've been out for a few days, have seen almost everything, let's go back." Chapter 83: The Bottomless Pit (Part 1)  It was clear that Wang Zifa took good care of fellow sect members, with four second-grade White Lotus disciples taking turns guarding the gate. Today, it was Nan Sisi on duty, and Miao Yi dismounted from his horse under the mountain gate archway, along with Zhu Tianbiao.  "The Cave Master, you've returned, everyone has been anxiously waiting for your return," Nan Sisi took the reins handed over by the two, turned her head, and immediately used magic to shout, "The Cave Master is back."  Miao Yi glanced at Nan Sisi a few more times, smiling as he entered the mountain gate. He certainly did not think everyone would miss him so much, guessing that Nan Sisi was just flattering him.  Before he even reached the main hall, he saw members of his cave sweeping in from all sides, greeting him with, "The Cave Master has returned."  Miao Yi nodded, leading the group into the main hall. After sitting alone in the high seat, he asked, "Nothing happened while I was away, right?"  "Something happened!" Several people almost said in unison, concern written on their faces.  "Something happened? Everyone seems fine, what could have happened?" Miao Yi looked to Yan Xiu below for answers, as he was the one he trusted the most.  Yan Xiu was quite calm, cupping his hands and saying, "Cave Master, on the second day after you left, Mountain Master Qin Weiwei led people here, pressing for the truth about Song Fuzhi's death."  At the mention of that woman, Miao Yi's face darkened. It wasn't that he was worried about Song Fuzhi's death being exposed, but that he had just taken office, and that woman came to check immediately afterward. What did it mean? And he had even sent a report to her immediately. It was clear she didn't trust him.  Miao Yi's gaze swept over everyone, and he couldn't help but coldly snort, "That wench didn't deliberately cause trouble, did she?"  "......" The crowd, initially worried, suddenly fell silent, their eyes wide as they looked at him, each of them giving a thumbs-up in their hearts. The Cave Master was bold to curse the foster daughter of the Prefecture Chief and the Mountain Master of Zhenhai Mountain in public!  "Cough, cough!" Miao Yi coughed twice, realizing he had misspoken, and with a change of face, he asked, "The Mountain Master didn't say anything, right?"  Wang Zifa and others exchanged glances secretly. It seemed that the relationship between the Cave Master and Prefecture Chief Yang Qing was not as everyone imagined, and in fact, he appeared to hold a deep grudge, even cursing Yang Qing's daughter as a wench.  The people of Lan Yu Sect had joined Yang Qing's command, each with their own mission, and they couldn't fully obey Yang Qing. These people, now grasped by Miao Yi, were worried about how to deal with their own sect in the future. Now it seemed that Cave Master Miao could be secretly won over to Lan Yu Sect's side. If Yang Qing's trusted followers could be turned into Lan Yu Sect's hidden spies placed by Yang Qing's side, it could be reported to the sect, and maybe even considered a merit.  Yan Xiu, not considering so much, replied, "The Mountain Master didn't really say anything, just kept pressing for the truth behind our petition."  Just this? Miao Yi thought it was a bigger issue. As long as he could control the mouths of the people on Lan Yu Sect's side, even if Qin Weiwei knew the truth, so what? He didn't believe Yang Qing would depose him right after supporting him, as that would be like slapping his own face and admitting to poor judgment.  He disbelieved that Yang Qing would do something to harm his own authority. Besides, he hadn't done anything wrong, had he? Dong Lai Cave was his domain, and what was wrong with him organizing Dong Lai Cave? Yang Qing assigned him to Dong Lai Cave, so he should be supportive, not pull his legs.  Miao Yi nonchalantly asked, "None of you have said anything wrong, have you?"  Everyone immediately responded in a jumble, "We've kept our lips sealed, but the key issue is that Dan Biaoyi was taken away by the Mountain Master, and we don't know if Dan Biaoyi can withstand it."  Miao Yi laughed and said, "Don't worry about this matter. I believe Dan Biaoyi won't talk nonsense."  He didn't say what he was thinking: Dan Biaoyi was part of the murder of Song Fuzhi, so it would be strange if Dan Biaoyi easily spoke up.  In fact, Yan Xiu and Qiu Shaogun, who seemed relatively calm, also thought this way.  As soon as this conversation ended, a faint sound of galloping hooves could be heard from outside.  After waiting for a while, they saw the just-mentioned Dan Biaoyi briskly enter the main hall, energetically salute everyone, and then bow in the middle to say, "Cave Master!"  Before Dan Biaoyi could speak, everyone had already crowded around, bombarding him with questions about whether he had said anything when taken away by the Mountain Master.  With Yang Qing's words as a foundation, Dan Biaoyi naturally assured everyone that he had definitely not betrayed anyone.  With that assurance, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, patting his shoulder and saying he was reliable.  Miao Yi, sitting high above, was also pleased with Dan Biaoyi's words. He crossed his legs and felt secretly proud, thinking that Dong Lai Cave was entirely under his control.  "Don't celebrate too early, do you all know Zheng Jinlong?" Dan Biaoyi looked around and asked.  Wang Zifa nodded and said, "Of course, he's our senior brother, who joined the sect even before Song Fuzhi."  Everyone was curious why he mentioned Zheng Jinlong, and Dan Biaoyi pointed outside, saying, "He came with me and is now waiting outside for the Cave Master's summons!"  Everyone had a bad feeling, and Wang Zifa immediately asked, "Why has Senior Brother Zheng come here?"  Dan Biaoyi sighed, "Although I withstood the questioning, the petition we made was passed to Lan Yu Sect for scrutiny, and it seems a senior from our sect who coordinates affairs in Nan Xuan Prefecture personally spoke to the Prefecture Chief, stating that Song Fuzhi deserved death for his disrespect, requesting the Prefecture Chief to allow Lan Yu Sect to send another person to fill Song Fuzhi's vacancy to atone for the crime. Thus, Zheng Jinlong came with me. Gentlemen, to put it bluntly, our sect seems suspicious of this matter, and Zheng Jinlong has been indirectly questioning me along the way. It's best to be prepared."  After saying this, he cupped his fists to Miao Yi and said, "I deliberately left Zheng Jinlong outside so I could report to you in advance, hoping the Cave Master can prepare early."  Miao Yi nodded, looking at the crowd and asking, "What do you think about this?"  After exchanging glances, Wang Zifa spoke seriously, "Cave Master, Senior Brother Zheng's arrival is probably as Dan Biaoyi said, to probe the truth behind Senior Brother Song's death."  Miao Yi sneered, "Your Lan Yu Sect is really never-ending, wanting to probe our reality. If he doesn't behave when he comes, you all go together and take him down. We have the advantage of numbers and don't have to fear him. By the way, how strong is his cultivation?"  The crowd's expressions changed dramatically, and Wang Zifa hurriedly waved his hands, saying, "No! Cave Master, if we kill Senior Brother Zheng, then the trouble will be huge. It's easy to kill Senior Brother Zheng, but what after that? If our sect sends another disciple with Blue Lotus cultivation, what will we do?"  Yan Xiu, Qiu Shaogun, and Dan Biaoyi glanced at each other, their expressions twitching slightly. The Cave Master was actually discussing the murder of a Lan Yu Sect disciple with a group of Lan Yu Sect disciples, and he was serious about it. What kind of situation was this? Lan Yu Sect had really taken in a good group of disciples. Chapter 84: The Bottomless Pit (Part 2)  Miao Yi said casually, "Neither left nor right is possible, so what do you suggest we do?"  Wang Zifa clasped his hands in salute and said, "Cave Master, I do have a method to bring Brother Zheng over to our side, but it requires your help with one thing."  Is he planning to drag our fellow sect brother into the mud? Miao Yi muttered in his heart and asked, "Speak up and let's hear it."  Wang Zifa responded, "Cave Master, Brother Zheng is also a cultivator of the Third Rank of White Lotus. If... if the Cave Master can allow Brother Zheng to enjoy the same treatment as us in the distribution of the Wish Power Beads, I have a way to persuade Brother Zheng."  Many furrowed their brows and quickly observed Miao Yi's reaction, as this request seemed a bit excessive. Everyone was already going to divide the Wish Power Beads, leaving only three for the Cave Master. If Zheng Jinlong were to also receive three, wouldn't that leave the Cave Master with nothing?  As expected, Miao Yi's expression darkened, and he leaned forward slightly, "Wang Zifa, are you joking? If you take all the Wish Power Beads, then what am I, the Cave Master, working for?  I'll tell you, at the end of the year when we harvest the Wish Power Beads, there will be twenty-four beads. Your side will only get fourteen; that's already the limit I can offer. How to divide them is your business. As for your Brother Zheng, if you can pacify him, then pacify him; if not, just get rid of him. I hate it when people set their sights on me."  He was not afraid of any Brother Zheng or crooked brothers. With so many people under him, a Third Rank White Lotus cultivator would still be at his mercy when on his territory, so why would he need to compromise?  "Cave Master, please don't misunderstand, that's not what I meant," Wang Zifa hurriedly waved his hands.  Miao Yi snorted coldly, "Then what do you mean?"  Everyone looked at Wang Zifa with a listening ear as he tentatively asked, "Didn't the Cave Master mention there are other sources of Wish Power Beads? My suggestion is that we first allocate three beads from my fellow junior brothers and sisters to give to Brother Zheng. When there are other sources of Wish Power Beads, it won't be too late for the Cave Master to make it up to them."  Upon hearing this, Hou Sheng, Shang Youlai, and Wang Xiuqin's expressions changed dramatically. It goes without saying that the beads would definitely not be allocated to Brother Zhu Tianbiao, who was of the Third Rank White Lotus cultivation. It would certainly be their misfortune as junior brothers and sisters of the Second Rank White Lotus.  The most crucial point was that the Cave Master's so-called other sources of Wish Power Beads were only lip service, and no one had ever seen them. Naturally, it was most prudent to secure the benefits that could be obtained first. Who knew what the future would hold?  However, since Wang Zifa had spoken, their reluctance could only be kept in their hearts without daring to speak out.  Nan Sisi, who was guarding the mountain gate outside, was unaware of the situation inside the hall. Otherwise, she would certainly not be pleased either.  "So that's it!" Miao Yi tapped his fingers on the armrest and pondered for a while before slowly nodding, "I can agree to your request. However, when it's time to earn other sources of Wish Power Beads, you can't back down. You must accompany me!"  Yan Xiu's heart suddenly skipped a beat, and something flashed through his mind. Could it be that the Cave Master really intended to go hunting in the Starry Sea?  Wang Zifa immediately nodded and smiled, "Of course, we will all follow the Cave Master's orders and accompany you."  He didn't make an absolute commitment; the premise was that they would go wherever the Cave Master could go, following him!  Miao Yi smiled and looked at the other disciples of the Blue Jade Sect, asking, "Do you have any objections?"  Wang Zifa immediately turned his cold gaze toward his fellow junior brothers and sisters. Although Hou Sheng and the others were somewhat reluctant, they still forced a smile and nodded.  "Good!" Miao Yi clapped his hand on the armrest, "This matter is settled then. That Zheng Jinlong will be left to you fellow sect members to deal with.  Shan Biaoyi, let him in!"  Shan Biaoyi took the order and went out. After a while, he brought in a plump man in blue clothes with a gentle smile on his face, looking younger than Song Fu.  Wang Zifa and the others clasped their hands and called him Brother.  The newcomer greeted everyone with a salute and finally stood firm, smiling and saluting to Miao Yi who was in the high seat, "Subordinate Zheng Jinlong has been ordered to come to Donglai Cave to serve, and greets the Cave Master!"  This person seemed much more sensible than Song Fu, at least more palatable to Miao Yi. He gestured with his hand, "No need for formalities."  After a few exchanges of pleasantries, as everyone was dispersing from the council hall, Miao Yi suddenly called out, "Shan Biaoyi."  Shan Biaoyi, who had reached the door, turned around and walked back, "Does the Cave Master have any orders?"  Miao Yi, slowly descending from his seat, looked at him with a half-smiling expression, "Did he really not say anything? Did that... Mountain Master just let you come back?"  Shan Biaoyi's heart skipped a beat. Thinking that he hadn’t revealed any flaws, he said with a surprised face, "I was part of the group that killed Song Fu. It wouldn't benefit me to speak out. Is the Cave Master doubting me?"  "No, just asking casually," Miao Yi laughed and patted his shoulder before turning to greet Yan Xiu and walking towards the inner hall.  In the backyard, full and satisfied, Heitan lay by the door flicking its tail and dozing off. Miao Yi entered the yard and it just opened its eyes for a glance. Safe – it wasn't that woman who had wielded a knife at its backside, so it continued to doze off.  Yan Xiu, who followed, tried to ask, "Cave Master, are you suspecting that Shan Biaoyi has revealed the truth?"  "No, I just feel that Qin Weiwei, that wretched woman, wouldn't be so easy to talk to. That woman has been trying to find fault with me," Miao Yi waved his hand, "Even if he did speak, it doesn't matter."  Hearing that the Cave Master had returned, Qian'er and Xue'er, who were waiting in the yard, also bowed their heads slightly and followed behind the two men.  As soon as Miao Yi entered the room and sat down, the two maids immediately offered fragrant tea and then stood silently to the left and right. Miao Yi just glanced at them and gestured for them to leave; he didn't have much trust in them at the moment.  After the two left, Miao Yi spoke to Yan Xiu, "I've marked a spot by the sea. Later, contact Donglai City and organize some laborers..."  He talked about building a wharf and ships, and Yan Xiu immediately became a bit alarmed, "Cave Master, you're not really thinking of going hunting in the Starry Sea, are you?"  "You think too much. It's for cultivation."  "Cultivation?"  "The laborer's wages can't be shortchanged. You handle this matter; it's decided. I'm going out for a few days, I'll go wash."  Miao Yi left after dropping the words.  Yan Xiu could only clasp his hands in agreement, turn around and leave the hall. Seeing Qian'er and Xue'er outside, he casually mentioned, "The Cave Master is going to bathe."  As he passed by them, he paused for a moment and reminded, "In all of Donglai City, not everyone has the chance to be the Cave Master's maids. Maids who can't gain the Cave Master's trust can't stay here for long..." Chapter 85: The Bottomless Pit (Part 3)  Inside the quiet chamber, Miao Yi had just stripped off his clothes and soaked into the temperature-appropriate pool. He closed his eyes and enjoyed it for a while until he heard footsteps and opened his eyes again to look towards the doorway of the stone chamber. Who was intruding here?  The answer was revealed as the somewhat anxious Qian'er and Xue'er entered. They had removed their outer garments, wearing only a tube top on the upper body and short bloomers made of caged fabric below. The crystal-clear lustrous shoulders, the delicate and fair collarbones, the limbs like pink lotus roots, and the exquisite curves of their waists were all exposed to the air.  The two girls, like bashful flower buds, dressed in minimal clothing, walked in with blushing faces, holding bathing supplies. Miao Yi's mouth fell open, and he was speechless for a while. Suddenly thinking of something, his face flushed red, and he quickly grabbed a piece of clothing from the shore, pressed it into the water, and covered his groin area, anxiously saying, "What are you two doing here?"  "We are here to serve the cave master with his bath!" both girls said with flushed faces.  Miao Yi clutched at his lower body and quickly shook his head, saying, "No need, no need, I can do it myself."  "This is what we should do," the two maidservants remembered the words of Yan Xiu from before. They set down their things with a firm attitude, stretched out their fair legs, and stepped into the pool, not caring whether Miao Yi agreed or not. One helped Miao Yi untie his hair, while the other scooped water to wet his shoulders.  Miao Yi was extremely embarrassed, even a little angry out of shame, but some things are a man's nature. Once the two girls entered the water, how could the thin, semi-transparent short gauze clothes withstand the flirtatious spring water? Soaked and revealing, along with the virgin body fragrance, made Miao Yi's heartbeat accelerate in an instant. He didn't dare to look any further, and he wanted to send the girls away, but the words got stuck in his throat.  He also didn't dare to stare any longer at the two girls' partially concealed bodies, so he closed his eyes and clutched his groin tightly, letting the girls' soft hands touch his body. The sensation of their fingertips gliding over his skin made him shiver uncontrollably.   However, he gradually adapted to it, and after adapting, he felt indescribably comfortable, except that his hands kept clutching his groin area tightly. It is known that before Donglai City selected these girls to be offered to the immortals, they specifically hired people to train them, naturally to please the immortals, so the skills of serving people were practiced over and over again. Donglai City would not dare to offer anything less...  The environment of a cave mansion that sits in control of an area will never be too bad. Amidst the dreamlike green mountains, between the mountain paths and rocky trails, there are flying birds and animals, a group of people, passing strange peaks, observing the forest sea, listening to the sound of spring water ding dong.  Wang Zifa and a group of junior brothers and sisters led Senior Brother Zheng to appreciate the scenery of Donglai Cave and get familiar with the environment of Donglai Cave, all showing great respect to their senior brother.  "The Six Saints dominate the world, and the various cave mansions under their jurisdiction also occupy the lands blessed with natural spirit and beauty. It's a great place!" A few of them entered a mountain pavilion, and as they listened to the junior brothers and sisters' introduction, Zheng Jinlong sincerely sighed at the surrounding scenery, which was no less than that of the grand Lan Yu Sect.  He always had a gentle smile on his face, and no one could tell anything from the expression of their senior brother.  Standing beside him, Wang Zifa smiled and said, "Now, our Lan Yu Sect has also entered the fray, there is much to be done!"  Zheng Jinlong 'oh'ed, and asked, "Do you still have the sect in your eyes?"  As soon as these words came out, everyone's smiles stiffened, and the atmosphere instantly became awkward, thinking that what was expected to come had finally arrived.  "Senior brother's words make us feel apprehensive..."   Before Wang Zifa could finish, Zheng Jinlong suddenly turned around and interrupted, still smiling, but his tone already carried a chilling coldness, "Apprehensive? Do you think your courage is not big enough?"  Everyone's eyes fell on Wang Zifa's face because he had said he had a way to deal with it.  Wang Zifa looked surprised and said, "What does senior brother mean?"  Zheng Jinlong smiled and said, "Junior brother, are you pretending to be confused with me? The death of Junior Brother Song, don't you think you owe the sect an explanation?"  Wang Zifa's expression became serious, and he said in a deep voice, "Junior Brother Song almost ruined the good things of our Lan Yu Sect, Song Fu deserved to die! Given another chance, we would still do the same!"  Zheng Jinlong was taken aback, his gaze flickering before he spoke slowly, "Could there be some hidden details? I would like to hear more about it."  Wang Zifa whispered, "Senior brother, even if the sect doesn't say it, everyone knows it in their heart. How can our Lan Yu Sect be content with being inferior to others? Sooner or later, we will have to replace Yang Qing. Do you agree or not?"  Zheng Jinlong neither agreed nor disagreed, did not say yes, and did not say no, but asked back, "What does this have to do with the death of Junior Brother Song?"  "Of course, it's related."  Wang Zifa asked, "What do you think of Miao Yi, senior brother?"  Zheng Jinlong couldn't guess what he meant, and after a bit of thought, he pondered and said, "I'm not clear about the other aspects, I only know his cultivation is weak and not presentable, and if not for Yang Qing's favor, he would not have today. It's not too much to say he's Yang Qing's confidant. Is this satisfactory to junior brother?"  "Senior brother's insight is profound!" Wang Zifa clasped his fists, "As senior brother said! But senior brother only knows one part and not the other. The relationship between Miao Yi and Yang Qing is not as close as outsiders see. We once heard him slip up and curse Qin Weiwei as a 'cheap woman'!"  Zheng Jinlong naturally knew that Qin Weiwei was Yang Qing's adopted daughter, and Miao Yi dared to scold the lord's daughter as a cheap woman? It was somewhat strange and he said, "Is there such a thing? But what does this have to do with Junior Brother Song's death?"  Wang Zifa immediately whispered into his ear, exaggerating and modifying the facts a bit as he murmured a few words.  Zheng Jinlong was shocked, "Three beads? Where did he get so many power beads to distribute to us?"  "I saw him with my own eyes holding a power bead that gathered the wishes of ten thousand people in one year..." Wang Zifa continued to mutter a few words.  "Does he have another source for the power beads?" Zheng Jinlong's eyes lit up.  Wang Zifa sighed, "Now senior brother should understand our difficulty. To say something unpleasant, although your status in the sect is higher than ours, once this news goes back to the sect, the small Donglai Cave will definitely become highly sought after, and those elders will surely send their own trusted relatives to replace us. Our defeat is a small matter, but if the news is exposed, once Miao Yi is called back by Yang Qing, our efforts to find the source of the power beads for the sect would be in vain. This is the sect's loss, so Song Fu deserved to die!"  Zheng Jinlong didn't believe these guys wanted to find out the source of the power beads for the sect. They probably wanted to find out for themselves, at least by getting Miao Yi out of Donglai Cave, the three power beads a year would definitely be missed, and if someone else became the cave master, they certainly wouldn't be as generous.   However, with so many benefits, he himself was also tempted. His junior brothers told him this news because they wanted him to share a piece of the pie and weather the storm together.   Yet, the matter had already aroused the suspicion of the sect, otherwise, they wouldn't have sent him. Zheng Jinlong frowned and said, "Junior brother, I can understand your painstaking efforts for the sect, but you should know that not giving a reasonable explanation to the sect will not pass muster, how should I teach me?" Chapter 86: The Bottomless Pit (Part Four)  Wang Zifa knew that he had also been tempted and felt a secret joy in his heart, but he feigned surprise on the surface and said, "Brother, did you not understand the meaning in my words earlier?"  Zheng Jinlong was stunned for a moment and pondered, but still did not understand and asked, "Please explain it to me, junior brother."  Wang Zifa spoke in a low voice, "As brother mentioned, Miao Yi is Yang Qing's confidant, but in fact, from the moment Miao Yi called Qin Weiwei a 'cheap woman,' it's clear that things are not as they seem. This surrendered soldier, Miao Yi, obviously holds considerable dissatisfaction with Yang Qing. Remember, he initially preferred death over surrender and only submitted to Yang Qing under duress. Our Lan Yu Sect has a lot of potential in this situation. If we can turn Yang Qing's confidant into a spy we plant by Yang Qing's side... Brother, explaining it this way to our superiors should alleviate some of the sect's suspicions."  "..." Zheng Jinlong fell silent. If he really did this, he would become entangled with these people, and if anything went wrong, not only would they not be able to escape, but neither would he himself.  After returning to his own cultivation estate, Zheng Jinlong was very hesitant and conflicted. On one hand, there were the terrible consequences of angering his sect, and on the other, the immense temptation of benefits. But in the end, he couldn't give up the benefits that might come his way. After a few days of observation and consideration, coupled with the continuous encouragement and temptation from Wang Zifa and others, Zheng Jinlong gritted his teeth and wrote a secret memorial.  The secret memorial also listed and fabricated a bunch of arrogant and domineering deeds by Song Fu, saying that Song Fu did not care about the big picture at all and indeed deserved to die. However, after Miao Yi killed Song Fu, Wang Zifa and others were also very angry and almost couldn't resist having a fight with Miao Yi.  But just then, Wang Zifa and others accidentally learned that Miao Yi was only superficially obedient to Yang Qing, and in fact, he was very dissatisfied with Yang Qing, even secretly cursing Yang Qing's foster daughter as a 'cheap woman.' Wang Zifa and others were also considering the bigger picture, feeling that it was not yet time for Lan Yu Sect to fall out with Yang Qing over a Song Fu. Since Song Fu was dead and nothing could be done about it, they decided to go with the flow. Thus, Wang Zifa and others decided to hold back on this matter, first protecting Miao Yi, winning his gratitude, and striving to develop Miao Yi, the confidant, into a spy to be placed by Yang Qing's side, to be used when Lan Yu Sect needed him.  Moreover, Miao Yi's cultivation was low, making him easy to control. Controlling Miao Yi was akin to controlling Dong Lai Cave, and if Miao Yi were to be driven out of Dong Lai Cave for this matter, and Yang Qing appointed someone with a higher cultivation level to take over, it would not be convenient for Lan Yu Sect to control Dong Lai Cave.  Zheng Jinlong finally said that he also felt that Wang Zifa and others indeed had the best intentions, and asked the sect to consider it carefully!  In the courtyard, Zheng Jinlong hesitated as he stuffed the secret memorial into the leg canister of a grey hawk, still undecided. In the end, he clenched his teeth and threw the grey hawk into the air. The grey hawk messenger quickly flapped its wings and flew into the distance...  There's a saying that even heroes find it hard to overcome the allure of a beautiful woman, which might be somewhat exaggerated. However, after bathing with the two maidservants once, Miao Yi at least no longer treated the two with complete indifference as mere helpers. Although Miao Yi controlled himself and did not cross the final line, the two did have skin-to-skin contact in the most private situation. Seeing the two maidservants after such intimate contact, his feelings were no longer the same. Subconsciously, he regarded them as his own people, and his commands became more casual.  Qian'er and Xue'er, facing their master, the head of the cave, no longer felt as nervous as before, even finding it funny when they thought back to the first time they helped the master bathe, how even the mighty cave master was more shy and nervous than them. It turns out that immortals could also be shy!  After entering the backyard of Dong Lai Grand Hall, Yan Xiu smiled slightly. In the pavilion, Xue'er played the zither with her ten fingers, and amidst the beautiful sound of the zither, Qian'er danced gracefully like a fairy, while Miao Yi held a teacup and enjoyed the performance, living a good life.  Seeing Yan Xiu come in, Miao Yi gestured with his hand, and Qian'er and Xue'er both stopped.  Yan Xiu, who entered the pavilion, glanced at the two and asked with a smile, "Cave Master, are these two still satisfactory? If not, I can ask the city lord of Dong Lai to replace them with two others."  This was still based on the reason of being followers; other people did not enjoy such good treatment. Once chosen, they could not be switched at will, and no cultivator could treat all the women in the world as their own to use freely. If that were the case, wouldn't that lead to chaos in the world? However, the cave master did have some special treatment.  Only those within the system under the Six Saints could enjoy the treatment of being assigned maidservants. Cultivators outside the system did not have such privileges. Other cultivators could visit brothels without problems, but if they dared to mess with followers and disrupt the balance of procreation, the cultivators within the system would immediately mobilize troops to encircle and pursue them. They needed to maintain their special rights!  This was also one of the reasons why everyone wanted to enter the system; the enjoyment of various rights was incomparable to that of the scattered cultivators.  Upon hearing Yan Xiu's words, Qian'er and Xue'er immediately looked nervously at Miao Yi. Before they were about to become the maidservants of an immortal, Dong Lai City had put a lot of effort into training them, providing good food and care, and no one dared to offend them, for they were soon to become the maidservants of an immortal, and offending them might lead to future retribution.  But once they were sent back, they would fall from heaven to earth. Without the backing of an immortal, no one would take them seriously, and the consequences of being returned were imaginable; it certainly meant that they had not served the immortal well, naturally angering those who had put in a lot of effort.  Miao Yi could not stand the two girls' sorrowful gazes and, thinking of the intimate skin contact in the water, coughed dryly and said, "It's alright, they are quite handy to use, no need to change."  He did not want the embarrassing details of his bathing to be spread.  This meant that the two girls had passed the probation period and obtained official recognition. Their status changed instantly; they officially became the close people of the cave master, not just anyone could offend them, and even Yan Xiu immediately bowed to the two, saying, "Great auntie, little auntie!"  Even an immortal addressing them with respect, the two girls' eyes lit up with joy, understanding that the cave master had officially acknowledged the two of them. From then on, their status would be higher than many others, at least higher than the other maidservants who were also selected to serve the immortals, because they were the cave master's maidservants.  Before coming, the two girls did not know that they would be serving the cave master. Not everyone had such luck; at least out of a hundred thousand people, only two would emerge.  Excited and well-behaved, the two girls looked at Miao Yi with a different gaze and gently moved to stand behind him, one on each side.  Miao Yi no longer avoided the two and knew that once he had chosen them, he had to start involving them in some matters. In the future, they would serve him as Qing Mei and Qing Ju served Yang Qing, otherwise, if they knew nothing, what could they do?  "Any reaction from Zheng Jinlong's side?" Miao Yi asked.  Yan Xiu replied, "So far, there has been no response. Zheng Jinlong has been holed up in his cultivation estate and has not come out. Wang Zifa and the others are very anxious, constantly urging." Chapter 87: The Bottomless Pit (Part 5)  As the two were discussing, Zheng Jinlong, who was anxiously waiting for news in the courtyard, stopped in his tracks and looked towards the black dot approaching from the sky, stretching out his arm to receive it. The messenger hawk he had sent out two days ago had finally returned, landing on his arm with a swoosh. He eagerly took out a narrow jade strip from the hawk’s leg cylinder and poured his mana into it to read the message. It read: Prince Fa and the others are well-intentioned, cooperate with them!  This was the reply from the Blue Jade Sect. Zheng Jinlong immediately breathed a sigh of relief. Not knowing the stance of his sect, he didn’t dare to openly express his position to Prince Fa and the others, for fear of being implicated if the Blue Jade Sect decided to investigate the matter thoroughly, something he wouldn’t be able to withstand.  Having fooled his sect, Zheng Jinlong gained confidence, quickly put the hawk back into the aerie, and turned to go back inside. He took off his blue clothes and changed into a set of black attire. The master of Donglai Cave disliked the clothes of the Blue Jade Sect and insisted on unifying the attire of Donglai Cave.  When Zheng Jinlong, now dressed in black, stepped out of the courtyard, Prince Fa and the others appeared from nowhere and repeated their old tune: "Senior Brother, have you made your decision?" They were also anxious. If Zheng Jinlong really refused to cooperate, then they would have no choice but to follow Miao Yi's plan to join forces and deal with Zheng Jinlong.  Although they knew this was a temporary solution, they had no other choice and could only take it one step at a time.  "Seeing that you are all dedicated to the sect, I have racked my brains for you this time!" Zheng Jinlong sighed and handed the recently received jade strip secret message to them.  After taking turns injecting mana to read the message, each of them was overjoyed. At the signal of Prince Fa, they stood in a row and bowed their hands together: "Thank you, Senior Brother!"  "It's been a few days since we’ve seen the cave master, and we don’t know if there are any tasks from him!" After Zheng Jinlong said this, everyone knew he had decided to share in the spoils and wanted to reassure the cave master.  Everyone immediately flattered and accompanied him.  Miao Yi, who had been notified, came to the front hall from the rear hall with Qian'er and Xue'er. Miao Yi sat down in the high seat, while Qian'er and Xue'er stood nervously to the left and right of his position. Yan Xiu, who had come out with them, stood at his own place below.  "Announce their arrival!" Miao Yi said indifferently.  Just now, Yan Xiu had explained the rules to the two girls. As the younger aunt, Xue'er's body trembled slightly, and she immediately stepped to the door of the hall. Gathering her courage, she called out to the people waiting below the high steps outside: "The cave master invites you to enter the hall for a meeting!"  Her voice was not soft, but one could clearly hear the tremble in it, showing her nervousness. It was understandable for her to be nervous facing a group of immortals and showing such authority for the first time.  As Zheng Jinlong and the others entered the hall, Miao Yi saw the black clothes on him and understood Zheng Jinlong's attitude. A smile flashed in his eyes, knowing that this fellow had also been dragged into the water.  Looking at Prince Fa, who understood the implication, he immediately sent a message: “It’s settled!”  "Greetings to the cave master!" Everyone bowed their hands together.  Now that everyone was gathered, there was no fear of being short-handed in a fight. Even if they encountered a Fourth Grade White Lotus cultivator, they could put up a fight. Miao Yi smiled and said, "No need for such formalities!"  Qian'er and Xue'er couldn't help but steal a glance at Miao Yi, realizing how imposing the cave master was, commanding so many immortals with his word.  In fact, there were only nine people below, plus one guarding the mountain gate outside, making a total of ten subordinates. Donglai Cave couldn't afford to support too many people.  But for the two girls who had just arrived, even one immortal was a lofty existence in their eyes, let alone ten. It was already a lot for them, as they had never seen so many once-revered immortals appear before them all at once.  If they knew that their master had the lowest cultivation among all the immortals present, one could only wonder what they would think.  After the nine people lined up in two rows, Zheng Jinlong stepped forward again and bowed: "Subordinate Zheng Jinlong is new here, and has yet to achieve any merit for Donglai Cave. I wonder if the cave master has any tasks for me."  This was to show his willingness to accept orders.  Miao Yi looked amused: "Newcomers should always show some initiative. How about guarding the mountain gate for a day?"  The people below were startled. Asking a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator to guard the gate again? Was this a repeat of the previous tactic? Did the cave master not understand the implication and wanted to harm Zheng Jinlong?  Zheng Jinlong was also startled. He had only been politely expressing his willingness on the surface, not expecting the other party to take it seriously. He had only just realized that, although this fellow had a low cultivation, he had the ability to kill a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator.  However, he quickly saw the cave master's intention. It was to see if he was truly willing to accept an assignment. The cave master didn’t trust mere words; he wanted to see real action.  "Your subordinate obeys!" Zheng Jinlong accepted with a fist salute.  With his agreement, Miao Yi didn't want to beat around the bush. To him, this was his territory, and the matter was simple.  "Now that everyone is almost here, let me introduce you to two people," Miao Yi said, raising his hand to point to the two maidservants, "This is Qian'er, and this is Xue'er!"  The crowd looked at each other and then bowed their hands in turn: "Greetings to the elder aunt, greetings to the younger aunt!"  Qian'er and Xue'er, both nervous, bowed in response.  After some exchanges and everyone dispersed, Zheng Jinlong went to replace the guard at the mountain gate. The current guard, Wang Xiuqin, was terrified. How could she dare to have Senior Brother guard the mountain gate?  After hearing it was the mountain master's intention, Wang Xiuqin relented but whispered a reminder: "Senior Brother, you know about Brother Song's incident; please be extra cautious."  Zheng Jinlong nodded, appearing indifferent on the surface but actually on high alert, still a bit worried that the cave master might play dirty tricks.  The incident with Song Fu being attacked at the mountain gate was not a secret. Everyone guessed that Miao Yi was behind it, looking for an excuse to act out.  Therefore, Zheng Jinlong decided to guard the mountain gate at all costs today, not going anywhere else to avoid capsizing in a gutter...  The news of Zheng Jinlong's submission spread quickly to Zhenhai Mountain. Qin Weiwei, dressed in white clothes like snow, lay on a couch in the loft, looking at the secret report in her hand with disgust. That guy had managed to deal with the person sent by the Blue Jade Sect to investigate. Was the Blue Jade Sect useless?  After Song Fu's death, Yang Qing also knew he couldn’t hide it. It made no sense to hide such matters, so he called the person in charge from the Blue Jade Sect stationed there to show them a pile of petitions.  The person from the Blue Jade Sect didn't say a word and directly condemned Song Fu's death, but then asked Yang Qing to make arrangements for another person to go and redeem himself.  Everyone knew that redeeming himself was a pretense, and the real aim was to investigate the true facts. However, Yang Qing agreed on the spot.  Later, when Qin Weiwei asked Yang Qing why he had agreed, what if the truth was found out?  Yang Qing said if the truth came out, it came out. At that time, he would directly express his stance to protect that kid. He wanted to see the attitude of the Blue Jade Sect, to test their bottom line. Secondly, he wanted to send some trouble to that kid to see if he could handle it and not disappoint him!  The secret report was quickly forwarded to Nanxuan Prefecture.  In the same mountain pavilion, Yang Qing, who received the secret report, chuckled lightly: "Another one has been swallowed up. That kid really has turned Donglai Cave into a bottomless pit, swallowing up whoever comes! It seems the Blue Jade Sect is nothing special after all, unable to handle even a small cave master under me, haha!"  Qingmei and Qingju, standing beside him, exchanged a glance. That kid had once again not disappointed the prefecture master. It was obvious that the prefecture master was increasingly appreciating him, especially since he had dealt with the Blue Jade Sect in a way that pleased the prefecture master. Chapter 88: Incubating the Nether Eggs (Part 1)  Having settled Zheng Jinlong's matter and effectively dealt with the Lan Yu Sect, Miao Yi no longer had concerns to worry about and could finally concentrate on his cultivation. However, before that, there was still one thing he needed to do. He had just taken over Donglai Cave and had been too busy to tidy it up. Now that he had time, he decided to try to incubate the mantis eggs he had obtained with Old Bai in the Myriad Dust of the Mortal World.  On a day when the sky was just beginning to light up, Miao Yi instructed Qian'er and Xue'er to guard outside and not allow anyone to disturb him. He then secluded himself in the quiet room to prepare, as Old Bai had mentioned that the secret method must not be divulged to others. Upon taking out the large chunk of insect eggs, the temperature in the room seemed to drop slightly, and holding the eggs felt like holding blocks of ice. Miao Yi clicked his tongue, "Indeed, these are freakish!"  Carefully, he peeled the insect eggs one by one from the mucous membrane, and a hundred quail-sized, black insect eggs were laid out on a jade plate. He then took out a small knife, held the blade in his left palm, and pulled with his right hand. His palm was instantly bleeding profusely.  With his bloodied palm, he quickly turned and caressed each insect egg, as Old Bai had instructed him to coat every single egg with his own blood, leaving no area untouched. By enveloping the eggs in his vital blood, he created a barrier between yin and yang and also allowed the nether embryos within the eggs to feel his presence from the start of their nurturing.  After some effort, he made sure each egg turned a blackish-red color without any mistakes. He then undid his bound hair and, with a bit of bravery, plucked hairs from his head. According to Old Bai’s secret method, the hairs had to be complete, without any breaks, and still have their roots, as if to hatch the nether eggs, the connection must not be broken.  He plucked over a hundred hairs, and after careful selection, discarded the ones without roots. He had to pluck several times from his head before he gathered a hundred intact hairs with roots. He dipped the roots of these hairs into the blood on his left palm, holding the tips in his hand.  With a spell, the hundred hairs immediately stiffened like bristles and spread out like a porcupine. Holding the hairs above the jade plate, he directed them at each of the insect eggs in the plate and stabbed down.  The surface of the insect eggs was not hard but was exceptionally tough and smooth. It took some effort to pierce the surface with the bloodied hair roots and insert them into the eggs. This method, as Old Bai said, was known as "the slender thread connecting the two realms of yin and yang."  Yin referred to the nether eggs, and yang referred to Miao Yi. His hair was the thread that linked the two, ensuring that the hatched nether mantis would be in tune with his mind and submit to his control.  The reason Miao Yi went through the ordeal of plucking hair and shedding blood was in the hope that one day he could control the terrifying nether mantis. Although he did not know how formidable the nether mantis was, he could feel, even as a cultivator, that he was utterly powerless against it.  Almost instantly as the hundred hairs were inserted into the nether eggs, an intense bone-chilling coldness traveled up the hairs, not simply cold, but an illusionary sensation that seemed to momentarily transport him into the netherworld, making his soul tremble.  This eerie sensation instantly plunged Miao Yi into a state of dazed confusion, and gradually, his soul seemed to drift aimlessly in the eternal darkness of the netherworld. If it were anyone else, this state would indicate a loss of soul, leading to severe problems.  Fortunately, the 'Starfire Jue' he cultivated played a significant role at the crucial moment. When the coldness eroded his cultivated source of law within his body, it reflexively circulated on its own, spreading a warm sensation throughout his body that instantly expelled the coldness with the swiftness of lightning, not allowing any violation, extremely domineering.  Miao Yi shivered violently and quickly awoke from his dazed state, only to find that the surface of the hundred hairs had formed a layer of frost. "Goodness, these nether eggs are really bizarre to have caused my spirit to waver!" he exclaimed in amazement.  Now, he was even more eager to see what would hatch from these eggs. After steadying his mind, he carefully recalled and pondered the mental method taught by Old Bai. Grasping the hundred hairs, he silently channeled his magical power through the hairs into the hundred nether eggs, applying the secret method within.  In less than half an hour, Miao Yi opened his eyes and ceased channeling his magical power, releasing the handful of hair. Under the influence of his technique, the hundred hairs that had previously lost their frost once again quickly spread frost from the roots.  He did not know if this method would be effective, but he had followed Old Bai's instructions. He summoned a stalk of Starlight Immortal Grass from his storage ring, pursed his lips, and blew a wisp of star cloud onto the cut on his left palm. The blurry wound immediately healed at a visible rate.  After fully recovering, Miao Yi looked at the immortal grass in his hand and couldn't help but shake his head in wonder. He was indeed lucky; the nether mantis he encountered in the Myriad Dust of the Mortal World had a stalk of Starlight Immortal Grass attached to it. Without this immortal grass, incubating the nether eggs would have been troublesome.  The reason was simple: according to the secret method taught by Old Bai, the nether eggs had to be coated with one's fresh blood every day for eighty-one days, without missing a single day, or else all efforts would be wasted. That meant he had to make eighty-one cuts on himself and bleed every day continuously for eighty-one days. Without the fortune of finding this immortal grass, it would have been unbearable for cultivators, let alone ordinary people, to make cuts and bleed every day!  After washing the blood from his hands in the flowing hot spring pool, Miao Yi turned and carried the jade plate out of the quiet room. Qian'er and Xue'er, who were guarding outside, were curious about the items he was holding. What were these black and red things covered in white fluff on the plate?  Regardless of what they were, Xue'er took the initiative to help Miao Yi carry them. Perhaps accustomed to giving them orders, he handed it over to her without a second thought. Just as he was about to give them instructions, he noticed Xue'er's face turn pale instantly. She trembled while holding the jade plate, which slipped uncontrollably from her hands.  Fortunately, Miao Yi reacted quickly, catching the jade plate and grabbing Xue'er's arm as she was about to collapse. He then realized his oversight; the items in the jade plate had a heavy yin presence, which nearly affected him, and was too much for ordinary people to bear.  However, the technique he cultivated was highly effective against yin energy. He quickly cast a spell into Xue'er's body, sweeping away the invading yin energy in an instant. Xue'er, whose eyes had rolled back, finally came around, but the yin energy had already damaged her vitality in just a moment, leaving her standing weakly with a pale complexion. Chapter 89: Hatching the Underworld Egg (Part 2)  "Sorry, I forgot that you are mortals and cannot touch this thing." Miao Yi asked, "Xue'er, are you okay?"  Qian'er and Xue'er looked at the jade plate with awe, realizing it was something mortals couldn't touch. Xue'er shook her head and quickly apologized, "It's all the servant's fault, I almost smashed the cave master's item."  "It's okay." Miao Yi laughed and said, "I have something to assign you to do, follow me!" The two followed him out of the hall, only to see that it was already sunny outside. As soon as the thing in the jade plate was exposed to the sunlight, the frost-covered fur immediately emitted strands of black smoke, the frost disappeared, and the fur instantly returned to its original color.  Frost exposed to sunlight couldn't possibly melt so quickly, let alone emit black smoke. Obviously, the frost covering the fur was not a natural phenomenon but a manifestation of extremely yin energy.   The sight of the frost suddenly turning into hairs and emitting black smoke shocked Qian'er and Xue'er again because they didn't feel the immortal qi, but instead, they felt a kind of evil qi. The black coal that was dozing off with its snake tail at the entrance suddenly sneezed, raised its head, and opened its eyes wide to look at the thing in Miao Yi's hand, as if it sensed something.  However, seeing that Miao Yi was leading the two maidservants up to the 'Observatory,' and it didn't affect itself, it continued to sleep, as lazy as ever. The Observatory is actually a high platform convenient for stargazing. Miao Yi placed the jade plate on the ground of the Observatory. According to Old Bai, once it started, it couldn't touch the ground before hatching; it had to be isolated from the ground, and placing it on the Observatory was just right.  Under the scorching sun, Miao Yi squatted and observed for a while. The breeze was blowing the strands of hair inserted into the underworld egg. He didn't know whether what Old Bai said about letting the underworld fetus gradually become accustomed to the world of the living through these strands of hair was true or false.  "Qian'er, Xue'er!" Miao Yi stood up.  "Here!" The two girls responded in unison.  Miao Yi pointed to the thing in the jade plate and said, "Starting today, I'm going to enter closed-door cultivation. You two will take turns guarding under the Observatory. Don't let anyone come up and touch this thing, and you also must not touch it, and especially do not let it contact the ground under the Observatory. Every day before the sunset, or during cloudy and rainy days when the sun isn't visible, remember to come to the quiet room to call me. Also, before sunrise every day, you need to come to the quiet room to inform me!"  "The servant has remembered!" The two maids nodded in agreement.  The three of them descended from the Observatory and came to the pavilion. Miao Yi called the two to sit down with him and then asked, "Do you two know how to sew?"  The two nodded again and said, "Yes."  "Sew me a close-fitting vest..." Miao Yi began to gesture the style of the garment he wanted them to sew. After understanding his instructions, the two girls quickly went to fetch needle and thread, and fabric. Upon returning, Qian'er sat aside to cut the fabric, while Xue'er used a comb to tidy up Miao Yi's hair, which had become disheveled from plucking hairs before, and tied it neatly.  Just then, Yan Xiu entered the yard, found Miao Yi, and reported that he had already contacted Donglai City and that the construction of the dock and the ship would start that day.  "Don't shortchange the craftsmen's wages," Miao Yi reminded him.  This was not the first time he had mentioned this, and Yan Xiu naturally said that he would take care of it. Noticing Xue'er's pale complexion, he couldn't help but ask, "The little auntie doesn't seem to look very well. Is she sick?"  Xue'er quickly shook her head, still frightened by the earlier experience.  Miao Yi looked back at Xue'er, who still had a somewhat pale face, knowing that she was slightly injured earlier but that it wasn't a big problem.  He then said to Yan Xiu, "Speaking of them, I was just looking for you."  Yan Xiu asked, "What does the cave master need?"  "Do they both have the qualifications for cultivation?" Miao Yi asked.  As soon as this was said, Yan Xiu immediately guessed what Miao Yi was about to say, "Does the cave master want them to cultivate?"  Qian'er and Xue'er immediately glanced covertly at Miao Yi. It wasn't their first day here, and over the days, they had heard people talking about cultivation, vaguely understanding what it meant. They couldn't help but tense up and perked up their ears.  "Exactly!" Miao Yi nodded. He had this intention, feeling that the two weak girls by his side couldn't really do much, especially for those in cultivation, such maids were a bit troublesome for him. Going to the back mountain to fetch someone to see him took a long time, climbing up and down the mountain, they would be exhausted and their complexion would change. It wasn't a long-term solution. Just like Yang Qing, having two cultivator maidservants made things much more convenient, and they could also be used as personal guards.  Especially just now, when Xue'er almost had an accident upon touching the jade plate, he took the matter seriously.  "Where can I get a set of cultivation techniques for them?" Miao Yi asked.  Yan Xiu pondered for a moment and said, "Complete cultivation techniques are the lifeblood of each sect and will not be shared. Moreover, to control their disciples, they teach in stages, so it's probably very difficult to obtain them. If there is a chance to go to Liuyun Sha Hai (Flowing Clouds Sand Sea), that place is a lawless area, where many hermit cultivators who have no place in the Six Sacred Realms reside, and it's mixed with demons and ghosts. It's quite normal for some to engage in dark and underhanded dealings. There is a possibility to spend a lot of money to buy them, but no one can guarantee the completeness of the cultivation methods that have not been practiced. It may lead to deviation and possession by demons if not careful. After all, most cultivators memorize their techniques by heart, and even if they carry them, they make them understandable only to themselves to prevent the leakage of their cultivation methods."  "Liuyun Sha Hai..." Miao Yi muttered to himself, thinking of the enchanting woman he met at Miaofa Temple.  Shaking off the shadow of the proprietress's smiles and frowns from his mind, he shook his head and said, "That place is too far away, who would go there to take risks? Besides, like you said, it's not safe, is there no other way?"  Yan Xiu shook his head and said, "It's difficult! To suppress the number of cultivators in the world, such private trafficking of cultivation techniques is severely cracked down upon! Only in a place like Liuyun Sha Hai might such a thing occur."  He didn't say who was suppressing and cracking down, but Miao Yi understood that he was referring to the Six Saints. The Six Saints didn't want to see too many people sharing the world's spiritual power. Once cultivators became rampant, everyone would want to gain spiritual power, which would inevitably lead to chaos and pose a serious threat to the current rules. The Six Saints would not allow anyone to threaten them.  Miao Yi frowned and asked, "Where did the maidservants by the mansion master get their cultivation techniques?"  "Of course, the mansion master taught his own cultivation techniques. It should usually be like this," Yan Xiu said.  Saying this, Yan Xiu wondered, "Mountain Lord, why don't you pass on your own cultivation techniques to them? You can teach them step by step according to their ability to understand."  This sounded nice, but what he meant was for Miao Yi to teach the two maidservants gradually, like other sects do, which also allowed controlling them. 
Chapter 189: Affairs between the Supervisor and the Empress Dowager 64  Xiao Mo had a moment where her spirit was deeply stirred, and she felt a wave of sorrow. The Supervisor... he dares not move. Once his body moves, his mind would also start to function, and he, being so intelligent, would surely know that Bai Weiwei was already dead. He didn't want to admit it, nor dare to think deeply about it, so he could only force himself to sit there, convincing himself that Bai Weiwei was just asleep and would wake up.  Xiao Mo felt that only when Bai Weiwei's body started to rot would the Supervisor truly regain his senses and realize that the person he was holding hands with had been dead for a long time. However, strangely enough, Bai Weiwei's body showed no sign of change. Even her pale complexion had improved quite a bit, and although her body was cold, it was undoubtedly just like she was asleep. Not a single characteristic of a corpse appeared.  Mu Yanjun kept watch over her, his gaze becoming brighter and brighter. Finally, the wretched old doctor was brought in; he was consuming heart-protecting pills, "I reckon that most of my old life is already gone."  Mu Yanjun had not slept for five days, and anyone could see how weary he was. Yet, he was exceptionally lucid, alarmingly and unnaturally so.  "After I had her take the medicine, she has been sleeping like this. I thought it was time to ask you to come and see when she will wake up," he said.  The old doctor sighed and only then approached the bedside to take Bai Weiwei's pulse. "Actually, this phenomenon is extremely rare. There is no need for treatment, but there is one particularly important thing that needs to be done..."  Mu Yanjun listened attentively, like a studious student, with a fire burning in his eyes.  The old doctor's voice lowered, "It's that I have to treat another person now..."  Mu Yanjun leaned forward, not wanting to miss a word he said. However, the old doctor moved as quick as lightning, sticking a needle into his neck in an instant.  Mu Yanjun's eyes widened dramatically, and his hand already slapped towards the old doctor's Baihui acupoint. Xiao Mo's hand stretched out to intercept Mu Yanjun's attack. In this exchange, Mu Yanjun could no longer hold on and fainted.  The old doctor touched his own head, "I almost died. But I guess I won't live much longer either. If he wakes up and is not crazy, that would be good."  Bai Weiwei couldn't be saved. As for Mu Yanjun's condition, it was simply heartbreakingly sorrowful; all his organs were showing problems. Not eating, not sleeping, not thinking, not moving, he was no different from a living dead. If he persisted for another two days, he would probably join Bai Weiwei in death.  Xiao Mo looked at the old doctor, "You guard our Supervisor's life. If you can't protect him this time, I will kill you with my own hands." After speaking, she turned around and went out to the place where they received punishment, silently accepting her penalty.  The old doctor sighed, "No wonder my master said that one should not become a miracle doctor even if you're selling sweet potatoes. Everyone treats me like a god, but even a god cannot make a person who wants to die continue living."  Mu Yanjun only slept for two hours before his eyes opened. He was startled, a rare panic appeared in his eyes, but he found himself unable to move.  Seeing him awake, the old doctor said, "I gave you an acupuncture treatment. Your spirit is greatly diminished, but with some nurturing, you should go meet the King of Hell."  Mu Yanjun's eyes darkened, his face pale and haggard, but full of murderous intent, chilling to behold.  The old doctor gave him another needle, "I originally didn't want to save you, after all, a person like you is cruel and ruthless. Bringing you back to life, who knows what chaos you would bring to this world."  Mu Yanjun's voice was soft and eerie, "Let me go."  The old doctor shook his head, "That won't do. I can't save your beloved, but saving you is also a form of compensation."  Suddenly, Mu Yanjun let out a piercing laugh, "You can't compensate, how could you possibly make up for it? Even if you save everyone in this world, you couldn't make up for a single hair of hers." Chapter 190: Affairs of the Supervisor and the Empress Dowager (End)  The old man: "You are not stupid after all, knowing that she is already dead."  Mu Yanjun's body trembled violently, and the needle that was crucial to restraining him seemed to be unable to hold him back anymore. Seeing this, the old man had no choice but to insert a few more needles.  "Her situation is quite special; you were too late, and the medicine didn't have time to take effect before she died. Therefore, all the medicinal effects protected her body, allowing her to remain uncorrupted for years. Unless you burn her with fire, apart from being a bit cold, she looks no different from a person in a deep sleep," said the old man.  With a sigh, he continued, "So when the young emperor heard this, he had her body taken away and burned."  Upon hearing this, Mu Yanjun understood the young emperor's intentions.  "Good, good, good," he said in a chain of affirmations, laughing coldly, "Everyone wants to take her away, don’t expect any of you to live."  After that, the needles in his body burst out one by one, and blood gushed from the wounds.  The old man saw this and knew that there was nothing he could do to reverse the situation. The thing that hurts people the most since ancient times is the emotion of love.  Mu Yanjun freed himself from the divine doctor's acupuncture restraints and flew out of the place.  The old man thought he was doomed, but Mu Yanjun didn't have time to kill him and disappeared from the spot.  The old man shakily took out a pill to protect his heart and ate it, thinking, "I won't live much longer. Mu Yanjun is indeed very vicious. Not killing me outright, is he planning to torture me slowly?"  A huge pile of wood had already been set up in front of the palace.  Bai Weiwei lay in the midst of the firewood, quiet and soft as if in deep sleep.  Xiao Pang, with eyes red, was so angry he bit his teeth until they bled. He cried until his voice was hoarse, saying, "Send my mother on her way."  Except for Mu Yanjun, everyone in the palace had accepted to send Bai Weiwei off.  Mu Yanjun's people, fearing that their supervisor had become obsessed and delusional, tacitly allowed the young emperor to burn Bai Weiwei's body.  The fire ignited instantly.  Xiao Pang couldn't bear it and knelt down, crying.  But before the fire could reach Bai Weiwei's body, a shadow rushed in recklessly, diving into the flames, lifting Bai Weiwei's body, and then leaping out of the fire.  When Xiao Pang saw the person clearly, he yelled in immense hatred, "Mu Yanjun, may you die a horrible death. My mother was killed by you, and yet you still want to defile her corpse. You are not human."  Mu Yanjun held Bai Weiwei, his hair tips and clothing edges singed by the flames, but Bai Weiwei remained unscathed.  He didn't respond, only said indifferently, "It seems that any riff-raff dares to step on my head now. It's time to clean up the palace."  With these words, Mu Yanjun returned to his old self—sinister, cruel, the almighty Nine Thousand Years Old.  The emperor was placed under house arrest.  People in the palace were slaughtered and cleaned out, especially those who had tacitly agreed to send Bai Weiwei's body to be burned. Regardless of whether they were Mu Yanjun's confidants, they were killed without exception.  Mu Yanjun refused to change for the better, treating the emperor as a puppet and the whole world as a slaughterhouse. Killing became his only hobby.  Mu Yanjun lazily looked outside the door, the ground stained red with blood.  He tenderly stroked Bai Weiwei, who was leaning in his embrace, "Weiwei, look, I killed people again today. If you beg me, I'll stop, okay?"  Bai Weiwei remained silent.  Mu Yanjun smiled and said, "If you don't speak, then I'll continue to kill."  He had once said that if she dared to die, he would drag everyone in this world down to hell to accompany her in burial.  Holding her cold body, Mu Yanjun spoke with seduction, "I am such a bad person, but if you were willing to teach me, maybe I could change for the better."  As he spoke, Mu Yanjun suddenly couldn't bear it and rested his head on her cold neck, silently shedding tears.  "Why won't you, won't you give me a chance to change?" Chapter 191 Reality 1  When Ye Yuxuan struggled to get up from the bed, his entire body was drenched in sweat. He was trembling, his complexion pale to an alarming extent. Suddenly unable to bear it, he hugged himself, gritting his teeth as if trying to call out someone's name. But he murmured silently many times and still couldn't call out the name of the woman in his dream.  His heartbeat was fast, and with closed eyes, he could see the sea of fire from his dream spreading out, ready to engulf him at any moment. He looked down at his own hands, as if he was still holding her. The happiness, sorrow, and anger were slowly fading, but the deep love ingrained in his bones seemed to have been transmitted to him from a man named Mu Yanjun.  Ye Yuxuan knew that he had been particularly out of sorts recently. And this feeling of being off had started to affect his emotions. For instance, right now, he actually felt... sad? Was it sadness? His chest hurt as if someone had drilled a hole in it, yet all the medical checks showed no issues with his body.  Ye Yuxuan pondered for a long while in a daze before finally getting out of bed. Just as he got out of bed, a servant came over and whispered, "Doctor Qin is here." Ye Yuxuan nodded faintly, asking the servant to pour him a glass of water, and then went downstairs with the water.  He discovered that the front door of his house was open, and Qin Qiu was directing a bunch of medical personnel to move medical equipment inside. Ye Yuxuan watched quietly, his somber eyes showing no ripple of emotion.  Qin Qiu looked up and saw Ye Yuxuan, already accustomed to his deadpan expression, and quickly went up to him saying, "My guest room is still there, right?" Ye Yuxuan nodded, "Isn't your guest room supposed to be reserved for a lifetime?" He had many rooms in his place, and Qin Qiu often came over, so he had reserved a room exclusively for him.  Qin Qiu: "Of course I know, so I'm just using it temporarily." Ye Yuxuan did not make a sound.  Without needing to be asked, Qin Qiu said, "You think I want to live here long term, but you are wrong. I have a lot of work at the hospital; how can I have time to stay here often?"  Ye Yuxuan didn't even bother with a grunt of acknowledgment.  Qin Qiu continued on his own, "So I've moved your fiancée into my room." Ye Yuxuan thought for a moment, then calmly said, "Bai Weiwei?"  Qin Qiu: "Yeah, I've already taken her to the room. Old Master Bai suspects there are many problems in his household, especially since Bai Weiwei was kidnapped from the hospital a few days ago. He feels he can't trust anyone around him, so he has entrusted Bai Weiwei to you for now, since you are her fiancé, right?"  Ye Yuxuan thought for a while, "I don't have time to take care of a patient."  Qin Qiu: "But that's your fiancée."  Ye Yuxuan nodded, "Then I just won't have a fiancée."  Qin Qiu was shocked, "What?"  Ye Yuxuan: "Anyway, you can bring her in, but you take care of her."  Qin Qiu roared, "She's not my fiancée."  Ye Yuxuan looked indifferent, "I'll give her to you then."  Qin Qiu almost spat out a mouthful of old blood, defeated. Ye Yuxuan shouldn't have a fiancée; he should live with a robot.  Qin Qiu decided not to talk to this emotionally stunted child. He needed to calm down, no, he needed to set up the environment for Bai Weiwei. After all, she was not in good health and had been in a deep sleep, requiring special care and medical equipment to sustain her life.  Qin Qiu was quick with his hands and feet, setting up the equipment quickly and ensuring Bai Weiwei's condition was stable before instructing the caregiver to watch over her throughout the night.  After he left the room, he saw Ye Yuxuan holding a cup of water, still sitting on the sofa in the living room, as if pondering something. Chapter 192: Reality 2  Qin Qiu was also thirsty, and after asking a servant to bring some water, he took a big gulp before saying, "You have insomnia?"  Ye Yuxuan nodded lightly, "I feel there's something I need to think about."  Qin Qiu walked over to the sofa opposite him, sipping water and asking, "What problem do you need to think about? Is it possible that the company is going bankrupt?"  Ye Yuxuan said calmly, "I'm wondering, will I become a corpse violator?"  Qin Qiu spat out the water in his mouth, "Corpse violator!"  Ye Yuxuan continued calmly, "It's just that in my dream, I dreamt about that man, always wanting to violate the corpse."  Qin Qiu said, "Stop, stop, stop, what kind of strange dream did you have again?"  Ye Yuxuan's expression became rare and distracted, "I dreamt she died, but her corpse always looked as cute as if she were sleeping."  Qin Qiu's voice became strange, "Cute?"  It's unbelievable that Ye Yuxuan would describe someone as cute, as if the sky were falling.  Ye Yuxuan repeated seriously and emphatically, "Yes, cute."  Then he continued, "And in the dream, that man, many times he couldn't help it, wanting to violate the corpse."  ---  Sequel:  The hot springs were misty, in this space where steam was rising. A delicate and beautiful figure lay quietly on the edge of the hot spring, with black hair falling into the water, floating like seaweed.  Mu Yanjun's face was somewhat flushed, his eyes burning with a frightening intensity. He struggled for a long time before gently releasing her body, not committing the most beastly act.  When did it all begin? Was it watching her sleeping corpse day after day without any response? Or was it when he started to go mad, sick, and even twisted?  He had tried every method to stop himself, but in the end, he couldn't help but undress her.  Only when touching her cold skin did he feel alive.  Murder no longer provoked any reaction in him.  She was dead.  He knew, he always knew.  He even knew how dark and terrible he was for not wanting to bury her.  When the young emperor was six years old, he would rather burn her corpse than leave it to him.  Maybe he knew from the start that he would commit such an act of desecration upon her.  Many times he really wanted to do it, but often at the last step, when he looked at her peaceful face, he couldn't go through with it.  He was afraid that down there, she would get angry, ignore him.  Although they were already married, only the final step was left.  Still, he didn't dare to take the risk.  Mu Yanjun endured for a long time before suppressing the burning sensation in his body, not truly breaking through the line to enter her.  He carefully washed her body clean and dressed her in comfortable and beautiful clothes before carrying her out.  The palace was empty, and the servants were fleeing everywhere.  When he learned that the young emperor began to cultivate forces and contact various military powers, planning to stand on his own, he never stopped him.  He even occasionally helped him.  The young emperor had also grown up, Mu Yanjun calculated, he was sixteen this year.  Ten years had passed, and he had been guarding the cold body of Bai Weiwei for ten years.  So fast, yet so slow.  Mu Yanjun carried Bai Weiwei, slowly walking to the palace gate, only to see a tall figure in armor, holding a long sword, leading the imperial guards surrounding the palace.  The young man's face was handsome and stern. He pointed his sword at Mu Yanjun and said harshly, "Mu traitor, return my mother to me, and I can leave you a whole corpse." Chapter 193: Reality 3  The Little Emperor grew up quickly, living a life of humiliation and sneaking survival under the feet of Mu Yanjun. In such humiliation, he began to vie for power and profit step by step, treading on blood, until now, finally able to wield a sword to seek revenge.  Mu Yanjun's face remained calm as he gently smoothed a strand of Bai Weiwei's hair that the wind had tousled, tucking it behind her ear. His expression was indescribably tender, then he looked up at the Little Emperor.  "Still coming? She has always been mine from the beginning to the end; what makes you think you can have her back?" said Mu Yanjun.  The Little Emperor's eyes reddened with anger, and he said word by word, "My mother has already died, the dead should be respected, how can you... how can you keep holding onto her body and not let her rest in peace, as if you won't let her be reincarnated peacefully?"  Everyone in the palace knew that Mu Yanjun lived with his mother, sharing the same residence and bed. He had seen a lot of secret affairs, how could he not know those dirty thoughts this eunuch had towards his mother.  "You claim to love my mother, but what you do is to humiliate her. How can you have the face to say you love her?" The Little Emperor said this, almost unable to hold back his tears. He hated his own lack of strength to protect Bai Weiwei, and also hated that he grew up too slowly to give Bai Weiwei a grand funeral even in death.  Mu Yanjun looked at the Little Emperor with a dark gaze, then suddenly smiled, "I did it on purpose. I heard that as long as you keep a person's body from being buried, her soul can only be trapped next to the body."  The Little Emperor suddenly remembered that this Mu villain had once invited high monks to the palace. Sure enough, he heard Mu Yanjun laugh and say, "I invited high monks to cast a soul-locking charm. If there really is a soul after death, she will not be able to escape from me and will have to stay by my side day and night."  The Little Emperor trembled all over with anger, his eyes bloodshot, and he shouted, "Mu Yanjun, is this how you love someone? You're simply a madman."  Mu Yanjun's smile at the corner of his mouth grew larger, eventually becoming crazily twisted, "I have long been a madman. Even if she dies, she won't be able to get rid of me. I want her to be entwined with me life after life."  The Little Emperor waved his hand, "Charge in and capture him."  He wouldn't feel relieved unless Mu Yanjun was cut to pieces. But before anyone could move, suddenly flames surged up. The palace had already been doused with oil, and a spark together with the wind caused the flames to reach the sky instantly.  Everyone had to back away to avoid the fire. The Little Emperor saw Mu Yanjun standing in the fire, holding Bai Weiwei, and in a moment of impulse, couldn't help but rush into the fire.  The people behind him immediately held him back, "Your Majesty, you can't go in. The fire can't be extinguished. If you go in, how will you survive?"  The Little Emperor, disregarding everything, shouted at Mu Yanjun with all his heart, "Mu Yanjun, let her go, let her go!"  The fire would not stop burning until everything was consumed. Mu Yanjun, holding Bai Weiwei, could not be separated in the end as they burned together.  Hearing the Little Emperor's words, Mu Yanjun looked up and smiled. In the light of the fire, his smile was indescribably relieved and relaxed, even the teardrop mole under his eye became more vivid.  Then he held Bai Weiwei and turned around to slowly walk into the palace engulfed in flames. If they couldn't be together in life, they would merge into one even as ashes in death.  For ten years, he had been thinking about merging with her day and night, but always stopped at the very last step. Because he knew that even if he obtained her body, it would still be a lifeless object.  If there really was a next life, and she knew of his vile and dirty ways, she might not want him anymore.  Now it was good. In death, they could be burned together, inseparably. Chapter 194: Reality 4  Mu Yanjun couldn't help but hug her even tighter, as flames began to consume their bodies. He lowered his gaze to look at her. Then, he rested his head on her neck and whispered softly, "I miss you so much, Weiwei."  ---  Qin Qiu clutched his head, feeling a headache coming on. What the hell is this stuff? Ye Yuxuan continued speaking, "In the end, the young emperor simply couldn't separate their ashes, and had to grudgingly bury them together in a single urn."  Qin Qiu waved his hand dismissively, "I think there's definitely something wrong with you recently."  Ye Yuxuan nodded, "I know."  Qin Qiu said, "You must be so pent up that you're becoming a pervert, even your dreams are twisted. You've been dreaming about love all the time lately, don't deny it, you must be going crazy wanting a relationship."  Ye Yuxuan silently looked at him.  Qin Qiu clapped his hands forcefully, "Why are you looking at me? Otherwise, why would you have such dreams? Over the years, you haven't been with women much, let alone **. What kind of man are you?"  Ye Yuxuan spoke calmly, "I feel like it's not a dream, it feels more like reality."  Qin Qiu, "Oh my god, your delusions are so severe now? You're taking dreams for reality?"  Ye Yuxuan couldn't be bothered to persuade others, he stood up, "I'm going to the company."  Qin Qiu reached out to hold him, "It's four in the morning, what company are you going to? I'm telling you, you should get into a relationship and lose your V. I've seen many old virgins like you, longing for a woman to the point of madness."  Ye Yuxuan tried to pull away, but found that Qin Qiu was holding on tight.  Qin Qiu continued, "You should go meet your fiancée now, start a relationship with her, and once things fall into place, you can do some shameful things. That way you won't always have those frustrated dreams."  Ye Yuxuan said, "Let go."  Qin Qiu said, "Don't be shy, young man. I know the pain of never having been in a relationship..."  Ye Yuxuan, "Old virgin, let go."  Qin Qiu stood there as if struck by lightning.  Ye Yuxuan, with a poker face, defeated his opponent effortlessly and went to work at the company at four in the morning.  Qin Qiu clutched his chest, "Ye Yuxuan, I shouldn't have saved your future wife, I should let you taste the bitterness of being alone."  After Ye Yuxuan left, Qin Qiu sighed, feeling as if he had aged many years. He remembered that he should go check on Bai Weiwei, as she was still asleep.  However, as soon as he opened the door, he heard the nurse's voice, "Miss Bai, wait, you can't pull out the needle like that."  Bai Weiwei didn't care about that, she just wanted to strangle the system. That damn system had exchanged her life points for a life extension pill, and her life for an entire month had been traded away.  Adding on the life safety welfare she received from the last dimension, five days of life points were deducted.  As soon as she woke up, she heard that she owed the system five days of life, and her heart disease immediately acted up.  In order not to let her die, the system directly used the life extension pill, gaining ten days of life, and after deductions, only five days were left.  After more deductions, only an hour remained.  From five days, a total of one hundred and twenty hours, it was deducted down to just one hour.  She wanted to chop up the system; who would believe it wasn't the system's doing?  The system tried to soothe her, "Host, calm down."  Bai Weiwei, "Calm your sister."  The system consoled, "Broaden your horizons, it's just a little bit of life points, don't take it to heart."  Bai Weiwei, "Broaden your head, you'd better shut up, or I'll stuff you into a beer bottle and smash it with a hammer." Chapter 195: Reality 5  The system immediately shuts up. She doesn't have the time to ask in detail what was deducted, leaving her with only an hour of life left, as she has more important things to do right now. Bai Weiwei got out of bed, rushed to the door, and saw Qin Qiu opening the door, looking at her in astonishment. Bai Weiwei had seen him a few times before, after all, he was the hospital director. She spoke very quickly, "Director, hello, where is this place?" Waking up to find the room changed, could it be the hospital's super VIP ward?  Qin Qiu immediately said, "This is your fiancé's house, it's like this, your father wants you two to deepen your relationship... Holy shit, what are you doing?" Bai Weiwei's hand actually went straight for his clothes, like a starving wolf pouncing on a sheep. She didn't have time to listen to what he was saying, and took out a cellphone directly from his pocket to call her own father.  As soon as the call connected, she swiftly said, "Dad, that bitch Bai Yaoyao wants to kill me. I had a heart attack, she tampered with my medicine trying to steal my fiancé, my company's position, everything I have. I was lucky not to die, last time she even instigated An Le, that bastard, to kidnap me intending to drown me. You better get someone to control her, and then wait for me to come back..."  She paused for a moment, then slowly and forcefully said, "Come back and slap her a thousand or eight hundred times, to wake her up, a wild chicken is destined not to become a phoenix. Even if she became a phoenix, I could pluck her feathers and stew her." There was a long pause from the other end of the line, as if digesting her words.  Then suddenly a light laughter came through, "Big sister, I don't know what you're talking about, have you been sick for a long time, and something is wrong with your brain?" Bai Weiwei's heart trembled, Bai Yaoyao?  "Where's dad?" Bai Yaoyao: "You mean our father? He's asleep, it's so late, you shouldn't disturb him."  Bai Weiwei sneered coldly, "What do you want to do?"  Bai Yaoyao sneered, "What do I want to do? I want you dead, will you die?"  Bai Weiwei took a deep breath, "That's also your dad, don't hurt him."  Bai Yaoyao clenched her teeth, "Is he my dad? You ask yourself, in Bai Changyan's heart and eyes, there's only you, his precious darling, and I'm just a damn weed. If something happens to you, he gets anxious and upset, if I died, he probably wouldn't even blink."  Bai Weiwei quickly walked outside, but saw that the room outside was completely a strange house, a huge living room with a dazzling and expensive crystal chandelier overhead. The butler was on night duty, and the servants quietly came and went without a sound. The door was of a special design that couldn't be opened without permission.  Ye Yuxuan's room? Bai Weiwei finally had the time to remember, her strange and utterly useless fiancé, what kind of a wealthy man he was.  "What do you want? As long as you don't hurt dad, I agree to anything." Bai Weiwei's weakness was Bai Changyan. Although Bai Changyan was swindled when he was young, resulting in Bai Yaoyao, his illegitimate daughter. But to Bai Weiwei, Bai Changyan truly poured out his love.  Bai Yaoyao laughed with pleasure, "Big sister, my sister who always seems like a queen high above, you actually speak to me in such a humble tone? I'm at home now, dad is right beside me."  Bai Weiwei had already reached the front door, on the other end of the phone, that woman's voice was still arrogant. "Dad is tied up with a bomb by me, now you have to choose, do you exchange your life for his, or just watch him die without saving him?" Chapter 196: Reality 6  Bai Weiwei closed her eyes, calming herself down. Then she opened her eyes again, her gaze fierce and resolute.  "I choose to exchange my life for it," she declared.  Qin Qiu had just walked over when he heard Bai Weiwei's words.  He was completely confused. "What happened?"  Bai Weiwei turned around, "Open the door, lend me your car."  Qin Qiu also realized that something was wrong with Bai Weiwei's state, so he immediately ordered the servants to open the door, and then went to get the car.  Bai Weiwei quickly followed, and as soon as the car door opened, she squeezed past Qin Qiu, sat in the driver's seat, closed the door, and drove off. The sequence of actions was terrifyingly fast.  By the time Qin Qiu came back to his senses, the car had already sped away.  Qin Qiu was utterly shocked. He suddenly started to run wildly after his car.  "Bai Weiwei, give me back my phone!"  How was he supposed to play King's Glory without his phone?  ---  Ye Yuxuan's place was about an hour's distance from her home.  Bai Weiwei rushed over with reckless speed, and by the time she arrived home, the system reminded her, "There are only ten minutes left."  Couldn't she live a bit longer? What exactly did this broken system do with her life points?  She never managed to successfully live through a day.  Bai Weiwei unlocked the door with her fingerprint, and the house was empty, not a single person in sight.  Where were the dozens of servants that were usually there? Had Bai Yaoyao dismissed them all?  Bai Weiwei's heartbeat was racing; if not for the life points given by the system that greatly improved her physical condition, she would have probably had a heart attack.  Suddenly, Bai Yaoyao appeared at the top of the stairs, "Sister, you're here."  Bai Weiwei looked at her coldly, "Where's dad?"  Bai Yaoyao looked at her tenderly, "Dad took some sleeping pills. His vigilance is really strong. If I hadn't looked for the opportunity for so long, I wouldn't have been able to put him to sleep."  Bai Weiwei took steps upward, "You want my life, how do you plan to take it? Do you want me to jump off the building myself, or do you want to slash my face and stab me dozens of times to vent your anger?"  Suddenly, Bai Yaoyao said, "Don't come over, sister. I'm afraid of your special abilities."  Surviving poison, cars flying to the sky.  She found it ridiculous, but she couldn't help but guard against it.  Just as Bai Weiwei was about to stop, the system's cold voice said, "Three steps left, hurry, Weiwei, go up."  Bai Weiwei didn't expect the system to suddenly remind her—what did it mean by "three steps left"?  She almost instantly chose to trust the system.  Bai Yaoyao's face changed, "Stop!"  But Bai Weiwei was just a few steps away from reaching her.  However, Bai Weiwei suddenly surged forward a few steps, and the system also reminded, "Ding, ‘Deep Love for You’ is activated, the effect lasts three minutes, please enjoy it happily."  Bai Yaoyao was about to scream to have An Le kill Bai Changyan when suddenly her mind shook, her pupils scattered for a few moments, and by the time she regained consciousness, she was already looking at Bai Weiwei with shiny eyes.  "Sister, I love you, love you, love you!"  Bai Weiwei was stunned for a moment. What the hell?  Bai Yaoyao suddenly rushed over, happy to hug her.  Bai Weiwei was startled and kicked her away.  Bai Yaoyao fell to the ground with a happy face, looking up, "Hitting indicates affection, scolding shows love, sister, kick me again, kick me, please."  Bai Weiwei felt like she was about to have a heart attack from disgust.  Yet at this moment, the system recited deeply and emotionally: "Dear, as a lonely single person in the deep night, do you envy the mandarin ducks flying side by side? Do you silently cry alone, only able to watch those dog couples holding hands in the distance? Don't be envious, stand up. The ‘Deep Love for You’ package only requires 119 hours of life points, and you can bring your love home. From now on, in your life, there will be someone to love you, hug you, kiss you, hehe you!"  Bai Weiwei staggered a couple of steps; her 119 hours of life points had been exchanged for this useless thing.  And Bai Yaoyao took the chance to hug her thigh, her face rippling with pleasure, "Sister, I love you so much, kick me to death."  As Bai Weiwei wished, she kicked her away.  "Scram, are you crazy?" Chapter 197: Reality 7  When An Le came out, he saw Bai Weiwei kicking Bai Yaoyao away and immediately took out the remote control for the bomb. Then he rushed to Bai Yaoyao's side, hugged her, and said to Bai Weiwei, "I advise you not to act rashly. Now, as long as I press this button..."  Bai Weiwei gritted her teeth and said, "An Le, you ungrateful wretch, you know how my dad treated you, and yet you stoop so low for this cheap woman?"  An Le took a deep breath, about to say something, when suddenly Bai Yaoyao jumped up in a fury and slapped An Le's left cheek askew.  "You made my sister angry. Look at my loving slap, giving you a heart-shaped peach." An Le: "......" Bai Weiwei: "......"  Bai Yaoyao looked affectionately at Bai Weiwei, then suddenly slapped An Le's right cheek.  "Sister, look, even when I hit someone, it's in the shape of love for you."  Bai Weiwei, with a mouthful of old blood stuck in her throat, felt like she couldn't take it anymore. She thought she needed medication, otherwise her heart disease was sure to act up.  An Le touched his face in confusion, "......"  The system leisurely added, "Actually, I saw these two cheap people setting up your dad with a life-extending pill as soon as I got back, extending his life by only ten days. After deducting five days, there are only one hundred and twenty hours left. I was worried that after you woke up, you would be threatened by these cheap people and be in danger, so I had to use your life points to buy the love package."  Bai Weiwei covered her chest, "Are you trying to disgust me? You could have just let Bai Yaoyao ascend to heaven. What's with this ghostly package?"  The system sighed, "We in the system world have laws; we cannot directly take someone's life. And you're too poor. You really can't afford anything offensive. You got those 119 hours just as the love package was discounted, and managed to snatch three minutes. For three minutes, Bai Yaoyao's love for you will be as vast as the universe. Whatever you tell her to do, she will do."  The system paused, then worriedly said, "You only have a few minutes left of life. The bomb still needs to be defused. After we get through this, let's go complete the next mission to save your life."  Bai Weiwei knew that now was not the time to dwell on this; her time was running out.  She immediately said to Bai Yaoyao, "Defuse the bomb on dad."  To take this cheap woman's life, the bomb had to be defused.  An Le, thinking of the strange events he had experienced before, and seeing Bai Yaoyao's drastic change in behavior, immediately realized this must be Bai Weiwei's doing.  He immediately restrained Bai Yaoyao with both hands, "Miss, what have you done to Yaoyao?"  Bai Weiwei's face became cold, "I said, defuse the bomb on my dad."  These words were like a firework of love, striking Bai Yaoyao's heart directly. She burst out with tremendous strength, flipping An Le over.  "Yes, my sister. Even defusing the bomb is in the shape of loving you."  Bai Yaoyao stretched out her hand with a face full of bliss, making a big heart shape, then turned around and viciously grabbed An Le's collar.  "Sister said, are you deaf? Defuse the bomb on dad."  An Le, with a worried face, "Yaoyao, have you been poisoned? Wake up. If you defuse the bomb, you won't be able to gain a foothold in the Bai family."  They had reached this point today, with no way out.  Once Bai Changyan died, and with Bai Weiwei being sickly, Bai Yaoyao would definitely have a chance to control the Bai family.  Bai Yaoyao suddenly thought of something, abruptly searched An Le and pulled out a gun for self-defense, pressing it under her own jaw, "Defuse it, you pig. How dare you contradict what my sister said, defuse it or I'll die and show you." Chapter 198: Reality 8  An Le was shocked. Next to him, Bai Weiwei added fuel to the fire, "If he doesn't dismantle the bomb, kill him and then commit suicide." Bai Yaoyao's eyes were filled with love, "Yes, my dear sister. I will definitely shoot heart-shaped bullets, killing and suicide are all in the shape of love for you."  Bai Weiwei was mentally exhausted: She didn't want to talk to this love-idiot at all, feeling like her IQ had been dragged down to the core of the earth.  An Le, although unwilling, couldn't let the demon-like Bai Yaoyao commit suicide. After all he had done, it was all for Bai Yaoyao.  Bai Changyan had taken sleeping pills and was sleeping very deeply.  Seeing her father lying there tiredly, the tears in Bai Weiwei's eyes were almost unstoppable.  Although An Le slowed down his movements, there were only a few steps to dismantling the bomb, and even if he was slower, he still finished dismantling it.  Bai Yaoyao's eyes were sparkling, "Dear sister, the bomb has been dismantled."  Bai Weiwei nodded, "You did well, drag him to death, bye."  The tears in Bai Yaoyao’s eyes flowed out from excitement, "Even the way you want to kill me is so beautiful. I love you so much, I wish I could turn into fireworks, and when they burst into the sky, they are all little hearts of love for you."  Bai Weiwei: She really wanted to cover her ears. F*ck your ‘heart’.  Bai Yaoyao, laughing satisfied and lasciviously, aimed the gun at An Le, "Dear sister said, it’s time for us to die, bye."  She pulled the trigger, aiming straight at An Le. However, at the critical moment, An Le rolled on the ground with agility, dodging the bullet and swiftly rushing toward her to snatch the gun from her hand.  His skills were way better than Bai Yaoyao’s. When he was serious, ten Bai Yaoyaos wouldn't stand a chance against him.  Bai Weiwei’s complexion changed; she knew that if An Le knocked Bai Yaoyao unconscious, both she and Bai Changyan wouldn't be able to escape from An Le's clutches.  Moreover, she heard the familiar reminder from the system.  【Countdown ten seconds... nine...】  There was no time left.  Bai Weiwei's eyes hardened, and she shouted directly at Bai Yaoyao: "Go jump off the building, right now, immediately."  An Le had become like this also because he liked Bai Yaoyao. If Bai Yaoyao jumped off the building, An Le could only chase after her.  Sure enough, Bai Yaoyao, without any hesitation, rushed outside, "Even if I jump off the building, I will jump in the shape of loving you."  An Le roared, "Yaoyao, what on earth is wrong with you? Wake up."  He could not care about anything else and could only desperately chase after her.  Bai Yaoyao looked like she was really going to jump off the building.  Bai Weiwei immediately made a phone call to her trusted people in the company, asking someone to come and protect Bai Changyan.  She momentarily forgot that this was not her phone, and in her haste, she directly pressed the familiar position, not noticing that the numbers in the call log were all incorrect.  As soon as the call connected, she immediately said: "Quickly come over, my dad is in danger, Bai Yaoyao is the murderer, in cahoots with An Le planning to kill him..."  She didn’t finish speaking.  A cold and calm voice came from the other end.  "Who are you?"  Bai Weiwei was stunned, quickly looked at the phone, and realized that she had dialed someone else by mistake.  She had no time for idle talk, immediately hung up the phone, and went to call the right person, but time had already run out.  【The system offers a free newbie gift pack, ding, unlocked, the host has obtained three days of vegetative state life, please quickly complete the next task to save your life.】  Bai Weiwei finally couldn't help but roar: "Can't you give anything other than a newbie gift pack?"  Is the system so poor that it only has newbie gift packs left? Chapter 199: Reality 9  Ye Yuxuan looked at his phone and suddenly felt that the voice was familiar. But in a moment of distraction, he couldn't remember whose voice it was. He continued to work for a while before he remembered that the number was Qin Qiu's. Ye Yuxuan redialed the phone, and as soon as it was connected, Qin Qiu's roar came through, "Ye Yuxuan, let me tell you, your fiancée's sister actually tried to kill her, and she even wanted to take her fiancé, her company's position, everything from her, and even tried to drown her. Now, she is even trying to kill Bai Changyan. I'm at the hospital right now, Bai Yaoyao ran to jump off a building, Bai Weiwei fainted, Bai Changyan woke up..." Ye Yuxuan hung up the phone calmly.  So, was he really unable to distinguish between dream and reality? Just now, he actually felt that the voice was particularly similar to that of the woman in his dreams. But...  He looked down at his phone; it wasn't a dream. Qin Qiu's phone had called twice just now. He suddenly stood up, grabbed the suit jacket on the chair, and walked straight out.  ---  When Qin Qiu arrived at the Bai family's place, he saw Bai Yaoyao stepping up the stairs in an enchantingly joyful manner. "Sister, I love you, I love you, I love you, I still love you even if I jump off a building."  An Le was chasing behind her, "Yaoyao, wake up, you're just poisoned, deeply hypnotized, what the hell have you been given, don't jump off the building."  What the hell?  Qin Qiu watched dumbfounded as they ran to the highest floor. Then he immediately went to find Bai Weiwei.  Bai Weiwei lay pale at the side of the bed. Alarmed, he immediately rushed over to pick her up. He had a feeling that something would go wrong and had already called for an ambulance and a police car. After calling Ye Yuxuan, the ambulance had also arrived and swiftly moved the people onto the ambulance.  When Bai Yaoyao jumped off the building, she was blocked by a canopy below, suffered severe injuries, and was taken straight to the operating room.  Bai Weiwei was in a not so bad condition with stable vital signs but was unconscious.  Bai Changyan, who had woken up, looked haggard as he watched his daughter. The house's surveillance had been destroyed, and he didn't know what had happened. But he guessed that the recent events must be related to his second daughter.  An Le had been locked up by him and was under severe interrogation.  When Ye Yuxuan arrived at the hospital, he saw Qin Qiu sitting outside Bai Weiwei's hospital room, silently crying. He paused, then walked up behind Qin Qiu and asked indifferently, "What happened?"  Qin Qiu turned around, holding his phone, "I lost my rank match again."  Ye Yuxuan didn't pay attention to him, "Who did you lend your phone to just now?"  Qin Qiu: "To Bai Weiwei."  Ye Yuxuan immediately pushed open the door of the ward and saw a woman lying on the bed. She was sleeping peacefully, looking somewhat haggard due to her long illness. Her lips were pale, her complexion not good, and even her long black hair had lost some of its luster.  Ye Yuxuan didn't know what he was thinking. He had seen her before; after all, she was his fiancée, but he never had any impression of her.  Qin Qiu then realized something was wrong and came in, "What are you looking at?" His gaze at Bai Weiwei was too frightening.  Ye Yuxuan was silent for a while before he softly said, "When she wakes up, I want to hear her voice." Her voice, for an instant, stirred his otherwise tranquil emotions, causing his heart, hard as a rock, to tremble. Chapter 200: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (1)  When Bai Weiwei woke up, she heard the system's voice ringing out. "Your mission objective is to win the love of Song Yunhuan. Target: Song Yunhuan, completion: zero. Time: four months."  She had no time to think further because as soon as she opened her eyes, she saw a pair of eyes filled with disbelief and hatred. Bai Weiwei was stunned to find that she had just forcefully pushed someone out. The person was young, with black hair that caught a halo of light when tossed in the sun, and beneath the messy hair was an extremely handsome face.  That face looked at Bai Weiwei with hatred as it fell out of the car. Bai Weiwei instinctively reached out to grab his hand but only caught his sleeve. Due to the force of speed and gravity, the sleeve tore, and the man still fell, instantly swallowed up by a mass of... zombies?  Bai Weiwei took a closer look and gasped. She was standing at the very back of a truck's cargo area, the doors wide open. The truck was full of people, and outside, a large group of decaying zombies were rapidly chasing after the vehicle. Whenever a human fell from the truck, they would rush over to feed.  The man she had pushed out had already disappeared into the zombie horde, probably devoured completely.  The system's familiar reminder also chimed in. "Ding, the male lead's favorability towards you is negative thirty-five. The male lead is full of hatred for you, more than that of a little heart that wants to kill you, mwah mwah."  Bai Weiwei felt goosebumps all over. What's wrong with the system, has it been possessed by a lovey-dovey package? What kind of reminder style is this?  Suddenly, she remembered something very important. Looking at the piece of sleeve fabric hanging from her finger, she asked somewhat hazily, "The man that this body just pushed out..."  The system cheerfully reminded, "Yes, that's the male lead."  Bai Weiwei felt the world spinning. Her hands, stained with sin and blood, were also stained with negative favorability. She had just pushed the male lead out to feed the zombies?  With the male lead eaten by zombies, whom was she supposed to pursue?  Could this world be...  Bai Weiwei asked with a trembling voice, "Ah Ling, this world isn't a horror film, is it?"  The system replied, "Look at those zombies chasing after your vehicle. Any normal person would know this is an apocalyptic zombie world."  Bai Weiwei stumbled to her feet, "But the target of the pursuit, he's already been eaten by zombies."  The system responded, "That is something the host should strive to resolve, so go for it, love you little heart."  Bai Weiwei felt disgusted.  System, what's wrong with you, haunted by the resentful spirit of being loved by Bai Yaoyao?  The system then reminded, "Ding, please host begin to accept the memories of this body."  That familiar headache struck again, and Bai Weiwei's complexion grew much paler. After she absorbed the memories, she was speechless for a long time.  The mission target, Song Yunhuan, and this body, Bai Weiwei, were university alumni. Bai Weiwei, with her delicate and pretty appearance and sweet voice, was very popular with men.  Song Yunhuan, on the other hand, was a recluse, the kind of tech guy who holed up in his dormitory writing code every day. Although he had a good appearance, his gloomy personality did not make him likable to girls.  These two people originally had nothing to do with each other.  However, the previous Bai Weiwei was a green tea bitch, seemingly pure on the surface, but in reality, she very much enjoyed using her pitiable appearance to gain the vain satisfaction of men's favor. Chapter 201: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (2)  Song Yunhuan was favored by her because he was a loner, with no woman ever getting close to him. She thought that this kind of man, who didn't pay any attention to women, was very challenging. Thus, she made a bet with her roommates that she could win over Song Yunhuan, the man who never showed interest in women, within a month.  Due to Song Yunhuan's lack of experience in dating, he was momentarily deceived by Bai Weiwei's innocent appearance and actually accepted her confession. The result was that the two of them became boyfriend and girlfriend for three days, barely progressing to the point of watching a movie together. But then, Song Yunhuan saw through Bai Weiwei's true face and even found out about her bet with her roommates.  Feeling deceived, Song Yunhuan exposed all of her deceitful acts toward men on the internet and straightforwardly asked for a breakup. Bai Weiwei felt deeply humiliated and was just about to take revenge on Song Yunhuan when the apocalyptic virus suddenly broke out, and zombies besieged the city. The two, who had just broken up, were forced to flee.  Because there were too many people escaping and only one truck was available, Bai Weiwei couldn't squeeze onto it. Song Yunhuan, feeling a moment of compassion, pulled her up, but Bai Weiwei, thinking of the humiliation, vengefully pushed the unguarded Song Yunhuan off the truck to feed the zombies.  Right after pushing him, Bai Weiwei was struck with regret. Looking at her hands, she wondered why she couldn't have reacted faster to hold onto Song Yunhuan, who was now being eaten by zombies. Whom would she go after now? Seduce zombies? No, she should be thinking about how to survive.  Because the truck was overloaded, she stood by the truck's door and could easily be pushed off. Someone had already started to forcefully push her out. If she fell, she would likely meet the same fate as zombie fodder.  The system once again reminded her, "Side mission reward distribution, please accept, host."  Bai Weiwei: "Accept."  The reward had better be a powerful apocalyptic survival skill that lets her fly or hide away. At the very least, a space to avoid others would do.  System: "Ding, irresistible charm trait has been fully distributed."  Bai Weiwei: Irresistible charm trait... What use does this skill have? It could be useful in the entertainment industry, but what good is this rotten charm during the apocalypse? It would be better to have a golden finger that allows survival without eating.  Suddenly, someone in the front of the truck yelled, "It's not working, the vehicle can't accelerate, and at this rate, the zombies will catch up to us."  There were too many people, and the truck was excessively overloaded. If the vehicle broke down, everyone on the truck would feed the zombies.  "How about... letting some people off the truck?" Someone suggested this, not knowing who said it. But this was almost everyone's shared thought on the truck. However, no one wanted to be the one who gets off.  Stepping off meant becoming prey to the zombies. Standing next to the rear door of the truck, Bai Weiwei could step right out of the vehicle. If people were to be eliminated, she would be the first to go.  Sure enough, someone was already quietly trying to push her off the truck. Bai Weiwei's face changed, and she turned back to look, only to find it was a school senior. A man who was usually quite polite and gentle turned out to have such malicious and selfish thoughts.  Just as she was about to say something, a breeze blew by. The system's reminder sounded in her ear: "Ding, irresistible charm trait activated."  Pink heart-shaped bubbles with captions floated before her eyes. 【Her slightly curled chestnut brown hair was lifted by the wind, her clear and dazzling starry eyes shone with captivating light, pure and innocent like a fawn...】  Bai Weiwei: What is this?  Yet the school senior was staring at her dumbfounded, his face turning red.  Bai Weiwei frowned, just about to say something. Another string of pink captions floated up. 【Her eyebrows furrowed, on her exquisite, unparalleled face was a pitiable sorrow.】  Bai Weiwei: "......" Chapter 202: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (3)  The senior's heart seemed captured by her sorrow, and he immediately grabbed her hand, "Don't stand here, it's easy to fall off. Let's move inside a bit."  Wasn't he just about to push her down?  His attitude changed rapidly.  The senior pushed those people away and pulled Bai Weiwei to squeeze further inside the car.  Bai Weiwei realized that this senior had a lot of power; many people were afraid of him, and many followed his orders.  If it were anyone else, daring to push their way into the car during such apocalyptic times, they would probably incur public wrath and be pushed out.  They reached the innermost part.  Indeed, a small group had formed, and the senior was part of it.  The senior stuffed her into the innermost seat, "Weiwei, sit here. Once the car drives out of the city, my uncle will come to pick me up."  Then he sat down next to Bai Weiwei, looking at her with a flushed and shy face.  Bai Weiwei pursed her lips in silence, listening to them discussing how to get some people off the car.  Only then did she find out that this senior, Lin Xiao, came from a powerful family, especially an uncle who was a high-ranking military officer.  And the people in this little group were all rich second-generation or official second-generation like Lin Xiao.  This also let Bai Weiwei understand why this group of people received such favorable treatment.  Because the car would eventually run out of fuel, but if these powerful second-generation individuals were on board, someone would definitely come to their rescue.  Bai Weiwei heard someone scream in agony, and her brows furrowed, just about to say something.  But she heard Lin Xiao say, "Don't be afraid. There are always some people who accidentally fall out. You won't have any trouble."  Bai Weiwei looked at him in astonishment.  Was she that familiar with him?  In the original host's memory, this senior was low-key and gentle, but he never hung out with them.  Could it be that Lin Xiao secretly loved the original Bai Weiwei?  Just as she thought this, the pink bubble subtitles appeared again.  【Her downcast beauty, as soft as clouds on the horizon, and like fog by the sea, so fragile that it inspires pity, making one unable to resist the urge to hold her and protect her…】  Lin Xiao also got excited, "Don't be afraid, I will protect you, and I won't let you suffer from the storm."  Bai Weiwei was speechless for a moment and knocked on the system, "What's with the pink subtitles?"  Only she could see them, which was making her cringe.  System: "It's the charm effect subtitles. In others' eyes, you're just that touching and uniquely beautiful."  Bai Weiwei felt tired, "Can it be blocked?"  Such subtitles could drive one to suicide; they were unbearable.  System: "Blocked now, but the effect is still there. I think the subtitle effect is very good, it has a girlish charm."  Bai Weiwei: It's more like a brainless charm.  Just as Lin Xiao was excitedly vowing to protect her,  The system's reminder suddenly sounded.  【Ding, male lead's favorability minus forty.】  Bai Weiwei was stunned, is Song Yunhuan not dead yet?  And at that moment, in the pile of zombies that had devoured Song Yunhuan, the zombies without consciousness suddenly emitted a terrible hoarse sound.  It sounded like fear and like a warning.  All the zombies suddenly contorted, and their decaying bodies were twisted into pieces by a tremendous force of space.  And from the pile of rotten flesh and severed limbs, a pale, colorless hand emerged, stained with blood, slowly bending.  Then he slowly stood up, and his handsome, almost demonic face, with black pupils surrounded by a ring of blood-red haze, suddenly began to smile lightly.  His laugh was hoarse and strange.  "Bai Weiwei, I'm going to eat you." Chapter 203: The Zombie King's Girlfriend, the Heartthrob of Thousands (4)  When the car started to become chaotic, Bai Weiwei was already prepared in her heart. There were too many people, and the car was moving too slowly; even Lin Xiao, who was a second-generation elite, couldn't do much here when people were facing a massive disaster. In such times, being a 'second-generation' was of no use.  Especially when a zombie suddenly jumped onto the roof of the car, and several people standing at the back door were pulled down by zombies, many people inside the car completely broke down. They cursed and cried, and began pushing each other, with several people falling off the car.  Moreover, someone noticed that the zombies seemed to be increasing in number. Although there were other places with people around, the zombies, seemingly attracted by something, were rapidly chasing after the car and not letting go. In the end, a terrifying tide of zombies formed, surging after them.  This grand and terrifying scene was enough to scare the faint-hearted to death.  Bai Weiwei asked the system, "Is there something to drive away the zombies?"  The system immediately nodded excitedly, "Yes, yes, there is! Vigorous Zombie-Killing Agent, your best companion in the apocalypse, lets you easily drive away zombies. Your reliable choice is the Vigorous Zombie-Killing Agent."  Bai Weiwei said, "Give me a bottle."  Now, there was no time to consider anything else; if she was bitten by zombies, all her strategies would be gone.  The system said, "This thing is expensive; you can't afford it on credit."  Bai Weiwei looked desperate, "I've done so many tasks, why can't I save up any life points? Tell me, have you been stealing my life points? Is it you making me penniless?"  The system became serious, "How could you be penniless?"  Bai Weiwei: What else did she have? Why couldn't she see it?  The system's tone became cheerful and cute, "You still have me."  Bai Weiwei: "Can you drive away the zombies?"  The system blew her a kiss, "How could I do that, but I will cheer for you, cheer cheer cheer, love."  Bai Weiwei felt like she was about to spit out a mouthful of old blood. Was this broken system deliberately irritating her? With this kind of system, it would be better not to have one at all.  And had the system been poisoned with love? Why was its way of speaking so... brain-dead?  Suddenly, Lin Xiao grabbed Bai Weiwei's hand with a solemn expression, "Weiwei, don't be afraid, I won't let anything happen to you."  Bai Weiwei had no idea what kind of strange illusion her heartthrob aura had given Lin Xiao.  Suddenly, Lin Xiao's voice became shy, "Weiwei, after we're safe, let's get married, okay?"  Bai Weiwei: "......"  Lin Xiao blushed a little, "I've even thought of our children's names. It would be best to have two: a boy like me and a girl like you... hehe, and then the two of us can still be together when we're old, watching the sunset, the beautiful people together."  Bai Weiwei felt a pain in her chest; she would get heart disease from the aggravation.  Suddenly, a loud noise came from the roof of the car, as if something had jumped on top of it. The car shook violently and started to skid. Bai Weiwei felt the car lose balance and her body pitched forward.  Lin Xiao grabbed her, and the two of them almost rolled into a ball. The car seemed to hit something, shuddering violently, and many people inside were thrown out.  The zombies swarmed up, beginning to tear and bite at humans. The scene was cruel and horrifying, the heavy scent of blood permeating the air.  The car also started to slow down, and suddenly it emitted a struggling sound and then stopped altogether.  Everyone screamed; the stoppage of the car meant they were all going to die.  Lin Xiao reacted quickly and terrifyingly. He grabbed Bai Weiwei's hand, kicked a few people away, squeezed out of the car, jumped down, and then ran for his life. Chapter 204: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (5)  People who failed to get off the bus in time were swarmed by the pursuing zombies. Bai Weiwei didn't look back, but she could hear the roaring of the zombies behind her. And also, the screams of people. It was truly a hell on Earth.  Lin Xiao hurriedly ran forward; ahead was the edge of the city with a stretch of abandoned commercial buildings. He said, "If we rush through here, we can get out of the city. My uncle is waiting outside the city."  But Bai Weiwei suddenly shook off Lin Xiao's hand and said calmly, "You go ahead, I can't keep up with you." She was telling the truth; she really couldn't keep pace with him. Lin Xiao looked like he had training, and being a big man, his physical strength was much greater than hers.  Running to this extent with him was already her limit. Now her feet felt unbearably heavy, and her heartbeat was so fast that it pained her chest. She was very clear about the limits of a person's strength, and she had reached hers.  Regardless of whether it was due to her irresistible charm, Lin Xiao's character was still acceptable—it was a matter of each to their own escape.  Lin Xiao turned back, his face filled with emotion, "You are truly kind. Not only do you have the most captivating eyes in the world, but also the most beautiful soul."  Bai Weiwei couldn't stand it anymore, and as Lin Xiao was still speaking, "How can you be so cute, so beautiful, so..."  Slap!  Bai Weiwei swung her hand and delivered a slap. This left Lin Xiao speechless.  Bai Weiwei sighed, feeling that the world had finally quieted down.  After dodging several attacks from zombies, Lin Xiao also realized that he couldn't escape the city while dragging along the burden that was Bai Weiwei. Even if she was the most wonderful burden in the world.  But his own life was still the most important.  Lin Xiao bid farewell with tears, "Weiwei, wait for me to come back and find you, goodbye."  After saying that, he ran away frantically.  Bai Weiwei: Never see you again.  System: "Hurry, hurry, I see a hiding place ahead."  Bai Weiwei, following the system's instruction, desperately dashed forward. Several zombies lunged at her, their stinking and rotting smell nearly made her retch with nausea.  It might have been her imagination, but it seemed like the zombies were toying with her. Whenever she thought she would be caught, the zombies would slow down their pace.  Bai Weiwei spotted the warehouse the system had mentioned, she rushed into the warehouse, slammed the door shut, and pushed anything heavy in front of it to barricade it.  The pursuing zombies roared outside the door, banging against it and howling.  Bai Weiwei was so frightened that her hairs stood on end; if she got bitten by these creatures, she would have to commit suicide immediately. Becoming a zombie was too ugly.  She refused.  However, the warehouse door was exceptionally sturdy, and the zombies could not get in for the time being.  Bai Weiwei sat on the floor, drained of strength, complaining to the system, "I think that one of the zombies outside might be Song Yunhuan."  Song Yunhuan had fallen into the horde of zombies; it was impossible for him to still be alive. If he was still alive, he must have turned into a zombie.  System: "Perhaps."  Bai Weiwei grew despondent, "The target of my conquest can't be someone with rotting flesh, bulging eyes, pus flowing from all seven orifices, and sparse hair, right?" That's what all the zombies outside looked like.  System: "No matter what, he is still the male lead. Even if he's a bit ugly, can't you just bear with it?"  Bai Weiwei: "I just thought of a problem."  System: "What problem?"  Bai Weiwei: "The affection level is only at negative forty."  System: "Negative forty is already terrifyingly high, and yet the host is so amazing and still complains that it's not low enough?" Chapter 205: The Zombie King's Adored Girlfriend (6)  Bai Weiwei: "In the last world, I started with a negative fifty points, and in this world, I personally pushed Song Yunhuan into a pile of zombies, yet I only got negative forty points. It seems that to men, the real grudge is when you cut off their jj."  System: Is the hostess focusing on the wrong thing?  Bai Weiwei chatting with the system was also just a way to distract herself.  After all, there were zombies everywhere outside, and anyone would be scared.  Bai Weiwei looked at the door, "Fortunately, this door is sturdy, or else I would have been eaten long ago."  She had just finished speaking when suddenly the door shook, and the screws fixing the door burst open one by one.  Bai Weiwei and the System: "..."  Boom, the door was kicked open by something and shattered into pieces, falling to the ground with a crash.  Bai Weiwei sat on the ground, watching the sunlight spill in from outside the door.  A tall figure appeared at the door, backlit, with black hair emitting a strange halo, and his exceedingly handsome face wore a twisted, eerie smile.  "I found you, Bai Weiwei."  His voice, with a bit of huskiness, was strangely sexy.  Bai Weiwei was stunned, her mind racing through countless thoughts, calculating her appropriate reaction in a second.  Then she resumed a scared expression, her voice trembling, "Song Yunhuan?"  Song Yunhuan's eyes were dark and gloomy, the red in his eyes even more pronounced as he smiled, "Yeah, didn't expect I could come back, did you?"  Tears suddenly rolled down from Bai Weiwei's eyes, and after a few sobs, she suddenly got up from the ground and rushed to him, then stretched out her arms and hugged him tightly.  She began to sob loudly, "Song Yunhuan, you're not dead, that's really great, it's so good that you're not dead."  Her crying was full of relief, guilt, and a sense of release.  Song Yunhuan's body was stiff and cold, just like a corpse.  He looked at Bai Weiwei with a dead air, his smile deepening, "I thought you would be glad if I died."  Bai Weiwei punched his chest lightly, "I really wished you would die; how could you treat me so badly? I've never liked someone so much; how could you do that to me?"  Her tone had a coquettish feel to it.  Song Yunhuan seemed a bit baffled by her attitude, "You like me?"  Bai Weiwei looked up, her eyes filled with tears, "What do you mean? I've always liked you. It was not easy to muster up the courage to be your girlfriend, and then you scorned me, and also posted things online to slander and insult me. From love, hate was born, do you understand? I really wished you were dead."  The red in Song Yunhuan's eyes intensified, his smile at the corner of his mouth becoming more eerie, "Love?"  Bai Weiwei bit her lip, a face full of willful innocence, "Of course. Do you think I would willingly like you? Do you know how embarrassing it is to like you? Your family is poor, and you're introverted; all my friends say you're not likable at all, and I've always been determined to marry into a wealthy family. How could I like a poor boy like you?"  System: Such brazen shamelessness.  Bai Weiwei pouted, her tears about to fall, "But I... the moment I see you, I like you. I kept telling myself that you have no prospects and can't provide the life I want. But I still like you, and yet I couldn't lower my face to chase after you. Luckily, my roommate made a bet with me, and I found a way out and went to confess to you."  Song Yunhuan fell silent.  Bai Weiwei became shy again, "And you actually agreed to be my friend."  Song Yunhuan in contemplation.  Bai Weiwei turned sad again, "But you didn't like me, and I accidentally... thankfully, you didn't die."  Suddenly, Song Yunhuan laughed, "Do you really like me that much?"  Bai Weiwei became embarrassed, "It's so shameless for a girl to always confess to you."  Song Yunhuan reached out, lifted her up, his smile even brighter, "Then I'll confess too. I especially like... the way you look when you're eaten by zombies."  After saying that, he threw Bai Weiwei out the door.  Outside the door were all zombies. Chapter 206: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (7) Bai Weiwei: "Irresistible charm is useless?" She thought that her performance combined with her irresistible charm would soften Song Yunhuan's heart a bit. Only then did the system have the chance to remind her: "The irresistible charm only works on people with a favorability level above zero." Song Yunhuan's favorability was negative forty; she wouldn't say just negative forty anymore. Negative forty was deadly. Bai Weiwei fell to the ground, her hand scraping across the floor to slow her momentum, the skin breaking and bleeding immediately. The zombies outside, as if smelling fresh meat, excitedly howled and surrounded her. Bai Weiwei's pupils shrank, "Trash system, does the irresistible charm work on these things?" System: "Irresistible charm is not zombie charm; this kind of charm is useless on anything without consciousness." Zombies that have not evolved do not have consciousness. The apocalypse has just begun, and the only evolved zombie is Song Yunhuan. Bai Weiwei: "So this side quest reward, apart from confusing some passerby A, is actually completely useless?" The system encouraged: "Once you have raised the favorability to above zero, the charm will be useful." Bai Weiwei roared: "Who can wait until then, I'm about to be eaten." Right after she finished speaking to the system, several zombies already pounced. Bai Weiwei rolled on the ground in fright, narrowly avoiding the zombie attack. She looked at Song Yunhuan, her eyes filled with helpless despair. Song Yunhuan was still smiling, standing in the sunlight, his eyes eerily ghastly. It seemed as if the zombies received some command, their attacks on Bai Weiwei became more aggressive. Their mouths open, revealing their foul-smelling teeth, they ran quickly, about to catch Bai Weiwei. Bai Weiwei had nowhere to hide, as the entire warehouse was surrounded by zombies. Inside the warehouse, no zombies dared to approach except for Song Yunhuan. Bai Weiwei didn't care about anything else; she would rather be torn to pieces by Song Yunhuan than be eaten by these zombies. Bai Weiwei thought wryly, at least Song Yunhuan is handsome. Just as she ran into the warehouse, her foot was pulled by something, and she fell hard to the ground. A zombie's hand tightly grasped her calf, dragging her towards the outside of the warehouse. Bai Weiwei's fingers clutched the ground so hard they bled. She felt the zombie's sharp nails pierce into her leg flesh, blood starting to gush out. Bai Weiwei trembled all over, suddenly feeling overshadowed by darkness. Looking up, she saw Song Yunhuan approaching her. He slowly squatted down, his handsome face still wearing that eerie smile. Even the smile was mixed with a hint of malicious satisfaction. "Do you know? Bai Weiwei, when you pushed me out of the car, I looked just like you do now, desperate with no way out, only to be eaten alive by zombies." Bai Weiwei looked at him, her eyes reddening as she said with a trembling voice, "I'm sorry, Song Yunhuan." Song Yunhuan twisted his smile, "Sorry for what? Aren't women like you supposed to be the most selfish and self-serving, why apologize to me?" Bai Weiwei was dragged step by step by the zombie, desperately clawing at the ground with her fingers, but her eyes were fixed on Song Yunhuan. "I'm sorry, Song Yunhuan. I know I'm not a kind person. I'm selfish and vain, petty, and pleasure-seeking, but I really didn't do it on purpose. I didn't want you to die, I just wanted to scare you. I never thought that I would end up unable to hold onto your hand." As Bai Weiwei spoke, she broke into tears, using all her remaining strength to suddenly reach out and grab his hand. The corner of his sleeve tore off. Chapter 207: The Zombie King's Charmingly Popular Girlfriend (8)  It was when Bai Weiwei was trying to pull him up that it tore open. Bai Weiwei exerted all her strength, clutched his hand, and said, "I'm sorry," her face filled with guilt.  Song Yunhuan did not struggle, letting her hold his hand firmly without letting go. Bai Weiwei was almost out of strength; the power of the zombies was so strong that it was beyond human resistance, and her being able to hold on to this extent was already the limit.  Suddenly, Song Yunhuan's fingers tightened, clenching hers in return. A glimmer of light appeared in Bai Weiwei's eyes, like hope, like joy.  Song Yunhuan's voice was faint, even gentle enough to say, "I believe you didn't mean it, but..."  His thin lips curved up, the darkness in his eyes chilling, "But, what does that matter?"  Having said that, he released his grip one finger at a time, allowing the light in Bai Weiwei's eyes to fade. Due to his loosening grip, Bai Weiwei was dragged out by the zombies.  The fingers of that zombie had already burrowed into the flesh of her calf, the pain so intense that Bai Weiwei felt her scalp explode. She was quickly pulled out of the warehouse, the sunlight recklessly spilling onto her, as zombies pounced one after another onto her.  Bai Weiwei felt her legs, hands, and back being scratched and bitten through by the zombies.  System: "Ding, the host faces a serious danger, life protection is compulsorily activated."  Life protection is compulsorily initiated.  The pain on Bai Weiwei's body disappeared instantly, but the ebbing of life did not slow down because of this. She looked up, her eyes filled with desperate struggle, and self-blame, but no hatred.  Before being overwhelmed by zombies, Song Yunhuan saw her mouth a silent sentence. "Song Yunhuan, I'm sorry."  It was as if she really just wanted to scare him but ended up accidentally letting go of him.  Suddenly, Song Yunhuan stepped out of the warehouse. The zombies became terrified, running away in all directions, each one avoiding Song Yunhuan.  When Song Yunhuan came to, he found himself rotting all over, but for some reason, his flesh was constantly regenerating. In the end, he did not become a zombie, an ugly creature.  Instead, he looked no different from before. The only difference was that he had endless energy, immense strength, and a corpse-like body. Even his heartbeat was gone.  He hated Bai Weiwei for turning him into this. This hatred made him want Bai Weiwei to experience everything he had gone through.  Although Bai Weiwei was not in pain, she could still feel where she was injured. There was not a single part of her body that was intact.  Bai Weiwei's consciousness began to blur, and just when she thought she was certain to die, the zombies suddenly dispersed.  Her face was pale, her body covered in zombie bite marks, a ghastly sight to behold.  When Song Yunhuan approached her, she suddenly looked up at him. Her face, unscathed by any attack, delicate with a touch of coyness, now looked at him with a blurred vision, inexplicably exuding a pitiful softness.  Song Yunhuan gently asked, "Does it hurt?"  Bai Weiwei just looked at him, seemingly in so much pain that she was not lucid.  She suddenly reached out her hand, her fingers covered in blood from scratching the ground.  "Song Yunhuan..." Bai Weiwei struggled to get closer to him.  Song Yunhuan kindly stood and bent over, responding with an indifferent "Hmm" as if he was dealing with a pitiful prey that he did not take seriously.  Bai Weiwei struggled to sit up, which was already the limit of her body; she could not stand up, and her hand just managed to touch his face. Chapter 208: The Zombie King’s Irresistible Girlfriend (9)  Dirt and blood were smeared across his face from her fingers. Song Yunhuan remained indifferent, as if waiting for her hateful curses. However, Bai Weiwei let out a sigh of relief and began to laugh softly, "Song Yunhuan, I'm about to die, aren't I?"  Song Yunhuan calmly responded, "Yes."  Finally at peace, Bai Weiwei asked, "Before I die, can I say something to you?"  Song Yunhuan did not react, simply watching her indifferently.  Suddenly, Bai Weiwei grabbed his clothes with her other hand, pulling his head down with the last of her strength.  Song Yunhuan's body stiffened, the red in his eyes deepening.  The kiss was brief, and as they parted, Bai Weiwei smiled, "I've lied to you many times. Pretending to be pure, naive, pitiful. But the one thing I didn't lie about is that I like you."  She smiled as she spoke, yet tears were in her eyes.  "I didn't hold onto your hand earlier, causing you to fall off the vehicle, I'm sorry." Her voice grew weaker.  "I didn't do it on purpose..."  Her fingers lost their strength, slowly releasing his clothes.  "Song Yunhuan, I like you…"  She fell back to the ground, her eyes beginning to lose their light as death overtook her.  Finally, darkness came, and she completely lost consciousness.  Song Yunhuan stood in a daze for a while before finally, belatedly, touching his lips.  It was his first kiss, his lips still stained with her blood.  He stuck out his tongue, tasting it; the blood had a sweet flavor. To him, a zombie, humans truly were a gourmet delicacy.  Song Yunhuan, I like you...  Like me?  [Ding, male lead's favorability decreased by thirty-five.]  ---  Bai Weiwei felt that this time she was undoubtedly going to die.  She had been caught and bitten by zombies; the virus would surely corrode her body.  Her life support could only last one day, and after that, she would experience unbearable pain.  Heat, cold, severe pain, all sorts of discomfort assaulted her.  In a daze, she communicated with the system, "Trashy system, how can I pursue Song Yunhuan if I become a zombie? I'll be bald, with crooked teeth, my face covered in rotting flesh, intestines hanging out and swinging about, he definitely won't increase his favorability."  The system comforted her kindly, "It's alright, we'll just wash off the rotting flesh, stuff the intestines back into the stomach, sew it up with needle and thread, and put on a wig to look good again."  Touched, Bai Weiwei asked in confusion, "Trashy system, do I really look good?"  System: "Of course you look good, even if you become a zombie, you're still the best-looking one."  Bai Weiwei felt she had the strength to fight again. She struggled for who knows how long and finally opened her eyes.  What she saw made her a bit puzzled.  It was a room in an old house.  Somewhat dilapidated, but very clean and homely.  It looked like it had been lived in for many years.  She was lying on a bed with light green curtains fluttering in the wind.  Bai Weiwei sat up and found that she hadn't turned into a zombie; the wounds had turned into white scars.  Her heartbeat and body were also normal, all human characteristics.  To be bitten like that and not turn into a zombie...  Bai Weiwei breathed a sigh of relief. She got out of bed and walked barefoot out of the room.  Then she saw Song Yunhuan sitting on the sofa in the living room, reading a book intently.  Seeing her come out, Song Yunhuan asked gently, "Awake?"  Bai Weiwei was a bit puzzled, "I'm not dead?"  Song Yunhuan shook his head, "You have a very special physique, immune to the zombie virus."  Bai Weiwei was stunned at first, but then she smiled sweetly, "Is that so? I'm so lucky."  Seeing her smile so happily, Song Yunhuan also smiled, "You said you liked me, is that true?"  Bai Weiwei hadn't expected him to ask this, and she shyly lowered her head. After a moment of silence, she finally mustered the courage to look up.  Her eyes were bright, full of smiles, "Yes, I like you."  Song Yunhuan's fingers on the book tensed for some reason.  He suppressed those restless impulses, walked over to her, and gently stroked her face.  Then he said with a gentle smile, "If you really like me that much, would you die for me?"   Bai Weiwei: "......" 
Chapter 368: Out of Danger  The situation was completely one-sided, with both sides firing with all their might, and the entire sky above the ocean was filled with gunpowder smoke. Bai Ye once again fired his high-speed magnetic wave scanning gun, and another airplane was blown to pieces. This gun was really useful, and he was getting addicted to it. Xiao Nai Bao commanded with ease, and the air force of the First Terrorist Organization formed an indestructible attack and defense team, initiating the final fierce assault.  Upon seeing the unfavorable situation, Nickla could not care about rank and raised his voice, "Master, we should retreat. If we continue to fight like this, our entire army will be wiped out."  Luis clenched his fists tightly, his face gloomy and his body full of murderous aura. He could clearly see the current situation, but he was unwilling to retreat just like that, especially when victory was within reach, and they could have captured them. It was infuriating to think that their efforts would be wasted so close to success.  The man's emerald green eyes flashed with a murderous intent, which then retreated back into his silent and melancholic gaze. He nodded at Nickla, who immediately ordered a cover retreat.  Luis gazed at the two figures drifting above the sea and scoffed coldly. This time they were just lucky; he would not let them go so easily.  "Baby, they are retreating. Should we pursue?" Bai Ye chuckled lightly. He was very fond of the magnetic wave scanning gun, holding it as if he were holding a child, with his lips curling into an indifferent and dangerous smile.  Xiao Nai Bao also smiled elegantly, ordering to stop the attack, with a calm tranquility in his dark, large eyes, he slowly said, "No pursuit. It would be too much of a pity to let him die just like that. The game of cat and mouse has only just begun."  This game had already turned the tide.  Luis, he should not have provoked him. Nuonuo's death, someone must accompany her in death; otherwise, he could not swallow this grievance. When the game would start, Luis could decide, but...  With a cold smile on Xiao Nai Bao's face, compelling and forceful, he decided when it would end.  Bai Ye smiled, casually brushing his sleeve, "Fine, no pursuit. We have the capital to play with him. It might not even be our turn to take action before someone is eager to deal with Luis."  Xiao Nai Bao looked in the direction of their escape and sneered without saying a word.  "Chu Li, it's over, no need for support. Let's head back immediately," Bai Ye said after finishing the phone call with Chu Li and ordered his subordinates to turn back to Rome.  It took a tremendous effort for Black Hawk and others to pull Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya out of the water. They knew that Cheng Anya had a virus and had taken protective measures in advance. Ye Sanshao also warned them that he was carrying a virus, so Black Hawk and the others were even more cautious.  Ye Sanshao lay there, gasping for air, and couldn't help but kick Miss Cheng, "Xiao Anya, you need to lose some weight, you're so heavy."  His entire shoulder was a bit numb because he had been swimming in the sea for a long time, which had consumed a lot of his energy, and then having to drag Cheng Anya along was indeed quite a strain on his arm.  He had almost failed to hold onto her and dropped her into the sea. The thought of that moment still made him shudder.  Black Hawk and the others cheered for their safety, passing towels and pouring hot water, everyone was busy, and some even took the opportunity to joke about how Ye Sanshao had been doing these days.  The airplane was lively, with men gathered together, there was an air of boldness.  Cheng Anya took a towel from Black Hawk to dry her hair, and wrapped herself with a blanket to warm up her chilled body. She automatically blocked out his words and finally felt safe. She sneezed and couldn't help but wrap herself a little tighter.  Black Hawk chuckled and said, "Third Master, if the lady loses any more weight, you'll complain about her being all bones."  "I'm complaining now," Ye Sanshao got up, drying off the seawater on his body. "It's because she's all bones that she's so heavy."  Cheng Anya continued to uphold the virtue that silence is golden. Black Hawk found two sets of clothes for them to change into. Since they were men's clothes, they looked comical on Miss Cheng, so she simply wrapped herself in a blanket.  Just after changing clothes, Black Hawk informed her that Ningning wanted to speak with her. Cheng Anya excitedly snatched the microphone, "Baby, it's Mommy."  "Hi, Mommy, did you miss your baby?" Xiao Nai Bao sat on the sofa, smiling and chatting with Cheng Anya, having missed her voice for a long time.  "Not at all." Cheng Anya snorted coldly, showing a fierce tone, "You're too clumsy, taking so long to find Mommy, you deserve a spanking."  Ningning thought of his promise, his heart tightened, but then he smiled, "Okay, baby accepts the spanking. Once we get back to Rome, you can spank however you want. I really missed Mommy, you don't love me enough, I despise you."  "Despise you back." Cheng Anya laughed loudly, worriedly asking, "You didn't get hurt, did you?"  "No, I'm fine, not a scratch, don't worry," Ningning said with a smile, "Mommy, the plane is about to land, we'll talk later."  "Okay." Xiao Nai Bao turned off the communicator, Cheng Anya sipped hot water to warm up, and Ye Sanshao, who had been eagerly hoping to chat with his son, was hung up on before he could, leaving him very dissatisfied, looking at Cheng Anya with accusing eyes.  Miss Cheng calmly ignored him, and Black Hawk said with a smile, "Third Master, the plane is about to land, you'll be able to see the young master soon."  Ye Sanshao felt completely ignored and couldn't help but pinch Miss Cheng, "Heartless little thing."  "Stingy ghost." Cheng Anya laughed and scolded, handing him the hot water. Ye Sanshao took it, drinking the remaining hot water in Miss Cheng's cup, thinking how wonderful it would be to have some alcohol to warm up at this moment.  The plane landed soon after, all descending into the castle. Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, and others were all there. Seeing Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya safe, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.  "Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, you really look ragged..." Ye Wei laughed, her body trembling, "Third Brother, I should have taken a picture as a memento."  "Stinky girl." Ye Sanshao scolded with a laugh. With Weiwei, Eleven, and Xiao Nai Bao all safe, he finally felt at ease.  After all this trouble, how could anything go wrong? Xiao Nai Bao cheerfully wanted to hug Cheng Anya but was sternly stopped by her. Xiao Nai Bao then remembered that his mommy had a virus, as Black Hawk had already mentioned, and then he looked at the hands his daddy and mommy were holding, feeling a slight heaviness in his heart.  "Daddy, Mommy, you both..." Bai Ye, you have to check on them quickly."  Xiao Nai Bao's first reaction was to find Bai Ye, who was a genius doctor and there was no disease he couldn't cure.  "I got it, I got it, don't worry," Bai Ye said with a smile.  "Virus?" A handsome man with golden hair and blue eyes blinked, "Xiao Bai, this isn't your strong suit, right?"  Xiao Bai? Bai Ye twisted his wrist, smiling suavely and gently, "Jason, try calling me Xiao Bai one more time?"  "... Damn, what's wrong with calling you Xiao Bai? You're Xiao Bai, and they even call Black Jack Xiao Tie."  Jason, known as the fire dragon, burst into flames on the spot, looking like a golden lion king, but still infuriatingly handsome. Especially those sapphire blue eyes, so dazzling. When he got angry, there was a kind of intimidating aura, like a volcanic eruption, with a very outwardly dominant presence.  Beside him, Black Jack, a man in his twenties, had a very delicate appearance, a mix of Chinese and English blood, with mysterious features of an Easterner and the depth of a Westerner, and a pair of gray-blue eyes that always seemed misty, giving the illusion of deep affection, but upon closer inspection, one would find that he was extremely sharp, with a kind of hidden depth.  The two leaders of the First Terrorist Organization, both young, with contrasting personalities, but both with a strong presence, each had an aura of reigning supreme, let alone having all three of the major leaders here.  This lineup was visually impactful.  "Jason, you really need a lesson," Eleven snorted, "Why call him Xiao Bai? Xiao Bai, beat him up."  Everyone, "......"  Ye Wei shook her head with a glance, "Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, don't bother with them, you guys should take a hot bath, and then get checked later, to avoid getting sick."  She summoned the maids to take Ye Chen and Cheng Anya to wash up. Xiao Nai Bao wanted to follow, but he stayed here, as Bai Ye looked like he was about to beat someone up, so Xiao Nai Bao quickly grabbed his sleeve.  "Bai Ye, can you save my daddy and mommy?" Xiao Nai Bao's eyes were bright, like two black grapes embedded in his tender face, full of hope, as if the light in his eyes would dim if Bai Ye shook his head.  Jason grabbed Xiao Nai Bao and hugged him, full of pride, "Baby, don't worry, Xiao Bai can even save the dead, let alone the living. Stop worrying about nothing, come help me bombard the mafia's defenses when you're free."  "Who was questioning Bai Ye's medical skills just now?" Black Jack expressed doubt, and with a palm strike, Jason swiftly dodged.  Xiao Nai Bao struggled a bit, and Jason put him down. Xiao Nai Bao asked, "Bai Ye..."  "Ningning, wait until I've examined them before I can be sure, don't be anxious," Bai Ye said, ruffling Xiao Nai Bao's head, "I promise to do my best."  Xiao Nai Bao had just lost NuoNuo, and with his parents' lives hanging by a thread, it was natural for him to feel uneasy, no matter how calm he was. He couldn't lose them again, and Bai Ye understood his psychology well.  "Don't worry too much," Bai Ye said.  Ye Wei said, "That settles it, leave it to Bai Ye, there is no unsolvable problem in this world. Since Luis could develop a virus, there must be an antidote, it's not possible to have no solution, if Bai Ye can't solve it, we'll take down his signboard."  Chu Li smiled, "Agreed."  "Xiao Bai, do you have a signboard?" Jason was puzzled; he never knew he had one. Eleven was very tempted to punch him.  "Speaking of which, why didn't you two catch Luis and bring him back?" Black Jack asked, "If that guy died earlier, we would have been at ease."  "I've wanted to annihilate him long ago. Recently, the mafia has been provoking us everywhere. Even after his headquarters were bombed, he still has the mood to engage in romantic affairs, truly incompetent."  "Luis is not in a hurry," Xiao Nai Bao said slowly, his face forming a dangerous arc, and his black eyes full of calculating light, "Winning without a battle is the highest realm of victory. It's one thing that he has a personal vendetta with us, but the struggle between the mafia and the terrorist organization is another matter. If we want to exterminate the mafia, it will definitely cost a lot of financial and material resources. After this incident, his position within the mafia is precarious. I've always suspected that there is another force hidden in places we can't see in the mafia. Otherwise, they would not allow Luis to engage in such self-destructive actions. Since that's the case, we'll let Luis lead the way for us, draw out this force, and annihilate them in one fell swoop."  Cunning... That was everyone's unanimous thought. Although they knew he was always scheming and sinister, because of his young age, everyone couldn't help but dote on him. Plus, with such a cute appearance, it was easy to overlook his true nature.  "Treacherous!" Jason gave a thumbs up. He had always been about action, not thinking too much like the others. However, he usually listened to Black Jack and Chu Li's plans. Xiao Nai Bao's plans, he always followed without question.  An action-oriented leader with a strong think-tank was a terrifying force.  "Ningning's method, I agree," Chu Li said, as he and Bai Ye always agreed with his ideas, "Once and for all, so that no one dares to challenge us again."  "Ningning's words, when have you ever refuted them? You're in cahoots," Black Jack laughed, "But this time, we really should teach the mafia a lesson, let them avoid us for fifty years."  Bai Ye nodded; he had no objections. His priority was to find a cure for the virus on Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya. That was the most important thing, leaving the rest to Chu Li.  Ye Wei and Eleven exchanged glances. Another force? In their minds, they both thought of the same face. Was it Mo Ye and Mo Yu? In the mafia, only they would have enough charisma and be mysterious enough. Besides them, they couldn't think of anyone else who could have such courage, a man who should have been superior to Luis, it made no sense for them to obey him.  The group moved to the living room, Xiao Nai Bao went to find Cheng Anya, she had just finished her bath and had drunk a cup of hot tea. Her body was warm, her cheeks flushed with a hint of pink, and she was lying on the bed, lost in thought as she looked at her fingers.  "Mommy..." Xiao Nai Bao pushed the door and entered, walking over with a smile.  Cheng Anya came back to her senses and squinted, praising, "Baby, you really have style."  This outfit really had a presence. There wasn't a hint of a child about him; he was a dangerous person through and through.  "Thanks for the compliment, Mommy."  "Don't come closer, sit farther away, I'm afraid I won't be able to resist hitting you," Cheng Anya pointed to the sofa opposite, "Sit there."  Xiao Nai Bao gave Cheng Anya a grievous look, "Mommy, you're rejecting me."  "Correct," Cheng Anya said with a smile, glancing at Xiao Nai Bao. She always felt that there was something different about the child. Although he seemed no different from before, a mother knows her child best. Any changes in him, no matter how well hidden, she could usually sense.  "Mommy, are you looking at me like that because you think your baby is handsome?" Xiao Nai Bao playfully blinked, looking extremely adorable.  Cheng Anya looked at him with a half-smile, "You've learned eight or nine points of your daddy's vanity. How have you been recently? Tell Mommy the truth. Were you bullied?"  Xiao Nai Bao shook his head, "No."  "Nonsense, Luis showed me photos, you were clearly covered in blood," Cheng Anya was clearly unconvinced, grinding her teeth, "He deserves to be hacked to pieces, I can't let it go."  Thinking of her own experiences, Cheng Anya felt extreme hatred towards Luis. Her bright face was covered with a layer of coldness, and remembering what Xiao Nai Bao had suffered, she had a bad premonition.  "Mommy, I'm really okay. Most of it must have been fabricated," Xiao Nai Bao said elegantly, rolling up his sleeve to reveal a fair arm, "Look, not a single scar."  The bullet wound on his arm was mostly healed, and he wasn't afraid of Cheng Anya finding out. The whip marks he had received were left by NuoNuo. Since they were inflicted by NuoNuo, he didn't feel bullied; instead, he was somewhat nostalgic for the pain of being beaten by her.  If NuoNuo could live, he would be willing to be beaten by her for the rest of his life.  "Ningning, are you really okay?" Cheng Anya's brows furrowed, not missing the fleeting pain in her son's eyes.  Xiao Nai Bao nodded, "I'm really fine, Mommy. The ones in trouble are you and daddy. Uncle Black Hawk said you have a virus. How did daddy get it too?"  "..." Cheng Anya thought of Ye Sanshao, who was driven by lust, her cheeks reddened again, and she lost the desire to speak, "Don't mention it. I jumped out of a plane in the desert and then again over the sea. How could we not have come into contact?"  Miss Cheng spoke very calmly, and Xiao Nai Bao didn't doubt her.  "Mommy, it'll be fine. Bai Ye is so skilled in medicine, he will surely have a way to save you both." Chapter 369: Self-Help for Adequate Food and Clothing  After Bai Ye conducted a detailed examination for them and drew blood from the two for a more comprehensive analysis, his face showed a rare seriousness, and Xiao Nai Bao had a bad premonition. When Cheng An Ya was hit and infected by bacteria, the doctors concluded that amputation was necessary to save her life. However, Bai Ye didn't even take a look and left a sarcastic remark before elegantly entering the laboratory. It seemed like there was no disease that could challenge the genius doctor Bai Ye. Last year, when Chu Li was shot 23 times, Bai Ye remained calm and composed. This was a confidence that transcended others; in this field, he was a legendary figure who shouldn't be stumped by any disease.  But this time, just as Jason had predicted, the virus was not Bai Ye's strong suit. Once he showed a serious expression, it meant that things were bad. Jason even patted Bai Ye's shoulder sympathetically.  "You finally encountered a difficult case, how rare. It's like Xiao Nai Bao being a legend in the field of computer technology, only to be surpassed by the brothers Mo Ye and Mo Yue." Bai Ye summoned over a dozen virus experts from Rome to the castle to study together, casting a serious atmosphere over the entire castle.  The patient herself was quite calm. Cheng An Ya had come to terms with her fate, feeling that even death was no big deal. In her life, she had loved passionately, with her beloved Ye Chen, the doting Ning Ning, a happy family, and a fairly successful career. She had experienced almost everything a woman could in her life.  Now, she was content with living such a tumultuous life of ups and downs. Her only regret was that she might not see Ning Ning again. But now that this wish had been fulfilled, she was indifferent to life and death. Ye San Shao cared even less; neither were people who feared death, and they were much calmer than expected.  Chu Li called it a spirit.  At the moment, everyone was in the conference hall discussing the virus and the fact that Ye San Shao only had five days left to live. Suddenly, Cheng An Ya remembered something, "Rong Yan gave us an agent that delayed the onset of the virus, it should be able to postpone it for a few days."  In the joy of their reunion, she had almost forgotten about Rong Yan and Chu Li. Although Rong Yan hadn't explicitly asked them to bring a message to Chu Li, how could they not? It was an unspoken understanding. Even if Rong Yan didn't mention it, Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao would still inform Chu Li.  Chu Li's eyes widened sharply, his gaze fixed on Cheng An Ya with a calm but urgent sharpness that startled her. Jason and Black Jack, who were joking around, also suddenly fell silent.  "You have news of Rong Yan."  Chu Li asked calmly, his voice ordinary but overly restrained. His body was tense, and it was obvious to everyone that he was stiff.  Xiao Nai Bao was also surprised. Ye San Shao recounted the events, and Chu Li stood up abruptly, saying, "Thanks!" He left only these two words before rushing out, with Jason and Black Jack quickly following.  Ye Wei laughed, "Dark Chu is thrilled this time. Look at how anxious he is; it's a rare sight in a hundred years."  The number one terror organization was about to launch a large-scale military operation. If the three giants went to battle together, it would be an earth-shattering intensity. Ye Wei mentally offered condolences to Prince William.  Somebody's territory was definitely gone, and maybe even the entire thing would be lost.  Since Rong Yan could come up with it, Bai Ye should also be able to, Xiao Nai Bao pondered. Right now, his entire mind was focused on the virus affecting his dad and mom, thinking when a man came over, "Young master, Brother Chu asked you to go to the study room."  Xiao Nai Bao pursed his lips, "Dad, Mom, I'll come over to accompany you in a while."  Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao exchanged glances, both feeling the sense of having a grown-up son. It seemed that Xiao Nai Bao had made up his mind about the first terror organization. Looking at his momentum, he was very different from the obedient son in front of her.  Well, since their son had chosen his path, then they should support him in seeing it through to the end. Cheng An Ya was supportive.  Ye San Shao was quite pleased. It was something to be proud and proud of that his son had grown up.  Cheng An Ya thoughtfully watched his figure disappear into the corridor, then turned to ask Ye Wei, "Wei Wei, did something happen to Ning Ning?"  A mother knows her child best. She asked because Xiao Nai Bao didn't say anything, but it didn't mean she truly believed nothing was wrong.  Ye Wei admired her sister-in-law's sharpness. She and Eleven exchanged glances, wondering whether to mention the matter with Xu Nuo. Ye San Shao could tell at a glance that something was being kept from them.  "Wei Wei, just tell us."  Ye Wei looked at them and relayed the events with Ning Ning and Xu Nuo, including Xu Nuo's death and Xiao Nai Bao's blindness, without omission.  The more Cheng An Ya listened, the heavier her heart became. No wonder she felt that her son's eyes were different now, no longer as clear and clean as before. Even with his background, he was still just a child with a bit of innocence.  But some experiences and shocks change a person's gaze, making them feel different; it wasn't just her being over-sensitive.  Ye San Shao also frowned slightly, feeling distressed over his son's experiences and blaming himself deeply. If it had been Cheng An Ya who died for him, he probably would have gone mad, not just blind.  This was similar to his past experiences of being withdrawn.  "Is the girl confirmed dead?" Cheng An Ya asked.  Ye Wei nodded, "Our people searched, confirmed dead. Speaking of Nuo Nuo, it just annoys me..."  Ye Wei slammed the table, recounting Xu Nuo's background, "All the bad things have fallen on Nuo Nuo; God really is a bastard."  Ye San Shao paused, "Xu Mingyang, I have some business dealings with him. He seems upright, I can't see how he would be so superstitious. Is there more to it?"  "It's not like that," Eleven said, "I've checked the Miao family's records; they indeed have such a life chart. Although it's fortune-telling, it's very accurate. The Miao family does have such a curse. However, there are many ways to deal with it; they shouldn't have abandoned Xu Nuo. Letting someone else raise her would have been acceptable; these parents were too heartless."  Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao were both silent, which meant that their son's future was worrisome.  Especially Cheng An Ya, she wasn't being overly anxious, but she knew her son best. He seemed unchanged from the past, but that was just appearance. Once the heart becomes desolate, it's like a walking corpse.  "Third Sister-in-law, don't worry too much. Ning Ning is still young; maybe he'll be better as he grows up," Ye Wei said, after all, they were just two children. No matter how deep the affection, it would fade with time.  No matter how profound the love in this world is, it cannot withstand the erosion of time.  Cheng An Ya smiled faintly, humming in response. What Ye Wei said was just to comfort them. Even Ye San Shao knew that forgetting is harder than remembering.  Falling in love with someone takes just a second.  Forgetting someone, however, takes a lifetime.  Ye San Shao inquired about the current situation of the Dragon Gate, and Ye Wei didn't hide anything, telling him everything. The situation wasn't optimistic; the three giants of the Dragon Gate all had troubles, especially Lin Yi Xuan, who was in constant trouble recently.  "Brother, don't worry about this. You should focus on curing the virus in your body. The huge Dragon Gate has many capable people," Ye Wei said with a seductive smile, "Louis won't be able to make a fuss for a while, and it's a good time for everyone to rest and recuperate. You don't know, the chief scolded us bloody yesterday. That sea battle was quite sensational."  The use of new weapons in combat and being the world's largest illegal arms dealer, could it not be sensational?  Eleven sneered coldly, "According to Jason's statistics last night, there are already thirteen countries that have paid a high price for this type of firearm, and they are all heavyweight countries. Each one is issuing joint statements to resist terrorists and eradicate terrorist organizations. But behind the scenes, they are spending money on our weapons."  "That's why I say, the truth, the truth, you're just a passing cloud!" Ye Wei laughed even more seductively.  Cheng An Ya didn't comment, and Ye San Shao just smiled. The arms market was in the hands of Jason, Black Jack, and Chu Li; indeed, they controlled many of the international lifelines.  Powerful enough that no one dared to ignore it.  The next heir was their family's Ning Ning, and the power was estimated to be even greater.  After staying for a while, Ye San Shao went to find Black Hawk to understand the current situation of the Dragon Gate. Ye Wei leaned towards Cheng An Ya, "Third sister-in-law, don't mention what we just talked about to Ning Ning."  "What happened?"  "The kid hasn't mentioned Nuo Nuo since he regained his sight."  "I understand," Cheng An Ya said, "Thank you all. If it weren't for you, Ning Ning's chances would have been slim."  "We have to thank Nuo Nuo. Ning Ning's life was exchanged for hers."  ...  At noon, five fighter jets and three helicopters took off from the castle, all heading towards the direction of Messilia. Chu Li, Jason, and Black Jack had all gone. Actually, Chu Li alone could have handled the matter. There wasn't any problem in the world that required all three terror leaders to act together. Jason was bored, Black Jack was bored, and since the mafia couldn't make a fuss, it was just the right time for them to stretch their muscles.  In the laboratory, it was a busy scene, with a dozen virus experts all in a state of panic. Bai Ye's face was even heavier; for the first time, he was at a loss. He stood in front of the computer with one hand propped up, eyes narrowed, as people bustled around, all researching the virus and various reagents being combined for study.  "Mr. Bai, I think it's better to do this. Since the mafia researched it, they definitely know the antidote," the team leader suggested, "Researching a new virus takes a long time, and Ye San Shao and Miss Cheng may not be able to wait."  Even with the relief agent, it could only delay for about 20 days, and they might not have any leads in twenty days. Moreover, this virus was extremely unstable, being a cellular virus. If it suddenly acted up, the relief agent would be useless, and death would be certain.  "Self-help for adequate food and clothing," Bai Ye said with a calm face, echoing the great saying.  The team leader was speechless.  Louis could ruthlessly fire at Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao, so expecting him to provide an antidote was impossible. He would have anticipated that they would cure Ye San Shao and Miss Cheng and would also anticipate that they wouldn't be able to solve it, definitely seeking him out. By then, he would be elusive, and before they could find him, the people would be gone. It was a risk not worth taking.  He was convinced that Louis would definitely not show up in the near future. Why bother?  Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao had lunch and then slept. They had been busy with examinations and blood samples since their return the night before, and both of them slept restlessly, being very tired. Furthermore, the virus was slowly consuming their bodies, and both of them were exhausted.  Mo Yue was ignored by Ye Wei for a day and was very displeased, pulling on Ye Wei's sleeve and staring at her resentfully. Ye Wei really wanted to kick him into the swimming pool. Xiao Nai Bao was curious about such a Mo Yue.  "Aunt, has he been like this for several days?"  "Five days," Ye Wei said, "Possessed by a ghost."  Xiao Nai Bao was curious about such a Mo Yue, the beautiful man with a stunning appearance and purple eyes, pure as an unpolluted flower, without the previous cunningness and malice.  Having seen the past Mo Yue, now seeing him calling Ye Wei "wife" with such impact...  "Wife, you're talking badly about me."  Mo Yue's purple eyes looked aggrieved, his lips pouting, biting Ye Wei's cheek, causing Xiao Nai Bao to shudder. This tone, he wasn't used to it even when he was three years old and coquettish with his mother... it was so... tender.  Ye Wei was already used to his touchy-feely behavior, patting his head, "Be good, wife admires ghosts the most, who can scare who to death. This is praise for you, understand?"  "Really?" The innocent Mo Yue looked at her with pure eyes.  Ye Wei didn't blush or skip a beat, "Of course, when have I ever lied to you?"  Xiao Nai Bao was silent. This was too... composed.  He had to sigh at Ye Wei's composure and boldness, not something ordinary people could compare to.  "Aunt, can he find Mo Ye?" Xiao Nai Bao didn't care if Mo Yue understood or not, and just asked.  "He said he couldn't find him," Ye Wei said, "Old Big Ice Block seems quite awesome, after all, the second is the second."  Xiao Nai Bao, "..."  Mo Yue showed a look of grievance again, hugging Ye Wei and biting non-stop. Xiao Nai Bao deeply felt it was not suitable for children and got up to go to the laboratory.  "Ning Ning, why are you here?"  "Is there no clue?"  Xiao Nai Bao could tell from Bai Ye's heavy face that things were not good. He was mentally prepared. Just then, someone brought in the data on the 1934 virus. Bai Ye said, "I'll talk to you in a bit."  He focused on reading the data, and Xiao Nai Bao, curious, joined in. The data on su-1934 was very comprehensive, with the harm, number of deaths, government's strong measures, and Bai Ye was most concerned about its designer.  "Su Jin Xiao?"  "Su Jin Xiao?" Bai Ye muttered, unfamiliar with the name. It was the first time he had heard it. The key was that the incident was an accident, and it was claimed to be a nuclear station leak causing the cruel deaths, with very few people knowing it was a virus causing harm.  Xiao Nai Bao had a flash of insight, "The grandfather of Su Man?" Chapter 370: Going to Riyadh  The little bun found out that Grandpa Su Man was the designer of 1934. He immediately contacted Su Man. Ye Wei, who was by his side, was very conflicted, extremely sad and resentful, staring at the little bun with a gaze so mournful as if she were a female ghost about to strangle him right there and then. Shi Yi naturally knew why and smiled very calmly.  Mo Jue pouted his tender lips and looked at his wife, and timidly commented, "Wife, you are so scary!"  Everyone nodded in agreement. Indeed, it was terrifying. Ye San Shao was even afraid that his sister would devour their own son. That expression was extraordinary and terrifying, and everyone felt extremely horrified.  Bai Ye touched his nose. Except for Shi Yi, no one knew why.  While waiting for Su Man to answer the phone, the little bun raised his eyebrows and asked his aunt, "Auntie, what are you doing?"  "I hate you, I hate you..." Ye Wei's normally enchanting and charming face turned into a resentful, angry ghostly expression. Ning Ning felt a bit terrified, and just as he was about to say something, Su Man responded from the other end.  "Ning Ning?"  Su Man's voice was extremely pleasant, like the wind blowing over the mountaintop in the early morning, cold but with a touch of freshness, so clean that it was untainted by the mundane world, listening to it made one feel unreachable and inviolable.  "Um, Su beauty, I need you for something. Can you go online? I'll send you something."  Ning Ning's voice was very urgent. It was his first time calling Su Man, and he forgot to greet him. At the moment, he didn't even care about his aunt's resentful eyes.  "Is something wrong?"  "Yes, a life-threatening matter."  Ning Ning didn't hide it.  "Send it over, I'm online."  Su Man didn't ask further and simply said. Just as Ning Ning said "okay," Ye Wei snatched the phone, "Su beauty, long time no see, did you miss me?"  There was silence on the other end...  "Ye Wei?"  "Why so distant? Just call me Wei Wei. We've been honest with each other, no need for such formality."  Ye Wei held the phone, her voice was coquettish and seductive.  Mo Jue pouted and stared at Ye Wei with resentful eyes. His wife's expression, tone, and smile clearly meant she was contemplating infidelity. Mo Jue's cosmos burned fiercely; he wanted to tear Su Man into pieces, to dismember him and grind his bones to dust.  A cold murderous aura instantly spread. Shi Yi, Bai Ye, and Ye Chen all shivered at once. Ye Wei just raised her eyebrows and looked at Mo Jue, then splendidly ignored him. Mo Jue's murderous aura grew stronger.  In that instant, everyone felt as if he was about to revert to the old Mo Jue, but his gaze remained clean. Although filled with murderous intent, it lacked that viciousness. Clenching his fists, he was very sad and angry, but showed no sign of actual action. They were reassured.  "Busy, hanging up," Su Man said and decisively hung up the phone.  The beauty of Ye Wei was not something every man could enjoy. It was a great test of endurance. To make someone like Su Man, who was always calm, keep his distance, Ye Wei certainly had her formidable aspects.  She wanted to entangle a man. No matter who it was, they only had the option to evade, absolutely no match for her.  "Su beauty is too insincere, just three words to dismiss me."  Ye Wei held the phone, full of sorrow, "I've been longing for him day and night, what a waste of feelings."  Cheng An Ya and Ye Chen smiled. Bai Ye walked over to the little bun, and Ning Ning sent the information Bai Ye had prepared to Su Man.  Shi Yi pointed to the ghostly Mo Jue. Ye Wei's smile faded a bit, and she asked innocently, "Big Bai, who bullied you? Tell your wife, and your wife will help you beat him up."  Mo Jue was also quite interesting. He pointed straight at Ye Wei with his index finger and accused, "Wife, you are bullying me."  Everyone, "......"  Ye Chen pursed his lips and smiled, not wanting to expose Ye Wei too much. The pure Mo Jue was obviously Ye Wei's nemesis. Her complicated scheming was all useless against him, as he was like a child who expressed his displeasure in the most direct way. He simply didn't understand what a facial expression was.  Ye Wei smiled gracefully, "Are you saying that I should beat myself up?"  Mo Jue reluctantly glared and suddenly rushed to Ye Wei's side, grabbing her sleeve and crying out, "Wife, who is he, who is he, why are you so nice to him? You are seducing him!"  Shi Yi was a bit startled. Seduce? The pure Mo Jue knew what seduction was? It was a miracle. Thinking back to a few days ago when he became Big Bai, he was like a blank slate, not understanding anything except for his wife.  And now, he understood everything.  Ye Wei's ability to corrupt was indeed formidable. Such a pure child had been tainted by her. It was strong, just one word. In the future, if Mo Jue returned to his old self, recalling the days when he was Big Bai...  Well... Wei Wei probably wouldn't have enough heads for him to take, considering how vicious the man was. It was unlikely he would let things end peacefully. She was a bit worried about Wei Wei's future.  Ye Wei gently patted Mo Jue's face, her smile enchanting and captivating, "Big Bai, how could you wrongly accuse your wife? He is hundreds of kilometers away from me, impossible to seduce. If I were to seduce anyone, it would be you."  "Wife, you don't love me anymore. Wife, don't fall in love with someone else. Big Bai will be very good, very good."  Mo Jue's expression was pitiful, clinging to Ye Wei's arm as if afraid she would dump him.  Ye Wei was silent. How could this child use such words? Talking about falling in love with someone else, one was the past tense, and the other was the present tense. It should be moving Su Man's feelings, not falling in love with you.  Ye Wei was flabbergasted.  "Wife..."  Mo Jue was not so easily dismissed. Ye Wei punched him in the stomach, "Stop it, or I'll beat you so much you won't even recognize your brother."  Everyone, "......"  Miss Cheng and Ye San Shao enjoyed the show, exchanging smiles. They found the couple's interactions quite interesting. Miss Cheng also secretly thought that the two extremes of this man were very challenging.  She had personally seen the scars on Ye Wei's body, beaten to a horrific extent. The iron lotus on her wrist nearly crippled her hand, and from these scars, one could tell how ruthless the man was.  Now that he had become this white, easily moldable, it was quite a challenge.  Only someone as fierce as Ye Wei could suppress him.  Mo Jue was extremely sad and angry, his purple eyes brimming with grievance, his tender lips trembling like autumn leaves, causing great fear among the few people around him.  The little bun was witnessing this spectacle for the first time. Compared to the hellish figures he had seen at the supermarket before, the little bun's lips curled sinisterly, "Big Bai brother-in-law, do you know who Su beauty is? He's my aunt's old lover. My aunt was very enthusiastic about him, chasing him for a year. This time, she must be jealous because I have Su Man's contact information and she doesn't, so my aunt is jealous of me."  Upon hearing this, Mo Jue's gaze became even more mournful as he looked at Ye Wei, suddenly standing up in anger, and left with a flourish. It was actually very handsome and dignified.  Ye Wei was dumbfounded... o(╯□╰)o! Damn, Mo Jue, are you rebelling? You're showing her your back, throwing a tantrum. Wow, that's gutsy.  Miss Cheng calmly smiled, "Wei Wei, aren't you going to comfort him? He's really angered."  "Wei Wei, seems like it's the first time he's angry at you?" Shi Yi asked doubtfully, and it seemed to be true.  From that day on, Mo Jue had always revered Ye Wei. Ye Wei said one, and he wouldn't say two. If Ye Wei told him to kill, he wouldn't let the person live. In short, whatever Ye Wei said was the decree, Ye Wei's word was the truth. He was obedient and compliant, never showing Ye Wei any temper. He just feared Ye Wei would get the slightest bit upset and run away. This was truly a spectacle.  Shi Yi's explanation was that Ye Wei not only colored him but also infected him with her temper.  After the little bun stirred up trouble, he smiled elegantly. Bai Ye gave a thumbs up. After all, watching Ye Wei's drama was rare, and with someone offering a free showing, he was naturally happy to watch.  "She's turned against him."  Ye Wei rose abruptly and strode out, her angry demeanor as if she was about to take someone to task.  "Auntie, Su Man has sent a message," the little bun called out from behind. Ye Wei seemed not to hear and disappeared in a blink of an eye.  Everyone laughed. Indeed, there is a cure for every ailment, but Ye Wei's nemesis was perhaps too extraordinary, too unexpected.  They say that innocence and cunning make a perfect pair, and it seems to be true.  Though this one is thoroughly white.  Su Man had apparently already looked at the materials, which included information on 1934 and an analysis of the new virus. He was a virus expert himself and could quickly understand these professional materials.  Su Man: Bring the person here.  Mommy is the Greatest: Is there a cure?  Su Man: 70%.  Mommy is the Greatest: Okay, I will leave immediately.  Su Man sent an address to the little bun, and Bai Ye took note of it. He was somewhat curious, "70% certainty, is he sure? So many of our experts are at a loss, can he do it?"  He sounded confident, just by looking at the materials he claimed a 70% chance of success.  "If Su Man says there is, there definitely is. Daddy, Mommy, let's make a trip. It's only a few hours from here to Riyadh, we can go back and forth quickly," said the little bun.  This was an opportunity he wouldn't miss, any chance to cure his daddy and mommy.  Miss Cheng and Ye San Shao looked at each other and nodded in agreement.  "I'm going too," Bai Ye said, his face expressionless, his emotions not visible, but only he knew how curious and excited he was inside. Chapter 371: A Beauty's Smile Overturns the City - Part 1  Men always compare their strength to one another. Bai Ye is known as a genius doctor, and although his research on viruses isn't deep, he does have some involvement with them. He's troubled by a virus that has also troubled many experts.  That man claimed to have a 70% certainty of success at first glance. For people like them, a 70% certainty means that there's a good chance of a cure.  Bai Ye was very curious about how capable this person was. Moreover, the prospect of a high-speed magnetic wave scanner was enough to open his eyes to new possibilities.  The name Su Man was well-known to everyone. Neither Ye Sanshao nor Cheng Anya had any objections; a trip wouldn't take much time, and since there was a possibility of a cure, they were more than happy.  Under Ning Ning and Bai Ye's arrangements, the plane was quickly prepared. The affairs of the Number One Terrorist Organization were temporarily handed over to Claude for command, while Bai Ye instructed the experts in the research lab to continue studying the virus and to send any analysis reports to them immediately to avoid duplicating Su Man's research.  Everything was arranged in an orderly manner. Initially, Ye Wei and Mo Jue were not considered, but just when the plane was about to take off, Ye Wei dragged Mo Jue onto the plane.  Eleven naturally also boarded the plane; she was always inseparable from Ye Wei. Besides, with Mo Jue present, there was a chance to encounter Mo Ye.  "Niece, why are you going too?" The little bun was utterly puzzled.  Everyone knew that Ye Wei and Su Man had a history, and now she was bringing along Mo Jue, who was extremely jealous. Wouldn't this turn everything upside down?  He still wished for Su Man to focus on treating his parents' virus.  "Why can't I go? I haven't chatted with Su Man for a long time," Ye Wei replied confidently, her smile capable of captivating all. It was a pity that there were only three men on the plane - Bai Ye, Ye Sanshao, and Mo Jue - otherwise, she would have surely charmed everyone.  Is that really just chatting? Everyone expressed their doubts, as chatting wasn't usually so provocative.  She must be dreaming of hooking up with Su Man. In fact, with such an obedient and beautiful person like Mo Jue, it was puzzling why Ye Wei was still so obsessed with Su Man. Everyone wondered what kind of celestial being Su Man was to have such a great charm, even the usually discerning little bun admired Su Man.  Looking at Mo Jue again, he had just left with a stern face and dignified air, but in the blink of an eye, he became a typical henpecked husband, holding onto Ye Wei and not letting go. It was a classic case of a husband who does whatever his wife says.  Ye Sanshao and Bai Ye both gave Ye Wei a thumbs-up and simultaneously despised Mo Jue's henpecked appearance.  Bai Ye said, "Brother Da Bai, are you jealous?"  Mo Jue hugged Ye Wei and nodded vigorously, his innocent face showing a very pure expression. It seemed he was no longer jealous.  Ye Sanshao expressed his contempt again. It was rare to see such a submissive man.  Occasionally teasing Miss Cheng and watching her walk into his trap was something Ye Sanshao found very satisfying.  Cheng Anya also gave a thumbs-up. "You really have a way to control your husband, Wei Wei. When you're free, teach me a few tricks."  "Sure, no problem. I guarantee that Third Brother will be incredibly obedient," Ye Wei replied.  Ye Sanshao promptly pulled Miss Cheng to his side, smiling sinisterly and darkly. "Miss Cheng, am I not good enough for you? You still want to learn how to control your husband? What are you dissatisfied with? Tell me, and I'll change right away."  The little bun shuddered and huddled with Bai Ye.  Eleven raised her eyebrows, and Ye Wei said, "How sour, Brother. What did you eat for lunch? You shouldn't threaten people like that. You should be as obedient as Da Bai, and Third Sister-in-law will be nicer and gentler to you."  Ye Sanshao sent Ye Wei a dagger-like glare. If he were as white as Mo Jue, Miss Cheng would probably know how to bully him even more. He didn't want that. A man should have some dignity.  Besides, he couldn't fake the innocent, unpolluted look like Mo Jue.  "Exactly, I think so too," Miss Cheng agreed, making her look forward to seeing if Ye Sanshao could change his ways for a bit of excitement.  "Come on, be good and give me a smile," Miss Cheng hooked her finger under Ye Sanshao's chin, openly flirting with him.  Ye Sanshao's lips twitched fiercely.  This flirtatious behavior was just like Ye Wei's. Learning it to perfection, indeed, birds of a feather flock together.  He felt that he needed to keep his wife at least two hundred meters away from his sister to prevent her from being led astray.  Ye Wei collapsed into Mo Jue's arms laughing, and even Eleven's lips curled into a slight smile.  The little bun innocently covered his eyes and said in his childlike voice, "Mommy, don't be so provocative. It's not suitable for children. You should also take care of a child's pure heart."  Everyone: "......"  Pure? If you are pure, then what is dark?  Bai Ye laughed casually and offered a few words, "Women are too scary."  "I sympathize with you," the little bun patted Bai Ye's shoulder gravely, offering condolences. "Indeed, too scary. I mourn for your future."  Bai Ye, Chu Li, and others have long been oppressed by Ye Wei and Eleven. Now, witnessing Miss Cheng's wicked taste, anyone would find women terrifying.  Bai Ye patted the little bun's shoulder in return, also offering condolences. "I also mourn for you twenty years from now."  "No need. I don't need it," the little bun smiled. He thought that the person who would be tormented was gone. Everything was empty. As long as he had Nono in his heart for a lifetime, he didn't need any other women, so no one could torment him.  Miss Cheng was chatting and laughing with Ye Sanshao when she overheard the conversation and suddenly felt a heavy heart, not knowing what to say to the little bun. She just looked at him deeply.  The rest of the group didn't think about Nono at the moment and continued to joke around. Ye Sanshao and the others were all family, very familiar with each other. Bai Ye, despite being indifferent, grew up with Ye Wei and Eleven and got along well with Ye Sanshao, so the atmosphere remained lively, with no worries about the virus.  Everyone was carefree, and it was impossible to be sentimental.  Eleven was curious. "Da Bai, why did you let Wei Wei go to Riyadh? Aren't you afraid that your wife will be seduced by Su Man?"  Ye Wei kicked her, wondering when this block of ice also learned to watch her drama. Deserved to be hit.  Eleven, always cool and composed, ignored Ye Wei's protest. In fact, she thought it was a drama not to be missed.  Not just she was curious; Bai Ye, Miss Cheng, Ye Sanshao, and the little bun were all very interested, their eyes fixed on Mo Jue.  Mo Jue blinked his eyes, answering very honestly, "Wife said, Su Man is not as good-looking as me. She abandoned Su Man, not me. I am the original."  Everyone: "......"  Even someone as cold as Eleven choked up, let alone Cheng Anya and others.  Wei Wei, you could actually say such a thing. Indeed... fierce.  "Brother Da Bai, Wei Wei is deceiving you. I guarantee with my integrity that this is absolutely insincere. Just look at how excited she gets when she hears Su Man's name. How can you believe that?" Bai Ye, oppressed for many years, finally had a chance to stir up trouble.  The little bun expressed the same doubt.  Mo Jue's purple eyes were confused. Seeing everyone nodding in agreement, and then looking at Ye Wei, he pulled her sleeve and asked, "Wife, would you deceive me?"  "No," Ye Wei replied calmly, her face unchanging.  Mo Jue was satisfied and proudly glanced over everyone. "Wife said she wouldn't deceive me. Don't try to sow discord."  Eleven's eyelid twitched. It was rare to see Mo Jue being trained by Ye Wei to such an extent.  The little bun laughed heartily.  As a fellow man, Bai Ye admired Mo Jue with one hundred percent respect.  Ye Sanshao lay on Cheng Anya's shoulder, laughing uncontrollably. This man was too adorable.  Miss Cheng was very calm. Mo Jue's expression when he said not to sow discord was genuinely unique, like a typical little white rabbit.  "Wei Wei, that was a good move," said Cheng Anya.  "Thank you for the compliment, Third Sister-in-law," Ye Wei replied.  The two women exchanged a smile. Miss Cheng glanced at Ye Sanshao, and he felt a chill down his spine, in a dilemma.  Miss Cheng's wicked tastes were not few. Being targeted by her meant a dead end.  "Miss Cheng, stop the strange images in your mind. He and I are not the same kind," Ye Sanshao immediately declared.  Mo Jue was the most typical image of a henpecked husband, and no man would want to learn from him.  Ye Wei laughed, "Third Brother, our Mo Jue is tenderer than you, very delicious. From the inside out, he is very pure."  Indeed, that was the truth.  Miss Cheng's smile became gentler. "You really don't know how to write 'pure'."  The little bun pondered with his chin in his hand, "I'm also curious about what Su Man looks like. Auntie, is she really celestial?"  "Ask Eleven," Ye Wei said casually, with Mo Jue present, she kept her mouth shut.  Eleven looked at Mo Jue and gave a fair opinion, "They each have their own merits."  "Then she must be celestial," the little bun said with a smile.  Miss Cheng suddenly noticed the jade pendant on the little bun's chest and asked with curiosity, "Baby, what are you wearing? A jade pendant?"  Isn't that something for girls? Her son never wore such things.  The little bun's smile faded slightly, a hint of pain flashing through his eyes before quickly returning to calm. He was about to answer when Mo Jue did it for him, "It's from my Nono's home."  The atmosphere turned a bit heavy.  Ye Wei and others knew the situation, but Cheng Anya and Ye Sanshao didn't.  The little bun casually tucked the inadvertently exposed jade pendant back in, his expression very calm, showing no trace of sorrow or despair.  But many years later, when Cheng Anya recalled this scene, she would understand.  There is a calmness called the ripple of still water.  "It's very beautiful," said Cheng Anya lightly, and Ye Sanshao held her hand tightly.  The little bun smiled brightly, "Yes, I think it's beautiful too."  Seeing their harmonious scene, he missed Nono very much. He was afraid to sleep at night, fearing that he would dream of her and upon waking up, he could only grasp the regret lingering in the air, unable to sleep all night.  These feelings, experienced too early, seemed engraved in his heart.  As time settled, this memory became clearer and clearer, firmly imprinted in his heart, slowly adding marks that could never be erased. For a lifetime, like a shadow, he would live with this memory, without regret.  Bai Ye patted the little bun on the shoulder, and everyone fell silent for a while. It was Ye Sanshao who knocked on the table. "Ning Ning, didn't you say you'd bring a fool home? Stay away from the fierce ones. Didn't listen and suffered for it?"  Miss Cheng was silent.  Bai Ye laughed. This early start on love education was also special.  The little bun clasped his hands together, adopting a look of utmost admiration, "Wise and mighty Daddy, your baby will definitely heed your teachings and won't dare again."  Everyone laughed lightly.  The atmosphere became lively again. Cheng Anya smiled and said nothing more, but her heart ached. His forced laughter was evident to her, very heartbreaking.  They chatted and laughed all the way to Riyadh, and the plane landed on a private airstrip. The estate was exceptionally spacious, like an oasis, with a vast date palm grove and a dense palm forest. In the center of the garden, there was a delicate fountain. The elegant villa courtyard was lush with various exotic flowers and plants. The estate was somewhat old, exuding a deep historical flavor. The bending corridors were adorned with lotus petal crystal lamps, very attractive. The walls were covered with climbing vines, full of greenery.  The female servants who came to greet them were all dressed in typical Arabian attire, with black robes, black head coverings, and black sand. They led them to the hall.  Ye Wei greeted them cheerfully, causing a round of light laughter. One of them, speaking in English, said, "The master is going to have a headache again."  Summers in Riyadh were extremely hot, but the hall was cool throughout. Bai Ye, with his keen observation, noticed that the walls were carved from ice jade, inconspicuous at first glance, but very cold to the touch. This was a special design to reduce the summer heat. Quite ingenious.  "Their family's walls are all carved from ice jade. Rich people indeed," Ye Wei said. Having lived there for quite some time with Eleven, she was very familiar with the place and took the initiative to grab some fruit to quench her thirst.  Riyadh's summer heat was unbearable, and they were parched upon disembarking the plane.  The female servants soon brought cold drinks and fruit snacks. Knowing Ye Wei and Eleven's preferences, they even prepared two cups of blue-green fruit drinks for the two of them.  Ye Wei spoke in Arabic, "Sister Diana, I didn't expect you to remember my favorite. I'm so touched."  Diana smiled and said, "The master is currently receiving Princess Seven. He'll be here shortly."  "Is she good-looking?" Ye Wei was very curious. The visitor must have come with the intention of throwing herself into his arms. Ye Wei had seen even more astounding scenes last year.  Diana's large eyes were full of smiles, "Not as good-looking as you."  Ye Wei was satisfied. Sister Diana, you know how to play the game.  Bai Ye shook his head and poked her shoulder, "Can yours understand Arabic?"  You should soothe your inner courtyard before you try to hook up with someone. Otherwise, you might set your own house on fire.  Ye Wei had forgotten about this and said to Mo Jue in Arabic, "Da Bai, my drink doesn't taste good. Let's switch."  Mo Jue obediently exchanged his drink with Ye Wei's, but she quickly stopped him, "No need, I suddenly find it very tasty."  He could understand. Ye Wei was conflicted.  The little bun laughed and explained to Cheng Anya, as she was the only one among them who didn't understand Arabic. She wasn't as versatile as them, only knowing English, Japanese, and French.  Soon, someone outside called for the master, and a tall figure slowly entered everyone's sight, his back to the sun, dressed in a white robe, surrounded by a faint and serene halo.  Emanating a sense of untouchable sanctity.  Cheng Anya's first impression was, indeed, Su the beauty!  Everyone had only one thought in their minds. A beauty's smile overturns the city. Chapter 372: A Beauty's Smile Overturns the City (Part 2)  Su Man, in his mid to late twenties, stood tall and straight. Unlike the typical Arab, instead of wearing a white robe, black headband, and white turban, he only wore a white robe, his long hair bound behind him with a silver ribbon. His eyebrows were like willow leaves, fine and long, resembling the dark greenery of distant mountains. His eyes, black and spirited, were like the springs in a mountain stream, cold yet carrying a sense of purity. Upon closer inspection, they were like the wind over an ice field, piercing and intimidating.  His high nose and beautifully shaped lips, with a color so lovely, carried an air of refinement that made his chin equally captivating. Every feature was a masterpiece from God. His entire presence exuded arrogance, iciness, and an unapproachable dignity that seemed almost blasphemous to violate. His stunning features would never be mistaken for a woman's because at a glance, he was unmistakably a confident and powerful man, emitting an aura of dominance and aloofness that no woman could possess.  Dressed in white that surpassed snow, with ink-black hair contrasted by a silver band, he was the epitome of peerless elegance. His appearance was guaranteed to amaze the entire room one hundred percent. Once he stood there, the whole world seemed like a mere backdrop to his radiance. Every man and woman in the hall, seasoned and calm as they were, became silent at the sight of such beauty. Even Ye Wei and Shi Yi, accustomed to his looks, were taken aback. Some people never tire the eyes, no matter how much they are observed; he was as dazzling as when they first saw him.  Su Man's gaze swept across the men and women in the hall, accustomed to such admiring looks. His eyes landed on the little one, and his usually unsmiling lips curved slightly. In an instant, his elegance illuminated the room, a smile that could overthrow cities.  "Su the beauty, I've missed you so much," Ye Wei was the first to recover, not even minding Mo Jue's jealousy, her figure darting over, eager to throw herself into his arms. Ye Wei was the top assassin, very quick on her feet, but there was someone even faster.  Mo Jue followed suit, pulling her by the waist to his side, his stunning features filled with protest, "Wife..."  This 'wife' was drawn out very long.  Su Man raised an eyebrow, his cold gaze falling on Ye Wei and Mo Jue. Ye Wei hadn't managed to reach her target and was filled with resentment, yet she couldn't let Mo Jue throw a tantrum, feeling extremely aggrieved.  "I don't miss you at all," Su Man said with a cold gaze, his voice clear and clean.  Mo Jue earned a full measure of respect for being able to control Ye Wei; otherwise, how many people would she have harmed?   "Su the beauty, that's not very kind of you," Ye Wei protested, patting Da Bai's hand, signaling him to let go.  Bringing him was a very wrong decision. If not for the fact that no one in the castle could control him, she really didn't want to bring him.  "Su Man." The little one approached, touching his chin, generous with his praise, "You are really unexpected."  Although they had heard he was extraordinary, they only realized upon meeting him just how otherworldly he was—noble and compelling.  "Little fellow, you are quite unexpected too," Su Man said, patting his shoulder, his expression softening, "How come Ye Wei is here too?"  Ye Wei immediately objected, "Su the beauty, what do you mean by that?"  Shi Yi was straightforward, "He's tired of you."  The little one laughed, "She's my aunt."  "The world is indeed small," Su Man's usual cold gaze flashed with helplessness, and it turned out to be one group after another.  The little one introduced them all because Cheng An Ya and Ye San Shao were infected with a virus, the two just nodded in greeting. Su Man was also not fond of socializing, which suited his temperament. A nod was considered an acknowledgment, and the same went for Bai Ye.  "Ning Ning, why are so many people here for a medical check-up?" Su Man's cold sweep made everyone feel an invisible pressure. Some people just have that kind of aura, a casual remark enough to intimidate.  Ye San Shao was silent, and Miss Cheng was also silent. It seemed that geniuses always had a bit of a strange temperament. Of course, except for their baby, in any case, they definitely had to come for a medical check-up, and the rest were none of their business.  "I miss you. Is that not allowed? You know that Shi Yi and I are inseparable," Ye Wei said.  "Yeah, and you even brought your family along."  "Hey, could it be that you regret not accepting me back then?" Ye Wei teased, hooking Su Man's arm, "Beauty, do you really not miss me at all?"  "I don't miss you," Su Man replied succinctly.  His cold gaze shifted, and Mo Jue had already pulled Ye Wei to his side. His purple eyes were filled with jealousy, "Wife, don't be like this, just come and hug me."  Everyone else, "......"  The others had their excuses, and Bai Ye said indifferently, "The virus they are infected with is under my jurisdiction, maybe I can help."  "No need," Su Man said coldly, his voice exuding restrained arrogance.  Bai Ye remained calm, but his eyebrows seemed to carry a hint of frost, gradually revealing his domineering side, "Trust me, you'll need me."  Their gazes clashed, one casual and distant, the other cold and arrogant, neither willing to give in an inch, the atmosphere oppressively tense.  The little one stood elegantly in the middle, smiling. Both men looked away, one serene, the other snorting. With a smile, the little one said, "Su the beauty, Bai Ye has also studied viruses. He's not as thorough as you, but his medical skills are definitely stronger than yours."  Su Man's cold eyebrows rose, "I need the latest analysis data."  "No problem," Bai Ye nodded.  Su Man swept his gaze around, instructing Ye San Shao and Cheng An Ya to follow him to the lab, barring others from following. Everyone obediently stayed in the hall. Bai Ye commented, "He's really arrogant."  "He has the capital to be," Shi Yi said. "He knew about Wei Wei and my identities from the start and never showed a good face."  "Ah, Wei Wei, you like that sort, huh? But..." Bai Ye looked at Mo Jue with a smile, "Your taste has changed too much."  Mo Jue didn't understand what Bai Ye was talking about, the little one laughed, Shi Yi couldn't help but chuckle, and Ye Wei waved her hand lazily. She was speechless, "It was absolutely an accident, an accident..."  "Is he Arab?" Bai Ye curiously asked. Su Man had the depth and refinement of Arabs, but also the delicacy of Eastern people, overall more resembling an Easterner.  "His mother is Arab, and his father is Chinese, a mixed-race child."  Everyone nodded, realizing that mixed-race children tend to be stunning. They had seen a few, all similarly impressive, but none quite like Su Man.  Ye Wei leaned lazily in her chair, sipping a cold drink, and spoke slowly, "Now you know why I was so fixated. Su the beauty is captivating inside and out. The more you know him, the more you realize he's a rare real man."  Too bad he wasn't interested in her. According to insider information, Su Man didn't like women but preferred men, so she was naturally ruled out from the start. Truly a tragedy.  "Auntie, your charm is failing."  "Little kid, don't talk nonsense. Look how he's still smitten and lost, where has it diminished?"  Ye Wei pointed to Mo Jue who was beside her, smiling enchantingly. Her charm still worked on Mo Jue.  Mo Jue held Ye Wei's hand and asked, "Wife, didn't you say he wasn't as handsome as me and that you had abandoned him? Why are you still so close to him? Wife, you lied to me."  "Friends haven't seen each other for so long, missing each other is normal, hugging is basic etiquette, understand?"  Mo Jue shook his head, pointing to Shi Yi, "She didn't go to hug."  Bai Ye and the little one couldn't help but smile. Shi Yi huffed coldly, and Ye Wei cooperated, "Look how icy Shi Yi is, who would dare to hug her? Do you want to die? How can you compare your wife to Shi Yi?"  Fire and ice cannot be compared.  "Wife, you should be like Shi Yi, no need to be too enthusiastic, Da Bai doesn't like it," Mo Jue said dejectedly.  He looked down, his mood downcast, his limpid purple eyes dimming, losing their luster.  Ye Wei paused, feeling a bit... displeased with this side of Mo Jue. She had never planned to change her behavior for anyone, and besides, Su Man wasn't interested in her. Teasing him was harmless, nothing serious.  "Wei Wei, have you noticed? He seems to be getting smarter," Shi Yi suddenly said, especially these past few days, quite noticeable, not like the naive person at the beginning, who would believe anything Ye Wei said.  Ye Wei nodded, and Shi Yi harbored another worry. Was he about to recover? Or?  "Da Bai, did you remember something?" Ye Wei asked softly. Mo Jue shook his head, and Ye Wei and Shi Yi exchanged a look, saying nothing. Maybe it was just an illusion.  "Wife, if you continue like this, I will kill him," Mo Jue said gravely, his purple eyes filled with murderous intent.  "......"  "Da Bai, let's go. I'll take you to enjoy the scenery of Riyadh," Ye Wei said, dragging Mo Jue out. His gloomy face immediately brightened up like clouds parting for sunshine.  This was a small research lab.  Since Su Man was a virus expert, his home lab was equipped with the world's most complete research facilities. Despite being small, it had everything necessary. At a glance, there were test tubes, reagents, automated equipment, computer-aided analysis, and a huge LCD screen.  Su Man took blood samples from the two and injected them with two different colored reagents. There were only three people here, and Ye San Shao didn't hold back, asking gravely, "Mr. Su, can this virus really be cured?"  Su Man was performing a systematic examination on Cheng An Ya, and he responded indifferently, "Maybe it can be, maybe not. I'm not completely sure myself. We have to see how unstable the virus is."  Ye San Shao was also prepared for the worst, watching Cheng An Ya, he smiled slightly. Cheng An Ya returned his smile. At their level, life and death seemed not so important. Su Man glanced at this couple, perhaps because of his good relationship with Ning Ning, he had a favorable impression of them, and his attitude softened quite a bit. After all, to raise a child like the little one, the parents couldn't be ordinary. Plus, a few months ago, Ye San Shao's exploits and scandals shook the globe quite dramatically. Knowing they were Ning Ning's parents, Su Man naturally paid attention, finding it quite interesting.  Now seeing them face life and death with such composure, he admired them. "Just call me Su Man."  Su Man's voice was always crisp, without much emotional fluctuation.  Cheng An Ya smiled as he examined her, starting a conversation, "Su Man, how did you meet Ning Ning?"  "By chance, I guess. He wanted a set of weapon blueprints, and I happened to have them. Originally I didn't want to give them, but he hacked my home computer. I had no choice but to compromise. If I didn't agree, I was afraid he would even help me change my nationality for free, and when I woke up, I'd become stateless. Maybe even my ID card would have a name popping up in the spouse column," Su Man recounted.  As the parents of the little one, Ye San Shao and Miss Cheng felt somewhat embarrassed... Their son's behavior was really... Robber-like! It's no wonder he's their son, Ye San Shao thought proudly. Even though the methods were sneaky and scheming, they were the most effective.  "...... You're really unlucky."  Miss Cheng managed to say after a long time, regretting it as soon as she spoke. Under normal circumstances, shouldn't they, as parents, be apologizing? Miss Cheng, o(╯□╰)o!  "Yeah, I consider myself unlucky," Su Man agreed, not feeling that the parents' education was twisted at all. Miss Cheng's indulgence in the little one had reached a certain level.  "Being unlucky occasionally is quite good. My son is quite useful," Ye San Shao also said, not feeling that the little one's behavior was shameful, but rather quite proud.  Su Man nodded in agreement, "Indeed."  Miss Cheng and Ye San Shao felt satisfied. Su Man was really accommodating. How they met wasn't important, what mattered was their current friendship, which was quite good, wasn't it?  Su Man finished examining Miss Cheng, his eyelids slightly raised, his cold eyes sweeping a trace of understanding, "I finally realize Ning Ning's character is not nurtured, but inherited."  Ye San Shao, "......"  Miss Cheng, "......"  Su Man asked Miss Cheng to get up and Ye San Shao to lie down, then said, "But you're right about one thing."  While examining Ye San Shao, Su Man looked at the screen displaying images and data, his gaze darkening. It was in Arabic, which Cheng An Ya couldn't understand, but she could clearly see the images—it was a liver.  "It's a bit troublesome," Su Man murmured.  Cheng An Ya's heart skipped a beat, feeling a bad premonition, "What's wrong? Is there no cure?"  "The virus has already invaded the liver, his case is more serious than yours," Su Man said truthfully, believing they were strong enough to handle the news, so he didn't hide it, "It's a kind of cellular virus. Once it invades the liver, bodily functions will significantly decline. He won't be able to move freely in a day and will have to lie in the lab, surviving on sedatives and oxygen masks."  Cheng An Ya's eyes widened in shock, blood draining from her face, feeling a painful pressure in her heart and head, completely blank. What else couldn't she concern herself with? Her hands and feet became numb and cold, and waves of fear washed over her. She had a strong feeling that she was about to lose Ye San Shao.  "Su Man, what should we do?" Cheng An Ya tried to remain calm, but couldn't, her voice trembling, her slender body stiffening.  Ye San Shao reached out, holding Cheng An Ya's hand. The cold touch was heart-wrenching. Although they had come to terms with life and death, the prospect of eternal separation still brought pain and despair.  "Don't worry, Xiao An Ya, it's not like there's no hope at all," Ye San Shao said softly, "We've agreed, haven't we?"  "The situation is worse than I thought, but it's not hopeless. Rest assured, I'll do my best," Su Man said firmly, his cold eyes filled with determination, "Ning Ning rarely asks me for anything, and I will do whatever it takes to grant his wish."  Cheng An Ya felt relieved for some reason, believing Su Man's words without reservation.  "And her?" Su Man glanced at Cheng An Ya, "She's fine, still under control for now. She's the first vector, the virus is more stable in her, so her condition is quite good."  "Why is that? I was infected before him."  "It doesn't have much to do with the timing of the infection," Su Man explained, "This cellular virus is inherently unstable, and being the second vector magnifies that instability, making mutations more likely."  Cheng An Ya didn't understand viruses well, but seeing Su Man's serious expression, she felt heavy-hearted. Ye San Shao, however, was calm, accepting the bad news peacefully.  "By the way, Su Man, the designer of 1934 was your grandfather. Bai Ye said the principle is similar, is there an antidote?" Cheng An Ya asked Su Man.  Su Man nodded, his cold eyes briefly showing pain, quickly concealed, "1934 was researched by my grandfather when he was young. At that time, my grandmother had liver cancer, and my grandfather's study of cellular viruses was solely for treating liver cancer. It was locked in the lab and unknown to anyone because he was aware of the great harm that could come from it. Unfortunately, it was stolen by an apprentice and fell into the hands of criminals, causing tens of thousands of deaths in a Siberian town. He regretted it deeply. Later, he devoted himself to researching an antidote for 1934, only managing to develop it in his later years. However, some documents were lost during a move, and several pages of the antidote records are missing. It will take me some time to complete them. Though the principle is the same, this virus is obviously more complex. Currently, I only have a rough idea and must confirm it before daring to test it on you."  Ye San Shao looked at Su Man, smiling slowly, serene and carefree, "Go ahead and do it, I trust you." Chapter 373: Wife, I Don't Think Highly of Him  After Su Man conducted a detailed examination of Ye Shaoshao and Cheng Anya, it was nearly evening when she came out. She stayed in the laboratory to prepare materials, and had the maid take the two to their residence.  The little milk bun had been waiting in the room early on. The examination took a bit longer than it did in Rome. The little milk bun felt uneasy, fearing that something might go wrong. If even Su Man said there was no way, it would mean that probably no one in the world could save them.  As soon as they returned, Ye Shaoshao's complexion looked very pale, which made the little milk bun's heart sink. He hurried forward, but Cheng Anya, fearing an accidental touch, ordered him to stay away.  Reluctantly, the little milk bun backed off to a safe distance.  "Daddy, Mommy, are you guys alright? What did Su Man say?" The little milk bun was very anxious, having waited an entire afternoon, losing patience, and now only wanting to hear good news, though he also knew this was very unlikely.  Cheng Anya didn't hide the truth from him and told him the reality.  The little milk bun felt fear and worry in his heart but did not show it. He pursed his lips and said, "Here we have the world's most awesome doctors and the top virus experts. Daddy and Mommy will definitely be fine."  Ye Shaoshao let out a carefree smile. The calm exhibited by the little milk bun was very much like that of a great general. He couldn't help but recall how the child had behaved when Cheng Anya was hit by a car and needed an amputation; he was not flustered and was busy comforting Grandpa Cheng.  But...  "Baby, don't worry too much. Do what you need to do. Since we trust them, let's trust them completely. At this point, whatever the result is, your mommy and I will accept it," Ye Shaoshao said soothingly.  "Don't keep a straight face, it's bad luck. Your daddy and mommy aren't dead yet, but with such a face, you might bring bad luck upon us. Be happy."  Miss Cheng waved her hand dismissively, not wanting to see her son's stern face, which made her uncomfortable.  In her memory, her son should always be smiling elegantly and adorably. A stern face didn't suit her at all.  "Got it, got it," the little milk bun pouted, his tender lips full of displeasure, "In any case, you're not allowed to leave me."  Miss Cheng chuckled, not recognizing her own child, "Who just said that we have the most amazing doctors and top virus experts here, and that nothing will happen? Why have you changed your tune so quickly? Lost confidence?"  "Mommy, don't expose your baby like this," the little milk bun glared, the little gentleman expressing his discontent.  Miss Cheng and Ye Shaoshao exchanged smiles.  "Little Anya, Ningning, let's go out for a walk as a family later. You haven't been to Riyadh before; the night view is very beautiful," Ye Shaoshao suggested. Because of business, he had been to Riyadh twice, but each time was a brief visit, and he never had the chance to truly appreciate the beauty of the city. The night view of Riyadh had left a deep impression on him.  Saying it was splendid would not be an exaggeration. A family trip would feel very good. Apart from that one time at the beach, they had never traveled as a family, and he didn't know if he would have the opportunity to enjoy such warm family time in the future.  He cherished it very much.  "Baby agrees," the little milk bun revealed an elegant smile and joyfully cast his vote in favor, his dark eyes revealing a childlike delight, "Su Man said that the local specialties here are very famous."  Ye Shaoshao nodded and gave his son a thumbs-up gesture. Father and son exchanged a smile.  Cheng Anya hesitated for a moment, her bright eyes revealing a hint of worry and fear. The incident with Zhang Bo was etched in her memory; that pain was indescribable and very painful.  "With our bodies like this, it's not suitable to go out on the streets. Better not go, it would be bad if others were harmed," said Cheng Anya. She wanted to see it too, but the situation didn't allow it. Inevitable physical collisions on the streets could lead to unimaginable consequences if the virus spread.  "That's true," Ye Shaoshao felt it was inappropriate as well. Even though the streets of Riyadh were spacious, there could always be unexpected incidents, "Damn, I have to lie down tomorrow and they won't even give me one sweet date tonight, God is really a bastard."  Miss Cheng, "......"  The little milk bun, "...... Daddy, use civilized language, don't set a bad example for your baby."  Ye Shaoshao smirked and threw a disdainful look at the little milk bun, "Come on, you've already given Louis the finger, how much more civilized can you get? Anyway, there's hardly anyone in our family, so we might as well not pretend."  The little milk bun touched his nose, reigned in his smile, and said seriously, "Daddy, you can't say that. Image is still very important."  Watching the father and son, Cheng Anya couldn't help but laugh; they were too cute.  "How about this, we'll go by car and won't get out. If there's anything to buy, let the baby go and buy it," Cheng Anya suggested with a smile.  "Baby, considering your father is going to start having tough days tomorrow, you'll just have to work a bit harder."  "At your command!" The little milk bun saluted in a military fashion.  Ye Wei and Mo Jue were having so much fun that they were nowhere to be seen for an afternoon. It was only at dinner time when Su Man came out of the laboratory that the two of them came back in a high-profile manner. Mo Jue was shouting "wife" so loudly that everyone felt the food was particularly delicious.  They didn't hold back and took their seats as soon as they returned. The maid served them food and drinks. Da Bai had gone out at noon with an unhappy face, but now he was very happy, his cheeks even flushed a lovely pink, looking very cute.  Shiyi whispered to Ye Wei, "Did you handle him? Did you find anything?"  In terms of tacit understanding, Ye Wei and Shiyi were the best. They even knew what each other had done in a short time without even exchanging looks. Ye Wei shook her head, "All normal."  Because of her special identity, Ye Wei, no matter how she felt about Mo Jue, whether she had fallen in love with him or not, was always on guard. No matter what she did, nothing could interfere with the big picture, so their caution was normal.  But whether it was a fake play that turned real or a real play that seemed fake, how much was true and how much was false, Ye Wei herself probably wasn't clear.  Not to mention others.  Her thoughts were always hard to guess, and others would see her as they did in the past: carefree and enchanting, without a half-point difference. It was precisely because of this that Ye Shaoshao and Bai Ye were reassured to have her look after Mo Jue.  "Su beauty, how are my brother and sister-in-law?" Ye Wei and Mo Jue happened to be sitting opposite Su Man, and with just a glance, they saw a pleasing beauty, which made Ye Wei's mood soar.  "Good," Su Man replied indifferently.  The little milk bun said, "Auntie, you're so lost in joy, do you still remember my daddy and mommy?"  "Little kid, eat more and talk less."  "Big White Uncle, did Auntie bully you?"  Mo Jue shook his head innocently, very protective of his wife, "No, my wife treats me very well."  Everyone silently mourned for Brother Big White. Any normal person with eyes could see that this was far from being good.  Su Man played with the food on her plate, her eyebrows slightly raised, her eyes occasionally landing on Mo Jue. Because she was sitting directly opposite, she could see him with just a glance, which didn't seem strange at all.  But what was strange was that Su Man looked many times, and everyone present was sensitive, except for Mo Jue who was oblivious, the rest could all feel it.  Su Man's sexual orientation was known to Ye Wei and Shiyi, and it was mentioned once on the plane.  Shiyi was always cool and collected, even Miss Cheng, who was usually very calm, could hardly maintain her composure because it was so suggestive.  Mo Jue's looks were indeed irresistible to both men and women, especially now with his innocent eyes, a peach blossom face, watery purple pupils, and tender pink lips, he looked very much like a pet suitable for keeping.  Seeing how Ye Wei enjoyed teasing him, it was quite fun.  So everyone immediately conjured up an intricate love triangle in their minds: Mo Jue took a fancy to Ye Wei, Ye Wei took a fancy to Su Man, and Su Man took a fancy to Mo Jue. This Ye Wei had been pursuing Su Man for over a year, and she came here mainly for Su Man this time.  Unexpectedly, bringing Mo Jue along somehow added a love rival to herself, and this love rival kept calling her "wife."  Everyone was now wickedly thinking about how aggrieved Ye Wei must be.  The little milk bun sipped on his iced coconut milk, his dark eyes darting around restlessly over his aunt, Big White uncle, and Su Man, looking very sly.  Ye Wei slowly put down her cutlery, smiling in a flirtatious manner, and got straight to the point, "Su beauty, have you taken a fancy to my Big White?"  Su Man's expression remained calm, her brows not even twitching, "Nonsense."  Mo Jue looked innocently at Ye Wei, as if afraid she would get angry, hastily waving his hands, "Wife, don't be angry, rest assured, I like my wife the most, I won't take a fancy to him."  Silence...  Shiyi turned her face away in embarrassment, her shoulders shaking a few times, apparently laughing madly.  Miss Cheng calmly tugged at the tablecloth, almost laughing herself onto the table. Ye Shaoshao's eyes twitched, wanting to laugh but feeling it was very impolite. After all, Su Man was the host and they were the guests.  The little milk bun choked on his coconut milk, sprayed it out in a different direction, and kept coughing.  "Ha ha..." In the midst of a strange silence, only Bai Ye laughed heartily, slapping the table. He was naturally carefree and indifferent, and it was the first time he acted out of character like this. Su Man's eyebrows were coldly raised, and with a motion as if in slow motion, her eyes swept over Bai Ye, sipping her tea with an air of lightness.  Mo Jue seemed oblivious to the consequences he had caused, looking around innocently, "What's wrong with you all?"  Ye Wei patted Mo Jue's head, quite comforted. She had been bullied by Su Man so many times without winning once. She didn't expect that with Mo Jue's appearance, he would give Su Man a big red face straight on.  Very good, very promising.  Seeing Su Man change her face was a very refreshing thing, although he was still very light and airy.  "It's nothing, Big White. You did well, and you deserve praise."  Ye Wei praised him generously, and Mo Jue naturally couldn't stop smiling when he heard his wife compliment him.  "Weiwei, you've trained a top-class pet." Bai Ye laughed so hard he was out of breath.  Ye Wei smiled charmingly, her laugh deviously cunning, "Su beauty, don't be shy. If you consider giving me a kiss, I might consider lending you Big White for a hug."  The others, "......"  The little milk bun was glad he wasn't drinking anything. Auntie, it's still you who's strong.  Ye Shaoshao couldn't help but feel that with such a sister, his life was truly complete.  Miss Cheng, however, felt that those with the surname Ye were indeed perverts. She had this realization long ago.  Su Man's eyes were still cold, her lips curving into an arc that was definitely not a smile, as if a frost had swept over. The man spoke evenly, without any waves, "In terms of personality, his condition is called a split personality. In terms of age, he is called dual age layers. In terms of the soul, he is not considered a complete individual."  ......  Another silence fell over everyone.  Ye Wei's smile faded, and she glanced at Mo Jue, "Have you encountered such cases before?"  "A few years ago," Su Man replied.  "Why does this happen?"  "How would I know?" Su Man answered coolly.  Ye Wei looked gloomy, "Su beauty, that's not very kind of you."  "I've always been this unkind."  Ye Wei was silent. Even if it was the truth, Su beauty, you shouldn't say it so confidently, o(╯□╰)o.  The little milk bun was curious, "Su Man, Mo Jue wasn't like this before. I've seen him once; he's worlds apart from now. He's been like this for many days now. When will he recover?"  Mo Jue was still very confused and didn't understand what they were talking about.  Su Man raised an eyebrow and glanced at Mo Jue, "I don't know."  "You said you've encountered cases before, haven't you?" Ye Shaoshao was also very curious.  Su beauty said, "This is not an illness, and it varies from person to person. Naturally, I am not clear."  Shiyi, however, was most concerned about another matter, "Can it be cured?"  "I don't know."  "Why do you not know everything I ask?" Bai Ye commented.  Ye Wei nodded in agreement, not knowing anything when asked, a quack doctor.  Su Man's cold gaze swept over Bai Ye, "If I ask you, you probably wouldn't know five things."  The others were silent. Su beauty, you're so vicious.  Bai Ye laughed nonchalantly, not caring at all, "It's not a disease, so it's normal not to know five things. Different specialties, no comparison."  Su Man sipped tea, unfazed, "Making excuses."  Bai Ye smiled, calmly sipping a glass of red wine, and everyone was silent.  The atmosphere was truly strange.  Ye Wei glanced at Mo Jue and kept silent. A split personality? She had never heard of it. Not a complete individual? That's even more nonsensical; he was clearly a living person. Chapter 374: The Beautiful Ink Jade Lady Returns  After dinner, Ye Shaoshao drove Cheng Anya and Little Bun out for a drive. Su Man originally wanted to act as a tour guide, but Ye Shaoshao refused, insisting that although he was not familiar with Liyade, with his all-capable son, they would surely not get lost. He did not want anyone else to disrupt the warm family time of the three of them.  The night scenery in Liyade was indeed very beautiful. Shedding its desert city appearance of over a decade ago with flying dust and sand, today's Liyade is filled with towering buildings, spacious and bright streets, and the city is brightly lit. Looking over, the street lights of the entire city lit up, giving people a feeling of a sea of lights.  The car moved slowly, and Cheng Anya noticed that the city had many fountains, with two fountains visible on almost every street, all uniquely designed, adding a touch of coolness to the hot summer days.  The city's greening was also quite good. Ye Shaoshao smiled and said, "Most of the Sahara Desert is within the territory of Saudi Arabia, and every bit of greening in Liyade city has to be artificially maintained, which is very costly. The fountains are just for regulating the city's temperature."  Cheng Anya nodded in understanding and showed respect. In fact, she also felt that Liyade was indeed too hot. During the day, at Su Man's mansion, there were ice jades everywhere, which was very cool. But once she stepped outside, the heat was overwhelming. Ye Wei cheerfully told her that 40 degrees was considered normal temperature, and the hottest could reach 45 degrees.  She finally understood why the streets of Liyade were so empty. Normally, no one would walk or shop outside when the daytime temperature was over 40 degrees and the nighttime temperature over 30 degrees. It was definitely self-torture.  The streets were really too empty. When there was no one around, they would get out of the car to take photos as a keepsake. Although hot and sweaty, Cheng Anya was smiling happily.  What they did not know was that a storm was brewing back at Su Man's mansion.  After dinner, Su Man entered the laboratory again to complete the antidote data for 1934 and continued researching the virus. He was the only person in the vast laboratory. When Ye Wei came, he was not surprised at all.  "Su beauty, how about I accompany you to spend a wonderful evening?" Ye Wei smiled charmingly, leaning into Su Man's embrace with a soft and fragrant body, hooking Su Man's neck with one hand, and smiling seductively, generously planting a kiss on Su Man's cheek.  Su Man did not even blink. Firstly, in terms of agility, he was no match for Ye Wei and could not escape. Secondly, such scenes of throwing oneself into his arms were too many, and he had become numb to them.  The man with black hair and a silver band was noble and cold. He slowly put down the dossier in his hand, and his cold and compelling gaze swept over Ye Wei, "If you want to seduce someone, at least dress professionally."  Ye Wei burst into laughter, her amorous gaze hooking the chin of Su Man, with an ambiguous expression, "I once stripped naked and wrapped myself in your blanket, and you remained unmoved."  "Good to know," Su Man said, brushing her hand away.  Ye Wei, a beautiful woman, brazenly attacked Su Man's chest, feeling the firmness and flatness, and expressed her grievance with a pout, "When can I feel something soft? Su beauty, it's really not generous of you not to tell me that you like men, causing me to chase you in vain for a year."  "You never asked," Su Man frowned, signaling her to get up. He really disliked being in such close contact with women.  Ye Wei refused to comply, hugging Su Man's neck and giggling, "Su beauty, if you had told me you liked men, I would have changed my sex for you back then, and by now we would surely have been a heavenly match. You just tore apart a perfect marriage, how can you live with yourself?"  Facing Ye Wei's irrational behavior and the belief that repeating a fallacy a hundred times turns it into truth, Su Man was very calm, "Even if you became a man, I still wouldn't like you."  "......Beauty, it's not right to judge people by their gender," Ye Wei said indignantly.  Why was it always impossible to hook Su beauty? Ye Wei was very conflicted. I am not calm anymore!  "Stop messing around, if you have something to say, say it quickly. I'm busy," Su Man said coldly, his imposing manner spreading throughout the room, intimidating enough to make ordinary people's legs go weak. But for Ye Wei, this kind of aura was completely useless; she had experienced even more awe-inspiring presences.  "Do you know why I'm looking for you? Are you pretending to be ignorant?" Ye Wei said.  "Just speak directly, your roundabout talk won't erase your affection for him," Su Man said bluntly. Although Ye Wei had entangled him for over a year, it was mostly in jest, and he was clear about it.  After all, he had tacitly accepted Ye Wei and Eleven as friends; otherwise, why would he have let them stay at his house for so long? No matter how strong they were, if he wanted to drive the two away, there were many ways.  "What if I like him?" Ye Wei admitted straightforwardly. Her secret being exposed did not embarrass or shame her at all; she openly acknowledged it, patting Su Man's chest, "As he is now, is he two people or one?"  "What do you think?" Su Man countered, "What are you concerned about?"  "He is a member of the mafia, possibly the mastermind behind Louis. So what if I like him?" Ye Wei said, her smile tinged with self-mockery, "It might just be a plot."  Su Man raised his eyebrows. Under the night's shadows, the man was dressed in white, noble and aloof, but his eyes were clear and intelligent, "Are you worried he's plotting against you?"  "It's a reasonable deduction," Ye Wei said, pulling over a chair to sit down, "I've spent my life scheming against others, and I never planned to be schemed against."  "Ye Wei, you're done," Su Man stated calmly, his voice warmed by a hint of warmth, "You've truly fallen for him."  Ye Wei's smile faded slightly, her expression becoming a bit cruel and domineering, "Su beauty, do you think I should kill him? To avoid future troubles!"  Su Man smiled, nobly detached, "I'm certain, you won't be able to do it."  "Ridiculous, there's no one in this world I can't kill," Ye Wei also smiled, her elegance and domineering attitude apparent, her pride unabashed and wilful.  "I'm certain," Su Man said solemnly, crossing his arms, "Ye Wei, you take what you want, you plunder, what you don't want, you destroy, you've always been like this. I advise you, the stiffest tree is most easily cracked."  "Don't compare half a catty with eight taels, you're not much better," Ye Wei waved her hand, "Aren't you the same? Me, you, Eleven, Bai Ye, all of us, which one isn't like this? Take the past Ink Jade for example, he was the same."  Su Man just looked at her, not speaking. His dark eyes held a terrifying clarity that disturbed Ye Wei, "You really don't know when he will recover?"  "I don't know, such people are rare, there are no precedents to follow, even if I have encountered them before, other people's situations can't be compared with Ink Jade's," Su Man said truthfully.  "Is there a way to keep him always as Da Bai?" Ye Wei asked.  "What do you mean?"  "Keep him like this forever."  "Ye Wei, that's impossible," Su Man said gravely, his tone extremely harsh, "This temporary personality appearing now is temporary, and it won't last long. The original one is the real him; don't get confused. It's like reality and virtuality, the current personality is virtual."  "I don't care, I just ask, is there a way to keep him like this forever?" Ye Wei asked sternly.  She didn't like the current Ink Jade more than the previous one; she knew very well that the previous Ink Jade was the real Ink Jade. But what Ye Wei worried about was that once Ink Jade returned to his previous personality, their relationship would be over.  If that was the case, it was better to keep things as they were.  "Would you rather guard a shell?" Su Man was surprised. This wasn't Ye Wei's character; the Ye Wei he knew was free-spirited and wilful, and would never go to such an extreme for someone.  "It's not exactly a shell; he's quite cute now," Ye Wei said, her expression turning cold, "Can you, or can't you?"  "Can't," Su Man said decisively, "A virtual soul existing in his body for too long will devour the original self, and in the end, he will die."  Ye Wei's brows knitted together.  Will he die?  She paused her breath slightly, feeling as if a stone was pressing on her heart, heavy and annoying, always harboring an ominous premonition.  "Su Man, I have a very ominous premonition, it's not him who will die, but me. What do you think, how should I deal with it?"  "Do you want him to die, or do you want to die?"  "Nonsense, I'm only in my early twenties; I don't want to die."  "Then isn't that the end of it?" Su Man countered, and Ye Wei was taken aback.  "Ok!" Ye Wei smiled, a hint of murderous intent flickering across her lips, "Understood."  She turned and left the laboratory.  As soon as she left, Bai Ye entered. Su Man's gaze darkened, cold and sharp as the coldest black iron, "What are you here for?"  "There's the latest virus analysis data from Rome," Bai Ye replied calmly, glancing in the direction where Ye Wei had left, "Are you sure you're not trying to break up a loving couple?"  "Lovers ought to be beaten," Su Man replied.  Bai Ye, "......"  Ye Wei sat alone in the courtyard, silent and brooding. She knew she shouldn't have gone to find Su Man, her mood extremely heavy. She had never been so hesitant in her life. She looked up at the moon in the sky and felt even more irritable in her heart.  Ink Jade, Ink Jade...  What should she do with him?  Ye Wei was also unclear about her own thoughts now. If Ink Jade reverted to his previous self, then they would be enemies. There might even be a major battle.  She was excited at the thought of the past when the two fought to the death, but also a bit helpless.  If he always remained Da Bai, then it would be unfair to them. As Su Man said, even life would become unreal.  Ye Wei didn't want that, and what she wanted even less was that if Da Bai's recent behavior was just an act, what kind of scenario would that be?  Ye Wei knew herself well; she would not show mercy to enemies, even if this enemy was Ink Jade.  Kill him? Unable to do it?  Su Man indeed had a pair of penetrating eyes that saw everything clearly. If she and Ink Jade were to fight, she would go all out.  But if it really came to killing him, could she do it? The incident at the beach was a living example.  If she were to kill him, she should do it now. She was very concerned about his behavior these past few days. If he reverted to the previous Ink Jade, she might not have the chance to kill him in this lifetime.  It was a sin they created, and they should end it themselves.  "Eleven, if it were Elder Ink, would you kill him?" Ye Wei suddenly asked.  Eleven coldly said, "Whatever I say won't count; you decide for yourself, so I don't mislead you."  "That means you would," Ye Wei smiled, her heart clear, "It's really tough, how can I bring myself to harm such an innocent Ink Jade?"  "......"  Ye Wei, you've really fallen too deep.  "Elder Ink has gone missing for so many days, where could he have gone?" Ye Wei muttered to herself, finding it very unusual, and worrisome, "You said that back on the beach, he almost dropped his gun for Ink Jade, willing to give up his life. Now that Ink Jade is in our hands, he has disappeared without a trace. Isn't that strange? He loves Ink Jade so much, it doesn't make sense for him to ignore him like this."  "I also find it strange," Eleven said, narrowing her eyes coldly, "Not just you, I also have a bad premonition."  As assassins, their intuition was the sharpest.  Ye Wei and Eleven exchanged glances, neither speaking much. After sitting for a while, Ye Wei went back to her room.  Ink Jade was playing with a computer on the bed. Ye Wei's brows knotted; she had never seen Ink Jade play with a computer these past few days. Seeing Ye Wei come in, Ink Jade cheerfully raised a smiling face, "Wife, you're back, come and give me a kiss."  Ye Wei smiled and sat down beside him, kissing his lips, "What are you playing?"  "Games," Ink Jade said, showing her his achievements like a treasure, "I defeated the monster."  "Awesome," Ye Wei smiled. It was indeed a game screen; her heart that was tense also relaxed.  This little idiot, she looked at Ink Jade sideways, his stunning face, and innocent smile.  Just like a child.  Who would actually have the heart to harm a child?  "Wife, why are you looking at me like that?" Ink Jade felt Ye Wei's gaze, paused the game, and asked curiously, his gaze somewhat blank. What's wrong with his wife?  "Nothing," Ye Wei replied casually, collapsing onto the bed.  This little idiot, why do your eyes have to be so innocent?  "Wife, are you very sad?" Ink Jade lay beside Ye Wei, his gaze a bit fierce, "Who bullied my wife? Tell Da Bai, and Da Bai will tear him to pieces."  An angel, instantly turning into a demon.  "Only my wife has the right to bully others, no one has the right to bully my wife," Ye Wei raised her hand, "Do I look sad to you?"  Damn, little idiot, do you know what sadness is?  A person without a heart, where does the sadness come from?  "You look sad," Ink Jade insisted stubbornly, "Wife, do you really like that Su Man?"  "Yes."  "What about me? What about Da Bai?"  "You're different," Ye Wei laughed and replied, patting his puffed cheeks, "Stop pouting, why do you care about Su Man?"  "I don't want you to like him."  "I also like third brother, Eleven, third sister-in-law, Ning Ning, there are so many people I like," Ye Wei raised her hand, watching Ink Jade's angry gaze, she found it amusing.  "Wife, you didn't mention me," Ink Jade's gaze looked particularly aggrieved, clutching Ye Wei's sleeve like a coquettish dog.  "Enough, I'm going to wash my face, I'll talk to you later," Ye Wei bounced off the bed and entered the bathroom.  Ink Jade unhappily pouted, tapping a few keys on the keyboard, and the game screen suddenly switched to another 3D image.  Drinking? Why did brother let him drink?  Ink Ye typed on the keyboard, after drinking, your wife will love you more.  Ink Jade was puzzled. Is that so?  Elder Ink: Be good, trust your brother.  Ink Jade's gaze turned to the side where two glasses of red wine were placed. These were delivered by the maid just now, and his wife never let him drink.  Curiously, he picked it up...  Ye Wei came out of the bathroom and immediately felt a change in the air. The room was carved with ice jade, exceptionally cool, but she felt her heart turn half cold. Ink Jade was sitting on the edge of the bed, slowly putting down the wine glass...  When did they have wine here? Ye Wei was shocked but saw Ink Jade look up, his pair of lustrous purple eyes, cold, grim, and exuding an eerie aura all over.  Ye Wei was still for three seconds, then she raised her usual flirtatious smile, "Hey, Ink Jade beauty, you awake?" Chapter 375: The Virus Acts Up Prematurely  Mo Jue slowly got up, his tall figure as if soaked in a layer of night, creating an overwhelming pressure. The already cool room felt as if a gust of icy snow had swept through, filled with danger. It was a tense and sharp atmospheric pressure, as if it wanted to slice a person into pieces inch by inch.  Ye Wei's smile became more and more enchanting, but there was a fierce murderous intent in her eyes, an indescribable cold ruthlessness and hostility, and a hint of complex determination. Paired with that smile, Ye Wei seemed like a poppy perched on the edge of a cliff. Beautiful, yet dangerous.  The two confronted each other without speaking, as if competing in a battle of auras, their equally beautiful and dangerous gazes fiercely colliding midair, sparking intense flames.  This feeling was all too familiar.  It was just like that time in the underground sewer, where both were ruthless, merciless, wanting to drive the other to death.  Mo Jue, you also want to kill me, don't you?  They were of the same kind. Since she had the intention to kill Mo Jue, she understood that the real Mo Jue would not spare her life either. It was mutual.  "Where is this?" Mo Jue asked word by word, his voice ice-cold. His memory still lingered on the island, the scene where Ye Wei hit him with a rum bottle. For the past seven days, all memories were blank to him.  He couldn't remember the things that happened when he was Da Bai (Big White).  However, based on his keen observation and amazing deduction skills, he knew that Ye Wei had escaped danger, and it was he who had helped her. Otherwise, on that island, even if Shi Yi (Eleven) were unharmed, the two of them couldn't have escaped from the island.  He knew that once he drank alcohol, he would become obedient to the first person he saw, so Mo Ye (Mo Jue's older brother) never let him touch alcohol. From his birth until now, he had only become a fool on rare occasions, and three other times were when Mo Lao Da (the eldest Mo) thought he looked cute when white, letting him drink. There was also once when they caused trouble as kids, Mo Lao Da had him drink and then act coquettishly towards their master.  Apart from these five times, this was the sixth.  Mo Jue knew all too well what kind of person Ye Wei was; she would definitely use him relentlessly, and his older brother would definitely spare Ye Wei and Shi Yi for the time being to protect him.  "Saudi Arabia, Riyadh."  Ye Wei smiled seductively, her voice like silver bells, "Mo Jue the beauty, do you remember nothing?"  This was an affirmative sentence. No matter how well he hid it, he revealed his traces once he spoke.  He doesn't remember, how truly...  Ye Wei was aggrieved. Although she felt she had oppressed Mo Jue more, in the past seven days, she had been extremely kind to him, hugging and kissing at will, almost to the point of pouncing on the bed.  She was rarely this kind-hearted, this gentle, and he actually didn't remember?  Ye Wei was very unsettled. Mo Jue coldly said, "No need!"  "No need?" Ye Wei raised an eyebrow. She didn't hear wrong, did she? The smile on the woman's face became colder, already tight with anger.  Mo Jue looked at her deeply, "I don't need these memories."  Ye Wei's eyes turned cold, and the flames in her eyes grew fiercer. She too smiled, "Is it unnecessary? You've just had a dream. Upon waking there are no traces, for me, it can't even be counted as a dream, naturally, there's no need to remember."  Mo Jue's gaze darkened, the curtains fluttered, and the entire spacious room was filled with a fierce murderous intent.  The atmosphere was tense, like a taut string.  Suddenly, Mo Jue moved, his figure swiftly like a specter, and in a blink, he was in front of Ye Wei. His five fingers spread out, aiming directly for Ye Wei's throat at an extremely fast speed. A gust of wind swept through, and Ye Wei repeatedly retreated, stepping on the wall to borrow strength and flipped over, landing behind Mo Jue. She turned around and kicked at Mo Jue's spine.  Mo Jue discerned the direction by the wind without looking back, and with a flick and pull, he tossed Ye Wei against the wall like an eagle discarding a chick.  Damn, that was ruthless!  Ye Wei turned in mid-air, and without giving her a moment to breathe, Mo Jue's palm was already on its way. Ye Wei propped her palm against the wall, kicking the wall repeatedly to avoid Mo Jue's palm wind, and grabbed the iron handle of a crystal lamp, gracefully spinning and kicking at Mo Jue, forcing him to retreat.  Ye Wei took the opportunity to land, kicking up a wooden chair in the room towards Mo Jue, following up without giving him a chance to react. However, Mo Jue's fist met the chair, and the massive impact force collided, shattering the chair to pieces.  Splinters flew everywhere.  His fist collided with Ye Wei's incoming fist, and in that instant, Ye Wei felt her wrist go numb, a sharp pain in her tiger's mouth. Her other hand opened, fiercely pressing and grabbing up along Mo Jue's arm, attempting to trap him with a reversal.  But Mo Jue easily turned his body, holding her in his arms with her back against him.  "You can't beat me." Mo Jue's voice was heavy, stating a fact without emotion.  His hot breath sprayed between Ye Wei's neck, the most familiar scent to her in these seven days. Ye Wei smiled faintly, "Then let's try and see who has the crueler heart."  As soon as she finished speaking, her elbow struck backward, which Mo Jue stopped with his hand, but suddenly felt a sharp pain in his other wrist. Ye Wei had twisted and turned, kicking fiercely at his head.  Caught off guard, Mo Jue was hit squarely, his body slamming hard against the wall. Ye Wei tapped her foot, the chair rose, she caught it, and smashed it hard at Mo Jue.  Mo Jue protected his head with both hands as the chair crashed onto his arms and broke apart.  Only a chair leg remained.  Made of iron and copper.  "Damn, Su Mei Ren (Beautiful Person Su), you're so rich yet you use counterfeit goods." The chair was too fragile; it broke so easily, definitely a counterfeit. Ye Wei tossed the wooden stick in her hand, and with a swing of her fist, she smashed it hard onto Mo Jue's handsome face.  Before she could enjoy punching him twice, Mo Jue caught her wrist and pulled her forward fiercely. Their positions switched instantly, and Ye Wei was pressed against the wall by Mo Jue, who punched her mercilessly without any consideration, landing four or five punches on her chest and abdomen.  "Playing tough?" Mo Jue's voice was dark as he ignored Ye Wei spitting out blood and raised another punch, landing it hard on her abdomen. Ye Wei vomited a mouthful of fresh blood, her face instantly pale as a sheet, feeling as if her organs had shifted, burning with pain.  The pain was unbearable...  Compared to their first fight in the sewer, Mo Jue was even more ruthless and faster this time, proving with actions that he was crueler than her, so she shouldn't try to play tough with him.  Ye Wei wiped the blood from the corner of her lips, an enchanting smile curling up, like a rose that lost its luster but stubbornly bloomed with her beauty, tenaciously emitting her charm, proud even in withering splendor.  "Why did you stop?" The beautiful Ye Wei smiled exquisitely, raising her hand and scraping it hard towards Mo Jue's face. He dodged by tilting his head, and Ye Wei followed through with another hand, her blood-stained palm hitting Mo Jue's face hard.  Mo Jue's eyes darkened, and Ye Wei laughed lightly, "This punch, this slap, all our interactions in these seven days, let's write them off. Neither of us owes the other."  He paused, and Ye Wei smiled. Enchanting and unparalleled, Mo Jue realized that during the fight, Ye Wei's palm wind had reached his chest, slapping it hard. Mo Jue stumbled back several steps.  Blood spilled from the corners of his mouth, and raising his eyes, he swept a cold glance. Ye Wei's palm wind came again, hitting his chest several times, not holding back at all, clearly intending to beat him to death.  Extremely ruthless.  Though she wore a smile, it was a suffocatingly dangerous one.  "Ye Wei!" Mo Jue, who was always sparing of words, was also angered, his body swiftly jumping up. The two fierce individuals crazily scuffled together.  It was a very clumsy way of fighting, as if both had forgotten their excellent martial arts, resembling a street brawl, all attack and no defense, an exchange of punches and slaps.  They fought like wild beasts, roaring and scuffling. The room's furniture was scattered and broken, none intact, looking like the aftermath of an earthquake.  Both were battered and bruised, here a bruise, there a purple mark, too ghastly to behold, especially Ye Wei, like a bloodied broken doll. But she seemed to have endless strength, stubbornly confronting Mo Jue, not showing any sign of weakness.  Such a commotion had already alarmed Bai Ye, Su Man, and Shi Yi, along with Ye San Shao, Cheng An Ya, and Xiao Nai Bao who had returned with them.  When they arrived, Ye Wei was on top of Mo Jue, punching him repeatedly with a vicious force that Bai Ye and Ye San Shao felt horrified watching. Suddenly, Mo Jue kicked hard at her abdomen, and Ye Wei was about to fall back onto a pile of broken glass. Shi Yi was about to move forward to catch her, but Mo Jue was quicker, pulling her hand skillfully, and both stood up from the ground.  As soon as they stabilized, they both punched out, hitting each other hard and fiercely, and both stepped back.  Shi Yi supported her waist, and Ye Wei managed to stand upright. Both were panting, looking disheveled.  Mo Jue's face, beautiful as a celestial being, was beaten to a sorry state, and Ye Wei wasn't much better off.  Everyone knew Mo Jue had returned to his original self by his expression.  Truly a world of difference.  "You two are really intense." Bai Ye's voice was light, the first time he saw Ye Wei beaten like this, Bai Ye truly thought it was a spectacle, definitely a spectacle.  Although he had the intention to watch the drama, his fists were clenched, ready to fight at any moment.  Ye Wei smiled seductively, like a blood-stained rose, "Mo Jue the beauty, I can't beat you, but how about a group fight?"  Mo Jue snorted, "You can try if you want?"  "Big White brother, no... Mo Jue, you're quite arrogant. Even if we overlook Wei Wei, just Shi Yi and I, you won't be able to leave this estate." Bai Ye laughed coldly, "As long as Wei Wei is willing."  Shi Yi snorted, "He won't be able to leave."  He dared to beat Wei Wei to this state; he can't think of leaving.  Cheng An Ya suddenly suggested, "Ah Chen, you go fight him. If you can't beat him, he still dies."  The virus, what a good weapon.  Bai Ye gave a thumbs up, "Good idea."  But Ye San Shao looked towards Ye Wei.  Suddenly, a tear gas grenade came through the broken window, shooting into the room. The glass shattered instantly, and white smoke rose within the room. Everyone quickly left the room, closing the door behind them.  When they entered again, there was no one left.  "Mo Lao Da is here." Xiao Nai Bao said. Since Mo Jue had disappeared, chasing him would be futile.  Shi Yi's brow furrowed, and Ye Wei suddenly clutched her abdomen, vomiting another mouthful of fresh blood, fainting in Shi Yi's arms.  "Wei Wei..." Ye San Shao and Cheng An Ya rushed forward in panic but dared not touch her, extremely anxious.  Ye San Shao looked at Bai Ye, "Bai Ye..."  "Let's go to my room first." Shi Yi said, and Bai Ye carried her to Shi Yi's room.  Ye San Shao wanted to follow and check, but Xiao Nai Bao entered Ye Wei's room. Ye San Shao and Cheng An Ya, fearing for their son's safety, could only stay behind.  Xiao Nai Bao avoided the debris and wood chips on the floor and jumped onto the bed.  "Ning Ning, what are you doing?" Ye San Shao asked in a deep voice, curious.  Everyone looked at the computer screen.  Mo Jue: Drinking?  Mo Lao Da: After drinking, your wife will love you even more.  Mo Jue: Is that so?  Mo Lao Da: Be good, trust your brother.  Ye San Shao's eyes twitched, and Miss Cheng asked the heavens silently, is this the so-called abduction?  "Damn, Mo Lao Da is too talented, just like that he summoned Mo Jue back?" This is obviously a blatant abduction.  The struggle between the big grey wolf and the little white rabbit.  Clearly, the little white rabbit lost.  "Mo Lao Da, truly Mo Lao Da." Xiao Nai Bao stroked his chin, his hands flying over the keyboard, and suddenly the screen seemed to crash, a flood of English scrolling rapidly.  Finally, it stopped at one place.  "Daddy, do you remember when we just came back and saw a car parked outside?" Xiao Nai Bao suddenly asked.  Ye San Shao nodded.  "Mo Lao Da is right there."  Ye San Shao was about to say something when suddenly his arm experienced a sharp pain, followed by pain in the liver area, as if fine needles were stabbing his liver. His limbs began to hurt severely, spasming, and he suddenly collapsed on the bed, convulsing.  "Ah Chen..."  "Daddy..."  "Go call Su Man quickly." Cheng An Ya said urgently, and Xiao Nai Bao jumped off the bed and ran out quickly.  "Ah Chen, hold on, it will be okay." Cheng An Ya wasn't sure if she was speaking to him or to reassure herself, her uneasiness growing, always fearing that she might lose him.  Her hands trembling with fear, Cheng An Ya's face was pale.  Didn't Su Man say it would act up tomorrow? Why did it happen earlier?  "Ah..." Ye San Shao suddenly screamed, his forehead's veins bulging, his delicate features twisting together as if bearing inhuman pain, and after reaching his limit... he fell into a coma. Chapter 376 Untitled  Ye Sanshao's virus acted up ahead of time, causing Cheng Anya to panic and feel as if she were sitting on pins and needles. She originally wanted to accompany Ye Sanshao, but Su Man suggested that it would be better for her not to go to the laboratory. Su Meiren always spoke with an irresistible authority, and even though Cheng Anya was worried and panicked, she listened to him and did not rush to the laboratory.  "Mummy, don't worry, Daddy will be fine," the little bun comforted Cheng Anya. His small, tender face bore a calmness and determination uncharacteristic of his age. He smiled elegantly, as if nothing had happened, impressively composed.  "Baby, Mummy isn't that helpless. There's no need for you to comfort me now, it's all right." Miss Cheng understood her son best. She smiled and asked him not to worry, although she was very concerned.  However, no matter how worried she was, she would still consider her son and not get so flustered that she couldn't even care for her son's emotions. If she were to panic, wouldn't it be embarrassing for her to be comforted by the little bun, who was also scared and worried? Hasn't she always been the most valiant mummy to the little bun?  Mother and son went together to see Ye Wei, who was seriously injured and unconscious. Bai Ye had already examined her and instructed someone to prepare medicine, and also administered painkillers to her.  Cheng Anya felt a little heartache looking at Ye Wei. She was so badly injured. Bai Ye's expression was calm, "The injury is severe for an ordinary person, but for Ye Wei, it's nothing serious. She'll recover in a few days."  "This isn't considered serious?" Cheng Anya was astonished. Would it only be serious if someone was beaten to death?  In Ye Wei's room, there were drips of fresh blood, and her clothes were also stained with blood. It was apparent she had been beaten until she vomited blood. To have caused Ye Wei to be seriously injured to the point of unconsciousness was already a very severe injury.  "It's all right, she'll be fine after a few days," Bai Ye said with a light laugh, as Shi Yi carefully applied medicine to her.  "What kind of deep hatred do they have with each other, that they fight so fiercely as if trying to kill each other? It's not necessary, right?" Bai Ye stroked his chin, pondering seriously, feeling that the situation was very strange. Was Mo Yu angry out of embarrassment?  "When have they not fought like it's a matter of life and death?" Shi Yi said coldly with a snort, now more curious about why Mo Yu suddenly got better. It was too sudden, "Bai Ye, when do you think she'll wake up?"  "She should be awake by tomorrow morning," Bai Ye said, poking Shi Yi's shoulder and asked, "Shi Yi, did Wei Wei really fall for it?"  "What do you think?"   "Did she fall for Big White Brother, or for the beauty Mo Yu?" Bai Ye was more curious about this issue.  The little bun tilted his head, pondering for a moment, "Probably for the beauty Mo Yu?"  "Why?" Shi Yi and Bai Ye asked in unison. Bai Ye thought to himself, Ning Ning baby, you also understand what it means to fall in love? The times are advancing too fast.  "It's a feeling," said the little bun. Mo Yu's personality is more appealing to Ye Wei. And Big White? Because it's Mo Yu, after he turned into an idiot, Ye Wei would willingly follow him. If it were someone else, she would have shaken him off long ago. When all is said and done, it's still because it's Mo Yu.  "Poor Wei Wei," Bai Ye looked at her injuries, feigned a sigh, crossed his arms and laughed, casual and free, "I'm a bit looking forward to seeing how Wei Wei will win over such a formidable beauty as Mo Yu."  Cheng, who had been silent, couldn't help but speak up, "I've never understood, Big White and Mo Yu, is there a difference? Aren't they the same person?"  "Mummy, it's almost the same, isn't that too much?" the little bun retorted. Bai Ye agreed, and so did Shi Yi. They never regarded them as the same person.  One devil, one angel. Different races, different factions, they cannot be compared.  "No, but your daddy, occasionally he's also very serious, and sometimes he's an idiot, isn't he? People have many sides to their personality, so why can't Mo Yu?" Cheng Anya said with a smile, sharing her view, "It's all the same person."  "Not the same."  "The same."  "Mummy, three against one, the minority is subordinate to the majority. You lost, stop struggling," said the little bun with a smile, looking like a little gentleman from the upper class of England, endearing to no end.  "......" Cheng Anya was speechless, damn, that was too undemocratic.  As if seeing what Cheng Anya was thinking, the little bun smiled again, "Mummy, democratic choice, have you ever seen when it was truly democratic? You say society is harmonious, but when has society ever been harmonious?"  Bai Ye and Shi Yi raised their thumbs up, strong, just one word.  Cheng Anya was aggrieved, "You're a grown man, you shouldn't bully a weak woman like this."  The little bun, "......um......"  The group chatted and laughed as they left Shi Yi's room. Bai Ye said with a smile, "They really are an extraordinary mother and son."  "Their whole family is extraordinary," Shi Yi succinctly commented. Every single one of them is an extraordinary freak.  "Mr. Su, the master asks you to go to the laboratory," a maid came hurriedly to invite Bai Ye, and everyone was startled. Bai Ye nodded and went to the laboratory with her.  "Ning Ning, what's wrong?"  "Su Man asked Bai Ye to go to the laboratory," explained the little bun. Cheng Anya's heart sank. Could it be that Ah Chen's condition has worsened? Her heart thumped wildly, and Cheng Anya's face instantly turned extremely pale.  She sat alone in the courtyard, and the little bun originally wanted to accompany her, but it was already very late, and Cheng Anya asked him to go back to sleep. The little bun could only return to his room to rest.  It was also very hot in the evening in Liya, with almost no wind, and the outdoor temperature was unbearably high. Even wearing a short-sleeved shirt would feel too hot. However, Cheng Anya's limbs were unexpectedly cold, with a thin layer of cold sweat on her forehead, and she felt no warmth at all.  Cold. A kind of cold that seeped out from inside to outside, extremely uncomfortable. This feeling was like when Louis told her that she had a virus in her body, and they were waiting for Ye Sanshao to come. It was very frightening.  The night grew heavier, and it was already late. She wanted to go to the laboratory to have a look several times but didn't dare to get close. She knew very well what the virus looked like when it acted up. When it happened to her, it was unbearably painful, and she always felt it was very hard to endure. But she didn't suffer long before Louis would inject her with a reagent to relieve the pain. However, she had seen with her own eyes how Zhang Bo hit his head against the wall until it was bloody in that small house because the pain was too much and chose to kill himself.  The more she thought of Zhang Bo's tragic state before his death, the colder Cheng Anya felt, her heartbeat sped up, and that ominous premonition once again surged in her heart.  The night was very quiet, with only the sound of water spraying from the fountain in the courtyard. She used to find it soothing, but tonight it made her feel irritable.  She walked in the courtyard for a while, then sat down again, crossed her arms in thought, looking particularly serene, as if she had merged into the night, quiet as if she didn't exist.  After a while, she suddenly stood up, as if she had made some decision, and headed towards the direction of the laboratory.  The closer she got, the more terrifying it felt. She was afraid to hear Ye Sanshao's howling, but unexpectedly, it was very quiet. Cheng Anya reassured herself that maybe it was nothing. Bai Ye's medical skills were so high, and Su Man was a virus expert. This wasn't like when Zhang Bo was ill; maybe there was a turning point. She shouldn't scare herself.  She resolutely opened the door to the laboratory and walked straight in.  Bai Ye was recording and studying the data on the screen, the first to notice Cheng Anya. He raised an eyebrow, "Anya, why are you here?"  Su Man was experimenting with two reagents, not even lifting his head, and was analyzing the combination with a microscope, very focused and oblivious to anything else. Cheng Anya said softly, "Continue with your work, I won't disturb you. I'll just accompany him."  Bai Ye glanced at Ye Sanshao on the operating table and nodded.  The laboratory wasn't very large, but the equipment was complete. Cheng Anya felt it was like a modern research center, as if it was a scene only seen in movies.  On the operating table, Ye Sanshao was in isolation clothing, wearing an oxygen mask, and his limbs were shackled with handcuffs and leg irons. His arms, chest, thighs, calves, and even his head were pierced with many needles, connected to several bottles of liquid Cheng Anya did not understand, which steadily flowed into his body.  Cheng Anya lowered her eyes and held his hand, but unexpectedly found a pool of blood on the floor. Following her gaze towards her feet, there was also a large patch of fresh blood on the floor. Cheng Anya looked at his wrist, where the handcuffs tightly clasped.  Due to struggling, there were two obvious wounds on his wrist, bleeding profusely.  She suddenly bit her lower lip, holding back the tears in her eyes, imagining how he had struggled and how he had hurt himself. Without looking, there would probably be wounds on his ankles as well. He must have tried to break free.  Ah Chen...  Through the isolation clothing, she held his hand. Cheng Anya looked at the unconscious Ye Sanshao, her heart aching in waves, wanting to cry but unable to shed tears. She couldn't cry; he must get better.  Evil begets evil, good begets good, the one who should be punished is Louis, not Ye Chen who has suffered all his life.   Ah Chen, don't be afraid, I will be with you, always with you. Even if we go to hell, I will be with you and never let you be alone.  Cheng Anya remembered that she once swore that from then on, she would be Ye Chen's guardian angel. But she didn't fulfill her promise, and it was because of her that he almost lost his life. What kind of guardian angel was she?  More like a disaster star.  Cheng Anya was a bit annoyed, holding Ye Sanshao's hand tightly, biting her lip to hold back the tears that wanted to come out, just quietly accompanying him.  Ye Sanshao was deeply unconscious, his pale face looking very peaceful. His breathing was very weak, his heartbeat faint, his hand slightly warm, which made Cheng Anya feel somewhat relieved.  He was still alive, and that was good.  As long as he lived for a second, she would accompany him for a second. If he lived for a day, she would accompany him for a day. Chapter 377 Untitled  Cheng An Ya had been accompanying Ye Sanshao in the laboratory until late into the night. After Ye Sanshao was given a sedative, he fell into a groggy sleep. In the research lab, there was only the sound of electronic equipment blinking and the clinking of test tubes and the reaction of reagents—very quiet indeed. She indeed fulfilled her promise. Despite the fear in her heart, she did not bother Bai Ye and Su Man, fearing that she would affect their work.  The two men, one conducting experiments and the other analyzing data, worked in perfect collaboration, exchanging information and then busying themselves with their own tasks, with hardly any conversation.  She sat quietly by Ye Sanshao's side, extremely tired yet unable to feel sleepy. She watched his face intently and occasionally looked up at Bai Ye and Su Man, gauging the progress of the situation from their expressions.  Later, Bai Ye could not stand it anymore and said, "An Ya, you should go back to rest. Ye Sanshao won't wake up after taking the sedative until we have prepared the antidote. Your staying here is not helping."  "It's okay, I'm not tired," Cheng An Ya said, insisting on staying with Ye Sanshao.  Bai Ye smiled, "I'm not worried you're tired, but I'm worried that the virus in your body will become more unstable and act up earlier."  Cheng An Ya opened her mouth but said nothing, still holding onto Ye Sanshao's hand, unwilling to let go. She knew Bai Ye was right, but she did not want to leave.  "You can't just not eat or sleep and stay with him for days and nights," Bai Ye advised, knowing that Ning Ning's mother was even more stubborn than Wei Wei and it was hard to persuade her. Seeing the stubborn look on her face, he felt that talking would be in vain.  "Just a little longer," Cheng An Ya said, wanting to stay as long as possible, as there was nothing else for her to do if she went back.  Bai Ye shook his head, allowing her to have her way, knowing that she would leave when she was tired.  He really didn't quite understand what love was, why intelligent people could also become foolish, and why they would choose such a silly act that was not at all helpful.  Bai Ye handed over the analyzed data to Su Man, just in time to exchange for Su Man's experimental data.  Su Man slammed the materials down on the table to one side, his cold gaze sweeping across the room, seemingly causing a gust of cold wind to rise. He said indifferently, "Having a woman here annoys me, it's counterproductive."  Bai Ye, "..."  Su Meiren, you're ruthless!  To say such a thing, with such an indifferent tone and an impatient and cold attitude, it seemed quite convincing. Then Bai Ye thought of his sexual orientation and fell silent. Maybe there was something to it.  Otherwise, he wouldn't avoid a beauty like Wei Wei.  Cheng An Ya slowly stood up, her lips twitching, and wanted to bang on the table in frustration, "Su Meiren, you don't have to be so gender-discriminatory."  Su Meiren's face was expressionless, with an air of 'I am gender-discriminatory, what can you do about it?', self-righteous and arrogantly proud, without any sense of chivalry.  Miss Cheng floated out of the research lab like a ghost.  She had to leave; Su Man had said he didn't want to see women around because it annoyed him. She couldn't stay, as it was a small matter that their research might be affected, but not finding the antidote was a major issue. Whether true or not, she really couldn't stay in the lab any longer.  Bai Ye gave a thumbs up, "Strong."  Su Meiren raised his brows and snorted coldly, continuing to work. Since time was urgent, Bai Ye didn't have the mood to dawdle and went back to analyzing data on the screen.  This was the most difficult disease he had encountered since he started practicing medicine; he had to pay full attention to keep up with Su Man's pace.  There was competition, which was inevitable. Su Meiren had been arrogant and presumptuous from the beginning, and his attitude of disdain for everyone was annoying. Bai Ye, known as a genius doctor, could not tolerate such disdain and was determined to make him acknowledge his abilities.  His title of genius doctor wasn't just for show.  "Su Meiren, I curse that you fall into the hands of a woman someday," Cheng An Ya muttered.  Would a lover of male romance not like women? It was her first time hearing such a thing. He must have said it on purpose to drive her away. If lovers of male romance were all gender-discriminatory, then fujoshi and fans of male romance would be so heartbroken.  The world was almost conquered by fujoshi. Thinking back on her years of dominance online, she knew many fans of male romance, each of them turning pale at the mention of it, ferocious like wolves, quite terrifying, and she herself was a genuine fan of male romance.  The feeling of being despised was really damn unpleasant.  Suddenly, an image crossed her mind. People often say that when a man and a woman are alone together, sparks fly, but what if it's just men? Especially if one of the men is gay. Bai Ye was reputable and capable, not to mention handsome and refined, which was...  Suddenly, she imagined them in a loving embrace, and Miss Cheng felt disheveled in the wind.  Ah, she must be sick to have such thoughts. Su Meiren looked like someone who would kill anyone who crossed him, with a cold and harsh appearance. Just a glance at his proud and arrogant, noble and untouchable demeanor made one feel like they were desecrating a celestial being. How could he possibly have an affair with Bai Ye?  It was his gender-discriminatory comment that had stimulated her, causing her thoughts to stray.  o(╯□╰)o。  Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, seven days passed. Ye Wei's injuries were healed, with no sign of bruising on her face, completely back to normal. Her little nephew jokingly called his aunt an indestructible cockroach, as she recovered too quickly.  She had been almost crippled by Mo Yu last time and recovered very quickly, and this time was no different.  One would expect her to feel some loss, but since waking up, Ye Wei had been all smiles, behaving as usual with no sign of anything unusual, as if she had never met Mo Yu.  She didn't mention Mo Yu or Big White Brother at all. It was as if this person had disappeared forever from her world, not worth mentioning. There were some issues with the first terrorist organization, but since they were not managers, Ye Wei and Eleven simply stayed in Liyade.  During this time, the outside world was calm, except for Melilia, where Chu Li was furiously bombing Prince William of Country R over a desert, leading the most elite air force of the first terrorist organization. Considering that Ji Wei was also in the castle, he dared not carry out a sweeping bombardment, but could only circle around with advanced munitions. Even more viciously, Chu Li, not content with half measures, poisoned the water supply near the castle, directly cutting off their source of life.  He sent the air force to circle above the castle every day, as if to say, 'I have all the time in the world to wear you down, let's see who can last longer.'  Such a barbaric and domineering approach could indeed only be done by terrorists. Given Chu Li's cunning, cutting off the water supply was already mild. If not for considering Ji Wei, the war would have been even more twisted and cruel.  On Dragon Gate's side, Lin Yixuan won the lawsuit and was released. The senior officials of City A personally confirmed it was a misunderstanding.  Tang Si's condition was also improving, and Dragon Gate had someone in charge.  On behalf of Ye Sanshao, the little baby was involved in Dragon Gate's affairs in North America, coordinating with terrorists to prepare for supporting Chu Li at any time, and dealing with the Spanish, Italian, and other governments' crackdowns and suppressions.  The baby suggested moving as much of the Middle East's power as possible to avoid the limelight, because Chu Li's actions were clearly a provocation to Country R. Whether willing or not, neighboring countries had to help, if not with people, then with condemnation.  With the recent clash with the mafia also alarming many, in short, countries came with aggressive intentions, hoping to use this opportunity to weaken the first terrorist organization's power.  Chu Li remained defiant, circling the desert daily, teasing Prince William, completely ignoring the government's encirclement and suppression, even arrogantly stating that it was a private grudge between him and Prince William, and anyone who intervened would be unlucky.  Given this person's usual behavior, most small countries indeed only dared to speak out, not take action.  During the first terrorist organization's clash with several governments, it should have been the golden opportunity for the mafia to act. The baby thought Luis would definitely mobilize the mafia to suppress the first terrorist organization and take the chance to unify the dark forces.  Unexpectedly, the mafia seemed to have disappeared. Except for a few small-scale military actions in the Middle East in cooperation with the government troops, there was no trace of the mafia's activities.  The baby was puzzled and only found out upon investigation that Luis was only trying to use the authorities for a proxy killing, hence the clash. He himself, however, stayed out of it, watching the snipe and clam fight.  Eleven said in a deep voice, "This doesn't fit Luis's usual style."  Ye Wei nodded in agreement. Although they didn't deal much with the mafia, Luis's usual style would not be so low-key. Even if he were using a proxy, he wouldn't be so quiet.  "Could it be the Mo brothers?" Cheng An Ya suddenly asked, having been discussing these matters with them for the past few days and gaining a general understanding.  "What are they trying to do then?" Ye Wei sharply pointed out the crux of the issue, and even the baby couldn't figure it out for a moment.  "Joining forces with government troops won't last long."  Ye Wei laughed enchantingly, "The commander said last night that the anti-terrorism organization has started to intervene, and government troops will soon disband. They never dreamed of it. War, that's the enemy of anti-terrorism."   Chapter 378: There's an Affair!  Little Bun was silent for a moment, recalling how the officer had blasted them in the group chat last night, and reluctantly told them to retreat quickly to the designated area to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. That feeling was indescribable, it was so delightfully chaotic. This time, it was the first terrorist organization's largest and most influential military operation in history. The counter-terrorism organization had been eager to get involved, even during the incident on Deadly Island where they tried to arrest people. This time, the threat extended to country R, which had very good relations with South American and European countries, so it was natural for them to intervene.  The most likely outcome was the dissolution of the joint government forces. If they got involved, the most likely result would be mutual destruction. To rescue country R and maintain peace, the best approach would be to dissolve the government forces and frame the whole dispute as a personal grudge over jealousy and competition for a woman between Chu Li and Prince William.  That way, the matter would come to an end, and peace could be maintained.  "It looks like it's going to take half a month. If the officer uses his connections to shake up the mafia, that would be even better," Little Bun said, touching his chin and smiling slyly. He too wanted to sit back and watch the fight between the snipe and the clam.  But as hot-tempered as the officer was, he was still very smart. It wasn't easy to scheme against him.  Eleven agreed, "If you want the officer to do something, you have to offer something of equal value. Think about whether he wants to catch someone or solve a case, otherwise you can't move him."  "The officer just likes to make a fuss. All he needs to do is say the word to Ningning for any information," Ye Wei said with a smile. "Chu Li better hurry up and win his woman over, otherwise if the mafia launches an attack, he'd be caught unprepared. Ningning, haven't you been able to find any news on the mafia?"  Little Bun touched his nose and smiled, saying, "I guess it'll take a few more days."  Ye Wei nodded, and Little Bun's lips curled into a teasing smile, his eyes sly and sparkling. "Auntie, you just want to hear about Uncle Bai's news, right?"  "I'm eagerly awaiting his news so I can make a move," Ye Wei smiled charmingly, playing with the luminous cup in her hand, appearing completely unconcerned, as if Mo Yu and Big Bai had no effect on her at all.  Cheng Anya laughed, "Weiwei, don't pretend to be strong, you won't be able to beat him."  That was the absolute truth. She had been beaten up and had only just recovered. She probably wanted to dismember Mo Yu, but strength spoke for itself, and she had to admit, Mo Yu was just too strong.  Ye Wei raised her eyebrows, her smile resplendent as a rose. She hooked her arm around Eleven's shoulder, "I have a great partner. Alone I can't beat him, but together we surely can. If a fair fight doesn't work, we'll gang up on him, right, Eleven?"  Eleven was as cold as frost and simply shook her head, "Mm, alright, we'll cooperate next time."  Cheng Anya smiled warmly, looking as fresh as a blooming lily, her pure beauty and bright eyes hiding a hint of amusement as she innocently asked, "Weiwei, don't you have a gun on you? Why do you need to fight with your hands?"  Little Bun pursed his lips and smiled. Mommy, spot on. You're always so sharp, yet you seem so harmless.  Even Eleven couldn't help but look at Ye Wei sideways. What Anya said made sense. Ye Wei was known as a sharpshooter who could use both hands to shoot with exceptional agility. Even in a fight, she could quickly draw her gun. That day, Mo Yu had no hidden weapons or firearms. If Ye Wei wanted to kill him, it would have been easy.  That day, she had seen Ye Wei's hand almost reach the gun handle, but ultimately she did not draw it. Although the movement was as quick as lightning, the many years of tacit understanding were not fake. Ye Wei knew every move in a fight like the back of her hand.  Beaten up like that and still not drawing a gun to kill – what else could that explain?  The Ye Wei they knew would rather dismember someone than take a punch. Yet she ended up being beaten half to death by Mo Yu.  Ye Wei's expression remained unchanged, her smile becoming even more enchanting, "Sister-in-law, you don't understand. I prefer to move my muscles. Close combat is the quickest way to find the opponent's weakness. This is called tactics."  Little Bun was silent. Auntie, you really have the nerve to say that after getting beaten to death. Why bother understanding tactics then?  Cheng Anya nodded as if she understood, "That's right. When you came to kill Achen, you shouldn't have shot from above. You should have looked for his weak spot up close, right?"  "Sister-in-law, you're really vicious. If Third Brother fought me, I guarantee you wouldn't recognize his face," Ye Wei said cheerfully, feigning complete innocence.  Cheng Anya laughed as well and didn't continue to question.  Ye Wei lowered her eyes and swayed the luminous cup in her hand. The wine inside swirled, and from the side, it looked like a dazzling light entered the liquid. Indeed, grape wine under the luminous cup was one of life's great pleasures.  So, whatever Mo Yu, whatever Big Bai, get lost.  In the clear wine, a pair of calm eyes were reflected.  "Has Third Brother shown any signs of waking up?" Ye Wei suddenly asked. She hadn't gone to the lab, and these past few days while recuperating, she rarely left her room.  Cheng Anya also stayed away. Ever since Su Man said that women would only annoy him and hinder his work, regardless of whether it was true or not and how worried she was, Cheng Anya was truly waiting for news and didn't disturb them in the lab.  But she knew that Third Young Master Ye had not yet awakened.  The virus was too powerful.  "Not yet. Su Man said that until the antidote is developed, he has to continue like this, relying on nutritional supplements, sedatives, and some other reagents I don't understand," Cheng Anya said with a gentle smile. She had gone from being worried to being calm.  "Third Brother really is plagued with misfortune," Ye Wei said with a bit of heartache. If she had to say who she loved most in this world, it definitely wasn't Big Bai or Mo Yu, but Third Young Master Ye.  Cheng Anya felt the same. Everyone understood that Third Young Master Ye's vitality was dwindling by the day. The seven-day deadline had passed, and he could only rely on these medicines to maintain his heartbeat.  Although she was heartbroken, she felt helpless. Why was it that she was fine, but Third Young Master Ye was in critical condition?  "Mommy, Auntie, I believe that Daddy will be fine," Little Bun said with an elegant smile. "With me and Mommy in the world, Daddy won't want to leave. Otherwise, if Mommy marries someone else with me, he would jump out of his coffin even as a ghost."  Ye Wei and Cheng Anya couldn't help but laugh, and even Eleven's lips curled up a little in amusement. It was indeed very much in Third Young Master Ye's style.  Originally, Cheng Anya thought that Ye Wei and Eleven must have a lot to do and suggested they leave Riyadh first, but Ye Wei insisted on staying. No matter how the outside world was in turmoil, Riyadh remained calm. Since it wasn't suitable for too many people to guard the place, the two of them took responsibility for the safety of the Ye family.  They had failed their duty last time, leading to a series of events. This time, Ye Wei and Eleven wouldn't possibly leave, as history wouldn't repeat itself on them.  Suddenly, Eleven asked, "Anya, since Louis can touch you, could his blood be the antidote?"  "Ba Ye also mentioned this issue. If we analyze his blood, it might be faster. But, Louis must have thought of this too. He's disappeared without a trace, and we simply can't find him," Cheng Anya said, still feeling creeped out when mentioning Louis.  "Where could he have gone? I always feel like this is the calm before the storm, and something is bound to happen."  "Mommy, don't think too much. Last time's events won't happen again. You can rest assured."  Although there weren't many people here, Su Man's mansion was impregnable. Even Mo Ye could only watch from the perimeter and couldn't get close; others couldn't even dream of coming in.  This place was like a fortified manor, with only exits and no entries. It was completely safe.  "I'm not worried about that. Anyway, I can't explain it."  "Sister-in-law, I'm actually curious about something. Why hasn't the virus on you acted up?" Ye Wei squinted her eyes and asked. "Counting the days, there are only a few days left in the one-month deadline. Even if it's not the death deadline, the virus should have acted up already."  "I don't know either."  Cheng Anya herself was puzzled. These past few days, she was fine, completely normal. Su Man and Ba Ye were both devoted to saving Third Young Master Ye and hadn't paid much attention to her.  After all, if she had an outbreak, she would be lying on the operating table just like Third Young Master Ye, either waiting for death or waiting to wake up.  "Actually, I find it strange too." Little Bun smiled and then adorably raised his index finger. "Of course, Mommy, I don't want you to have an outbreak."  "Sister-in-law, you must be a mutant." Everyone laughed.  While they were joking, they heard footsteps. Ba Ye and Su Man came out. The two had stayed in the lab for two days. There was a bit of weariness between their brows. When they came back, Cheng Anya and the others immediately surrounded them.  Su Man's complexion looked really bad. Despite looking exhausted, his cheeks were slightly flushed. The flames leaping in his cold eyes made Ye Wei involuntarily pinch her own arm. Huh, no fantasy? Even the beautiful Su Man could change color. What's going on?  She vaguely felt that she had missed a good show.  "Su Man, is the antidote ready?"  "Ba Ye, how is Achen?"  ...  "Tomorrow," Su Man said succinctly.  Ba Ye waved his hand, took a seat, and took a sip of tea before saying, "We're missing the last ingredient. Success or failure depends on tomorrow."  Cheng Anya's heart, which was hanging by her throat, finally settled. She thought their expressions meant that hope was slim and didn't know how long they would have to wait, but it turned out to be good news.  Her pale face flushed with color, and her eyes almost teared up. Although she had acted normal these past few days in front of Little Bun, only she knew how worried she was at night, always looking in the direction of the lab.  She prayed to God more than a hundred times, only hoping for his safety.  "That's great."  Little Bun's face brightened with relief, and the child's nervous emotions also eased.  Su Man rubbed his head, his expression relaxed a bit, and his tone softened, "Worried sick, huh?"  Ye Wei couldn't help but be annoyed. It's true that children are favored. Su Man had never spoken to her so tenderly. She despised Little Bun, this latecomer. Ye Wei was very conflicted.  "Worried." Little Bun grinned, glanced at Su Man, and then at the very calm Ba Ye beside him. He sensed something was odd, "Su Man, Ba Ye, if it's good news, why did you come in with such scary expressions?"  Something's not right.  Ba Ye opened his mouth to say something, but Su Man swept a sharp glare over, and Ba Ye raised his hand, smiled, and made a zipping gesture over his mouth, continuing to drink tea.  Everyone was puzzled. Ye Wei's eyes rolled between Ba Ye and Su Man's faces. In fact, everyone including Little Bun had overlooked the slap mark on Ba Ye's face.  The hall fell into a deathly silence.  Su Man gave a cold snort, his eyebrows sharp as knives, and that cold aura was truly frightening.  Ba Ye smiled, and everyone thought Su Man was about to kill him next. Who knew he just swept a cold glance over Ba Ye and left with a flick of his sleeve.  Everyone looked at his retreating back, exchanging bewildered glances.  What happened?  Little Bun hopped into Ba Ye's arms, his small palm touching the slap mark, his dark eyes blinking. "Ba Ye, what happened to your face?"  "Swatting mosquitoes. The mosquitoes in Riyadh's summer are much bigger," Ba Ye said calmly, putting down the teacup and rubbing Little Bun's head. Little Bun was very frustrated. Why did everyone like to touch his head?  Ye Wei squinted her eyes and hummed. Little Bun compared his own fingers with the slap mark, very practically verifying, "Ba Ye, your fingers don't seem that thin."  Everyone nodded in agreement, their eyes fixed on Ba Ye's face.  They all had the ultimate expression of seeking the truth from Ba Ye.  Knowing that the virus was about to have an antidote, Cheng Anya's heart was also relieved, and she couldn't help but pay attention to the beautiful slap mark on Ba Ye's face. It was hit just right, with a lot of force.  One could tell at a glance that the hand was beautiful, slender, and delicate.  "Stop pretending, it was Su Man who hit you, right?" Ye Wei laughed with a hint of danger. The expression seemed to be gnashing teeth, very conflicted.  "Why did he hit you?"  "Ba Ye, what did you do?"  "You didn't indecently assault him, did you?"  ...  Everyone expressed their doubts almost unanimously.  Ba Ye calmly put down the teacup, "So tired, I'm going to sleep."  Everyone watched Ba Ye's graceful retreating back, then thought of Su Man's cold and compelling beauty, and they all sensed a hint of an affair.  Ye Wei was aggrieved, clenching her fist, "Ba Ye, you better not go gay aaaah..." Chapter 379: Pregnant  Ye Wei, the beauty, was showing her fangs and claws, really wanting to rush forward and tear Bai Ye into shreds like hand-pulled beef. Her gorgeous features were twisted together, looking particularly terrifying, like a vengeful ghost. It seemed as though Little Bun could even see the ghostly figure of Ye Wei with her flowing hair.  "Vivi, stay calm, stay calm, don't freak out," Miss Cheng said with a light smile, but the teasing in her eyes couldn't be hidden. Anyone could see that the beautiful Vivi had lost her composure.  Eleven looked up at the sky speechlessly; when it comes to genius, Vivi was the strongest. Fortunately, Bai Ye didn't turn his head when he heard this, truly calm, not something ordinary people could compare to.  Little Bun weakly raised his hand and asked, "Auntie, I have a question, what does 'bent' mean?"  Miss Cheng's smile twisted, stiffening for a moment.  Eleven observed from the sidelines, as unmovable as a mountain. Ye Wei turned her head and gently patted Ning Ning's head, saying with heartfelt instruction, "Good child, you're definitely not 'bent,' so you don't need to know."  Little Bun tilted his head adorably, smiling with an innocent face. Although he didn't know the specific meaning of 'bent,' he knew it certainly wasn't a pure word, judging by the reactions of the women.  "Mommy said learning has no end."  "Darling Ning Ning, you should know that not 100% of what elders teach is correct; otherwise, there wouldn't be so many murderers in the world," Ye Wei said seriously.  Ah, she was not calm anymore.  Eleven shook her head, very puzzled, "Mo Jue has no influence on you at all? You still have the mood to compete with Su Man?"  This woman was becoming more and more secretive.  "Who does he think he is? How could he compare to Su the beauty? I'm really struck by this," Ye Wei lamented with a sad face, seeking sympathy, "You're all too much for not sympathizing with me."  "Do you need people's sympathy?" Cheng Anya was very eager to watch the drama, "It's normal for you to go berserk."  Indeed! Thinking about it, Ye Wei had been chasing Su Man for so long without any reaction, but Bai Ye and Su Man had only been together for a few days and it seemed like there was a hint of an illicit affair in the air. This jq (affair) was blatantly floating in front of her, naturally she felt struck.  Although Su the beauty's reaction wasn't great, at least there was a reaction, and it was such a fierce one. Would any random person stay calm in this situation? Impossible.  "Third sister-in-law, Eleven, did Su the beauty blush just now?" Ye Wei asked in confusion, her smile becoming more twisted.  "Seems like it," Miss Cheng said with more subtlety, while Eleven nodded directly; both of them looked at Ye Wei.  Ye Wei blinked her eyes and, unexpectedly to the two women, didn't go berserk but instead stroked her chin and asked, "Why?"  "What 'why'?" Ye Wei rolled her eyes, "Bai Ye likes women, right? Su Man likes men, right? So when a single man and a widower get together, the one who should be in danger is Bai Ye. So if there's a hint of an affair, it should be Bai Ye who is furious, Su the beauty should be calm. Why is it the other way around with Bai Ye calm and Su the beauty freaking out?"  "Right." Miss Cheng thought about it too, she hadn't thought about it carefully before, but after Ye Wei brought it up, she found it a bit strange, "Did Bai Ye tease Su the beauty? Otherwise, why would he get slapped?"  "Not at all." Ye Wei and Eleven denied in unison. Bai Ye wouldn't do such a thing; he didn't like men, although Su the beauty's looks could captivate many, even men might throw themselves at him.  However, Bai Ye was not so superficial. They had known each other for more than ten years, what kind of scenes hadn't they seen? They also understood Bai Ye's character, he absolutely wouldn't do such a thing. He wouldn't even tease women, let alone men.  "Then why would Bai Ye get slapped?" Cheng Anya asked again, the three women looked at each other, all with questions in their eyes.  "It should be for taking liberties that he would get slapped," Eleven said, "But Bai Ye isn't that kind of person, so that assumption is negated."  "Then it's impossible." Miss Cheng tilted her head, very puzzled.  "Could it be that Bai Ye directly exercised his rights over Su the beauty on the spot?" Ye Wei said something shocking, and everyone was stunned by her words. If Bai Ye wouldn't tease, how could he possibly skip the steps and just pounce on someone? It's a matter of procedure.  "If Su Man had been 'had,' it would definitely be the other way around, she would have 'had' Bai Ye and then sent him to see the King of Hell. Would she only slap him once?" Eleven said coldly, deeply dissecting Su the beauty's twisted personality.  "Besides, Ye Chen was also in the lab at the time." The three women fell silent once again, with Little Bun weakly raising his hand, "Aren't you supposed to consider that I'm here too?"  "Why are you still here? When you hear us discussing these adult topics, you should immediately leave," Miss Cheng glared at him righteously, as if it was his fault for hearing and it had nothing to do with them.  "Exactly."  "Agreed."  Little Bun, "......"  Women, indeed, are very frightening creatures. Still, his Nono is the best.  "Ah, I can't stay calm anymore. Why is my rival in love a man..."  Ye Wei completely lost it and turned to head toward the central courtyard. Her figure seemed to float over, looking particularly horrifying.  Dinner time.  Everyone gathered, Miss Cheng, Ye Wei, Eleven, and Little Bun's four pairs of eyes kept drifting between Bai Ye and Su Man, their expressions a bit conflicted.  Miss Cheng was a senior lover of Danmei (boys' love) and was extremely content now that the antidote was in sight. Naturally, she had the leisure to enjoy the affairs of others. In fact, from her many years of experience in the Danmei world, Bai Ye and Su Man were definitely a well-matched pair. Su Man was white as snow, cold and proud, while Bai Ye was graceful and elegant.  The two of them were a rare sight of good looks, standing together very eye-pleasing, very much like a match made in heaven. A pair of strong attack and strong receive type, which she liked the most.  The palm print on Bai Ye's face had faded after an afternoon, and he was now dining with a light breeze, very modestly accepting the unanimous attention of everyone. His calmness was not something ordinary people could compare to.  Ye Wei pulled her chair closer to Su Man and asked with a grin, "Su the beauty, why did you slap our Bai Ye brother?"  Bai Ye brother? Everyone shuddered, Su Man didn't lift an eyelid, "No comment."  "No comment, ah, don't be so stingy," Ye Wei clung to Su the beauty's sleeve and acted coquettishly, "Did our Bai Ye brother bully you? I'll help you beat him up. I know you can't beat him, no worries, I can."  "No need to trouble yourself." Su Man snorted coldly. Indeed, he was not as skilled as those special agents, but to put someone down, Su Man had plenty of ways without relying on force.  "It's no trouble, no trouble. Actually, I've found him very unpleasant to look at, and I've been wanting to beat him up for a long time. It's not troublesome at all," Ye Wei continued with a smile.  As Little Bun questioned the heavens for the nth time for having such an aunt, without the most shameless, only more shameless, ordinary people really don't have this kind of adaptability.  "Then please do as you wish." Regardless of what Ye Wei said, Su the beauty dismissed her with the four-word mantra, and even Ye Wei felt that the guy's mouth was too tight. It was even less likely to dig out any inside story from Bai Ye.  "You're all too much for not entertaining the public with such excitement. It's better to be happy together than alone," Ye Wei protested dissatisfied.  Eleven agreed.  Miss Cheng continued to dine, and Little Bun stayed out of the firefight to avoid collateral damage.  "Bai Ye brother, you're straight, right?" Ye Wei blinked her eyes and asked innocently, "I remember last year that Miss World was still revolving around you, a Russian beauty, ah, I even saw you kissing, you should be straight, right?"  Bai Ye paused for a moment, his brows raised slightly, "You really are omnipresent, you even saw that?"  "I just said that figure looked like you. It turns out it was," Ye Wei clapped and laughed, "Since you're straight, I'm relieved. Don't covet Su the beauty."  Bai Ye smiled without responding, and Su the beauty, unlike her outburst at noon, seemed like nothing had happened, calmly telling Miss Cheng, "You should rest early, we need to take blood samples tomorrow, don't eat anything before entering the lab."  After saying that, he stood up and left. Everyone looked at his plate, which was almost untouched.  Cheng Anya responded, asking Bai Ye, "Is the last ingredient for the medicine my blood?"  Bai Ye nodded, "Yes."  Cheng Anya felt relieved, success or failure would depend on tomorrow. Bai Ye said it, and she didn't doubt it at all. His tone was relaxed and confident; she should be half at ease.  "Third sister-in-law's blood, eh? I thought we needed Louis's blood to do it," Ye Wei pondered, "Hurry up and get well, I miss him."  "There should be an 80% chance."  "By the way, Bai Ye, why hasn't third sister-in-law's virus acted up yet? She looks almost the same as a normal person, why is third brother so serious?" Ye Wei asked curiously.  "The first virus carrier is naturally more stable than the second carrier, that's not strange. Besides, there are still several days left before the one-month deadline, I've given her a mitigating agent, which can alleviate it for more than ten days, so the virus is under control, there's no problem," Bai Ye said with a gentle smile.  "I see." Cheng Anya nodded, no outbreak was always a good thing.  Eleven looked at Bai Ye's plate, which was empty, and she raised her eyebrows, "If I remember correctly, you two haven't come out for two days, why do you eat so much, and Su the beauty eats so little? Is it because of a bad mood, no appetite, and he's ironclad?"  Ye Wei poked Bai Ye's arm, "What exactly did you do to him? It's a rare thing for Su Man to physically attack someone."  Several pairs of eyes fixed on Bai Ye's face, and Bai Ye smiled lightly, "No comment."  "Eleven, we haven't exercised for a long time." Ye Wei twisted her wrist with a threatening smile, Eleven indicated that she received the message, they could move tonight, suppress by force, see if he would speak.  Bai Ye raised his hand, he had a golden pass to avoid death, "I have to detoxify Ye San every day."  Everyone, "......"  "Then it's easy to handle, break your legs, you can still detoxify in a wheelchair, we need your brain not your legs."  "Auntie, you're ruthless!" Little Bun gave a thumbs up.  Bai Ye automatically treated these words as if they were wind by his ear. The maid served them abalone soup, sparing a portion for each, and Diana said, "This is what the princess sent to the master last time. It's very delicious. The master asked me to prepare it for everyone to taste."  Ye Wei propped her head and smiled, "Diana sister, your lips are getting sweeter and sweeter. Su Man would never instruct you to do this, it must be your idea."  "Vivi Miss is smart," Diana smiled, beneath the black veil only a pair of bright and black eyes could be seen, shy and timid, very beautiful. Although her full face was not visible, judging from these eyes, Diana was definitely a beauty.  Ye Wei smiled; Su Man liked plain tastes and didn't like seafood. Abalone, if left in the mansion, would only fatten the mice. Moreover, it was sent by the princess, it must be a good thing.  "This flavor is a bit strange," Miss Cheng fanned herself and frowned, smelling very uncomfortable.  "It's alright, very fragrant," Little Bun said.  Diana spared a bowl for everyone, and when placed in front of Cheng Anya, she suddenly felt nauseated. But because they were all there, it wasn't good to be too rude, so she could only barely hold back. The smell kept drilling into her nose and she couldn't hold back anymore, covering her mouth and rushing out of the dining room, retching non-stop...  Diana and the others were stunned, Little Bun and Ye Wei quickly put down their chopsticks and chased after her. Cheng Anya leaned against the pillar and vomited non-stop, everyone looking at each other with puzzled faces.  "Mommy, are you not feeling well?"  "Third sister-in-law, what's wrong with you?"  ...  Cheng Anya couldn't stop vomiting for a good while and finally stopped, the whole person feeling a bit floaty.  Bai Ye had a frown on his forehead, and after Cheng Anya cleaned herself up, he wanted to take her pulse. Cheng Anya smiled, "It's nothing, I may not be used to the smell."  "Give me your hand." Bai Ye smiled gently, and Cheng Anya could only extend her hand. Bai Ye took her pulse through a thin layer of paper. After a while, his brows raised, and he looked at Cheng Anya with a strange expression.  Little Bun was anxious, "Bai Ye, what's wrong with my mommy? Is the virus acting up?"  "It's not the virus." Bai Ye murmured, "She's pregnant." Chapter 380: Should We Keep the Child? Pregnant?  Cheng Anya’s eyes widened in shock, her mind went blank as if struck by lightning, leaving her at a loss. It felt as surreal as hearing about aliens invading Earth. Bai Ye also found it odd, as if he couldn't believe it. He took her pulse several times and finally confirmed it, looking at Cheng Anya with a strange look in his eyes, as if contemplating something.  "Bai Ye, are you sure you didn't get it wrong? Is Third Sister-in-Law really pregnant? They've been on the run and took two flights. If she was pregnant, the child would have been lost by now. How could it possibly still be alive?" Ye Wei also felt it was fantastical. There had been many vigorous actions along the way; was it that the child had a strong fate, or...  Shi Yi did not express an opinion, and the little milk bun, touching his chin, also pondered seriously about what kind of situation this could be.  "It's indeed a pregnancy pulse; she is pregnant," Bai Ye said definitively, looking at Cheng Anya with a bit of surprise. Cheng Anya was still in shock, sitting dazedly as if the pregnancy had nothing to do with her.  Everyone looked at each other, not knowing what to say.  The little milk bun waved his hand in front of Cheng Anya, and she finally snapped back to reality, her face a bit pale, "This child..."  Seeing her look like this, Ye Wei and the others couldn't help but think that the child might be Louis's. If it really was Louis's, that would be really... complicated. Louis coveted her and had captured her for so many days. It wouldn't be strange if he had touched her without restraint and had thoughts of doing something to her.  It seemed like the pregnancy wasn't that far along, a logical conclusion. Seeing the peculiar look on Cheng Anya's face, Ye Wei and Shi Yi couldn't help but think the worst, but the little milk bun quietly watched his mommy.  "It's been less than two weeks, about ten days or so," Bai Ye said, his expression becoming even more peculiar.  "What?" Ye Wei exclaimed, her eyes suddenly taking on a peculiar look, her lips twitching, "Third Brother isn't lustful, is he?"  Ye Wei was very quick to react, quickly thinking of the time when Ye Third Young Master contracted the virus and when they escaped. About ten days or so definitely ruled out Louis; it had to be Ye Third Young Master.  Considering that Ye Third Young Master had worn gloves the whole way to avoid physical contact with her, everyone assumed that they had collided with each other while parachuting in the desert and then contracted the virus.  But the truth seemed to be so shocking.  Ye Wei's expression easily led others to speculate, and Cheng Anya's face turned red with embarrassment. Wei Wei, aren't you being too direct?  Shi Yi also felt the situation was very shocking. For the first time, he was amused, "So it goes, 'A man's true nature,' no lies there."  Ye Wei followed suit in a well-coordinated manner, speaking in clichés, "To die under a peony is to be a romantic even in the afterlife. Third Brother... really has the guts. Brains full of lust, what an idiot..."  She finally understood what 'preferring beauty over life' meant.  "It's not what you think," Cheng Anya hurriedly waved her hands, but it seemed as if it was just as they thought. As soon as she spoke, everyone's gaze fell on her, filled with insinuation and a kind of 'no need to explain, we understand' look.  So, Miss Cheng calmed down.  Alright, since everyone thinks so, let's just leave it at that. Since Ye Third Young Master had always given off such a fierce impression, she simply stopped talking to avoid making things worse.  How could she be pregnant? Cheng Anya couldn't clearly define her feelings. There was a bit of joy, a bit of hesitation, and even a bit of fear. Getting pregnant at this time wasn't a good thing.  That time at the castle, she had been infected with the virus, and Ye Third Young Master, regardless of the consequences, did what he did without any contraception because they had to escape. They hadn't thought too much about it, and an accident had happened.  It was really a matter of life and death. Cheng Anya was very conflicted. Why was her success rate so high? Twice, both times successful? If she got pregnant every time in the future, wouldn't she set a Guinness World Record? Cheng Anya's thoughts were in disarray. Her imagination ran wild to the extent that she was unparalleled, truly powerful. She imagined a situation where a dozen children surrounded her, calling her mommy.  Cheng Anya finally understood what it meant to be 'startled into alertness,' coming back to her senses with a gulp. Too frightening.  Ye Wei, Shi Yi, Bai Ye, and the others had already been shocked by the range of emotions on her face, enjoying a silent mime show. As exciting as it was, the little milk bun weakly asked, "Mommy, what are you thinking about?"  Cheng Anya shook her head, quickly returning to her usual smile, without even blinking, "Nothing."  They didn't know the situation, so naturally, they didn't know what she was thinking about. She herself had been thunderstruck, and if she told others, they would laugh for three days and nights. Perhaps only such an extraordinary pregnant woman would think of such a mess of things upon learning of her pregnancy.  However, it wasn't a 100% hit rate either. That day, Ye Third Young Master had fought for almost a day and a night, and both of them didn't know how many times...  Cheng Anya felt psychologically balanced.  "Bai Ye, could there be any problems with the child?" Cheng Anya brushed away the messy thoughts in her mind. What she was most worried about now was the health of the child. She became pregnant in an unhealthy condition, and her body had been injected with several kinds of relief agents, which could likely harm the child. If a child was born with missing limbs or was mentally disabled, it would be better not to have them from the start.  Although it was hard to let go, how could she bring a child into the world if they weren't healthy?  "Right, could the child be infected with the virus?" Ye Wei and Shi Yi asked in unison.  Bai Ye pondered with a serious expression, "The specific situation is not yet clear. After all, it's still too small. We must wait until the child grows a bit before we can thoroughly examine it. The virus will definitely infect the child."  It was just a question of how much or how little. Cheng Anya's pregnancy seemed to complicate the detoxification process.  He had to consult with Su Man about this.  Cheng Anya clenched her fists anxiously, her heart pounding. This pregnancy felt different from the last time when she was pregnant with Ning Ning; there was more joy last time, but now there was more panic. She was afraid she couldn't keep this child.  Ye Wei saw her thoughts and spoke softly, "Third Sister-in-Law, don't worry too much. The virus will be cured tomorrow. Since the child is still small, maybe when your virus is cured, the child's virus will be cured too. Even if the child is not healthy and has to be aborted, it's not a big deal. You and Third Brother are still young; there will be plenty of opportunities to have children in the future."  The little milk bun's face, tender and pink, showed reluctance, "I want Mommy to give birth to a little brother or sister."  "We want that too, but they have to be healthy to be born," Ye Wei said, feeling a bit heavy-hearted. It seemed like it was really hard to say. Generally speaking, without even checking, they knew the child wouldn't make it.  Cheng Anya also thought about this, her face losing its luster, her dark eyes dimming, a trace of pain crossing them. Really, must she abort it?  She didn't want to be too pessimistic; she hoped to keep it. She couldn't bear to abort the crystallization of love.  "Anya, don't worry for now. Let's wait until the virus in your body is cleared, and then we can talk about the child. There might still be a chance," Bai Ye said. His smile was always distant but so warm, making people feel comfortable, especially in his white doctor's coat, which reassured people even more.  Cheng Anya nodded, smiling, "I know."  Ye Wei turned her head, pondering for a moment, and asked, "Bai Ye, Third Sister-in-Law has always been in good condition without any other symptoms. Is it possible that the virus has all transferred to the child?"  Cheng Anya also thought about this. Her body had always been healthy. Was it possible that it had really transferred to the child? If so, the child definitely couldn't be kept.  "There is that possibility," Bai Ye furrowed his brow. But Cheng Anya's blood analysis definitely still showed the virus; it wasn't possible that all of it had transferred to the child. If it had transferred to the child, then the child definitely couldn't be kept.  "I'll go consult with Su Man," Bai Ye said, leaving the hall for Su Man's room.  His brow was unusually heavy.  Cheng Anya had a foreboding feeling, as if the little life that hadn't been with her for long might be a fleeting encounter, and in the end, it was just false happiness. Her heart ached like it was being pricked by needles.  "Mommy, don't worry. Once Bai Ye and Su Man discuss it and check you thoroughly, we'll know," the little milk bun said with a smile. He didn't like to see Mommy with a worried face.  "Right, Third Sister-in-Law, don't worry too much. Maybe we're worrying over nothing," Ye Wei said with a smile.  Cheng Anya smiled, "Don't worry, I'm fine. I was just wondering if it's a boy or a girl."  The little milk bun quickly raised his hand, "I like a little sister."  Little sisters are the cutest. He could be the little sister's protector, and he would definitely be a good big brother.  "Why don't you want a little brother?"  "A little brother is fine too, but I still prefer a little sister," the little milk bun said with a smile, somewhat excited, "If the little sister is fine, she can come out soon."  "Ning Ning, baby, I bet with you, it's definitely going to be a little brother."  "I bet on a little sister."  "Then you're definitely going to lose. According to the Ye family tradition, yang prevails over yin," Ye Wei said, touching her chin, speaking earnestly.  Cheng Anya, "...It seems so."  "I still want a little sister." Chapter 381: The Beauty Under the Moon  Cheng Anya went back to her room alone, sitting there uneasily. She wasn’t sure if it was just her imagination, but she felt that the child in her belly was growing strong, and there was a sense of connection between their hearts. Earlier, with so many people around, she didn’t feel anything particularly different; she was just shocked. Now, standing alone on the balcony and looking at the bright moon in the sky, her heart surged with emotion.  It was as if wave after wave of warmth was engulfing her, and she had a strong maternal feeling, even more touching than when she first found out she was pregnant with Ning Ning. Perhaps this child, conceived out of her love with Ye Chen, held even more significance than Ning Ning did at the time.  Ning Ning was her pillar in a foreign land, while this child was the crystallization of her love with Ah Chen. Moreover, she didn’t know if the child would have a chance to be born or if it would be healthy. This uncertainty would make any mother pay more attention and love to their child. There was no doubt about that.  Whether the child would be healthy and could be kept safe was now the biggest issue. Every mother in the world has the same mindset: to love their child and treasure them, hoping they can survive and grow up safely. Cheng Anya was no exception.  Tonight, in the city of Liya De, the moon was full, and the soft moonlight was clear and gentle, shining on the world, enveloping the brightly lit city as if it were wrapped in the tender embrace of a mother. She couldn't help but pray that heaven would give her child a chance to survive.  Cheng Anya was not a fatalist, but she couldn't help thinking that if prayers really worked, she wouldn't mind praying devoutly every day, sincerely asking for blessings.  “Mommy.”  Ning Ning appeared quietly on the balcony, his smile warm and gentle. His face had thinned, no longer as chubby as before, and he carried a more grown-up appearance. As a mother, she felt an extreme tenderness for him and wished he could always remain cute and pink.  "Why haven't you gone to bed yet? It's so late."  Cheng Anya, afraid of impulsively embracing him, moved a bit to the side. Ning Ning pouted in dissatisfaction.  Cheng Anya glanced at him, "No protesting."  "Mommy, don't be so cautious."  "I’m a natural germ, stay away from me."  Miss Cheng rebutted with a single sentence.  "What's wrong, can't sleep?"  "A little bit, Mommy. Will I really have a little sister?" Little Bun's eyes gleamed as he looked at Cheng Anya with the words "little sister" practically written in his gaze, clearly longing for one.  Cheng Anya didn't know how to respond. If she told the truth, she might disappoint Ning Ning; if she lied, it wouldn't be what she wanted. After hesitating for three seconds, Cheng Anya chose to tell the truth, "It's not certain yet, don't get your hopes too high. With daddy and mommy here, it's not just a sister; you could have a brother too."  Little Bun chuckled, "Mommy, don't be so funny, okay? And I don't want a brother, I want a sister."  He then recalled a saying, "Love will come, and so will bread." o(╯□╰)o.  "Alright, then it will be a sister."  Cheng Anya smiled and said, hoping more than Little Bun that the child would be safe and healthy. Once Ye Sanshao woke up, he would surely be surprised. Cheng Anya imagined that he might even exclaim that his hard work overnight wasn't wasted.  Cheng Anya was embarrassingly stunned.  "Mommy, I've noticed you're a bit biased towards boys."  "Nonsense."  She preferred daughters; they were pretty, and she could dress them up and make them look beautiful, which felt like an accomplishment, "I like little sisters too."  "Then why do you always mention brothers?"  Little Bun scorned Cheng Anya, pointing out the most direct evidence. From the beginning, he never heard her mention a sister, let alone liking one. It was a deception.  "Didn't your aunt say? The Ye family tradition is that males thrive and females do not."  Cheng Anya argued righteously, saying if she was biased, it was entirely Little Bun's fault.  Who made her own son more beautiful and adorable than girls, and more considerate and filial than daughters?  "Then, Mommy, just keep having babies. If you have ten or eight, surely you'll have a sister."  Little Bun spoke seriously, and Cheng Anya's face darkened. He nodded earnestly, thinking his idea was very good.  "Am I a sow to you, so you wish I wouldn't live?"  If she could move people at will, she would have slapped him already.  Little Bun smiled with his eyes narrowed, feeling very cheerful, and Cheng Anya’s worries about the child were somewhat dispelled by Little Bun, "Haven't you thought that Mommy might not be able to keep this child?"  "With Bai Ye and Su Man, there will surely be no problem."  Little Bun smiled, "I trust them. Even if a sister comes out looking like Ultraman, they can turn her into Snow White."  Cheng Anya, "..."  What a fierce theory and vivid metaphor.  My son, this is blind trust, Miss Cheng silently asked the heavens.  Little Bun said, "I still hope you can be safe soon, and then I can settle the score with Louis properly."  Mentioning Louis, Little Bun's voice carried a hint of bloodthirsty fierceness, and his whole demeanor seemed to don a sharp coat. This domineering and murderous aura was evident, and only in front of Cheng Anya would he be so unrestrained.  "Louis, huh..." Cheng Anya looked up at the bright moon, "Didn't he disappear without a trace?"  "I'm working hard to find him. As soon as my abilities improve a bit more, I won't need to be wary of Mo Ye and Mo Yue."  Little Bun said solemnly, currently Louis could hide without a trace, and the mafia could disappear because Mo Ye and Mo Yue had perfect hiding abilities. He had been exploring his limits these past few days, trying to break through his own boundaries.  He would not give up so easily.  "Alright, just take good care of yourself."  Cheng Anya said lightly. She knew that Xu Nuo's death had to be avenged, and Ning Ning had put all the blame on Louis. Without dragging Louis to accompany Xu Nuo in death, he would not stop.  "You can also leave Liya De now."  Cheng Anya said, "It's fine here with daddy and mommy. If necessary, we can call Black Hawk and others over as well."  "How can that be? I can only rest easy when you are safe."  Little Bun smiled, "In my heart, daddy and mommy always come first. How can I neglect you just for revenge? That's not acceptable."  "Fine, don't try to cheer mommy up. You’ll forget your mother when you get a wife. Later, I'll focus on training your sister."  Cheng Anya half-jokingly said.  Unexpectedly, Little Bun didn't deny it, instead saying, "Women will also forget their mothers when they have husbands. Mommy, you’re like that, and you still want to teach your sister?"  Cheng Anya was left speechless by Little Bun, struggling to respond, "So, in this world, parents are the most tragic."  Little Bun, "..."  Well... that's a bit serious.  "Mommy, in this world, I still love you the most."  Little Bun said earnestly.  Cheng Anya's heart ached. Yes, she knew her son loved her the most because his most beloved was no longer there.  Cheng Anya didn't feel like her son was stolen from her. Instead, she felt very heartbroken.  "I know."  Cheng Anya smiled, "Baby, you have such a sweet mouth tonight."  "Mommy is pregnant, I'm happy."  Little Bun laughed, and Cheng Anya shook her head.  "I hope your daddy wakes up tomorrow. I'm somewhat looking forward to his reaction."  "Daddy will probably say, 'Damn, I haven't enjoyed enough of our two-person world, and here comes another light bulb.'"  Little Bun imitated Ye Sanshao's cursing, and Cheng Anya laughed so hard she collapsed on the balcony railing.  "Baby, you're too good at this."  ......  Su Man's manor resembled that of an ancient noble estate, with modern designs as well as classic courtyard styles. The courtyard where Su Man lived alone was like a small courtyard-style garden. The exterior of the house had an ancient charm, resembling a bungalow, but with an elegant appearance, white jade walls, glazed roof tiles, and many white jade lotus lanterns under the eaves, providing an elegant atmosphere.  The courtyard was filled with various exotic flowers and plants of strange breeds. Bai Ye, upon one glance, was startled to realize that he couldn't even name a single purple-blue flower there.  He felt an exotic fragrance filling the air, refreshing and invigorating.  "What kind of flower is this?"  Bai Ye curiously squatted down and examined it closely. It looked a bit like a rose, but not quite. He had never seen a purple-blue rose before. As he reached out curiously to touch it, he heard Su Man's distinctively cold voice carried over by the night breeze, "If you don't want to die, you'd better not touch it."  His voice was as cold as an ice spring in winter, enough to chill someone even in the heat of summer. Bai Ye drew back his hand. Really deadly, a poisonous flower? Who would plant poisonous flowers all over their own garden? Such an odd temperament.  "What brings you here?"  Su Man asked coldly. Standing in the moonlight, his figure was even more tall and straight, his demeanor sharp, noble, and otherworldly, like a deity. His beauty would make even men pause for a moment.  The beauty under the moon, unparalleled in elegance.  Bai Ye mused to himself that this cold demeanor must be directed at him. He was well aware that despite their warming relationship over the days, it had unexpectedly deteriorated again, which was... quite unexpected.  With a gracious smile, Bai Ye said, "I came to discuss something with you. Cheng Anya is pregnant." Chapter 382: The Innocent and The Scheming  Su Man was taken aback, seemingly not expecting Cheng An Ya to be pregnant. His brow furrowed coldly; after the flash of astonishment, Su Man's piercing gaze swept towards Bai Ye, sarcastically saying, "Don't you pride yourself on being a genius doctor? How come you didn't find out a few days ago? A false reputation indeed."  Bai Ye smiled gently, comforting like a spring breeze, his tranquil brows seemingly lifting a warm wind as well, not minding Su Man's ridicule in the slightest. "Why are you blaming me? You didn't notice it either."  The last time he checked on Cheng An Ya was 8 days ago, and at that time, she was only about two days pregnant. The symptoms were not at all obvious. Moreover, their attention was all on the virus, so how could they notice her pregnancy? Even with the most thorough check, Su Man's lab was for virus research, and blood analysis didn't include such detailed responses. It wasn't an obstetrics and gynecology department, so it would have been strange if they had detected the pregnancy. This matter had nothing to do with his medical skills.  With a cold humph, Su Man responded, "I'm not a doctor."  Su Mei Ren pushed all the responsibility away with just one sentence. He indeed wasn’t a traditional doctor, so it was very normal for him not to diagnose Cheng An Ya's pregnancy. But Bai Ye is a genius doctor who also didn't diagnose it; that definitely meant his medical skills were lacking.  Bai Ye kept silent in his heart, thinking that Su Mei Ren should be more generous as a person.  It was obvious that Su Mei Ren didn't know how to write the word "generosity," and he sipped his lips lightly, "Pregnancy and the virus outbreak aren't too closely related. Detoxification should proceed as usual. What's there to discuss?"  Bai Ye shook his head, a hint of firmness in his smile, "You can't say that. An Ya is pregnant, and the child is very likely to be infected with the virus."  "Abort it," Su Man stated matter-of-factly, cutting the conversation short, "This is a cellular virus. The child is infected with the virus right from the womb, who knows what kind of monster will be born."  Bai Ye's eyes narrowed slightly, a trace of solemnity on his face. He had also considered this issue. A cellular virus is different from other viruses; it can change the genes of the human body, and indeed, there are concerns that the child might be a bio-human or a mutant. That would certainly be a tragedy.  But now, everyone was looking forward to the birth of the child, and suddenly saying to abort it would be too cruel.  "What if the child is not infected with the virus?" Bai Ye asked.  Su Man scoffed coldly, "You still need to ask such a stupid question? What kind of genius doctor are you if you don't even understand this basic medical knowledge? The child is growing in a pool of viruses, and you are still hoping against hope that there's no infection?"  "Su Mei Ren, medical judgments are not necessarily one hundred percent accurate, there might really be a chance," Bai Ye said unafraid of Su Man's mockery, lightly putting forward his judgment.  Su Mei Ren's face darkened, his gaze chilling and ominous, "If you call me 'Su Mei Ren' one more time, I'll poison you to death."  Bai Ye kept silent. Su Man stood against the wind, dressed in white surpassing the snow, his ink-black hair tied with a silver ribbon, his hair fluttering in the moonlight, beautiful like a dream or a fantasy, like a celestial being stepping out of ancient tales. Indeed, a beauty in name and reality.  Besides, people like Ye Wei, the little milk bun, and others call him 'beauty,' so why can't he call Su Mei Ren the same?  Apparently sensing what Bai Ye was thinking, Su Man's aura grew even colder, that unangry yet imposing aura quite frightening.  Bai Ye, knowing the situation, decided not to call him that anymore. Su Man may not have the same skill, but he had plenty of poison on him, and Bai Ye was pondering what kind of poison powder might come his way with a flick of Su Man's hand.  "I came to talk to you about An Ya and the child. Ning Ning really wants this child, you wouldn't bear to let him down, right?" Bai Ye played his trump card; all of these people doted on Ning Ning. Indeed, the child's young age had its advantages, but more importantly, this child was indeed very lovable, otherwise, Bai Ye wouldn't be so desperate to protect Ye San and Cheng An Ya.  Su Man indeed quieted down, "We have to wait for the child to grow a bit before we can be sure. If the child is infected with the virus, it's mostly not advisable to keep it. This type of virus is extremely unstable and might mutate during the entire pregnancy period, causing other effects. Of course, if they want to take a gamble, I have no objections."  To gamble, this virus could combine with cellular layers to produce a superhuman child, perhaps even more terrifying than Ning Ning, but the chances of that are very slim. Even adults cannot merge cells with the virus, and for an unborn baby, the chances are even slimmer.  Bai Ye fell silent; he understood everything Su Man said.  "If the child is infected with the virus, will the antidote work?" Bai Ye asked.  "There's an eighty percent chance it won't work. This is not the first or second wave of infection; it's a natural virus carrier, the antidote is useless," Su Man said indifferently, like someone born and raised on poison, becoming a poison person, for whom the antidote is useless.  Bai Ye was startled.  "Don't you have a solution?" Bai Ye raised an eyebrow and asked, touching his chin and smiling somewhat wildly, "Who was it that said I was all talk and no action? You're not much better. There are specialties in every field, and this is not my forte."  Su Mei Ren's gaze flashed sharply but did not directly answer, "I got it, we'll talk tomorrow."  He stood straight in the moonlight, his whole being blending into the layer of cold moonlight, appearing extremely chilling, his brows filled with a cold indifference that clearly showed he was seeing off the guest.  Bai Ye remained standing, watching Su Man, his face smiling, his handsome face calm as the surface of a lake in March, as if he hadn't heard his words.  Su Man sneered, his brows frosty, "Anything else?"  "Why are you still angry? As a grown man, you shouldn't be so petty, right?" Bai Ye said lightly, "I didn't do it on purpose, and you've hit me already. You should have let off your anger."  His tone was light but carried a hint of an awe-inspiring pressure, not inferior to Su Man's.  He knew why Su Mei Ren was being so unkind.  Bai Ye was very restrained by nature; he hardly ever lost his temper, either indifferent or smiling, gentlemanly like jade, elegant and free-spirited. That was the impression he gave to others. But by nature, he was extremely domineering and arrogant, just integrated into his indifference, giving people the wrong impression of a gentleman.  And Su Man, he was too lazy to pretend. He was noble and arrogant, also a restrained character, but not the kind integrated into a smile like Bai Ye. His restraint was covered with a layer of frost.  Cold and intimidating.  "Enough with the nonsense, please leave," Su Man said coldly, extremely unkind.  Bai Ye smiled, his robe flowing like jade, his demeanor even more tranquil. His brows teasingly raised, "Could it be, you really care that much?"  Su Man's cold eyes swept over sharply, the pitch-black pupils carrying a sharp danger. Bai Ye met this with a light smile. The icy atmosphere seemed to encounter a warm breeze, Su Man's expression growing even colder, while Bai Ye remained silent and smiling.  The two unconsciously recalled the accident in the lab today.  For nearly 8 days, they had been alone together, working in unison to research the antidote for the virus. With Bai Ye's assistance, Su Man had saved a lot of effort. His detoxification ability was indeed good, but in some areas, he truly wasn't as good as Bai Ye. After all, there are specializations in every field, and the two of them had different research directions, so they complemented each other.  Su Man initially looked down on Bai Ye because he felt that Bai Ye was trying to compete with him. He thought it was beyond Bai Ye's capabilities, after all, Su Man had the arrogance to be conceited, looking down on Bai Ye's title of 'genius doctor.'  But gradually, over a few days, he also knew that Bai Ye was not unworthy of his reputation. Bai Ye was indeed talented in medicine, and their cooperation was very tacit, gradually warming their relationship.  Heroes tend to cherish each other, especially those who have always been unsurpassed in their own fields like them.  Once people become familiar, there are no taboos in speaking. That day, when they suddenly brought up the topic of homosexuality, two grown men, one of whom is homosexual, bringing up this topic was extremely awkward.  Su Man obviously didn't want to say too much, and Bai Ye was tactful, so he didn't ask further.  Who knew, Su Man accidentally broke a vial of reagent, and as Bai Ye was cleaning up, he slipped...  There is always such a scene in TV dramas where the male lead, due to some accident, suddenly falls, topples the female lead, and very accurately kisses the female lead's lips. As a result, a secret affair begins.  This is a cliched shot used in TV and movies until it's worn out, and the audience is almost numb to it, while the actors are still enjoying their performance. This is a classic love scene. But applied to Su Man and Bai Ye, it's completely inappropriate. Why? Even if the ground was covered in oil, Bai Ye could walk on it as if nothing happened, not to mention falling down. Even if he did fall, he could stand up before hitting the ground,  However, Bai Ye was somewhat stunned when he realized he was falling on Su Man, and that moment of distraction was the cause of the trouble. Su Man was caught off guard and really was toppled by him.  Actually, being toppled was no big deal, it was an accident, and Su Man wouldn't be angry about it. The most important part of this classic scene was missing, which was the kiss. Without the kiss, it wouldn't be a classic scene at all. This was not an accident; Bai Ye had deliberately kissed him.  And from falling to kissing, there wasn't even a pause, realistically making it seem like it was an accident, but Su Man was not someone to be fooled. He was very clear about how much Bai Ye weighed. He was shocked for four seconds, then raised his hand and slapped Bai Ye.  That moment, Su Man was so angry. He clearly felt Bai Ye's gaze change midway, and he knew it was not good, but he wanted to push him away, and it was too late.  For the first time in his life, he was taken advantage of like this.  This was different from Ye Wei's seduction; at least Wei Wei had never kissed his lips.  A kiss in exchange for a slap from Su Mei Ren, the deal wasn't actually that bad. Su Mei Ren's first kiss was taken, that was his first kiss, and Bai Ye was slapped for the first time. Both were firsts, so it was even. Who knew that Su Mei Ren would turn his face and not recognize anyone in anger, treating him as someone to be shunned again.  "You, are you seeking death?" Su Man narrowed his eyes dangerously, his aura intimidating, remembering the incident and thinking of the amazement and pause in Bai Ye's eyes. He felt deeply insulted.  If he was seeking death, he wouldn't mind obliging him.  They had just discussed homosexuality, and Bai Ye had joked that homosexual lovers almost never last long, everyone just seeking novelty. This view had already displeased Su Man.  But it cannot be denied that what Bai Ye said was the truth.  He also knew that Bai Ye was different from him; he liked women and was a true straight man.  So what was it that he kissed him? Seeking novelty, coveting beauty?  Su Man was a dignified man and was not ashamed of being homosexual, but being treated as a woman by another man, one can imagine how furious the always proud and haughty Su Man was.  For the first time in his life, he was so unsettled.  Bai Ye raised his eyebrows and smiled, "No, I want to live a long and prosperous life."  Su Man coldly humphed, the flames of anger leaping in his cold eyes, "Get out, or don't blame me for being ruthless."  With that, he left, leaving Bai Ye with a cold and indifferent silhouette.  Bai Ye stood with his hands behind his back, handsome and upright, modest as jade, the smile on his lips growing more intense. He, a genius with both talent and looks, why would he be disliked?  Bai Ye was quite perplexed.  Today, why he kissed him, Bai Ye himself was not clear, it seemed like an uncontrollable impulse. The moment he fell, all he could smell was the familiar cold fragrance that he had become accustomed to these past few days.  It's a disgrace for a man to have a fragrance, but Su Man was always messing with flowers and plants, and the yard was filled with this cold scent. It had long blended with him, seemingly innate, particularly enchanting.  Being so close, maybe it was the fragrance that was too tempting, or maybe the lips were too captivating, he had been bewitched, thinking that the kiss would probably feel good. In the blink of an eye, before Bai Ye could even realize what he was doing, he already felt the warmth on his lips, and he had kissed him.  To say it was an accident was an understatement; he did it on purpose.  Bai Ye glanced once more at the splendid garden, a bit bewildered in his heart, unable to understand why he had acted that way. He left Su Man's courtyard thoughtfully, not noticing that Su Man's cold gaze had been following his departing figure.  Humph!  Su Man coldly humphed, daring to take advantage of him, then he would have to exchange something of equal value.  The lips of the noble and unparalleled beauty curved into a hint of a smile. It was as if he had already seen his prey walk into the trap. Chapter 383: The Poison is Cured  The next day, in the laboratory. Cheng Anya watched as Bai Ye injected the antidote into Ye Sanshao's body. The transparent liquid flowed like an icy spring, making her feel a bit cool-hearted, to the extent that her limbs felt a bit cold, and her palms were sweating profusely. She watched nervously for Ye Sanshao's reaction on the operating table.  This was not the first time Su Man and Bai Ye had developed an antidote. In the past few days, they had tested three different antidotes, all of which were first tested on lab rats. The first two times, the rats died, but the last time, there was no reaction in the rats.  This time, there was a reaction in the lab rats, and after Su Man's analysis, the toxins in the blood had all disappeared within an hour.  That is to say, this was an antidote, at least it was effective on the lab rats.  Because Cheng Anya was pregnant, they could not predict the reaction of the antidote on a human body, so they had to test it on Ye Sanshao first since his time left was very limited.  The antidote had to be injected.  Ye Wei, Eleven, and others were present, as well as the little bundle of joy. This was the most critical day. If the antidote failed, they would inevitably have to look for another way to save them, which would waste even more time.  Given Ye Sanshao's condition, he simply couldn't hold on for much longer.  The little bundle of joy and Cheng Anya both knew this was their last chance. Success or failure depended on today.  After the antidote was injected into Ye Sanshao, everyone quietly watched the diagrams on the screen. The supply of sedatives had been temporarily stopped, and at the moment, Ye Sanshao only had an oxygen mask on him.  The rest of the reagents had been withdrawn, and now it all depended on the reaction to the antidote this time.  Bai Ye took Ye Sanshao's pulse, his expression solemn. Judging from the pulse, it was very calm, because the sedative had just been withdrawn, and he had not shown signs of waking up, so the pulse appeared calm.  But after half an hour, there was no obvious reaction.  The screen showed that the virus had not been eliminated. Cheng Anya couldn't understand such diagrams; she only knew that the screen showed the virus devouring cellular bodies, which were internal views of Ye Sanshao's body.  Bai Ye had explained to them that the black areas indicated the regions invaded by the virus. From the diagrams, Ye Sanshao's liver, stomach, and spleen were all infected with the virus, and it was very serious.  The body was almost filled with terrifying viruses, all in a free and mutating state.  After the antidote was injected, red bubbles appeared on the screen, constantly striking against the black areas. Cheng Anya and others had just watched the demonstration on the lab rats. After about ten minutes, the black areas would slowly fade and gradually disappear.  This represented that the virus was being eliminated, disappearing.  But after half an hour, there was no change in Ye Sanshao's body, only the red bubbles continuously struck against the black areas, like a struggle between good and evil.  Good wanted to kill evil, but was powerless and helpless.  Bai Ye wrapped his arms around his chest and watched the screen, almost holding his breath. For the first time, he felt his heartbeat was so tense. Could it be that the antidote was wrong? He drew a cold breath in his heart. According to his precise calculations, there should have been a reaction after fifteen minutes. Why was there no reaction at all?  The lab rat had started to assimilate the virus after only ten minutes. Something was wrong.  A fine sweat appeared between Bai Ye's indifferent brows.  Su Man sat calmly in front of the computer, his eyes coldly staring at the screen. He seemed very calm, not showing a hint of panic, as if it was normal to have no reaction for half an hour.  But Su Man's palms were also sweating. He knew very well that if the antidote was ineffective this time, Ye Sanshao would surely die.  Even if he and Bai Ye raced against time to research the antidote, there would definitely be no results within three to five days.  Cheng Anya could wait, but he absolutely couldn't wait any longer.  The man's noble features were very solemn. He didn't need to turn his head to know the expressions of the people behind him.  Cheng Anya and others did not dare to disturb Su Man and Bai Ye, fearing to interrupt their train of thought. Ye Wei and Eleven pursed their lips, also nervously waiting. The little bundle of joy stayed with Cheng Anya, afraid that his mommy wouldn't be able to endure such torment.  The wait between life and death was the most exhausting. In such a situation, most thoughts turn to hopelessness.  The little bundle of joy looked at his daddy on the operating table not far away, his gaze showing pain. He had only recognized his daddy for less than half a year. He didn't want to lose him. Fortune-tellers on the streets always say when reading someone's palm that you will surely have lost a loved one before the age of ten.  Later investigations showed that most people had lost their beloved family members before the age of ten, whether it was a grandfather, a mother, a grandmother, etc.  He had already lost Nono.  So, he also counted as having lost a loved one.  So, daddy, you must live on.  If he died, his mommy would probably become a walking corpse, never happy for the rest of her life.  Daddy, you have to hold on.  He had always had confidence in Su Man and Bai Ye, but only at this critical moment did he realize how nervous he was.  Cheng Anya stood alone on the side, her hands supporting the edge of the table, her eyes like torches staring at the screen, fearing to miss any detail. She prayed desperately for the antidote to take effect quickly.  "Bai Ye, increase the dosage," Su Man said in a deep voice.  Bai Ye's brows furrowed heavily, and without asking further, he injected another dose of the antidote.  In fact, this antidote was also a poison. If there was no virus in Ye Sanshao's body, just the antidote alone would be enough to poison a person to death within a minute.  So increasing the dosage also carried a certain risk; a slight miscalculation could result in death by the antidote.  "Bai Ye, what's the situation? Why is there no reaction?" Ye Wei asked nervously, "Could it be ineffective?"  "Wait," Bai Ye uttered one word, firm and resolute.  Time passed slowly, and this kind of waiting was the hardest. He told you that he would wake up within an hour. If he didn't wake up, he would die.  But you have waited almost an hour, and he hasn't woken up yet.  It's like hope is slipping away through your fingers.  Suddenly, a clanging noise came from the operating table. Ye Sanshao's wrist moved; he seemed to want to break free from the handcuffs but was stuck.  He became anxious, pulling hard, his movements very large.  Everyone was startled, and suddenly, Su Man also rapidly analyzed his body's various functional indicators on the computer. Ye Sanshao first groaned as if in pain, his head shaking constantly, his body also struggling fiercely to break free of the restraints. Cheng Anya and Ye Wei wanted to go over but were stopped by Bai Ye.  Suddenly, Ye Sanshao let out an angry roar, "Ah..."  His eyes, which had been closed for nearly ten days, suddenly opened wide, his black pupils filled with blood, frighteningly red. His limbs began to struggle violently, continuously shouting and screaming, as if crazed.  Cheng Anya watched with her eyes about to split, "Ah Chen..."  She tightly covered her mouth, her heart twisted with pain, unable to bear to look, and lowered her eyes to the table. Yet, his crazed voice still echoed in her ears.  Ah Chen...  "Daddy..."  "Third brother... what's wrong with you?" Ye Wei also panicked, "Su Man, what's wrong with my brother?"  "The antidote is starting to react," Su Man said calmly. "He was bound to suffer unbearably once the sedative was withdrawn, and now with the antidote devouring the virus, the two reactions are clashing. It's a normal reaction."  "Moreover, we've increased the dosage, so he will suffer even more," Bai Ye added.  "Daddy won't have any problems, right?"  "As long as there is a reaction, he won't die," Su Man said, his hands busily testing all of Ye Sanshao's indicators, while commanding Bai Ye to inject him with several other reagents.  So ruthless, so resolute.  Upon hearing that death was not imminent, everyone's hearts eased a lot.  Cheng Anya and the others were laymen and didn't understand but could see that Ye Sanshao's suffering seemed to have lessened somewhat.  The kind of screaming that seemed to want to dig out his internal organs was a bit terrifying.  Ye Sanshao's appearance was indeed a bit frightening, his features distorted, his voice hoarse, his hands and feet were scraped by handcuffs and shackles until they were bloody, deep enough to see the bone, as if they were going to embed into his bones.  Cheng Anya's heart ached.  "Daddy, it will be okay, you hang in there," the little bundle of joy clenched his fist, cheering for Ye Sanshao.  "He can't hear you," Bai Ye said with a smile. In Ye Sanshao's current state, he temporarily couldn't feel anything except pain and the dizziness of being close to death. This situation lasted for nearly ten minutes.  The antidote then quickly began to merge with the black virus areas, slowly clearing the virus from Ye Sanshao's body. Ye Wei and Eleven, familiar with various modern technologies, had never seen such a vivid full process before.  They could clearly see the antidote sweeping through Ye Sanshao's body, the black virus gradually fading, then slowly disappearing.  At the same time, Ye Sanshao's body slowly broke out in a layer of sweat.  His roaring slowly softened, turning into uncomfortable groans.  In the end, Bai Ye injected him with serum, completing the final step of detoxification. Ye Sanshao, exhausted, fell into a deep sleep.  Cheng Anya was anxious and wanted to go over, but Bai Ye quickly stopped her.  "Anya, he's just been detoxified. Don't get poisoned again, next it's your turn."  Cheng Anya's footsteps faltered, "Detoxified, really? He's alright?"  "Yes, it was successful."  "That's great!" Ye Wei and Eleven high-fived, the laboratory erupted in cheers, even Su Man's lips curved into a slight smile.  After such a terrifying process of detoxification, the little bundle of joy was anxious, "Will my mommy also suffer as much as daddy did?"  "No," Bai Ye said with a smile. Chapter 384: Children Under the Virus  Cheng An Ya's process of detoxification was not painful at all, similar to a regular injection. After the antidote was administered, she felt somewhat drowsy and then lay on another operating table. From the internal view, it could be seen that the virus in Cheng An Ya's body was almost entirely concentrated towards the direction of the uterus.  Everything was as Bai Ye had expected. Ye Wei had mentioned before that Cheng An Ya's condition was very strange, not at all like someone who had been infected by a virus. He also asked her, when they were on the isolated island of Louis, it wasn't like this at all. She would have attacks, feeling weak and sore all over, with piercing pain in her internal organs. This situation started from when they were at Prince William's castle, which is to say, the child was slowly absorbing the virus, growing up soaked in the virus.  Su Man was right, he didn't even need to look at the internal view to know that the child must have been infected.  "Could it be that this child is treating the virus as nourishment to absorb?" Ye Wei looked at the internal view, extremely shocked, her eyes wide open with disbelief. Little Bun, however, was a bit worried. The image was a bit frightening.  "That should be correct." Bai Ye said, feeling a bit uneasy. The child was conceived during the time Cheng An Ya was infected with the virus, and now this child was naturally a carrier of the virus. Not to mention what impact the virus would have on him, if he were to be born, would everyone be unable to touch him?  Su Man's brows furrowed, a rare sight of the beautiful Su Man looking worried. Ye Wei, Eleven, and Little Bun all felt the situation was serious. Ye San Shao was quietly sleeping on the side, completely unaware. Cheng An Ya was also asleep, without any sensation. Their hearts, however, were thumping wildly with worry.  "Su Man, how is it?" Little Bun asked.  Su Man patted his hand and said indifferently, "For now, it's unknown. The infection is certain, but whether there are problems can only be known once the child grows a bit bigger. Your mommy will be fine."  The antidote was taking effect, slowly eliminating the virus in Cheng An Ya's body. She did not experience the intense pain that Ye San Shao did, just lying there quietly, as if asleep, her face still with a trace of tranquility.  "Bai Ye, I heard from the old witch that the Grey Wolf once experimented with poison people. Is it the same principle as with this child?" Ye Wei suddenly asked, recalling events from many years ago, her brows furrowed even tighter.  "Poison people?" Su Man raised an eyebrow.  Bai Ye nodded, indeed such a thing had happened, "The Grey Wolf once used infants as poison people for cultivation. From their birth, the food they consumed contained strong poisons. At that time, there were more than a dozen children; over ten died, and only three survived. Later, their food was all laced with extreme poison, and during their growth, two more died, leaving only one survivor. This child was different from normal children. He was a carrier of poison. Anyone who touched him would be poisoned; the severe cases would result in death, while the lighter cases required immediate injection of serum and several months to recuperate. Even the air he exhaled was poisonous."  "How cruel." Little Bun frowned. How could there be such cruel people? His Nono had been in the hands of the Grey Wolf since he was young, but thankfully, the Grey Wolf did not cultivate her as a poison person. Such pain was definitely not something ordinary people could endure.  "Indeed very cruel. Later, the old witch imprisoned the child, and because of this, she fell out with the Grey Wolf. It's been many years, Wei Wei wouldn't remember if she hadn't mentioned it. This kind of success rate is extremely low, many people died to cultivate one. Moreover, the food for the poison people must contain strong poison; eating normal food for a long time would lead to death due to lack of toxins," Bai Ye said gravely. They had only heard about these things, but in the special forces camp, they had to believe whatever they heard; it was definitely true.  "If that's the case, if the virus disappears, will the child die?" Eleven raised her own question. This matter was really too complicated; she felt it was very profound and difficult to understand.  "This is something I've heard about too, but it's different from the child's situation," Su Man said indifferently. "If the child can grow, then it means the virus has already fused with the child's cellular layer. Look at him, although he's not yet fully formed, he is indeed growing. Viruses and poisons are different; congenital carriers may also be able to control the virus. If he dies without the virus, then it means he is destined to have no fate with this world," Su Man spoke lightly. The virus in Cheng An Ya's body had almost completely disappeared, and it was being expelled through her sweat. Bai Ye also injected her with serum.  Except for Bai Ye, everyone else listened in a daze, but at least the virus was finally resolved, which was a good thing.  Ye Wei carried Cheng An Ya back to her room, Bai Ye carried Ye San Shao back, and they ordered the maids to help them clean up, especially Ye San Shao, who needed to apply medicine to his wrists and ankles, as he had struggled quite fiercely.  Su Man and Little Bun walked at the back, Little Bun smiling and saying, "Su Man, you really worked hard this time."  "It's just a small matter," Su Man said indifferently, his hand on his shoulder, "We're our own people, no need for formalities."  Little Bun grinned, Su Man pulled him to sit down on the long bench in the central courtyard. It was a cloudy day in Riyadh, and the temperature was a bit low. The open-air courtyard did not feel stuffy, and the presence of such a big fountain actually added a few touches of coolness.  Su Man asked, "When are you leaving?"  They certainly couldn't stay long. Dragon Gate, the first terrorist organization, and the Mafia were in the most chaotic and tense phase; no one knew who would have the last laugh. They must not stay too long. Some of them were core members of the terrorist organization, some were core members of Dragon Gate; they all had to find ways to deal with the crackdown by the Mafia and the joint government forces. The second half of the year was expected to be turbulent.  "I was just about to ask you this question. Will my mommy have any more problems? If the child carries the virus, could it be released to infect my mommy again?" Little Bun thoughtfully raised this question.  "No, they both have antibodies in their bodies now. The same virus no longer has an effect on them," Su Man said. "I've considered this issue a long time ago, rest assured. If anything happens, it's mostly likely to be the child that's affected; the adults won't have issues. The worst-case scenario is to terminate the pregnancy."  Little Bun nodded, feeling relieved.  "I'm just worried about my mommy. We must be fully prepared this time. I will not let Louis succeed again." Little Bun's face turned slightly somber as he mentioned Louis' hiding place, which he was close to discovering.  "In terms of strength and seniority, the first terrorist organization is the boss, the Mafia is the second, and Dragon Gate is the third. The second wants to take down the boss; alone, it's definitely not possible, so they must pull the third one in," Su Man said with a smile. He never left his house, yet he had a clear understanding of the world's situation; these things couldn't be hidden from him.  Little Bun also nodded in agreement, understanding this better than anyone, "He definitely can't win over Dragon Gate, so there's only one way: to merge with Dragon Gate, and level the entire North America. At one point, the Mafia had divided North America's forces, and even the terrorist organizations had to give them some respect. If it really turns into a two-tigers-on-one-mountain situation, it'll be too late to act. Of course, the premise is that he can swallow North America."  "Indeed," Su Man replied with a smile.  Little Bun was visiting for the first time, and he had been busy with the virus the entire time, not having much opportunity to chat. It was almost time to leave, and Su Man felt a little reluctant to part with him. But he was, after all, a carefree person; as for partings and reunions, it was all up to fate. Besides, they would surely have many intersections in the days to come.  "Riyadh really is calm, huh? Mo Yu has also been gone for so many days. Louis should know that my daddy and mommy are in Riyadh, yet he hasn't made a move, which is strange," Little Bun said with a smile. He had wanted to set a trap for Louis to walk into, to withdraw all the people from Dragon Gate and the first terrorist organization from Riyadh, leaving only Ye Wei and Eleven. Surprisingly, Louis did not act, which was unexpected to him.  "Having conquered the world, what's a beauty or two?" Su Man said indifferently.  Little Bun thought about it and agreed. Su Man suddenly asked, "That batch of firearms hasn't been forged yet, has it?"  "Are you talking about the high-speed magnetic wave gun? They've forged one," Little Bun said with pouted lips. "The thing you designed is too difficult to forge; many turned out to be failures, with only one successful piece. But it might be easier to forge more in the future."  "Not bad, I thought it would take another month or two to forge one. The reserve forces of your organization are really strong."  "Of course," Little Bun said proudly. "Speaking of which, Bai Ye was the first person to test the gun. The power is really fierce; it can blow up a fighter jet in high-speed flight. It's unbelievable."  "Almost approaching the speed of light," Su Man said with a smile. This was the result of three years of his hard work, creating his most proud work. If it were sold on the market, it would definitely be at a sky-high price. Yet, Little Bun tricked him and took it away. Bai Ye was actually the first person to test the gun—how cheap for him.  Little Bun covered his mouth and laughed, his dark eyes sly, revealing a bit of cunning, "Su Beauty, why do you have such a problem with Bai Ye? Our Bai Ye is considered the calmest, most handsome, and best-tempered person in the terrorist organization. 'Flowers bloom on the street, and the gentleman is like jade,' what a fitting and apt description."  "Are you promoting your family's unsellable goods?" Su Man turned his head, his noble face also revealing a smile. Because of the angle, he was already beautiful, and now he showed a breathtaking beauty. Little Bun couldn't help but exclaim, "Demon!" His hands couldn't resist reaching for Su Man's chest.  It was hard.  "You cheeky kid, you're quite daring," Su Man said with a smile, allowing him to touch, his face showing a slight indulgence. "You and Ye Wei are indeed from the same family; even the way you act is the same."  Ye Wei didn't know how many times she had touched his chest just to confirm whether he was male or female.  "Su Beauty, you really are too much of a femme fatale," Little Bun said with a giggly voice.  "What unsellable goods? Our Bai Ye is a hot-selling item," Little Bun blinked. "Product quality, appearance, practicality, are all beyond reproach, and it's a multifunctional product."  Su Man laughed loudly at this metaphor. Little Bun felt satisfied as he saw Su Man laugh out loud for the first time, revealing his teeth.  This scene, seen by Ye Wei and Bai Ye on the balcony of a distant villa, seemed like a scandalous affair. Su Man was laughing indulgently, and Little Bun was almost clinging to him. Ye Wei watched in great indignation, "Su Man is too immoral, to have such improper thoughts towards my Ning Ning. This is too much."  A lolicon, oh a lolicon.  "You're overthinking it. Are you sure it's not Ning Ning who's molesting him?" Bai Ye laughed, and went downstairs.  Ye Wei's eyebrows twitched, she quickly followed, her arm hooked around Bai Ye's shoulder and asked, "Bai Ye, do you have a thing for Su Beauty?"  "I like beautiful women."  Ye Wei, "......I should suggest Su Beauty change sex or something."  "Even if he changes sex, he's not a beautiful woman."  A beauty, this is different from a beautiful woman.  "Forget it, don't contradict yourself."  "Don't you want Su Beauty and switch to embrace Mo Yu's beauty?" Bai Ye raised an eyebrow and smiled, letting Ye Wei circle his neck. He wasn't unaware of the excessive intimacy; it's just that he, Chu Li, and others have never seen Ye Wei and Eleven as women.  Otherwise, with Ye Wei and Eleven being both talented and beautiful, after spending more than a decade with them, how could they possibly not be moved? When they were younger, Jason even liked Eleven, but later it just fizzled out. It was better to be family than lovers.  Because they met too early.  "Nonsense." Ye Wei snorted, "I still prefer Su Beauty a bit more."  She didn't mention Mo Yu. Bai Ye, however, reminded her, "When Ye San Shao and An Ya wake up, it's almost time to leave Riyadh. There will definitely be a tough battle, so you better be psychologically prepared. I know you won't let emotions get in the way, but it's still good to have a heads-up, so you don't end up in a hopeless situation."  Bai Ye was also concerned for her. Da Bai was fine, obedient. Mo Yu was too dangerous; he always felt something terrible would happen.  "Are you so distrustful of me?" Ye Wei pinched his arm, "Do I look like someone who would betray you?"  "Don't play dumb with me; I'm worried about you," Bai Ye said gently. "Mo Yu seems very dangerous; it feels like you're not his match."  "The hell, I'm not his match?"  "In terms of scheming, men are still a bit stronger than women," Bai Ye said with a smile. "Look at An Ya, she's so smart, but I think when it comes to big issues, Ye San Shao is more calculating."  "You're being sexist."  "I'm just despising you. Anyway, be careful."  "Got it, I won't let you down," Ye Wei said with a grin. As they happened to reach the central courtyard, Ye Wei leaned in, flirtatiously kissed Bai Ye's cheek, and whispered, "That's your reward."  Bai Ye was at a loss whether to laugh or cry, and when he looked up, he saw both Su Man and Little Bun watching them. Su Man's expression remained unchanged, his eyes stern, losing the gentle smile he had in front of Little Bun, and he just coldly snorted. Chapter 385: The So-called Caught in the Act  Cheng Anya woke up to find that it was deep into the night. The faint moonlight leapt in from the balcony, scattering silver light across the floor. Inside the room, a white jade lamp was lit, emitting a soft and white glow that wasn't harsh on the eyes. It was like a thin veil brushing past, filling the room with warmth and softness.  The poison had been neutralized, she understood in her heart. She had thought while Bai Ye was injecting the antidote that if she couldn't wake up and remained asleep, passing away unknowingly and painlessly, it would be akin to the so-called euthanasia that people often spoke of. She laughed at herself for having such fanciful thoughts at that time, but in that moment, she felt relaxed.  After all, she knew that Ye Sanshao would be safe and sound. Even if she were to die, the only regret would be the child.  One death, two lives was not a good thing.  She smiled, shifted her body, and saw that Ye Sanshao was sleeping beside her. The bed was warm and cozy, warming her to the bone.  The corners of her lips curved slightly, and only after a closer look did she realize that the room was still theirs, but the bedding had been changed. The silk comforter was warm in winter and cool in summer, and with the warmth of a human body, it felt very comfortable.  Perhaps it was a psychological effect, because after the poison was neutralized, she no longer needed to worry about infecting innocent people or causing the death of loved ones. In those few short days, although Cheng Anya appeared relaxed and talked with them as usual, her heart was extremely heavy. Since Zhang Bo's death, this heavy stone had been pressing on her heart, suffocating her in the middle of the night.  This was a kind of heart disease. She almost wanted to isolate herself from the crowd, fearing innocent deaths. Now that the heavy stone had been shattered, her heart felt much lighter, and only now did she realize that the feeling of lightness was truly comfortable, as if reborn.  Beside her was the shallow breathing of Ye Sanshao. During the detoxification, the image of his fierce and crazed face had already faded away. All she knew was that he was now peacefully asleep and safe.  Everything was worth it. Cheng Anya often heard people say that one who survives a great disaster is destined for good fortune later on.  They had endured several hardships this time: jumping out of an airplane in the desert, getting stranded for two days, nearly being killed in a castle, almost being blown to pieces at sea, hovering between life and death several times, and being plagued by a virus. Now that they were safe and sound, could they expect a smoother path ahead?  She hoped so.  Cheng Anya knew that Luis was not dead yet, the mafia's whereabouts were unknown, and there had been many changes at Dragon Gate recently. All of these were being manipulated by someone behind the scenes, attempting to stir up trouble once more. She didn't need to inquire further; just by listening to Xiao Naibao and Ye Wei's analysis and discussions, she understood a thing or two.  After this detoxification, an even bigger storm awaited them. She just hoped that Ye Sanshao, who had already experienced so much pain in the world, had endured all the hardships he would have to face in his life.  From now on, may everything be smooth.  With a sigh, she touched his eyebrows.  Ye Sanshao's eyebrows were thick and nicely shaped. His closed eyes and long eyelashes made for a beautiful side profile, slightly curled, casting a thin shadow under the eyelids. A tall nose and beautiful lips, his delicate features were like a masterpiece crafted by God. She had long known that Ye Sanshao was incomparably handsome. Although he wasn't as breathtaking as Su Man, Mo Jue, and others, his appearance was rare to find in this world.  Her slender fingers traced over his lips, which felt slightly dry. Remembering the heat of these lips, Cheng Anya was momentarily stunned, then withdrew her finger, thinking that if Ye Sanshao knew she had touched him like this while he was asleep, she wondered what the narcissistic man would think.  She rarely looked at his features so intently. Thinking of his domineering, angry, scheming, and pretended grievances... and many other expressions, Cheng Anya couldn't help but smile.  The laughter spilled from her lips.  "Do I look that funny?" The voice that had been absent for many days was hoarse and carried a hint of displeasure. Cheng Anya was taken aback, meeting a pair of pitch-black eyes. The previously closed eyes were now open and staring at her angrily.  Cheng Anya was delighted in her heart. He was awake? Everything was finally alright. She then secretly wondered when he had woken up. Recalling how her long fingers had brushed over his features, her fingertips felt warm, and her face flushed.  "Did you wake up earlier?"  "Tell me, what were you laughing at?" Ye Sanshao's eyes darkened as he suddenly grabbed her hand, pulling at the wound on his wrist. He let out a muffled groan, covering the wound while causing pain to the other side, furrowing his brows.  "Don't move." In a panic, Cheng Anya quickly helped him sit up. Fortunately, the pull wasn't deep, and the blood hadn't seeped through the gauze. Cheng Anya wanted to unwrap it and reapply the medicine, but Ye Sanshao stopped her.  "It's just a flesh wound," he said, looking at the wounds on his wrists and ankles. With bits and pieces of memories flashing through his mind, it wasn't hard to guess what had happened.  He vaguely remembered his own madness, the sound of metal clashing in his ears. At that time, the pain seemed trivial, and he didn't remember much.  "Flesh wounds also need medicine. Don't move around." Cheng Anya took the medicine, unwrapped the gauze, and reapplied it to him. Only then did Ye Sanshao realize how terrible the wounds on his wrists were.  He was shocked and quickly looked at Cheng Anya's wrists. Seeing she was unharmed, Ye Sanshao abruptly asked, "What about the poison on you? Is it resolved?"  Cheng Anya nodded and recounted the situation, omitting the matter of the child. She was still uncertain how to tell Ye Sanshao about it. After applying the medicine, she wrapped it up again.  "You haven't answered my question." Ye Sanshao nudged against the head that was close by.  Daring to laugh at him while he was asleep deserved a punishment.  Cheng Anya rolled her eyes at him. "Can't I be happy? The poison is resolved, and that's something to be happy about. Why can't I laugh?"  "Liar." Ye Sanshao hummed and leaned in to kiss Cheng Anya. "How many days have I been asleep?"  "Nine days," Cheng Anya replied.  She had been anxious for nine days. Especially today, when the antidote was administered, the feeling of desperation was deeply imprinted in her heart. She would never forget the agony of waiting, more unbearable than any other moment.  Ye Sanshao looked at her, his eyes deep, and suddenly said, "It's been so long. You should kiss me, like a prince kissing Sleeping Beauty."  After saying that, he pouted his lips and leaned in for a kiss.  Cheng Anya pushed him to the other side with a slap, laughing and scolding, "Where do you resemble a princess?"  A narcissist indeed.  Ye Sanshao also laughed, lightening the previously heavy atmosphere instantly, spreading joy all around.  Cheng Anya turned her head, seeing his shallow smile, and snuggled closer. Ye Sanshao turned his head, naturally kissing her lips. Cheng Anya extended her tongue, delicately tracing the shape of his lips.  Suddenly, he pressed her into his arms, taking control. He kissed her deeply, sweeping over every inch of her softness, twirling his tongue, sucking and nibbling, enjoying the joy of resurrection after death, the thrill of regaining what was lost.  Everyone prepares to never wake up again when they fall into a deep sleep, carrying complex emotions of parting from life. At this moment, being alive, who wouldn't be moved and joyous?  The treasure in his arms became even more precious.  Cheng Anya closed her eyes, enjoying his kiss. The familiar scent in her nostrils, the gentle breeze brushing past her brows, filled the room with tender affection.  It seemed like he could never get enough of kissing, Ye Sanshao was not satisfied. Just as he let her take a breath, he covered her lips again, kissing her dominantly. His lips were as domineering as his personality, strong and assertive.  The moonlight was soft and white, the beauty was like jade, embraced in his arms, and naturally, they both fell onto the bed.  Cheng Anya was kissed into a daze, feeling only the nibbling and teasing on her earlobes. The hot breath drilled into her ears, this heat seemed to penetrate through the ear canal into the central nervous system, then plunging down.  A slight agitation in her lower abdomen, embarrassingly hot.  This feeling was a bit unfamiliar, yet somewhat familiar. In the desert castle, that day and night, she had felt this way countless times, her fingertips becoming powerless in his arms, melting into a puddle of spring water. Her face was as tender as a rose, her eyes were enchanting like silk.  At his mercy.  "Anya..." His low and hoarse voice rose slowly, hot breaths spraying on Cheng Anya's delicate neck skin, her skin flushed pink. His wet kisses traveled down, opening her clothing, but when he touched the wound, Ye Sanshao briefly groaned in pain.  The entangled Cheng Anya instantly sobered up, her eyes clearing from confusion, stopping Ye Sanshao's head, "Ah Chen, stop it, your hands and feet are not convenient."  "It's nothing." Ye Sanshao dismissed it with a word, not minding his own wounds. Just as he was about to tear open Cheng Anya's clothes, she quickly got up but was pressed down by him, "Don't move."  "It's alright, we didn't die, and there's no rush in these one or two days." Cheng Anya looked down on him. Desire, once tasted by either man or woman, was irresistible, especially for someone like Ye Sanshao, a top-notch lecher.  But even a lecher should consider the situation.  "How about you come on top?" Ye Sanshao was unwilling to give up, blinking suggestively with eyes that carried a dark green glint of anticipation, seeming very eager for Miss Cheng to take the lead.  Cheng Anya's face flushed red, pushing his shoulder to signal him to get off, "I don't know how."  "I'll teach you."  "..."  Miss Cheng's cheeks reddened even more. Ye Sanshao leaned over and whispered in her ear, making Cheng Anya nearly kick him off the bed. Her face was flushed with embarrassment, "You sex fiend, don't even think about it."  Ye Sanshao suddenly leaned in and kissed her deeply. Cheng Anya struggled for a moment when suddenly there was a clattering of dishes. Both of them turned their heads, only to see two figures, one big and one small, trying to flee.  Ye Wei and Xiao Naibao slowly turned around. Ye Wei saw her sister-in-law's swollen lips and a face flushed with spring, her eyes enchanting, while her brother looked unsatisfied, his eyes fierce. She... for the first time felt that interrupting others felt so... exhilarating.  Xiao Naibao waved in a very ladylike manner. Ye Wei said, "Brother, sister-in-law, you two have good stamina, very good... Continue, continue, we'll come back later..."  "Mhm, continue, continue..." Xiao Naibao echoed.  The two figures, one big and one small, stood still without any intention to move. They held trays in their hands, watching the scene innocently.  If it weren't for Ye Sanshao's injury, Cheng Anya would have kicked him off the bed long ago. Oh my, how embarrassing...  Thunder, strike me now!  So this was what being caught in the act felt like, (⊙o⊙)...  "You two really have no sense of timing." Ye Sanshao snorted coldly before finally getting off Cheng Anya. Fortunately, he hadn't been too hasty to tear off her clothes, or there would have been an even more embarrassing scene.  Ye Wei thought to herself, how could she blame them? Who else would think of doing such a thing after lying down for so many days with such severe injuries? You were just too fierce, brother, don't blame us.  Originally, she and Ningning had timed their visit well. They hadn't eaten all day, and Ye Wei had asked someone to prepare some easily digestible food to bring over. She had intended it for her brother and sister-in-law's health, so they wouldn't have to ring the bell for service. Who would have expected to walk in on such a scene?  Even Xiao Naibao was surprised; although she deeply understood that her father had been hungry for a long time, she didn't expect him to be so fierce. Thinking that he wanted her mother to take the lead because his hands and feet were inconvenient was really... polluting the pure hearts of minors, Xiao Naibao also felt conflicted.  "Brother, come on, drink some iced milk, cool down, cool down." Ye Wei took out the drinks, porridge, and side dishes from the tray, smiling and beckoning her brother to come over and cool off.  Unsatisfied men can be very scary.  After the initial embarrassment, Cheng Anya didn't feel much. Living with the Ye family required a strong heart, and this little incident wasn't enough to make her panic. Fortunately, her clothes weren't disheveled, or it would have been more embarrassing.  "Mommy, I can finally hug my treasure." After putting down the tray, Ningning jumped into Cheng Anya's arms without caring about her father's jealous gaze, clinging to Cheng Anya and not letting go, "Mommy..."  "You're so good." Cheng Anya smiled, casually pinching Ningning's little face, giving him a big kiss on his cheek, making Ningning beam with joy.  "Mommy, you smell so good. No wonder daddy loves to nibble on you." Xiao Naibao turned his head around. Cheng Anya was mortified, slapping the back of his head, "Asking for a spanking, aren't you?"  "You're really violent." Xiao Naibao laughed, pulling Cheng Anya to the dining table, "Mommy, it's been a long time since you tasted my cooking, right? I prepared all of this."  Ye Sanshao had already devoured his food like a whirlwind.  He was extremely hungry, suffering from a double hunger. Chapter 386: Going Separate Ways  The virus is resolved, so it's time to discuss leaving Riyadh. Ye Wei Eleven and Bai Ye had discussed it; they need to return to Rome, step up their efforts, and quickly deal with the grievances between Prince William and Chu Li. The main task at hand is to deal with the mafia; Prince William is most likely being used by Louis to weaken the power of the first terrorist organization and to divert attention. They can't afford to be entangled with Prince William for too long, as it would be a loss.  Bai Ye had contacted Chu Li, and after he returns to Rome to take care of some things, he will start mobilizing the international forces of the first terrorist organization, using the international situation to force Prince William to capitulate. They have come this far; he doesn't believe William would rather go down with Chu Li than to give in, which is the quickest way to resolve the situation.  Eleven and Ye Wei naturally have their own matters to attend to; they need to find the whereabouts of the Mo brothers and Louis. Little Bun said, "Daddy, Mommy, this time I want to go with Bai Ye, may I?" This was the main reason he and Ye Wei went upstairs to find his parents. If it weren't for the recent changes, Little Bun would have already found a way to join the first terrorist organization. This opportunity was perfect for training, and he didn't want to miss it.  Being with them would allow him to learn more, and he was determined to follow this path to the end, learning all the skills necessary. He couldn't always stay by his parents' side, and most importantly, he wanted to avenge Nono. He didn't want to let go of either Louis or Cang Lang.  Ye San Shao had no objections. He tilted his head, indicating that the person his son needed to convince was his mother. "Mommy, what do you think?" Little Bun asked Cheng An Ya. "I know that you've just recovered, and it might not be appropriate to discuss this, but Mommy, please just indulge me this once, okay?"  Cheng An Ya leaned back and looked deeply at Little Bun, silent for a moment while Little Bun quietly looked back at her, very persistent. Cheng An Ya sighed in her heart. What use was there in stopping him now? She had already decided when she was fleeing that she would let go and let her son fly.  She indeed couldn't provide him with the skills he needed for growth; someone else would have to do that. "If you've decided, I have no objection," Cheng An Ya finally agreed.  Ye Wei felt relieved. If it had been before, it would have been difficult to convince Cheng An Ya, but after this incident, it was easy, and she wasn't sure whether she should thank Louis for giving Cheng An Ya such a shocking lesson.  "Mommy, you're the best," Little Bun hugged Cheng An Ya's neck tightly, "Thank you, Mommy."  Cheng An Ya kissed her precious son, "Do what you want to do, you've grown up, and Mommy trusts your judgment."  Through this incident, she had grown. Her son had also grown. It was time for her to let go.  Her son was a kite in the sky, and she was the string, forever tied to him, preventing him from flying beyond this patch of sky. Only by loosening the string could he possibly fly higher and farther. The more the string was loosened, the farther he could fly, and that was alright, as long as the son didn't fall. She could reel him in, and eventually, he would return.  Ye San Shao looked at the mother and son, smiling in comfort. The greatest fortune of his life was meeting Cheng An Ya, falling in love, and having such an excellent son. This was the blessing of several lifetimes that he had to cherish.  "Daddy, Mommy, what about you?" Little Bun asked, a bit worried, "Going back to A City?"  Ye San Shao nodded, "I need to go back. I've been away for a month. Lin Da and Tang Si are very worried. The three of us need to discuss how to combat the mafia. Louis's next move is to try to swallow up North America, and Longmen will bear the brunt."  Little Bun nodded, holding Cheng An Ya's hand tightly, and suddenly said, "Mommy, why don't you stay in Riyadh? This is Su Man's home, sacred ground. With Su Man here, no one can bother you. Wait until the situation stabilizes a bit more, then you can return to A City, okay?"  Cheng An Ya shook her head, "I won't. I'll go back with you. There's no room for discussion."  Little Bun understood his mommy's character. Since she said so, there was definitely no room for negotiation. He couldn't help but look towards Ye San Shao.  Ye Chen gave a faint smile, "This time I will be with her 24 hours a day. There won't be a repeat of the same situation."  Furthermore, Longmen's assassins would also protect them around the clock, and they wouldn't be as negligent and passive as last time. Louis would find it difficult to approach A City.  "This seems feasible. Staying with Third Brother is not much different from staying with Su Man. Currently, A City is a peaceful area, whereas Riyadh has become a bit unsafe. Although they fear Su Man, if Third Sister-in-law is alone, Louis might not care about mutual destruction," Ye Wei calmly analyzed. "We still have no news of Louis and Old Master Mo. Ning Ning, you're checking their whereabouts. Once there's a discovery in A City, notify us as soon as possible."  "Of course," Little Bun said firmly, holding Cheng An Ya's hand, "Mommy, your baby won't let you be frightened again."  Before Cheng An Ya could say how good he was, Ye San Shao sent a fierce punch his way, flattening Little Bun, who then covered his sore head, looking at Ye San Shao with big, aggrieved eyes.  "Daddy, are you trying to turn me into an idiot?"  "I was the one who said that. When did you start stealing my lines?" Ye San Shao narrowed his eyes and glared.  Little Bun sulkily curled his lips; he had always been saying that. Protecting Mommy and being her guardian angel was his natural duty, especially since Daddy had not been around for so many years. It was quite rude to suddenly cut in line.  He wisely chose not to say that.  Cheng An Ya rolled her eyes and imitated his earlier action by punching him, "Shut your mouth."  Ye Wei couldn't help but laugh out loud. "You're being rebellious."  Ye San Shao pretended to raise his hand to strike, but Cheng An Ya wasn't afraid at all, completely ignoring him and speaking to Ye Wei, "Wei Wei, I'm leaving Ning Ning in your care. Please look after him for me."  "Don't worry, Third Sister-in-law. He's so cunning and shrewd, he definitely won't have any problems," Ye Wei replied with a modest smile from Little Bun.  "Since it's decided, I'll arrange for a plane later," Ye Wei said. "Third Sister-in-law, if you feel unwell, notify Su Man immediately. He said there won't be any danger for the time being."  "Don't worry, I know."  "Hasn't An Ya been detoxified?" Ye San Shao's voice deepened, his heart skipped a beat, and he looked at Cheng An Ya with a burning gaze, a flicker of panic crossing his face.  "Didn't Third Sister-in-law tell you? She's been detoxified, but there's still no reaction from the one in her belly," Ye Wei blurted out, and Cheng An Ya couldn't stop her in time.  Ye San Shao was stunned. Chapter 387: Conversation Between Father and Son  Ye Shaoshao took a good ten minutes to digest the meaning in Ye Wei's words. By the time he came back to his senses, Ye Wei and Ningning had already left, leaving the space to them. When he snapped back to reality, Cheng Anya had already drunk two cups of hot tea.  Was he dumbfounded with happiness, or with anger? Cheng Anya was curiously pondering. The child's arrival was indeed sudden and not in their plans, but after all, had come, and she was extremely happy in her heart.  And him?  Seeing how much he adored Ningning, Cheng Anya guessed that he must also be extremely fond of children. But the reaction arc of this soon-to-be father was too long. She almost had to nudge him awake to get some other reaction out of him.  He had the same expression on his face for too long. It wasn't tiring for him, but she found it difficult to watch.  "Pregnant?"  "Um, that night in the desert."  Cheng Anya said indifferently. Suddenly, her wrist was gripped tightly, and she was pulled into his warm embrace. His large palm pressed against her spine and against his chest. Bending down, his kiss landed, capturing her lips.  He kissed her domineeringly, his tongue prying open her tightly closed teeth, delving deep into her mouth, almost reaching her throat, sweeping over every tender spot inside her lips, tasting and plundering without satisfaction.  It was a stormy kiss, and she had no resistance to him. Now that she was in his arms, she naturally responded.  Ye Shaoshao twisted her hand backward, manipulating it into an angle that was very accommodating to him, and kissed her hard and fiercely.  It wasn't the first time they kissed, and Ye Shaoshao was never gentle. However, this kind of roughness was a first, and she could even taste a hint of salty blood between her lips and teeth due to the excessive force.  She sighed, this man would never learn what's called gentleness.  Excitement was not supposed to be like this.  Her breath was nearly taken away by him, the kiss lasted too long. Cheng Anya slightly turned her head to dodge his scorching kiss, but he unsatisfactorily kissed her cheeks, her tender earlobes, his hot breath all over her neck, a warm current in her lower abdomen, restlessly stirring.  She was extremely embarrassed, her skin turning a light pink.  In a moment, Ye Shaoshao turned her face back towards him and covered her lips again, this time much gentler.  Cheng Anya's gaze swept by, the light was soft and white, the man's brows full of tender affection, and at this moment, she actually felt a sense of tranquility and distance.  As if eternal.  She was content. Although they expressed their joy differently, she admitted without pretense that she quite liked Ye Shaoshao's consistently action-oriented way of showing it, her heart filled with honey, sweet.  The child, he liked, no doubt.  If it could be kept, how good would that be. She couldn't help but think, if Ye Shaoshao had known she was pregnant with Ningning seven years ago, what would his reaction be? Most likely, he would have been cold-faced, brutally ordering to get rid of it, he didn't need it.  The difference between having feelings and being heartless was really huge.  "Anya, I'm very happy," Ye Shaoshao said after a long time, his chin resting on top of her head, speaking slowly.  Cheng Anya smiled, "I'm also very happy."  In Ningning's room.  In recent days, besides paying close attention to the situation with Ye Wei and the others during the day, exchanging messages with Chu Li, and studying strategies, the little bun spent the rest of the time delving into computer technology.  He had to admit that there was indeed some distance between him and the Mo brothers.  It's extremely difficult for a person's ability to ascend when facing a barrier.  Like having already scored 100 on a test, there's no room to rise any further, the only difference is the perfection of the test paper.  Sometimes more effort is required.  Ningning was luckier than others, being a genius, he was destined to move faster than others, able to overcome any challenge with half the effort, as with this time, although he still hadn't reached the level of the Mo brothers.  But at least, he could now know whether the information given by the Mo brothers was true or false. With a little more time, he was sure he could beat these two brothers. In this field, he would be the ultimate king.  When Ye Shaoshao came over, he was still busy.  "Daddy?" Ningning stopped his work, tilting his head to look at the clock, it was already past midnight, "Daddy, why haven't you gone to sleep?"  "What about you? Aren't you also not sleeping? What are you doing?"  Ye Shaoshao sat next to Ningning, and upon seeing the computer, he understood. He rubbed his son's head, "Don't push yourself too hard."  "It's okay." The little bun smiled brightly, "I'm contending with the Mo brothers, I'm not tired at all, on the contrary, I'm very passionate. Daddy, I'll be able to overtake them soon. Then, taking down Louis won't be difficult."  He had trouble falling asleep at night; once asleep, he would dream of Xu Nuo, in a red dress with a soft whip, like a fiery rose, with a cheerful demeanor, yet he couldn't touch her. Waking up to a sense of desolation and loneliness, he was extremely afraid of this feeling, hardly sleeping at night except with the help of medication.  Just as well, he had time to compete with the Mo brothers.  Ye Shaoshao smiled, "Daddy believes in you."  "Why aren't you with Mommy?"  "She's gone to sleep," Ye Shaoshao said, looking at his son. Ningning smiled knowingly, "Daddy, you have something to say to me?"  Otherwise, his daddy wouldn't have come to find him so late.  "This time away from us, be careful with everything, understand? With the Louis matter, I know you hate him, but don't focus on revenge, or you'll lose your way," Ye Shaoshao cautioned. He always had an uneasiness in his heart. Cheng Anya could feel that the son had changed, so how could he not feel it? Even if he was as adorable and clever as ever in front of them, his nature had changed.  He was always worried that the hatred in his heart was too heavy, and it would ultimately harm himself. The heavier his heart's desire to kill Louis was, the more satisfying it would be when he achieved his goal, and the deeper the confusion in his heart would be.  Being too obsessed with one thing always brings some negative effects. When he has completely accomplished it, what will support him to keep living?  Xu Nuo could not possibly be resurrected, and his heartache could not be healed. He feared that his son, in the path of revenge, would go too far and ultimately harm himself.  This was his heartfelt advice.  He had not spent a day out of the shadows for many years, not a day of happiness, until he had them, mother and child. He didn't want Ningning to walk the path he had taken, to be lonely for life.  "Daddy, what are you talking about? I don't understand," Ningning said with an elegant and light laugh, his slightly childish fingers tapping aimlessly on the keyboard, his gaze drifting out the window, not looking at Ye Shaoshao.  How could he not understand? But his heart knot, no one could understand.  Without having lost, one could never understand that kind of despair that gnaws at the heart. Occasionally, he would sit alone on the balcony and look at the sky of Liya, thinking that slaughtering the mafia might lessen the hatred in his heart.  His heart had become cruel.  "Really don't understand?" Ye Shaoshao asked sternly, his son was too smart and too mature. The way father and son got along had always been friendly and familial. He had never had such a serious conversation with Ningning nor had he ever been angry with him.  This son was too perfect.  He wouldn't make you angry, was obedient and filial, smart and lovable. He wouldn't have any flaws for you to catch and educate him on. His thoughts were meticulous, rigorous, and sensible.  Because he was too smart, it was even more worrying when he was stubborn.  Ningning remained silent, his youthful face had already lost its babyishness, and his profile was completely engulfed in the night. He lacked the warm, elegant smile of the daytime and the gentle and adorable softness he showed in front of Cheng Anya.  His demeanor was cold and intimidating, with thoughts swirling in his eyes.  It was very quiet in the room. The moon in Liya was rarely full, always missing a bit, and the moonlight seemed much colder. Such pouring down made one feel a chill.  "Ningning, you've grown up, and you don't listen to my words anymore?" Ye Shaoshao's voice contained a hint of anger.  Ningning's silence hit right at his guess.  "Daddy, I know my limits," Ningning said softly. Too much malice was not a good thing; he indeed had the intention of a massive killing spree. What did it matter if it was cruel? But...  "Ningning, if you punish yourself, then Xu Nuo's death will have no meaning," Ye Shaoshao said gravely, "If it were your mommy, she definitely would not want me to become a cruel person who only understands hate and not love."  Doesn't understand love? Maybe, it's said that one who hates for too long really doesn't know how to love anymore. Even if Louis died, it might not relieve the hatred in his heart, but afterward, who would he go on to hate?  For the first time, Ningning felt the image of Ye Chen in his heart become so grand. The hand resting on his shoulder also seemed so powerful.  "Daddy, I understand."  Ye Shaoshao patted Ningning's shoulder, speaking earnestly, "I hope you really understand and come out of the shadows soon."  After saying this, he stood up and left.  Ningning watched as Ye Shaoshao's figure disappeared at the doorway, remaining silent. Since Xu Nuo's death, it was the first time someone had talked to him like this. He didn't know what to feel.  A bit angry, but that person was his daddy; he couldn't be angry.  A bit shocked, it turned out daddy had always been silent, but he saw right through his heart knot.  Also a bit moved, because he felt that no matter how old a child is, how smart they are, in the eyes of their parents, there's nothing to hide, all emotions are exposed.  Before, he thought that not having a dad was no big deal, he could make Cheng Anya's life worry-free.  After knowing Ye Chen, he liked this daddy. He did everything to matchmake them, wanting a complete family. In fact, for him, having a daddy meant having one more person who loved him, and also one more person for him to love.  He wasn't sure what the warm feeling in his heart was at the moment. It wasn't until many years later, when he looked back, that he realized how important the role of a father is in a son's life.  Subconsciously, he took his words to heart, which is why he didn't go to extremes and take a deviant path. 
Chapter 437: Hitting a Wall  At this moment, as the Blue Silver Golden Light Array was activated, the flames suddenly dimmed, sucked and guided downward. However, the Fire Calabash was clearly not so easy to deal with; it forcefully sucked upwards, snatching away a portion of the flames and then, with a "whoosh," shot to the side, breaking out of the range of the Blue Silver Golden Light Array.  These rapid changes were dizzying.  Tough to deal with, this person!  Must take her down quickly, otherwise the enforcers will arrive.  The Fire Calabash spewed flames downward, and the woman reappeared, her eyes filled with murderous intent, "What are you doing?"  As she spoke, a flash of golden light under her feet, a circle of beautiful patterns quietly emerged, and the woman's body instantly stiffened.  Tang Wulin's Blue Silver Grass wound upwards opportunely, Ye Xinglan's Stargod Sword pointed directly at the opponent's chest, and Xie Xie had already silently reached behind her, with the Light Dragon Dagger poised at her neck.  Everything was a set up!  Is there anything better than Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Chains for dealing with a single opponent?  The absolute establishment of the Starlight Chains was a heaven-defying existence!  Just as everyone breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had taken down the opponent, an unexpected change occurred!  The Stargod Sword had reached her front, and the sharp edge of the Light Dragon Dagger had also reached her neck. Under the threat to her life, the woman's eyes suddenly brightened.  A loud phoenix cry sounded from her body, followed by a burst of soul power from within her body, unparalleled in strength.  As if stimulated, under her clothes, circles of fiery red light shone, resembling rings but appearing to be inside the clothes, located at her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, knees, and other places.  In the next instant, these fiery red lights appeared, and a formidable soul power burst forth from the woman.  Many times stronger than before, the soul power rose and transformed into a huge ring of fire that surged out. The Fire Calabash in the air displayed a layer of fine golden patterns, and the originally one-foot-tall Fire Calabash shot up to two feet, growing several sizes larger.  The powerful fire element fluctuation burst out instantly, the violent impact forcibly sent Tang Wulin and the others flying, and the flames burned their soul power like a bone-chewing maggot.  The phoenix cry became louder and louder, and the woman exuded an authoritative aura. Immediately after, pieces of dark red armor rapidly appeared, covering her entire body.  A phoenix helmet covered her head, and the dark red armor extended to both sides, with an elegant streamline shape that extended downwards and curved, outlining the female form. Her shoulders were wrapped in soft lines, covering her entire arms.  The dark red flame patterns spread across the armor, and on the breastplate, there was a golden-red phoenix design. The armor was not particularly magnificent, but with it on, the woman's presence had risen several levels.  "Battle Armor!" Tang Wulin blurted out, his face filled with a bitter smile.  Yes, this was battle armor! Judging from its complexity and energy fluctuations, it should be one-word battle armor, and the rings that appeared on the woman's body were storage tools for the battle armor.  One-word battle armor could not be integrated into the body of the armor master.  Even so, this was a complete set of one-word battle armor! Meaning, the woman, who originally had a five-ring cultivation, had her strength directly elevated to the level of a seven-ring Soul Saint.  Yan Feng was very angry at this moment. She had been in a particularly good mood today, very happy. She had gone to the Spirit Transmission Pagoda just to register, to officially become a one-word battle armor master.  Battle armor masters were top existences that any organization would be willing to support. Just now, during the contract signing, the Spirit Transmission Pagoda promised her a series of welfare policies. At twenty-seven, she was one of the youngest battle armor masters in Spirit City, with a limitless future.  The Spirit Transmission Pagoda had agreed to assist her with a substantial amount of resources in the future to help her make a breakthrough to a two-word battle armor master. Once she became a two-word battle armor master, that would be a true battle armor master, with a place on the entire continent.  But who would have thought that just as she was happily leaving the Spirit Transmission Pagoda, she was attacked by this group of young kids.  Moreover, their abilities were quite strong. If she hadn't used her battle armor, she might have really been caught off guard.  She had no idea Tang Wulin and the others had no malicious intent. The Stargod Sword and the Light Dragon Dagger made her feel the threat of death.  At that moment, the voice of Wutian sounded in the ears of Tang Wulin and his group of six, "You just need to defeat her, and you will be considered to have passed this city."  Tang Wulin's mouth twitched, Teacher Wutian, you also have a dark side! This is a complete one-word battle armor master, equivalent to the power of a seven-ring Soul Saint level expert, can we really win against her?  Without waiting for more thoughts, Yan Feng had already made her move. Her powerful soul power surged instantly, and with a point of her right hand at Tang Wulin, the Fire Calabash above her head immediately spouted a line of fire that reached Tang Wulin in an instant.  At this point, they could only give it a try; explanations were undoubtedly useless.  From the look in her eyes, it was clear she had been angered.  They were not in the right in this situation! First deal with it.  Tang Wulin took a deep breath, the three purple soul rings on his body suddenly disappeared, and golden light rings emerged. The rings blossomed, his right arm swelled, and golden dragon scales spread. At the same time, dazzling star lines quickly condensed in his right hand, and the battle armor gauntlet appeared.  Facing a true battle armor master, how could he not give it his all?  "Battle Armor?" Yan Feng was also startled when she saw the battle armor on Tang Wulin's right hand.  The words 'impossible' flashed through her mind!  How old was he? Moreover, she clearly saw that Tang Wulin's battle armor emerged directly from his body, could it be that he had two-word battle armor?  Although it was just a piece of armor, having battle armor at such a young age was simply unimaginable. When she first had her piece of armor, she was already twenty-one, and that was considered a prodigy.  She had been practicing hard over the years and finally became a true one-word battle armor master.  But how old were these kids in front of her?  As Tang Wulin activated his power, the others also moved quickly.  Xu Lizhi had already retreated far away, without saying more, one bun after another flew out from his hands, Light and Nimble Steamed Buns, Bloodthirsty Red Bean Buns, one for each person.  Tang Wulin's left hand was behind him, already catching the two buns that came his way, without hesitation, he stuffed them into his mouth.  They had to fight quickly.  Even if it was just one-word battle armor, once the full set was assembled, it also had the ability to help the soul master quickly recover soul power.  If they fought a protracted battle with her, they would not stand a chance.  With a stomp on the ground, a thunderous noise erupted, and Tang Wulin shot forward like an arrow, his right arm shielding his front, the blood in his body boiling and the aura of the Golden Dragon King surging out. His eyes turned completely golden, and the blood energy radiating from his body was fierce.  His right hand, the Golden Dragon Claw, blocked in front of him, bracing against the opponent's flames, pushing forward against them head-on.  As the team leader, and also as a power-type battle soul master, he absolutely could not retreat now. Only by blocking the front could his companions have a chance.  Under the stimulation of the Bloodthirsty Red Bean Bun, his own soul power and blood energy instantly peaked, and his whole body's skin showed faint golden scales, especially on the right hand, right arm, and right chest, where the scales were particularly dazzling.  He had twin martial souls?  Yan Feng was stunned.  "Hmph!" She did not dodge, and the Fire Calabash above her head suddenly started spinning, the original line of fire turned into a large swath of flames that swept over Tang Wulin's head, covering his companions and blocking the others.  She wanted to isolate Tang Wulin and deal with this obviously leading little guy first.  The Golden Dragon Claw reached her in a flash, and Yan Feng's right hand also came up, clenched into a fist, and met it head-on.  Just as the two were about to collide, the dragon roar inside Tang Wulin suddenly intensified, and a huge golden dragon head, over two feet in diameter, appeared without warning, directly swallowing Yan Feng's right arm.  Golden Dragon Shock!  After eating the Red Jade Shrimp that day, although Tang Wulin's blood energy had not broken through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, it had greatly improved, allowing him to control the Golden Dragon Shock more skillfully.  Yan Feng was also startled, only feeling a great force coming head-on, and then, the punch she threw out, the flames were devoured as if by a giant clamp, and the Golden Dragon Claw grasped her right hand.  As the Golden Dragon Claw exerted force, Yan Feng's one-word battle armor lit up, all the flame patterns on it came alive, especially the fire phoenix on her chest, which actually moved and turned into a phoenix flame shadow rushing straight at Tang Wulin's chest.  This is... Chapter 438: Big Sister, I Think This Is a Misunderstanding  At this moment, the calabash on her head was also free to act. With a flash of her soul rings, Yan Feng spat out a golden-red fireball that seemed almost solid, shooting straight towards Tang Wulin's chest. This was battle armor! Defensive and offensive integrated battle armor!  Tang Wulin could clearly feel his own Golden Dragon Claw's powerful strength and characteristics being dispersed and neutralized in every corner of the opponent's battle armor upon contact, making it impossible to even activate its smashing properties. Then came the opponent's powerful counterattack.  No matter how strong Tang Wulin was, with the support of Golden Dragon Terrifying Roar and the gauntlet battle armor, he was at most equivalent to a four-ringed Soul Ancestor. However, his opponent was a genuine one-word battle armor master!  He exerted force in his right arm, trying to fling the opponent away. In terms of strength, Tang Wulin was quite confident in himself. At the same time, a Blue Silver Grass emerged from under him, pushing against the ground to abruptly change his direction, attempting to dodge the phoenix and the fireball. But both attacks were actually able to change direction, following his movements and continuing to pursue him.  Just then, an ice spear silently arrived, striking right on the fire phoenix, which exploded instantly. The powerful explosion sent Tang Wulin flying backward.  The difference in soul power was too great! Even with the support of the Bloodthirsty Dou Sha Bao, Tang Wulin felt as if his insides were burning after the blast. Crossing sword silks formed a net, blocking the pursuing golden-red fireball, which exploded again, and Ye Xinglan's muffled groan followed.  In terms of actual combat experience and fighting skills, Tang Wulin and his team were not weaker than Yan Feng, but the problem was the huge gap in soul power levels. With her one-word battle armor, her defense was something Tang Wulin and his team currently found very difficult to break through.  Xie Xie silently appeared behind Yan Feng, his Light Dragon Dagger and Shadow Dragon Dagger striking simultaneously at Yan Feng's shoulders. But the battle armor covering her entire body flashed, and in the next instant, a fiery red light burst forth, repelling him.  Unable to break through the defense, how could they continue to fight? Yan Feng quickly took control of the situation.  At that moment, a sense of threat suddenly came over her. Without any warning, an additional dazzling light sphere appeared in her field of vision, presenting four colors: blue, red, yellow, and green. The four-colored halo flowed around the fist-sized light sphere, which was rapidly approaching her.  Yan Feng did not dare to be negligent. Her fourth soul ring lit up, and the calabash on her head suddenly swelled a bit before a series of golden-red fireballs were ejected. These fireballs, like a barrage of cannonballs, immediately blocked the path of the four-colored light sphere.  A violent roaring sound ensued, and for a moment, the air was filled with an intense elemental storm.  Tang Wulin had already landed, running his Xuan Tian Gong to calm the burning sensation within his body. His physique was robust, and he was not injured. But this battle, it really couldn't continue! Now it was all up to Gu Yue.  It turned out that the defensive power of the one-word battle armor could truly withstand the test. The elemental storm raged for a good five or six seconds before gradually subsiding, and Yan Feng still stood there, unmoved. The golden-red flame light flowed on her battle armor, not dimming in the slightest, and the calabash above her head was once again aimed at Tang Wulin.  "Big Sister, I think, I think this is a misunderstanding," Tang Wulin said with a wry smile.  At that moment, a piercing alarm sounded, and not far away, three figures were rapidly approaching. They were three mechas, but unlike the purple-ranked mechas in Tian Dou City, these three were all yellow and did not have any purple-ranked mechas.  "Cease fire!" A synthesized voice shouted.  Yan Feng, who was about to make a move, had to stop, the mouth of the calabash pointing upwards as she let out a cold snort and glared angrily at Tang Wulin.  Then she suddenly realized with surprise that the boy who had previously taken the initiative to attack her now had a face full of sorrow and anger.  The three mechas descended from the sky, their huge ten-meter-tall bodies instantly separating the two parties.  "Wow!" Cries suddenly rang out as Xu Xiaoyan, holding onto Ye Xinglan beside her, began to cry loudly.  Xie Xie lowered his head, filled with a sense of loss, while Ye Xinglan looked a bit dazed. Xu Lizhi crouched on the ground, Gu Yue was expressionless, but a hint of a smile flashed in her eyes.  Tang Wulin stood tall, pulling Gu Yue behind him, his face showing even more intense sorrow and anger.  "Enforcer, you've arrived just in time; please save us. If you had come a moment later, we would have been burned to death by her."  "What?" Yan Feng was still not able to react for a moment. It was clear that they were the ones who had attacked first!  The voice from inside the mecha said, "What exactly happened here? Why did you attack these young people, one-word battle armor master?"  Yan Feng, who had only recently registered as a one-word battle armor master at the Spirit Pagoda, was not recognized by the enforcers. However, there was a clear sense of vigilance when they mentioned the words "one-word battle armor master."  Although they had three mechas, just yellow-ranked mechas plus their cultivation, they were definitely not a match for a one-word battle armor master.  "Don't listen to them blaming others first; they were clearly the ones who attacked me first," Yan Feng said angrily.  Tang Wulin blinked his beautiful big eyes, looking terrified as he said: "You, what are you saying? We attacked you? You're a one-word battle armor master! We're just a few small soul masters. Uncle Enforcer, I'm fourteen years old this year, and my youngest companion is only thirteen. Do you think we would dare to take on a one-word battle armor master?"  Yan Feng was almost driven mad with anger, her body trembling slightly as she said: "You're slandering me! Clearly, you were the one who attacked me first. At that time, you didn't even know I was a one-word battle armor master. We don't even know each other."  Without any hesitation, Tang Wulin said: "We don't know each other; why would we attack you? I clearly heard you say you had just become a one-word battle armor master and wanted to find someone to test your skills. Then when you saw us, you suddenly slapped me, and we had to defend ourselves. My teacher taught us that the greater the power, the greater the responsibility, but as a one-word battle armor master, you bully us children instead. How can you have the audacity to reverse right and wrong?"  Xu Xiaoyan cried even louder, nearly hanging on Ye Xinglan. Ye Xinglan turned her head away.  Xie Xie sighed deeply. After spending a long time with Tang Wulin, his acting skills had also improved significantly.  With both parties sticking to their own story, the enforcers were also a bit stunned, but without a doubt, all three of them subconsciously leaned towards Tang Wulin and his team. This was the advantage of being young; no matter how you looked at it, they didn't seem like they would provoke a one-word battle armor master.  "You all come back with us to the Spirit Pagoda to retrieve the surveillance footage and then determine who is right and wrong," the lead enforcer said in a deep voice.  "Okay!"  Tang Wulin agreed without hesitation.  Grinding her teeth, Yan Feng said: "You little scoundrel, when the evidence is laid out in front of us, I want to see how you can still confuse right and wrong."  She was really furious!  The three mechas turned around, forming a triangular formation to enclose Yan Feng in the middle. "Let's go. Please retract your battle armor."  This was clearly to guard against her suddenly fleeing!  Yan Feng was furious and shouted: "Are you blind? Can't even distinguish right from wrong? What if I don't retract it?"  The lights on the three mechas flashed simultaneously, and three soul-guided cannons were already aimed at her.  "Uncle Enforcer, you see, she is so arrogant and domineering," Tang Wulin said as he stepped back, as if afraid of being affected by any aftermath.  Yan Feng couldn't take it anymore and roared, "I'll burn you to death!" With a shake of her body, she lunged towards Tang Wulin's direction. The three mechas weren't for show, as the three soul-guided cannons fired without hesitation, and three bursts of soul-guided cannonballs exploded forth. Chapter 439: So Handsome That It Makes One's Heart Race  These enforcement officers of the Spirit Transmission Tower were well-trained. Faced with a strong opponent, they employed the most secure method. The three cannonballs were not fired at Yan Feng, but instead blasted into the air. When the three cannonballs collided with each other, they immediately unleashed a fierce energy storm.  Although Yan Feng was wearing her battle armor, she was still thrown off balance by the intense energy impact. The three mechas quickly surged forth, simultaneously taking to the air, and their soul-guided cannons fired relentlessly at her without regard for energy consumption.  Faced with a one-word battle armor master, how could they dare to hold back! Moreover, the leading enforcement officer had already called for reinforcements; they just needed to hold on for a while.  Only now did Tang Wulin and the others realize the strength of these enforcers. Back when they were in Sky Dou City, if they hadn't led the enforcers away from the start, preventing them from coordinating with each other, things would have been really difficult.   The three mechas worked together seamlessly, and the soul-guided cannons erupted wildly, forming a crossfire that covered the area without gaps.  Even though Yan Feng was very strong, her main combat power was still in her martial soul, the Fire Gourd, and her one-word battle armor had just been completed. The coordination between her martial soul and battle armor was not yet perfect, and she was actually suppressed for a moment.  Tang Wulin wouldn't let go of such a good opportunity. He took his companions and turned to run, shouting, "Everyone be careful not to get hit. Let's move further away. Enforcement Uncle, good luck!"  Xie Xie was the fastest, shooting up like a wisp of green smoke and jumping directly onto the soul-guided automobile parked not far away. The others hurriedly got into the car, and even Xu Lizhi became agile at this moment.  Stepping the accelerator to the floor, the soul-guided car emitted a piercing roar and instantly sped off.  At this time, the three enforcers' attention was all on Yan Feng. The sound of the soul-guided cannons was much louder than the car starting up, and they had no idea that Tang Wulin and the six of them had already run away. Yan Feng, too, was surrounded by energy light and didn't notice either.  Without Tang Wulin needing to say anything, Xie Xie was already weaving through the streets, speeding up the car.   "We've hit a snag; our luck is too bad. Aren't battle armor masters supposed to be extremely rare? How did we pick one that's a battle armor master?" Xu Xiaoyan's face was devoid of tears.  Tang Wulin gave a wry smile and said, "It looks like we need to change our approach. This method is too uncertain, and it also offends people. Not a good idea at all! If we continue like this, I'm afraid we'll be listed as the most unwelcome people by the Spirit Transmission Tower."  Gu Yue said, "That won't happen, not with me here."  Xie Xie exclaimed, "Boss, you're getting more and more impressive. That acting skill! Incredible."  Tang Wulin said irritably, "You think I wanted to do that? With the strength of that battle armor master, a few mechas definitely couldn't deal with her. If we hadn't said that at the time, once we were caught in the Spirit Transmission Tower, even if we could find a way to escape later, it would definitely delay a lot of time. We'll find a way to apologize to them later."  At the Spirit Transmission Tower.  "Slap!" Yan Feng slapped her hand on the metal table in front of her, sparks flying, "Now you all understand, right? Those little rascals are just swindlers, was it they who attacked me first?"  Looking at the surveillance screen displaying the footage, the enforcers were speechless.  Yan Feng had just managed to break out from the encirclement of the three mechas and discovered that Tang Wulin and his group had disappeared. In her anger, she wanted to chase after them, but at that moment, the enforcers' reinforcements had arrived, and three purple mechas surrounded her.  Even though a one-word battle armor master is strong, faced with six mechas, Yan Feng also had no solution. She could break through, but if she did so, today's incident would be confirmed! Therefore, she chose to surrender and was brought back to watch the video.  "Sorry, Miss Yan Feng, we have also investigated your identity. We are really sorry for before, we didn't expect these children to be so cunning at such a young age."  Yan Feng angrily said, "What are you waiting for now? Why aren't you quickly going to capture them and bring them back?"  The leading middle-aged enforcer had some difficulty saying, "I'm afraid that's not possible. Although our Spirit Transmission Tower has an exalted status, after all, it is not a federal enforcement institution. If we were to send a large number of people to search for them, it would be easy to touch the bottom line of the federal government. That would be very unfavorable for us. We have already reported the situation to the government side, and they can only pursue it. Moreover, to be honest, we have limited evidence for this matter, and most importantly, you have not suffered any injuries. Even if we catch them, we can't punish them much; at most, it would be considered provoking trouble, and they would be detained for a few days by the law enforcement authorities."  Yan Feng had calmed down a bit by now. Yes! She had not been injured, so it was really hard to convict them. They said they were thirteen or fourteen years old, which is true. Under eighteen, they would be protected by the Juvenile Protection Law, and it would be difficult to even capture them, and in the end, it would just be calling the parents to pay a fine and take them back for strict discipline.  Those little rascals, too hateful!  "Miss Yan Feng, please calm down. We apologize first for this matter."  The enforcers stood up and bowed slightly to her.  Yan Feng, seeing them like this, had most of her anger dissipate and waved her hand, saying, "Forget it. Just don't let me run into them again. If there's nothing else, I'm leaving."  The enforcers escorted her out of the Spirit Transmission Tower respectfully. As a battle armor master who had joined the Spirit Transmission Tower, the enforcers still respected her very much. Who knows, maybe one day she would become their superior!  After leaving the Spirit Transmission Tower, Yan Feng looked around, trying to find Tang Wulin and his group, but there was no trace of them. At that moment, her gaze suddenly stopped, falling in one direction. It was on a man who appeared to be about her age, with a tall figure dressed in white. His clothing was somewhat retro, with a white robe and long hair draped behind his head.  He exuded a cool and detached aura.  Yan Feng's martial soul was of the fire attribute, and her temper was also related to this aspect. When she saw the man, she suddenly found that the anger in her heart unexplainably subsided.  He was so handsome!  She instinctively swallowed and no girl disliked handsome guys, especially those with good stature and appearance.  Moreover, just at a glance, Yan Feng was surprised to find that she couldn't see through this person's cultivation level. But she could be certain that he was definitely a soul master.  A soul master stronger than me? It seems to be of the ice attribute.  As a fire attribute soul master, she had the clearest perception of ice attributes.  He's walking towards me?  Yan Feng's heartbeat began to quicken.  Initially, she was a bit unsure, but soon she realized that the man was walking directly toward her, not quickly, but very steadily. His gaze also followed her.  What clear eyes! So handsome!  From the man's eyes, Yan Feng quickly saw her own reflection, but she suddenly noticed that her image did not seem too good. Earlier, in the fight, her clothes and hair had become somewhat disheveled.  She hurriedly tried to tidy herself up, and although she felt that she was doing it as inconspicuously as possible, she still felt a bit of heat on her face.  "Hello," said the cool voice.  Yan Feng's heart skipped a beat, even the voice was so pleasant to hear, though a bit cold, but piercing to the heart!  "You, hello!" Yan Feng looked at the handsome guy close at hand, and her voice trembled a bit.  "My name is Wu Zhangkong."  The man in white nodded to her.  "Oh, my name is Yan Feng."  She instinctively gave her own name.  "I'm really sorry. Those children today, they are my disciples. They are undergoing a test, which is an end-of-term exam at the academy. So they were looking for people to spar with everywhere, without any malice. I apologize to you on their behalf."  Wu Zhangkong bowed slightly to her as a gesture.  "Oh, oh, it's okay," Yan Feng's heartbeat quickened, but the next moment, her heartbeat suddenly stopped for a second, and her pupils dilated as her voice went up by an octave, "What did you say? Those few, those... are your disciples?"  "Yes," said Wu Zhangkong.  Yan Feng's breathing became hurried, "And you taught them to attack me out of the blue?"  Wu Zhangkong was still just as cool, "Although that's not the case, I am their teacher, and it's not unreasonable for you to place the blame on me."  "You..." Yan Feng suddenly found that she was somewhat unable to say angry words.  Wu Zhangkong nodded to her again, "I apologize once again, goodbye."  With that, he turned and walked away.  "Hey!" Yan Feng called out.  Wu Zhangkong stopped and turned back, "Is there something else?"  Yan Feng said, "So you're just going to end it with an apology?"  Wu Zhangkong replied, "What else would you like?" Chapter 440: Invite Me To Dinner  Yan Feng said, "If you want to apologize sincerely, you should at least invite me to a meal, right?" When she uttered these words, she felt embarrassed for herself.  However, she was already in her twenties this year, and she had been working hard on her cultivation without having had a boyfriend. She had always thought that love at first sight was something that only happened in novels, but today she found herself embarrassingly discovering that, even though it was their first meeting, she had fallen for this cold-looking guy. He was so handsome! Never mind the rest, being handsome was enough!  "Okay," Wu Zhangkong nodded. "What do you want to eat?"  "You decide," Yan Feng said cheerfully.  A thoughtful look flashed in Wu Zhangkong's eyes, and after a moment, he said, "Come with me." He then turned and walked down the steps.  His figure was also so handsome—super handsome! Yan Feng secretly patted her chest, her pretty face turning slightly red as she quickly followed him.  Suddenly, she felt that those few little guys weren't so annoying anymore. After all, they had such a handsome teacher.  She forgave them!  This was fate!  Wu Zhangkong walked unhurriedly, with Yan Feng silently following behind him. She didn't speak to him anymore because she found that just by walking after him and watching him, it was like she was appreciating a beautiful scene.  His figure became clearer and clearer in her heart.  He indeed attracted attention, as almost every passing female, regardless of age, would subconsciously glance at him.  As a five-ringed Soul King, Yan Feng had excellent hearing, and she heard countless lovestruck voices exclaiming, "He's so handsome!" Of course, the number of times she had said it in her heart was the most.  Because she had been following him and watching him all the time!  Turning into an alley, Wu Zhangkong stopped in front of a small restaurant with a front that was less than four meters wide. Through the window, one could see inside—it had only four tables. It was nearing noon now, and the fragrance of stir-fried dishes wafted out.  Wu Zhangkong just stood there in front of the small restaurant, standing quietly, his gaze contemplative and somewhat lost. From the side, Yan Feng could clearly see that his cold eyes seemed to soften a bit.  "Ah, Zhangkong, you're here! Come on in." A man who appeared to be in his fifties, with short hair and a plump figure, came out.  He obviously recognized Wu Zhangkong and was very familiar with him. He hugged Wu Zhangkong's shoulders and ushered him inside.  If Tang Wulin and the others saw this scene, they would be so surprised that their jaws would drop. Wu Zhangkong, a man with a strong sense of cleanliness, did not get angry at all from the man's touch but instead nodded to him warmly and walked in.  Yan Feng followed him into the small restaurant.  The restaurant was really small, and the sanitary conditions were just so-so. It was a typical fly restaurant.  If it were any other man who brought her to this place, she would give him zero points in an instant. This was too stingy.  But since it was Wu Zhangkong who brought her here, her evaluation was that it was characteristic! A handsome guy is just different.  Yes, the world is just so unfair!  "Zhangkong, it's been a long time since I've seen you. How have you been?" The fat owner led him to a table by the bed.  Wu Zhangkong sat down on the inside as if he knew the place well, "I'm fine."  "This is your friend?" The fat owner finally noticed Yan Feng.  Yan Feng could not be considered beautiful, but she had a certain charm and was at the prime age of a woman, full of vitality.  "Hello," Yan Feng smiled at the fat owner and sat down across from Wu Zhangkong.  The fat owner opened his mouth, clearly a bit surprised.  "The usual," Wu Zhangkong nodded to him.  The fat owner reacted, smiled, and said, "Okay, the usual. I'll get it ready for you. That's great, Zhangkong, that's so good of you." As he spoke, he immediately rushed to the back to get busy.  With the fat owner gone, the warmth on Wu Zhangkong's face returned to coldness, and Yan Feng sat across from him. Now she could seriously look at him from the front.  His eyelashes were really long! And his eyes were so beautiful. His nose was straight, and his lips were just the right thickness.  What would it feel like if he kissed me... Ah, what am I thinking!  For no reason, Yan Feng's face turned red again.  "Do you come here often?" Yan Feng asked.  Wu Zhangkong's cold eyes seemed to focus for the first time, glancing at her, "I used to come often."  Yan Feng said, "No wonder the owner knows you."  "Mm."  Yan Feng asked, "Do you usually stay in Tianling City?"  Wu Zhangkong shook his head.  Yan Feng asked, "Then where are you?"  "Shrek," Wu Zhangkong replied.  Yan Feng asked, "How old are you this year?"  Wu Zhangkong paused for a moment and shook his head, not saying anything.  Yan Feng said, "Then let me guess, is it okay? Twenty-seven?"  Wu Zhangkong didn't make a sound.  "That's not right! Then twenty-six? It can't be twenty-eight, right?"  Wu Zhangkong's brow furrowed slightly, "Thirty-three."  "Thirty-three?" Yan Feng looked at him in surprise, "Then you really don't look it, your skin is so well-maintained. If it weren't for your mature aura, I would have thought you were just over twenty. I'm about to be twenty-seven, so you're over six years older than me."  "Mm."  Yan Feng said, "Are you always so concise when you talk?"  "Mm."  Yan Feng asked, "What's with those disciples of yours? What kind of assessment are they taking?"  Wu Zhangkong replied, "End-of-term exams."  Yan Feng snorted, "That leader kid is really not a good thing. He attacked me and then played the victim, acting so convincingly. Did you teach him that?"  Wu Zhangkong said somewhat helplessly, "That wasn't me."  Yan Feng asked, "Then who taught him?"  Wu Zhangkong's mouth twitched slightly, and Yan Feng's heart stirred, seeing Wu Zhangkong's more normal expression for the first time.  "He has a unique talent," Wu Zhangkong said helplessly.  Yan Feng said, "You should be careful when choosing disciples. It's like a young tree; as a teacher, you must ensure it grows straight and doesn't take a wrong path."  Wu Zhangkong replied, "He won't. He has a good nature."  Yan Feng pursed her lips, "I don't think so. Let's not talk about him. Let's talk about you. Are you a teacher at an academy? Which one?"  At this moment, the fat owner came up again, the dishes were ready.  Several small dishes, each with a generous portion. They were caramelized greens, fish-flavored shredded pork, Kung Pao chicken, and a pot of tofu soup.  Three dishes and one soup, with two bowls of rice.  Yan Feng was actually a bit hungry because she was so excited that she hadn't eaten breakfast.  Despite the small size of the restaurant, the dishes were full of color, aroma, and taste, making one's mouth water.  "Go ahead, don't be shy."  She picked up her bowl and started eating, adding a chopstick of fish-flavored shredded pork to her mouth, and soon her eyes widened.  "It's so delicious. I really didn't expect such a small restaurant to make such tasty food, much better than many big hotels. Really good."  Wu Zhangkong also picked up his bowl, but he ate much slower, his gaze drifting over the four dishes as if he was savoring something or feeling something.  Picking up a piece of caramelized greens, he tasted it as if reflecting on something.  While eating, Yan Feng asked, "You still haven't answered, which academy are you from?"  "Shrek," Wu Zhangkong replied indifferently.  "Shrek Academy? Ah! Shrek Academy?" Yan Feng almost dropped her bowl.  She widened her eyes at Wu Zhangkong, her voice rising a few notches, "You, you're a teacher at Shrek Academy?"  "What's wrong?" Wu Zhangkong glanced at her.  Yan Feng's expression changed slightly, "Nothing, nothing." But in her heart, she exclaimed, "Perfect!" Chapter 441: Yan Feng and Heavenly Ice  "How handsome, and he's a teacher at Shrek Academy, that's simply impeccable perfection! I really yearn for Shrek Academy! I tried to get in once but failed. It's such a pity, otherwise, I might have been able to learn from you," said Wu Zhangkong indifferently, "You wouldn't have been able to. When you were in school, I was still a student. You couldn't have been my student by age."  Yan Feng was frustrated, "Do you even know how to chat? Is this how you talk to girls?"  Wu Zhangkong remained silent, quietly eating his meal.  Yan Feng pouted, this guy!  Not long after, she couldn't help but speak again, "Since you're a teacher at Shrek Academy, you must be a Battle Armor Master, right? One-word or two-word?"  Wu Zhangkong replied, "Two-word."  Yan Feng's eyes widened in amazement, a thirty-three-year-old two-word Battle Armor Master, that's incredible! No wonder she couldn't see through his cultivation.  "I've just become a one-word Battle Armor Master and named my battle armor 'Feng.' A one-word Battle Armor Master can only use one word to name their armor. What about you? How did you name your two-word battle armor? It's frustrating to say, my martial soul is the Fire Gourd. Usually, people name their armor after their martial soul or their spirit. How should I name mine? I can't just call it Gourd, so I used my own name. What are your two words?"  Wu Zhangkong said, "Heavenly Ice."  Yan Feng commented, "That sounds nice. Why did you name it that? Your martial soul is ice attribute, right? That's why you named it so."  Wu Zhangkong looked up at her, "Heaven is part of my martial soul's name, and Ice is my wife's name. We shouldn't talk while eating, let's eat."  His wife's name? His wife's name! Yan Feng was stunned. She should have thought of this earlier; with his qualities, how could he not have a woman?  A huge sense of loss made her appetite vanish.  For the rest of the meal, they ate in silence, with Wu Zhangkong not eating much. His mind was in a completely different world.  ...  "Wow, Zhangkong, I love the candied yellow vegetables from this place. It's hard to imagine that eggs can be made so delicious. I'll learn how to make it well and cook it for you at home, okay?"  "Hey, save some tofu for me! I heard eating tofu is good for the skin. Although my skin is a bit better than yours, I still need to work hard."  "The fish-flavored shredded pork is really appetizing, can I have another half bowl of rice? Do you think I'll get fat?"  "Look at you, so clumsy, you've got rice on your face. Ugh, I'm not going to kiss it off for you, hey, don't rub against me!"  ...  After leaving the small restaurant, it was midday.  Yan Feng smiled at Wu Zhangkong, "Thank you for the lunch."  Wu Zhangkong shook his head, "I'm leaving."  "Can I have your soul communicator number? I'm going to the Spirit Pagoda later to have them cancel the report they filed at the government office for your disciples today. I'll let you know once it's done."  Wu Zhangkong hesitated for a moment but eventually recited a string of numbers.  "Can I look for you at Shrek Academy to have a meal together?" Yan Feng asked with a smile.  Wu Zhangkong glanced at her, "I'm leaving, goodbye." After saying that, he turned and left.  Yan Feng watched his retreating figure disappear before she withdrew her gaze and sighed, "All the good men are already taken. When will I find a good man like that? It seems Tianling City is too secluded, I should also go to Shrek City, now that I'm a one-word Battle Armor Master. There should be opportunities for me to seek development there. I'll have the Spirit Pagoda transfer me."  The soul-guided car sped on the highway, heading straight for the next city.  Their mission in Tianling City was considered a failure; they had to change their route and pass through another city.  After much deliberation, they couldn't think of a faster way than to attract soul masters to act and then trouble the enforcers at the Spirit Pagoda.  So, they had to take the old path.  Luck wouldn't always be bad; it fluctuates. In the following cities, they did not encounter any more difficulties and completed the exam tasks quite smoothly.  They had successfully impersonated inspectors and had passed through several cities. Soon, they had completed over half of their tasks.  "It's the fourth day. We need to speed up. Let's complete two more today, another two tomorrow, and then we'll reach Ming City the day after tomorrow. In Ming City, we don't even need to find the Spirit Pagoda to easily locate powerful soul masters. After all, it's the headquarters of the Federation. When we get there, we need to be more discreet," Tang Wulin said as he looked at the map and spoke to his companions.  As they journeyed, they went from initial tension to relaxation. Indeed, reading thousands of books and traveling thousands of miles was meaningful. During the process of completing the exam tasks, they encountered troubles but managed to solve them all. The most troublesome was the encounter with Yan Feng. However, that battle allowed them to fully realize how powerful a Battle Armor Master could be.  As students of Shrek Academy, even in a six-on-one situation, they had a chance of victory against a five-ring Soul King, let alone a six-ring Soul Emperor. But facing a beginning armor master was completely out of their league, as they couldn't even break through the defense.  "Wulin, I know a place in Ming City that's suitable for us to complete our final exam," Ye Xinglan suddenly said.  "Oh? What place?" Tang Wulin asked curiously.  Ye Xinglan said, "Ming City used to have an academy that was a significant competitor of our Shrek Academy ten thousand years ago. To this day, they are still one of the top academies on the continent, although they can't compare to our Shrek anymore. But in the Federation, they are still a leading academy. Why don't we go there and challenge them?"  Hearing her suggestion, Gu Yue immediately reacted, "You're talking about the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, right? That's also an academy with over ten thousand years of heritage."  "Yes," Ye Xinglan's eyes shone with excitement, "I've long heard about the grudges between there and our academy. I think, if we can complete the last battle of our final exam there, it would be the most valuable."  Tang Wulin's eyes lit up, "That makes sense, I think we can do it."  "That's settled then," Ye Xinglan clenched her fists firmly.  "Stop talking about that, let's deal with the problem in front of us first," Xie Xie's somewhat unstable voice rang out.  Everyone looked through the windshield forward, and they were stunned.  In the distance, over twenty mechas were lined up in a row, including five purple mechas and fifteen yellow mechas, blocking the highway.  There were no soul-guided cars stopped on the road, apparently, they had just landed.  The emblems on the chests of these mechas indicated that they were from the Spirit Pagoda.  After completing five exams, they had finally been tracked down by the Spirit Pagoda.  "Wulin, what do we do?" Xie Xie stepped on the brakes to slow down, urgently asking Tang Wulin.  Tang Wulin's eyes narrowed slightly, and those familiar with him knew that this was a sign he was about to explode.  "Stop the car!" Tang Wulin shouted, his left elbow striking out forcefully, and with a "bang," the entire car door flew off.  He grabbed the roof of the car and flipped out.  His actions told his companions what to do; he would never surrender without a fight.  Even if they were caught, it wouldn't be a big problem—just paying a fine and apologizing. But they might also be sent back to Shrek Academy, which would be a huge embarrassment. And then, it would be difficult to complete the final exam.  In the history of Shrek Academy, there had never been a case where a class leader was eliminated. Tang Wulin did not want to be the first, nor did he want his companions to be disqualified with him.  Xie Xie stomped on the brake and turned the steering wheel sharply. The soul-guided car immediately crashed towards the guardrail.  All of them were formidable soul masters, and even Xu Lizhi had Tang Sect's protective techniques. When the car crashed into the guardrail, they had already scattered and escaped.  Gu Yue held onto Xu Xiaoyan and shouted, "Blizzard."  Xu Xiaoyan's martial soul was activated as they rushed out of the car, and her third soul ring lit up instantly. Supported by Gu Yue's Elemental Tide, the blizzard quickly spread out from her body.  There were forests and fields on both sides of the highway.  Tang Wulin shouted, "Into the woods, quick!" He shouted to his companions, but he himself did not move.  The soul-guided mechas had already taken off when they saw them change direction, with soul-guided cannons aimed at their direction, rapidly approaching. Chapter 442: The Almighty Gu Yue  Mech armor flight, though it has an acceleration process, is extremely rapid and cannot be compared to their current speed. Only by threading through the forest would there be a sliver of chance. Moreover, Tang Wulin had another reliance; these mech armors belonged to Spirit Pagoda, not the official authorities. Spirit Pagoda mech armors would not dare to kill recklessly, as the Federation's order could not be disrupted.  Therefore, Tang Wulin determined that these mech armors' purpose was to capture them, not to kill them. With such a judgment, he had some confidence in leading his companions to escape.  As expected, those mech armors flying in the air all withdrew their soul-guided cannons and flew toward them with bare hands. Leading the way were five purple mech armors, zooming towards them like bolts of lightning.  Tang Wulin tapped his toes on the ground, leaping into the air. Golden light flickered as his Golden Dragon Body burst forth, his body expanding and scales emerging. His right arm suddenly swelled, and his battle armor gauntlet appeared.  In an instant, he elevated himself to his strongest combat state. With the sound of dragon roars inside him, Tang Wulin took a deep breath, circled his hands in front of him, placed his left hand on the battle armor on his right forearm, and, with a fierce shout, unleashed a claw strike into the void. His blood qi ran in reverse, Golden Dragon Shocking Heaven, Golden Dragon Fright Claw!  He channeled all his soul power through his hands into his right Golden Dragon Claw, driving his Golden Dragon Fright Claw with the Golden Dragon Shocking Heaven. Before this final exam, he had not dared to do so, as his right Golden Dragon Claw would feel overwhelmed, but with the continuous increase in blood qi after coming out this time, although he had not broken through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, his body's tolerance had clearly become much stronger.  Five splendid claw shadows swept out in the air, cold and sharp. The edges emitted a dark golden luster, while the back of the blades was brilliant gold, faintly showing dragon scale patterns.  At the moment of being unleashed, these claw shadows were only five feet long, but they swelled rapidly in the wind. In a blink of an eye, they turned into several tens of meters in size. Although they became more illusory as they grew larger, they managed to block the way of the five purple mech armors.  The five purple mech armors were also startled by this scene. A soul master's attack range was proportional to their strength. They naturally took Tang Wulin's golden light aura for soul rings, but since when were there golden soul rings? Moreover, with such a large control range of the claw shadow, their first reaction was to activate their protective shields to the maximum and defend with all their might.  "Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom—" Five thunderous booms exploded in the air, and the five mech armors were blasted flying backward. The mech armor that bore the brunt of the core power of the Golden Dragon Fright Claw had its protective shield filled with cracks and was almost shattered.  From a distance, this scene was absolutely shocking. Facing twenty mech armors, that small figure soared into the sky, and with one claw strike, five purple mech armors were swept away. What a domineering presence!  Although the fifteen yellow mech armors closely followed, seeing the five purple mech armors blasted away by Tang Wulin, they hesitated and didn't dare to charge directly. The power that could blast away purple mech armors could very likely tear apart their own mech armors!  Tang Wulin landed with a thud, touched the ground with his toes, and flew backward, vanishing into the blizzard that had already formed behind him.  A soft little hand swiftly grasped his, and they sprinted away. The blizzard unleashed jointly by Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan was beyond an ordinary thousand-year soul ring ability, especially when only aiming to block the line of sight and detection without considering the attack power. In just a short while, it had already covered hundreds of square meters, with the blizzard raging in the air. A tornado whirled out, carrying snowflakes and greatly obstructing the mech pilots' vision.  Tang Wulin's strike not only blocked their pursuit but also had a considerable deterrent effect. Those purple-ranked mech pilots had no confidence they could come out unscathed in a one-on-one situation.  Therefore, they didn't dare to scatter to search but had to gather together, using the radar attached to the mech armors to search. However, the method to counter mech radar was something Shrek Academy had taught very early on. The energy fluctuations in the blizzard were chaotic, making it almost impossible for the radar to function effectively.  Tang Wulin was pulled forward as they ran. Suddenly, he felt empty space beneath his feet, and his body sank downwards. While he was shocked, he found his footing again, then realized it had gone dark before his eyes. The light had suddenly disappeared.  Then, a ball of golden light lit up, and he could see the situation clearly. It was a small space, surrounded by dirt, and all his companions were here, with Gu Yue being the one who had pulled his hand. The golden light was coming from her hand.  She let go of Tang Wulin's hand, didn't speak, and the light in her eyes shone. Elemental Tide and Elemental Control, two big soul skills, were released at the same time. Suddenly, Tang Wulin felt the ground beneath him slowly sinking, and even more incredibly, the dirt above closed by itself, as if it was continuously swallowing them up.  The other companions looked at Gu Yue with awe, even the haughty Ye Xinglan had brilliance in her beautiful eyes at this moment. The control of earth elements at this moment was simply a divine skill! The earth elements below were undoubtedly the richest, and Gu Yue, with her cultivation, controlled the dirt, plunging them deeper down. The dirt could block most scans, and the further away from the surface, the less likely they were to be detected.  They were naturally safe as well. They say there is no road in the sky and no door to the earth, but Gu Yue had opened this door for them. Those mech pilots from Spirit Pagoda could never dream that they could escape underground, and there was no way to pursue them unless they used soul-guided cannons to bombard the area immediately, but these mech pilots belonged to Spirit Pagoda, and Tang Wulin and his companions hadn't committed any grave crimes, at most they were only causing trouble, so how could they mobilize such a large operation!  After a good ten minutes, Gu Yue, with sweat on her forehead, stopped controlling the earth elements. "Everyone, control your breathing. The air underground is thin," Tang Wulin said to his companions. They couldn't escape the pursuit only to suffocate underground.  "No problem," Gu Yue said. She flicked her left hand, and a ball of water floated in mid-air. She gently rubbed her right hand on the water ball, and it gradually shrank, making the air in this underground space much more comfortable.  "The teacher taught me a method to separate water elements, which can create the oxygen we need. There won't be a problem for a short time."  "Gu Yue, you're simply all-capable!" Xu Xiaoyan exclaimed in admiration.  Gu Yue smiled slightly, "Let's not talk about this, they probably can't find us now. We'll go out later. But what do we do next? Spirit Pagoda is searching for us, and all the cities with Spirit Pagoda branches must have received the message and will be on high alert. Our previous method won't work. We need to change."  Tang Wulin's eyes narrowed slightly, "The cities we're going to next are all big cities. Big cities will certainly have soul master academies. There won't be a lack of soul masters with higher cultivation than us. We can do this..."  His train of thought was still the one that had surfaced because of the proposal of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. Since the Spirit Pagoda's route was no longer viable, they would do it this way.  An entire hour later, Gu Yue finally controlled the dirt to push them back to the surface. Sure enough, the mech armors had disappeared without a trace.  However, to their frustration, the car was also smashed and couldn't be driven.  Tang Wulin had already checked the map before. From where they were to the next city was less than two hundred kilometers. With no other options, there was only one option: run!  With Gu Yue's wind element control and Xu Lizhi's Lightening Small Bun, Tang Wulin carried a bit of Xu Lizhi, and Ye Xinglan helped Xu Xiaoyan. The six of them could only rely on their legs, following a small road near the highway towards the next city. Chapter 443: Crashing the Party!  Two hundred kilometers was nothing for someone with a strong body like Tang Wulin, but Xu Lizhi suffered quite a bit. Even with the support of his recovery big meat buns and agile xiao long bao, after two hundred kilometers, he felt like he had lost a circle of weight.  "Spirit Pagoda!" Xu Lizhi swung his fists viciously.  "What do you want to do?" Gu Yue asked softly.  Xu Lizhi glanced at her, "I will never sell buns to them again!"  Ye Xinglan said disdainfully, "Look at your ambition."  Tang Wulin pondered, "The original plan for today was to run to two cities, but now it seems we can only cover one city. Let's rest for a while, and this afternoon we will go find the academy."  They stayed at a small hotel, and being soul masters, they recovered quickly. Tang Wulin also took the opportunity to inquire about the location of the soul master academy.  The city they were currently in was called Tianding City, which was about two thousand kilometers away from Mingdu, and they would pass through several other cities in between. Without a car and no money to buy one, they decided to continue on the soul-guided train heading west after completing their mission.  Tianding City indeed had a soul master academy, which Tang Wulin found out after some inquiries was quite famous and called Tianding Starry Sky Academy.  This was a special soul master academy that only recruited soul masters with flying-type martial souls.  It also had an advanced academy that trained high-level soul masters, mecha masters, and battle armor masters.  As for training battle armor masters, everyone agreed there was no need to take it too seriously.  The average graduation age for the advanced academy was between twenty-two to twenty-five years old. Even in Shrek Academy, students who could complete one-word battle armor at this age were few and far between, let alone other academies.  "That's the one!" Tang Wulin decided. While the others were resting, he was not tired and rented a soul-guided communication device at the hotel, dialing a number.  "Master uncle," Tang Wulin greeted respectfully.  "Wulin, how is the final exam going? Is everything smooth?" Zhentai's gentle voice came through.  Tang Wulin replied, "Not very smooth, there's a little trouble. It's like this, I need to earn some more money to continue with the later exams. I am in Tianding City now, and because I don't have a blacksmith badge, I can't take on forging tasks. Could you please speak to the local blacksmith association on my behalf, so I can take on a fusion forging or spirit forging task, and also borrow a pair of forging hammers? After completing the task, I will directly exchange it for some travel expenses."  Zhenhai was somewhat speechless, "You really have it tough. Just go over there, you don't need to forge anything, your forging level combined with your age, could cause some unnecessary trouble. I will ask Tianding Blacksmith Association to give you some money to spend."  "Then thank you, master uncle." Tang Wulin secretly gave a thumbs up – having such a master uncle was indeed great!  Zhenhai chuckled, "No need to thank me, we're family. Whenever you have time, come over to the headquarters to play."  "Definitely," Tang Wulin said without hesitation, not to mention the help that the godly blacksmith's guidance would bring to his future forging, but the delicious food at master uncle’s place was irresistible!  After a trip to the Blacksmith Association, by the time his partners were rested in the afternoon, Tang Wulin had already returned from the Blacksmith Association, bringing back one million federal coins.  "Let's buy another car," Xie Xie suggested.  "What does everyone think?" Tang Wulin looked to his companions.  Ye Xinglan said, "Having a car is indeed more convenient. Although it's not as fast as the soul-guided train, it's much more convenient within the city. With the navigation system, it can save us a lot of time."  "Then buy it!"  With similar spending as last time, they bought another car of similar size.  Following the address Tang Wulin had found, the team headed straight for Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy.  The Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was located in the southwest corner of Tianding City. The academy had been established for nearly two thousand years. Although it was not as ancient as Shrek Academy, which dated back to ancient times, it was also considered to have a long history.  Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy had trained many talents and had a close cooperation with the military. In the early years when the military recruited soul-guided masters, they preferred those with flying capabilities.  Soul-guided masters could fly with the help of soul-guided devices, but those who could fly inherently had much better control in aerial combat. Even if their martial souls were not very strong, their combat effectiveness could be enhanced by soul-guided devices. At that time, the appearance of soul-guided devices greatly narrowed the gap between ordinary soul masters and genius soul masters.  With the emergence of mechas, the strength of soul masters could not even determine the outcome of a battle for a long time.  It was only after the appearance of battle armor that the strong soul masters regained their advantage.  Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was a college that focused on training soul-guided masters, especially flying soul-guided masters. Therefore, the mecha masters they trained were very famous in the federation and were scarce talents in various military regions.  With the support of the military, Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy developed very quickly. Besides those ancient top-tier academies, they were also considered to be among the best of the second-tier academies.  A regular soul-guided car stopped in an alley not far from Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy.  Six people got out of the car, all dressed in green sportswear. Green was always a very eye-catching color.  Leading them was Tang Wulin, who had just purchased the sportswear. Green represented the color of Shrek.  The main entrance of Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was very cool, made of metal, over twenty meters high and forty meters wide, allowing even mechas to pass through easily.  The walls were tall, and looking at the covered area, it was quite impressive. A large area in the southwest of Tianding City belonged to them.  Tang Wulin led his companions to the main entrance and gave Xie Xie a look.  Xie Xie's mouth twitched slightly, taking out something - two long bamboo poles supporting a banner.  The banner unfolded, about ten meters wide, white with a dozen green characters written on it, which were not very well written but still legible to anyone who saw it.  He and Xu Lizhi held one end each, raising the banner, sticking the bamboo poles into the ground.  The entrance of Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was bustling with activity. As soon as they raised this banner, it immediately attracted the attention of many passersby.  A passerby read aloud subconsciously, "We come from Shrek Academy and challenge your academy's strongest team under twenty years old."  Is this a challenge to the academy? Yes, this was the method Tang Wulin came up with: simple, crude, direct, and time-saving.  There were guards at the gate of the Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy. It was still early, and the students had just begun to enter the school gate. Many people stopped and watched curiously when they saw this scene. Some were surprised, some frowned, some were angry, and some were curious.  Soon, the front of the academy was crowded with people.  Shrek Academy? The most attractive thing to them was undoubtedly the three words "Shrek." For any student, these three words had an extraordinary meaning - that was the stuff of legends! Students from Shrek Academy have come to our academy for a challenge?  Challenge the strongest team under twenty years old? Judging by their age, they seemed to be around fifteen years old.  Tang Wulin stood at the forefront expressionlessly. He believed that such a straightforward challenge could not be refused by the Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy. If they refused, the reputation of the academy would plummet, and the psychological blow to the students would undoubtedly be huge.  "Are you really from Shrek Academy?" A seventeen or eighteen-year-old youth approached Tang Wulin and asked in a deep voice.  Tang Wulin nodded, "Hello, we are from Shrek, and we hope to have a match with your academy for the purpose of exchange and learning."  The youth asked, "How can you prove that you are from Shrek?"  Tang Wulin smiled faintly, a flash of gold in his eyes as a golden ring of light rose abruptly from under his feet.  The golden light was dazzling, causing a burst of exclamations.  Gold? What was the situation with a golden soul ring? Even the strongest soul beasts were orange in the legends, right? Do golden soul rings really exist? It seemed like in the legends, the soul rings of gods were golden!  Little did they know that Tang Wulin's was not a normal soul ring, but a blood essence soul ring.  Tang Wulin knew his own difficulties – how could he prove his identity? There was no way to prove it, okay? All the things that could prove his identity had been taken away by the academy.  The reason he didn't release three purple soul rings was that the golden soul ring would be more shocking, and it was important to suppress the opponent first.  The young man also showed a shocked expression, involuntarily stepping back two steps. Chapter 444: The Predestined Starry Sky Soul Master Academy  At this moment, the gates of the Predestined Starry Sky Soul Master Academy opened, and several people came out. They all appeared to be over forty years old. The one in the lead was tall and burly, with some grizzled short hair standing upright, looking very spirited.  Tang Wulin had not retracted his blood soul ring, and as he emerged, he naturally saw them too. A flash of surprise passed through his eyes, and he stepped forward, then stopped.  "Shrek Academy? Are you from the outer or inner court?" asked the middle-aged man.  Tang Wulin replied, "Outer court, first grade, class leader, Tang Wulin."  Formal challenges were different from looking for a cheap fight at the Spirit Pagoda.  "Class leader?" The middle-aged man's surprise was obviously stronger than when he first saw the golden soul ring on Tang Wulin.  "Put away your banners, please come in." With that, the middle-aged man stepped aside.  Tang Wulin waved his hand, and Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi immediately packed up the banners. This was an admission threshold; once admitted, that was it. It wasn't appropriate to fight outside the door; challenging someone required giving the other party some face.  "Go to class, don't hang around here anymore." The middle-aged man waved his hand authoritatively, and he obviously had a lot of clout within the academy. The students of the Predestined Starry Sky Soul Master Academy immediately scattered like birds and beasts, each heading into the academy.  Tang Wulin and the other five followed into the academy. The academy, with its long history, not only occupied a vast area but also had an elegant environment, with many sculptures lining the roads.  The middle-aged man said, "I am the director of the educational department of the Predestined Soul Master Academy, Li Zhi Long. Our academy has a long history and is the leading advanced soul master academy in Predestined City, mainly teaching flying soul masters, soul engineers, and mecha masters. There is also a specialized postgraduate college for training battle armor masters. Are you here representing Shrek Academy?"  Hearing him mention Shrek Academy, Tang Wulin suddenly had a thought and honestly said, "We are not representing the academy. To be honest, Director Li, we represent ourselves. This is a trial from the academy, requiring us to find opponents stronger than us to battle in various major cities. They also took away all our identity proofs and equipment. We had no choice but to come here with this strategy, please forgive us. But we chose the Predestined Soul Master Academy because we know, this is the best academy in Predestined City, even the entire northwest."  Gu Yue and Ye Xinglan looked at Tang Wulin with a strange gaze. When did he become so straightforward? Had he changed?  But what surprised them even more came next. After hearing Tang Wulin's words, Director Li Zhi Long laughed heartily, "Truly, the young calf is not afraid of the tiger. Worthy of being a little monster cultivated by our Shrek Academy. You did not directly attack our school, which has already given us face. I remember, back in our batch, there was a senior who went alone to the military station for a school mission, causing a huge commotion."  Our Shrek Academy? These words left everyone stunned.  Tang Wulin was also surprised and asked, "You studied at Shrek Academy before?"  Li Zhi Long smiled and said, "Yes! I am probably about fifteen batches older than you. Unfortunately, I only barely graduated from the outer court."  Although he said it was barely, his expression was not of someone who barely managed; it was filled with pride. Being able to graduate from Shrek Academy was his life's proudest achievement.  Tang Wulin also smiled, "Then we should call you senior. Hello, senior. We are really sorry for this inconvenience. If it's not suitable, we'll leave and think of another way to complete our final exam."  Li Zhi Long waved his hand and said, "What are you talking about! You've already come. And after what you've done at the school gate, if there wasn’t some result, I wouldn't be able to explain it to the students. I will find you opponents, as you said, the strongest team under twenty years old. I also want to see how much difference there is between our students and you. Speaking of which, it has been many years since I've been back to Shrek. I really miss the Spirit Ice Plaza! Back when I was at the academy, my greatest hope was to be able to study by the Sea God Lake and enter the inner court. Unfortunately, I never managed to do that."  His eyes were filled with nostalgia as if lost in memories, and Tang Wulin also had a smile on his face.  The reason he told the truth was that he observed and analyzed the situation. When he first saw Li Zhi Long, although the director seemed very authoritative, his gaze towards them clearly carried a bit of closeness. Furthermore, the changes in Li Zhi Long's eyes during their conversation and his expression when mentioning Shrek made Tang Wulin guess some things. That's why he told the truth, and indeed, it touched the director.  The main teaching building of the Predestined Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was very impressive, nearly a hundred meters tall. From the outside, it was hard to see how many floors there were, as it was a huge domed structure. The majesty of it was almost comparable to the main teaching building of Shrek Academy, only slightly smaller in area.  Li Zhi Long first took them to a rest room, then asked, "You're only comparing soul master abilities, right? Do you use mechas?"  Tang Wulin hurriedly shook his head and said, "No, do you think the academy would let us bring mechas out?"  "Good, rest for a while, have some water, I'll go arrange things. We'll catch up later."  "When did you become so honest?" As soon as Li Zhi Long left, Xie Xie couldn't help but ask curiously.  Gu Yue said from the side, "He must have noticed something. This Director Li has a connection with our academy. That's why he told the truth, right?" She didn't understand at first, but later, as she listened to their conversation, she gradually figured it out.  Tang Wulin smiled without saying a word, just pointing to his own head.  "Cut..." Ye Xinglan snorted disdainfully.  Tang Wulin said, "Let's get ready, everyone. I think the exchange match later won't be easy. Although Director Li is our senior and supported our final exam, he now represents the Predestined Starry Sky Soul Master Academy. He will definitely choose the best students to compete with us. The soul masters here specialize in flying, which can be troublesome. Everything will proceed according to the plan we have discussed."  Everyone nodded.  Tang Wulin closed his eyes to rest. It wasn't long before Li Zhi Long returned.  "Do you need to adjust your state?" he asked as he entered the room.  Tang Wulin stood up and said, "Senior, no need. We still have to go to the next city, so it's better to finish the fight quickly and continue with the exam."  Li Zhi Long smiled and said, "As a class leader, are you afraid of being eliminated?"  Tang Wulin shook his head and said, "I'm not worried about that, but I hope to earn more points and then share them with my classmates. I hope every student in our class can stay in the end."  Li Zhi Long was visibly moved and said, "Good! You are a qualified class leader. In that case, follow me."  To the surprise of Tang Wulin and the others, there were no elevators inside the tall teaching building, only spiral staircases going up, explained Li Zhi Long, to constantly exercise the students' physical fitness.  Following the staircase all the way to the top floor, they reached the highest point, with a ceiling height of over thirty meters, housed in a vast domed structure.  Through a corridor, they entered a large hall.  The hall was massive, but what was even more surprising was that it was an open-air hall, without a dome, directly under the sky.  "This is the academy's observatory, also an important practical training ground. With a diameter of three hundred meters, since our academy specializes in flying soul masters, there is no height restriction here," Li Zhi Long explained.  Tang Wulin commented, "It is truly magnificent. To be able to gaze at the starry sky here at night must be very beautiful." Chapter 445: Observatory  Li Zhilong smiled and said, "It's not difficult to see the stars. You'll be able to see them in a bit. Our observatory has some peculiar features. Whether it's day or night, once activated, it can bring us closer to space and allow us to directly observe the stars at a closer distance. The large soul-guiding array of the observatory draws the power of the stars from space into the observatory, providing the purest energy to help our students cultivate. Only particularly outstanding disciples are allowed to come here to cultivate at specific times. Usually, it's mostly the graduate class students here. They refine their bodies with the power of the stars, tempering their own battle armor."  The surprise in Tang Wulin's eyes was genuine this time. He had not expected the Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy to have such an extraordinary place. It seemed that today's match would not be easy to play! But wait, star power? Starlight?  He subconsciously turned his head to glance at Xu Xiaoyan, not far from him, but to his helplessness, he saw a look of bewilderment in Xu Xiaoyan's eyes.  "Please wait here for a moment and feel the environment. Our students will arrive soon."  Around the observatory was a thirty-meter high wall, and upon closer inspection, one could see that the wall was constructed with many rare metals, forming intricate patterns and designs.  Having heard Li Zhilong's introduction and observing and feeling the surroundings, one could discover the huge potential energy contained within the observatory.  Soul-guiding arrays have been used among the common folk for many years, but humanity has never stopped developing them for thousands of years. More and more large and complex soul-guiding arrays have been designed and produced, each with different functions. The military controls the largest number of large soul-guiding arrays, which are used in national defense facilities.  And the soul-guiding array in front of them was the most complex and massive one Tang Wulin had ever seen. He wondered if Shrek Academy had one. They must have, after all, Shrek was the number one academy on the continent!  Feeling everything around them, soon, a group of people appeared before them.   The uniforms of the Tian Ding Soul Master Academy were black, with star-shaped embroidery on the chest. Silver stars represented cultivation level, with each additional one indicating a higher level of soul power. At the graduate level, the silver star would turn into a gold star. Therefore, the strength of the students here could be understood by counting the stars on their uniforms.  The six students who came were all adorned with silver stars, glittering with silver light, four males and two females. Upon their arrival, their gaze first fell on Tang Wulin's group of six, carrying a hint of curiosity. These six people appeared to be between eighteen and twenty years old.  With a glance, Tang Wulin could discern their strengths and weaknesses.   The strongest among them had forty-six silver stars. The other five also had over forty stars, exactly meeting their standard for confrontation.  Coming from Shrek Academy, they didn't really care much about opponents who were a level higher than themselves.   But what Tang Wulin cared about was this observatory. Without a doubt, Li Zhilong's decision to have them compete here was not without reason.  Li Zhilong smiled and said, "Let me introduce you to each other. These six are talented students from Shrek Academy. And our six here are the most outstanding students below the postgraduate level. How about this, introduce yourselves to each other."  Tang Wulin nodded, and saluted the six people opposite: "I am the captain, Tang Wulin, an offensive control system battle soul master."  A tall young man on the other side stepped forward with a smile: "Hello, welcome to Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy. I am the captain, Xiao Tian. Coincidentally, just like you, I am also an offensive control system battle soul master."  Their eyes met, and although both were smiling, they were also scrutinizing each other.   Due to age, Xiao Tian's figure was obviously taller and leaner than Tang Wulin's, but he didn't see any emotions in Tang Wulin's eyes.  Gu Yue was the second to speak, "Gu Yue, offensive system battle soul master." A simple introduction.  The second person on the other side was a skinny male student who looked very ordinary and had nothing remarkable about him, but he had the second-highest number of silver stars after Gu Tianming, at the forty-fourth level.  "Ye Zishu, agile attack system battle soul master."  "Xie Xie, agile attack system battle soul master."  The third person on the other side was tall and burly, the strongest-looking of all six.  "Gu Tianming, agile attack system battle soul master." He's an agile attack system? Not an offensive system? With that physique.  "Ye Xinglan, offensive system battle soul master."  The fourth person from Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was a medium-built but very handsome young man. With a slight smile, his voice instantly left a deep impression on Tang Wulin and his team, melodious and pleasant, "Zhang Xinjie, control system battle soul master."  "Xu Xiaoyan, control system battle soul master." Xu Xiaoyan still had a look of confusion in her eyes, speaking subconsciously.  The fifth person from Tian Ding Starry Sky was a beautiful girl, petite and exquisite, giggling, "I am Li Yaoyao, offensive system battle soul master."  "Xu Lizhi, food system tool soul master." The fat guy.  The last student from Tian Ding was also a female, with good looks and figure, appearing soft and delicate. "My name is Han Yushang, control system battle soul master." Another control system?  After hearing the other side's introductions, Tang Wulin couldn't help but be on guard.   Captain Xiao Tian was an offensive system battle soul master, and then there were two additional control systems, pure control system battle soul masters.   It's important to note that there were only six people in total! Half of them were control systems, what's the situation?  Moreover, according to the characteristics of Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy, these six people were also flying soul masters, fighting in their own special field, all above level forty. This battle was definitely not going to be easy.  Tang Wulin looked at Gu Yue beside him, Gu Yue felt his gaze and turned her head towards him, their eyes met, and they nodded imperceptibly to each other.  "Alright, the teacher responsible for controlling the observatory has also arrived, and the observatory barrier will be opened shortly. This is a sparring match, so stop at the right moment," Li Zhilong said with a smile.  He had always been proud of being a graduate from Shrek Academy, but he hoped even more that the students he trained could defeat the students from Shrek Academy!  Although Tang Wulin and his team were young, the identity of Tang Wulin as the class leader could, in some sense, represent Shrek Academy.  Winning this match would be a matter of pride for Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy, even though there was a slight age mismatch.   Which academy has ever defeated a younger team from Shrek Academy?  Both sides retreated, creating distance, which was the rule for the match. Before the start of the battle, they had to be at least one hundred meters apart.  As they retreated, Tang Wulin's eyes gradually brightened.  Those who knew him were aware that the greater the pressure, the stronger his fighting spirit, and the more he could be stimulated to tap into his potential.  The six opponents in front of him were strong, but could they be stronger than the top five young talents of that year?  Having defeated even the martial soul fusion skills, Tang Wulin was confident that even in a specific place, they could still crush their opponents.  This was the undefeated belief of Shrek.  They represented not only themselves but also the glory of Shrek!  In a triangular formation, Tang Wulin was at the front, with Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan following, and Gu Yue, Xu Xiaoyan, and Xu Lizhi at the back.  The six opponents did not seem to have any intention of forming a formation, still lined up in a row.  Six against six, the team battle tested not only individual strength but also the cooperation between them.  "Ready!" Li Zhilong acted as the referee for the match.  "Buzz—" The humming sound rang out, and the walls surrounding the entire observatory lit up. The magnificent patterns on the walls seemed to come to life under the halo of light, rising into the air and turning into beams of light that converged at one point before forming a giant pillar of light shooting into the sky.  What an observatory.  Tang Wulin's heart moved as he felt the energy fluctuations within the observatory.  In the next moment, the sky began to darken, all the golden light disappeared in a short time, the walls remained magnificent, but the day had turned into an endless starry sky, with twinkling stars as if they were within reach.  A peculiar and pure energy descended from the sky, bathing the entire observatory.  Tang Wulin clearly saw that the six opponents had faint golden halos appearing on their bodies, and their aura was slightly enhanced. Although not significant, it was undoubtedly a boost in this environment.  "Huh?" A soft exclamation came from behind.  Tang Wulin turned around and immediately saw a surprising scene.  A dazzling golden light lit up behind him; the golden light was in the form of a mist, the golden mist rising, even making those close by unable to see her face.  "Xiaoyan."  Tang Wulin called out softly. Chapter 446: I'm Fine, Wonderfully Fine  "I'm okay. I'm really fine, this feeling, it's so wonderful!" Xu Xiaoyan's voice was a bit shaky, but it was clearly a shake of excitement.  The referee for this match, Li Zhilong, was also a bit surprised. He was the most familiar with the Starwatch Platform, where students could absorb star power to refine their bodies, but it was only effective for soul masters with flying martial souls.  It could be said that the Starwatch Platform was the foundation of the Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy. Fighting here, one’s own soul power would have an enhancement, and the recovery speed would also be much stronger than in the outside world.  But what was the situation with that girl from Shrek Academy? Was that her martial soul?  Different students have different degrees of perception and absorption of star power. The more in tune with the star power, the stronger the star power fluctuations that would appear on their bodies on the Starwatch Platform. The faint golden aura that Tang Wulin had seen before was such an example. Even within the Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy, only a very few students could manifest star power in this way, which was generally not visible on the surface of ordinary students; the faint golden mist was a manifestation of this.  The golden mist that appeared on Xu Xiaoyan's body was already near materialization, so even Li Zhilong, who was very familiar with this place, couldn't understand the changes that appeared on her body.  "Begin!"  With a loud shout from Li Zhilong, the match between the six students from the first class of the first grade of Shrek Academy and the strongest team under twenty years old from Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy began.  On the Shrek Academy side, three figures shot out like lightning, with incredibly fast speeds.  Tang Wulin made the biggest move, stomping his left foot on the ground, and his body shot out like a cannonball, so fast that it was breathtaking. In the instant he dashed out, his martial soul was also released, with three circles of purple soul rings shining brilliantly, and strands of Blue Silver Grass swarmed out.  However, it was already very difficult for people to recognize that this was Blue Silver Grass. The translucent blue vines had faint golden lines inside, and if one looked closely, they could see faint scale-like patterns on the surface of the Blue Silver Grass.  Naturally, the ones who rushed out with him were Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan. Xie Xie was light in shape, not as violent as Tang Wulin, but his speed was not slow at all.  Ye Xinglan was just fast, so fast that it was hard to see clearly. All three of them had three soul rings shining, like three sharp arrows, charging straight at their opponents.  The reaction of the six students from Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was unanimous; they jumped up and took off into the air at the same time.  Xiao Tian Tian bent forward slightly, and a layer of dark red light suddenly burst out from his body, even his eyes turned dark red. A pair of wings like bat wings opened behind him, and with a strong flap, he shot up into the sky. His four soul rings, all purple, flashed with light, an imposing aura.  When he released his martial soul, his originally slender body also began to expand, becoming more burly.  What kind of martial soul was this? Tang Wulin didn't recognize it at first glance.  Beside Xiao Tian Tian, Ye Zishu was the most peculiar. He clasped his hands in front of him, a yellow light shone, and it turned out to be a long bamboo pole. Then, the light of the second soul ring among his four soul rings flickered, the bamboo gently swayed, and countless bamboo leaves fluttered up, condensing into two wings behind him. He propped the bamboo pole on the ground, bounced his body up, and flew up as well. His flight seemed light and airy, the whole person had a strange sense of lightness, like dandelion seeds rising, not like pure flight.  Gu Tianming's mouth let out an eagle cry, a pair of wings spread out, and his hair also noticeably grew feathers. With a flap of his wings, he rushed fiercely into the sky.  His martial soul, the Skyreaching War Eagle!  Zhang Xining also had a pair of wings, but compared to Gu Tianming, his wings were much smaller and more agile. The wings were white, and with a gentle flap, he fluttered into the air, dodging behind Gu Tianming, like a startled little bird.  The most astonishing to Tang Wulin was Li Yaoyao. The next moment after the petite and exquisite beauty rose into the air, a strong flame suddenly burst out from her body. Immediately afterward, her whole skin turned dark, and her arms each condensed into a mass of stone-like shapes. Flames jetted out, propelling her upward at great speed. The six of them flew up together, but her speed was the fastest.  What kind of martial soul was this?  As expected of the Flying Martial Soul Academy, it was truly eye-opening.  The last, Han Yushang, was relatively normal, with a pair of colorful butterfly wings spreading out from her back. The butterfly wings fluttered lightly, and she rose into the air as if weightless.  Indeed, all six could fly!  A hundred-meter distance for a soul master above three rings was just a matter of a few breaths. When Tang Wulin and his group had charged out fifty meters, suddenly, Tang Wulin jumped up, then landed on his feet, and with the momentum, he forcefully flung a Blue Silver Grass trailing behind him.  A figure, pulled by the Blue Silver Grass, shot up into the air like a cannonball, smashing toward the six from Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy, who had already flown to at least thirty meters in the air.  Not only did he stop. Ye Xinglan and Xie Xie also stopped at the same time, leaped up, and jumped towards Tang Wulin's direction. Tang Wulin opened his arms, hugged their waists, and started spinning in place.  After spinning rapidly for three rounds, he suddenly flung them out, and both Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan rose into the air.  None of them were flying soul masters, and they couldn't stop the others from taking off from a hundred meters away. What they could do was intercept in the air before the opponents flew to a completely unreachable height.  The first to be flung into the air by Tang Wulin was Xu Lizhi. His body was plump, and at this moment, his body curled into a ball, like a meatball cannonball, aiming directly at the direction of Gu Tianming, the Skyreaching War Eagle, and Zhang Xining, whom he was protecting.  Control-type soul masters would always be more troublesome than assault-type soul masters, something Tang Wulin firmly believed in, so the first he wanted to deal with was the opponent's control-type soul master.  Xie Xie was flung up, aiming at the Butterfly Winged Han Yushang, while Ye Xinglan's target was the opponent's team captain, the strongest Xiao Tian Tian.  The three flew in three different directions, and just this alone showed how powerful Tang Wulin's strength was and how strong his control was.  If you look closely, you will find that although the three of them flew up, there was a Blue Silver Grass wrapped around each of their waists.  Tang Wulin's current position was right in the center of the Starwatch Platform.  A bunch of fireballs rose into the air, each with a diameter of more than a foot, carrying dazzling tails, pressing towards Ye Zishu and Li Yaoyao.  Tang Wulin's plan was simple, to intercept the opponents in the shortest time possible, while Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan provided long-range support from the ground, and he himself was ready to dispatch and burst forth at any moment.  He didn't expect to completely solve the opponents in the first moment, but at least to take down a part of them.  Then it would come down to attrition.  Although flying soul masters have a certain advantage over ordinary soul masters, the soul power consumption of flying in the air is far greater than that of soul masters standing on the ground.  Therefore, Tang Wulin was not afraid of the opponents flying to a very high place and not coming down.  The first to engage in battle was Xu Lizhi's side. He was the first to be flung out by Tang Wulin, and with the help of momentum and Tang Wulin's strong arm strength, he was definitely much faster than relying on his wings to fly.  Gu Tianming had just flown to the specified height, and a huge meatball from the opposite side was already rushing towards him.  The first soul ring on Zhang Xining, who was behind him, shone, and a clear and loud scream rang out. His voice was indeed pleasant, melodious, and lingering.  His martial soul was the Hundred Spirits Bird. Although he was a flying type soul master, he relied on sound to control his enemies.  His first soul skill was deceleration. To weaken the opponent.  However, his deceleration ability had no direct effect on Xu Lizhi.  Xu Lizhi did not fly over by his own power! He was flung over by Tang Wulin.  Gu Tianming was still pondering at this moment, thinking that this chubby guy was a food-type tool soul master, so was he being flung out as cannon fodder?  As an excellent student of Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy, his reaction was also quick. The first soul ring on his body lit up, and his wings slapped forward fiercely, dozens of eagle feathers turned into arrows, shooting towards Xu Lizhi.  In aerial combat, being able to attack from a distance is very important because it's easy for both sides to maintain distance.  The eagle feathers broke through the air, making a series of "pu pu" sounds.  Unfortunately, what Gu Tianming didn't know was that the person he was facing came from the Tang Sect. What was the essence of the Tang Sect when it was first established? Hidden weapons!  In mid-air, the originally coiled Xu Lizhi suddenly stretched out his body, circling his hands in front of him, his face still wearing a simple and honest smile, his pair of plump hands shining with a jade-like luster. Those eagle feathers seemed to enter a vortex, converging inward, and were directly caught in his hands. Chapter 447: The Gap  Xu Lizhi pushed his hands forward, shifting from Capturing Dragon to Controlling Crane, and dozens of tough and sharp eagle feathers shot out. Supported by his rich soul power and amplified by the Tang Sect's hidden weapon technique, the Heavenly Maiden Scattering Blossoms, they flew towards the Bailing Bird Soul Master Zhang Xining even faster than before.  Meanwhile, he had already reached Gu Tianming. Seeing the huge body before him, Gu Tianming could no longer take care of Zhang Xining. The second soul ring on his body flashed, and a pair of eagle wings suddenly doubled in size, trying to block the eagle feathers while closing inward. Eagle Wing Strike! The second soul skill.  Unexpectedly, the fat man smiled and waved at him. The body that was supposed to hit him suddenly paused in mid-air. Following that, a burst of cold light shot out from his hands. The cold light, spreading like a peacock's tail feathers, bypassed Gu Tianming and went straight for Zhang Xining behind him.  This was the fat man's real killer move. The previous eagle feathers were just an unexpected bonus.  Before the eagle wings could hit him, the fat man suddenly shot backwards, his smile unchanged, still waving at Gu Tianming.  Not good!  By the time Gu Tianming thought of rescuing Zhang Xining, it was already too late. Most of the eagle feathers were blocked by him, but some still flew towards Zhang Xining.  Zhang Xining was a pure control system Soul Master, specifically a sound control type. His frontal combat ability was almost zero, but his control ability was the strongest among everyone.  Facing the eagle feathers, he desperately flapped his wings to dodge but was still scratched by a few, leaving wounds.  Just when he thought he had avoided them, a large bunch of cold light had already appeared in front of him. There had to be hundreds of steel needles covering all his possible escape routes, each needle imbued with robust soul power.  There was no escape!  This...  A sigh sounded in his ear, and then, amidst a series of "ding ding" sounds, he fell from the sky.  "Zhang Xining, out."  The voice of Li Zhilong was filled with helplessness, but he had to save him!  It was just an encounter, and in the absence of a flying type Soul Master on the other side, one of their important control system battle Soul Masters was already out.  Shrek Academy, truly a monster academy.  Zhang Xining's face was flushed red. His heart was filled with unwillingness, but this was a competition, a battlefield, and feeling indignant wouldn't change the outcome.  As the fat man descended from the sky and was about to crash into Tang Wulin, Tang Wulin also circled his hands, Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, skillfully dissipating the force and placing him beside his body.  The fat man raised his hand, and a big healing meat bun was already handed over to him. Tang Wulin bit into it, swallowing it in two or three bites.  At the same time, Xie Xie, who had ascended into the sky, had already reached near Han Yu Chang, the butterfly Soul Master. Agility beats control, and once close, there was almost no chance of turning the tables.  But Han Yu Chang was unusually calm. The second soul ring on her body flashed, but there were no changes to her body. Instead, she seemed to pull on something in front of her with both hands, and then gently clapped her wings.  At that moment, Xie Xie felt as if the world in front of him suddenly turned black and white, and then something seemed to break. Han Yu Chang seemed to be right in front of him. His Light Dragon Dagger swung out, but hit nothing, and everything turned to naught. A slight pain on his shoulder, and his body began to fall through the air.  To the others, it seemed that Xie Xie had suddenly initiated an attack on thin air, and then Han Yu Chang flapped her butterfly wings, pointed her toe on his shoulder, and flew into the air.  This was...  A chill ran through Tang Wulin's heart, mental control system!  Xie Xie's attack couldn't possibly have such a huge deviation. The only possibility for this situation was that he was bewildered by Han Yu Chang.  This Han Yu Chang was not only a flying type martial soul but also a mental control type martial soul.  As Xie Xie fell from the sky, a dazzling cluster of fire suddenly erupted. It wasn't Gu Yue's fireball, but rather Li Yaoyao, who had ascended the fastest before. It was unclear which soul ring on her body was flashing, but her whole body curled up in the air, then plummeted like a meteorite, heading straight for Xie Xie with incredible speed and momentum.  What kind of martial soul was this? A meteorite?  Although Xie Xie was an agility-type Soul Master, he was falling from the sky and was in an unavoidable situation. Agility-type usually came with weaker defenses.  He had just started to fall when Li Yaoyao smashed through one of Gu Yue's fireballs and flew towards him. Obviously, her coordination with Han Yu Chang was not just a day or two's work.  His waist tightened, and Xie Xie's body flew sideways, pulled by Tang Wulin's Blue Silver Grass. He was pulled horizontally into the air, avoiding Li Yaoyao's impact.  But Li Yaoyao didn't stop her momentum. Instead, she bravely descended, like a meteor chasing the moon, targeting Tang Wulin.  It was clear to them that the core of these six people from Shrek Academy was Tang Wulin.  Force attack control system.  Tang Wulin, as if he didn't see Li Yaoyao, pulled his right hand, entangling the Blue Silver Grass around Xie Xie's waist, and shook it with force.  Xie Xie's falling momentum stopped abruptly, and as he ascended again, he was sent back into the air, still targeting the butterfly Soul Master Han Yu Chang.  Ye Xinglan and Xiao Tianxian also met in the air. Ye Xinglan, with her sword as one, turned into a cold star and went straight for Xiao Tianxian.  Xiao Tianxian's body surged with starlight, his burly body suddenly spread his wings to the maximum, and both hands slapped towards Ye Xinglan. A dazzling dark red light ball suddenly appeared in the air, blocking Ye Xinglan's path.  The Sword God Star shone, turning into streams of golden light, like countless stars suddenly blooming. A layer of pale golden halo emerged on Ye Xinglan's body, and the celestial stars seemed to brighten at that moment.  The dark red light ball shattered, and the sword's edge was instantly in front of Xiao Tianxian.  Xiao Tianxian was shocked. He never expected that Ye Xinglan could also launch attacks with the power of the stars, and clearly, she was more in tune with it than him.  The third soul ring on his body flickered, and suddenly a pair of horns grew on his head. A dark red electric net burst out from his body as the center, and his entire body seemed to become a huge electric ball in an instant.  "Ding!" The Sword God was deflected, and Ye Xinglan, without leverage in the void, seemed about to fall.  But at that moment, she raised the Sword God in her hand, and the third soul ring glimmered.  A bright light suddenly rose, and her body instantly negated gravity, turning into a star that shot into the sky.  This...  Li Zhilong was also somewhat stunned. He could see that Ye Xinglan's martial soul must also be related to stars. If not, she wouldn't be able to borrow the starlight so smoothly.  A bad premonition followed.  As Tang Wulin shook the Blue Silver Grass to help Xie Xie ascend, the meteorite that Li Yaoyao had transformed into had already arrived. The roaring momentum, the solid exterior, and the blazing flames all highlighted the explosive attack power.  Facing such a meteorite, Tang Wulin raised his right hand, golden scales surged, and the Golden Dragon Claw appeared.  He clenched his fist, his blood qi running counter to the surge within him. In an instant, a layer of golden light also rose from his body.  This wasn't borrowing the power of starlight; it was the visualization of his own blood qi swelling to the extreme.  "Boom—"  Tang Wulin stood in place, unmovable, and the meteorite that Li Yaoyao had become came to a halt in front of his fist.  In that instant, time on the entire Star Observation Platform seemed to have stopped. Chapter 448: At this moment, the stars shine brilliantly. Li Yaoyao's attack is known for its strength, and her martial soul is the peculiar meteorite. In fact, she cannot fly, but she can use the tail flame jet capability of her martial soul to rise into the sky and then fall to smash her opponents. All her soul skills also amplify her own abilities when using this attack method. With her current strength at the four-ring level, her full-force collision can reach a force of over 3000 kilograms. Moreover, even if she doesn't crush her opponent with one strike, she can immediately rise into the sky and attack again, which is the most terrifying aspect. She herself has the defensive power of a meteorite layer, which is also quite formidable. She is known as the killer move in their small team, called omnipresent on the battlefield. She can even change her direction in mid-air during the collision.  The ability to change direction did not work on Tang Wulin, because he didn't dodge at all. After such a violent collision, both of them were at a standstill. What was going on?  Li Zhilong moved and was already nearby, ready to rescue either side if there was a problem. But in the next moment, his pupils shrank violently. Starting from the center of Tang Wulin's Golden Dragon Claw on the transformed meteorite of Li Yaoyao, fine cracks appeared, and then they rapidly spread, reaching every corner of the meteorite in the blink of an eye. The next instant, the meteorite burst apart with a boom, and Li Yaoyao let out a delicate cry, her body collapsing softly from within the meteorite. A Blue Silver Grass swiftly wrapped around her, binding her tightly.  Li Yaoyao's face was pale at this moment, her whole body was in unspeakable pain due to the intense shock from before, but the shock in her heart was far greater than the physical shock she endured. How is it possible, he blocked my full-force strike with just one hand!  Tang Wulin shook his right hand, his whole right arm feeling a bit numb and sore. The impact of that strike was really not light. Hmm, just this much. The second one!  The second person from the Skyreach Academy for Star Luo Soul Masters is out. Tang Wulin looked up at the sky, where Ye Xinglan's third soul skill, the Falling Sword Star, had already descended from above. Under the illumination of the starry sky around the observatory, her Falling Sword Star truly looked like a meteor chasing the moon, and since Tang Wulin had known her, this was definitely the strongest Falling Sword Star that Ye Xinglan had ever used. The power of the stars is really useful. Of course, it helps our side.  The fourth soul ring ascended, and Xiao Tianxian suddenly became still, and his face could no longer be seen clearly. All that could be seen was a pair of blood-colored eyes. A pitch-black aura rose around his body; with a fierce motion of his hands in mid-air, a layer of black airflow suddenly burst forth, turning into a vortex in the sky. The Falling Sword Star collided with the vortex, which trembled violently for a moment, and the next instant, Xiao Tianxian disappeared. Ye Xinglan disappeared at the same time.  What happened? Is it a spatial ability? No, that's not right! There are no fluctuations of spatial elemental attributes.  The next moment, Tang Wulin was shocked as a flash of dark red light appeared, and Xiao Tianxian re-emerged in mid-air, but Ye Xinglan did not reappear with him. What soul skill is this?  Xiao Tianxian spread his wings and descended from the sky, his wings opened wide, and his body rapidly changed shape in mid-air, plunging straight towards Gu Yue. At the same time, he clapped his hands in the void, and a mass of dark red light suddenly appeared in front of Tang Wulin, like a black hole, trying to engulf him.  Countless green shadows fell from the sky, which were pieces of bamboo leaves. The bamboo leaves changed and flipped in the air, like arrows, covering the whole field and also hiding Ye Zhiqiu's figure. Hidden among the large bamboo leaves, seven leaves turned golden, absorbing the starlight in the air. His martial soul was called the Seven Crafts Star Bamboo, with each soul ring adding a new variation. Flight was one of them. The current Seven Star Bamboo leaves are his strongest attack method, the fourth soul skill.  After the fight had started for a while, they already had two people out, and although the six members of Shrek Academy were not as advanced in their cultivation as their opponents, each one of them had a solid foundation and exceptional combat power. If they didn't erupt now, they wouldn't stand a chance at all. So, as Xiao Tianxian erupted, he did too.  On the other side, the Skyreach War Eagle Gu Tianming also spread his wings and charged at Xie Xie in the air, standing in front of the Butterfly Soul Master Han Yushang. Han Yushang's fourth soul ring lit up, and her butterfly wings suddenly doubled in size, flapping towards Tang Wulin's direction in mid-air. The Butterfly Wings, that was the name of her fourth soul skill.  Tang Wulin felt as if a sea of spirit had appeared in front of him, madly assaulting his brain. This wasn't control; it was a strong spiritual shock. He immediately judged that Han Yushang's spiritual power must have also reached the level of the Spiritual Sea, the same realm as Gu Yue.  Tang Wulin's own spiritual power had not improved since it reached the edge of the Spiritual Sea realm. The Spiritual Sea realm was a huge threshold in the spiritual level, and he had been diligently practicing the Purple Demon Eyes, waiting for the opportunity to break through. In his opinion, at the latest when he broke through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, he would also be able to break through the Spiritual Sea realm.  At this time, the strong spiritual fluctuations that assaulted him like waves caused him a splitting headache, and Xiao Tianxian's attack had also appeared in front of him. Tang Wulin's body glowed with a golden halo, and his Golden Dragon Body was released. His entire body was enveloped in a layer of golden light, with golden scales emerging in large areas, covering him. His whole body was shrouded in golden patterns, and his blood and qi surged. He himself suddenly crouched down, hugging his knees and curling up.  Xie Xie's figure in the air suddenly became illusory, and his Light Dragon Dagger was suddenly thrown out, carrying a blinding light blade, flying straight towards the Skyreach War Eagle Gu Tianming, while his own body changed continuously in the void, giving a sense of walking on air.  Gu Tianming felt as if his opponent had suddenly become countless figures, elusive. The wings vibrated, and a large number of eagle feathers flew out, but whenever the eagle feathers seemed about to hit the target, they were always dodged by the opponent through the gaps. In an instant, Xie Xie reached him. The Light Dragon Blade was blocked by Gu Tianming's wings, and the next moment Xie Xie was already in front of him, a golden light suddenly burrowed out from under his armpit, and Gu Tianming felt his body tighten, tightly bound.  Xie Xie's Light Dragon Dagger swung back, blocking his wing attack, and taking advantage of this strike, he leapt into the air, standing upside down, the Light Dragon Dagger tracing a series of light shadows, and his body flashing continuously in the void. The golden light that entangled Gu Tianming quickly spread upwards, and facing Xie Xie's lightning-fast attack, Gu Tianming couldn't take care of it. Xie Xie's attack was too fast and ghostly, always appearing in the most difficult places for him to defend. He felt out of breath.  Finally, the golden light wrapped around one of his wings, and Xie Xie's body spun in the air, the Light Dragon Storm suppressed Gu Tianming from the sky.  After Han Yushang fanned out the butterfly wings towards Tang Wulin, she turned to help Gu Tianming, but Gu Tianming had already been suppressed by Xie Xie, and she was about to launch a mental attack on Xie Xie as well. Suddenly, a strong sense of crisis emerged in her mind, and her body sank sharply. An invisible sharpness swept past her side.  Han Yushang was shocked. "Don't move!" A big hand had already wrapped around her waist from behind, and a cold breath was placed on her neck. "Your spiritual power is strong, and I'm not sure if I can block it when you launch a mental attack on me. But what I can be sure of is that even if I can't block it, I can definitely leave some marks on your neck or accidentally on your face. So, slowly descend." Han Yushang had never been so close to someone before, her pretty face turned red, and in her anger and frustration, she could only flap her wings and slowly descend.  Xie Xie, with his own power, defeated two more people. On the other side, Tang Wulin curled up, enduring the attack. The bamboo leaves fell from the sky, covering Tang Wulin, Gu Yue, Xu Lizhi, and Xu Xiaoyan, who had not moved from a distance but was shrouded in strong golden light.  The seven golden bamboo leaves hidden among the many bamboo leaves each found their targets. Gu Yue remained calm, and a strong wind rose around her body, preventing the nearby bamboo leaves from approaching her. The next instant, a flash of silver light, and she avoided Xiao Tianxian's pounce, appearing next to Xu Xiaoyan.  As for Xu Lizhi, he was next to Tang Wulin, so she didn't need to worry about him. Just as Gu Yue was about to release her own skills to protect Xu Xiaoyan, she suddenly felt a wave of energy fluctuations and looked back in surprise when she heard Xu Xiaoyan's gentle voice. "Stars, shine brilliantly!" Chapter 449: Mutation of the Stars  With the dazzling Starwheel Ice Staff held high above her head, in the next instant, myriad beams of starlight suddenly burst forth. The intense starlight, reflecting off the stars in the sky, instantly filled the entire observatory. All the bamboo leaves disappeared without a trace under the brilliant starlight, leaving only seven golden bamboo leaves frozen in mid-air, unable to move.  It was not just the bamboo leaves; under the envelopment of the starlight, Xiao Tian Tian who leapt into the air, Ye Zi Shu the Seven Treasures Bamboo soul master who was still in the air, Gu Tian Ming the Sky-reaching War Eagle who had lost his fighting ability under the entwinement of golden words, and Han Yu Chang the Butterfly soul master who was being suppressed by Xie Xie's shadow clone and descending, their bodies all turned golden under the starlight.  Those in the air, in the next instant, descended from the sky like free-falling. Those already on the ground, completely lost their ability to move. In this instant, the whole world seemed to turn golden.  Xu Xiao Yan's entire body was enveloped in starlight, as if a goddess had descended, with specks of golden starlight weaving dazzling brilliance on her. On her forehead, a pattern appeared out of nowhere, identical to the starwheel at the top of her Starwheel Ice Staff.  With her starlight's resplendent release, it seemed as if the light itself became softer, as if finding its master. The patterns of the entire observatory's array lit up, the stars in the sky became bright again, and countless starlights crazily converged towards her body.  Xu Xiao Yan's body lightly floated up, with specks of starlight rapidly gathering towards her. At this moment, Tang Wu Lin had already stood up again, watching this scene with his mouth agape in shock.  Of course, he did not forget to step forward a few steps, pressing down on the golden-transformed Xiao Tian Tian. At the same time, he threw out a strand of Bluesilver Grass, catching Ye Zi Shu who was descending from the sky to avoid him being injured.  Xie Xie's shadow clone rolled on the ground with the descending Han Yu Chang, dissipating the force and standing firm. He too looked up at the bizarre scene in the sky.  Each of them could feel that Xu Xiao Yan's aura was undergoing a transformation, a fundamental change. Soul power mutation! Indeed, only a soul power mutation could cause such intense energy fluctuations and the spectacle before them.  Moreover, from her current situation, no matter how you looked at it, this should be a positive change, and a very good one at that.  Li Zhi Long was already dumbfounded; he could never have imagined that this match would turn into such a situation. In fact, even if Xu Xiao Yan had not erupted, the outcome of this match was already determined.  Xiao Tian Tian's attack and Han Yu Chang's mental impact had not caused too much damage to Tang Wu Lin. When it comes to endurance, Tang Wu Lin was definitely second to none among everyone present.  Originally facing the powerful attacks from Yuan En Ye Hui, he could bear them all along, let alone the small scene before him. These outstanding students from the Star Luo Soul Master Academy, although also strong with four rings of cultivation, were not on the same level compared to Yuan En Ye Hui.  If Yuan En was here, he could defeat the entire opposing team with his strength alone. What Tang Wu Lin was originally wary of was the observatory itself. But he did not expect that the observatory would end up benefiting Xu Xiao Yan.  With a flash of light in the sky, Ye Xing Lan reappeared midair. Bathed in the starlight, her body also had a golden halo, and the Star God Sword emitted dazzling brilliance.  She was also absorbing the star power. However, compared to Xu Xiao Yan, she was only absorbing a very small part, and her body gradually descended from the sky. She sat down cross-legged directly on the ground and began to meditate.  Opportunities don't come often, and the students from Shrek Academy never lacked the ability to seize the moment. The golden color on the bodies of the Star Luo Soul Master Academy students gradually faded, and they regained their mobility.  Seeing this scene, how could they not be shocked? There was no need to continue this match; the outcome was already clear.  Tang Wu Lin looked at the dumbfounded Li Zhi Long, walked over quickly, and said in a low voice, "Senior, what do you think about this..."  Li Zhi Long came back to his senses and asked subconsciously, "Your classmate, is her soul power related to star power?"  Tang Wu Lin nodded.  Li Zhi Long took a deep breath, "I've never seen a soul master so in tune with star power. This is really..."  He wanted to say it would be great if she belonged to their academy. With his many years at the Star Luo Soul Master Academy, his understanding of the observatory was very profound.  This baptism of star power, no matter what mutation it caused, would definitely bring great benefits to Xu Xiao Yan. Such a student, it's impossible not to be a genius! If they could cultivate such a person, it would be an unparalleled improvement for the entire Star Luo Soul Master Academy.  But obviously, that was impossible. She came from Shrek.  Tang Wu Lin said, "Senior, could you please not interrupt the star power? Xiao Yan's current situation..."  "Of course!" Li Zhi Long interrupted him and said solemnly, "Although she is not a student of our academy, such a unique situation is an adventure for her and an encounter for us. We will record and preserve this data, which will be very valuable for the application of star power. Don't worry. Let her absorb as much as she wants."  Saying this, he turned to the six students of the Star Luo Soul Master Academy and said, "You should also carefully feel the changes in the star power and see if you can learn anything from it."  "Yes!" The six-headed by Xiao Tian Tian answered respectfully. Only now, the six of them were not in high spirits.  As the outstanding young generation of the Star Luo Soul Master Academy, they have always held themselves in high esteem. Not yet twenty years old and having reached the six-ring cultivation, three of them were skilled in control.  In competitions in Star Luo City and nearby cities, they were always invincible. Especially Xiao Tian Tian's Demon King soul power was very strong.  But today, facing the Shrek Academy, which was generally one ring lower in cultivation and much younger, and without a flying soul master on the opposing side, they were utterly defeated. This was a gap in the fundamental strength. How could they not feel frustrated?  This wave of star power absorption lasted for more than an hour before Xu Xiao Yan's body slowly landed on the ground. Many spots of light appeared on her body.  Tang Wu Lin used his mental power to roughly count, and there were about three hundred and sixty-five spots of light.  Xu Xiao Yan sat cross-legged on the ground, her Mysterious Heaven Skill in operation, and the three hundred and sixty-five golden spots of light on her body flickered on and off. Her Starwheel Ice Staff stood upright beside her, completely turned golden, especially the top starwheel, which seemed to become ethereal, as if the stars were branded inside it. Looking closely, it gave the feeling of looking up at the stars.  Her soul power must have evolved, at least the starwheel had evolved. Xu Xiao Yan's soul power fluctuations did not increase by much, but the feeling was one of purity.  Under the influence of the starlight, she seemed to become completely transparent, indescribably peculiar.  All along, Xu Xiao Yan had been the weakest in terms of strength in the team, relying only on the control of the Starwheel Ice Staff at night and later, the first soul ring Starwheel Chain that could finally be used during the day, to play a certain role.  But this time, she seemed to have truly improved.  The stars gradually returned to normal, the light from the observatory receded, and the starlight on Xu Xiao Yan's body disappeared as if absorbed back into her body, quietly.  Her originally very beautiful face now had an additional layer of luster, with a faint treasure light flickering.  Taking a deep breath, Xu Xiao Yan slowly opened her eyes, and when she noticed that all eyes were focused on her, her face turned slightly red. Chapter 450: Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy  "How does it feel?" Tang Wulin asked.  Xu Xiaoyan frowned slightly, "It's very strange, I can't explain it clearly."  Looking into her eyes, Tang Wulin understood that she wasn't unable to explain, but rather she didn't want to say it here.  "Senior, I'm very sorry for disturbing you today. Xiaoyan has recovered now, so we'll take our leave," Tang Wulin said to Li Zhilong.  Li Zhilong looked at Xu Xiaoyan, "Junior, the situation that happened to you is very special. We have recorded the whole process. We will study it later. Can you leave a contact so we can communicate more in the future?"  "Okay." Having received such a big favor, Xu Xiaoyan naturally wouldn't refuse and left her soul communicator number.  Of course, it would only be useful after getting back the soul communicator, which had been taken away by the academy.  They quietly left the Sky Dou Star Soul Master Academy and got into the car.  Xie Xie followed the map and drove towards the next city.  "Competing with the academy in this way is not bad," Tang Wulin said. "It is really helpful for our improvement. In the next city, we should be a bit more tactful."  Gu Yue said, "Will we be as lucky in the next city? This time we just happened to encounter a senior who graduated from Shrek Academy."  Tang Wulin hehe smiled and pulled out a piece of paper from his chest. "Just before leaving, I asked Senior Li. Our academy has students all over the world, and which academy doesn't want to hire someone from Shrek Academy as a teacher? Senior Li gave me a list. It has the names of our seniors from Shrek Academy who are in several cities we are going to visit, along with their contact information. With these, we can contact them in advance, and then have a proper reason to seek them out for sparring."  "This works too…" Gu Yue stared at him in shock.  Xu Xiaoyan also said, "Captain, did you already plan to do this before? This is a good idea. Had we known, we should have done this from the start."  Tang Wulin said, "Xiaoyan, your martial soul should have mutated just now, right? How does it feel?"  Xu Xiaoyan's expression was a bit weird, "It mutated. I really didn't expect there to be such a huge amount of star power there. At the beginning, I didn't know what was happening, but later I discovered that after the massive star power poured into my body, it quickly integrated with my martial soul, and then my martial soul seemed to grow quickly, it's almost like it awakened."  "If I'm not mistaken, my original martial soul should have been immature, or to say, flawed. That's why there was a different state during the day and at night. Although this flaw would gradually diminish as my cultivation improved, it would always exist and would have even greater effects later on. But this time, after absorbing the star power, it helped me mend these flaws and also purified the impurities in my martial soul, making the martial soul purer."  Tang Wulin said, "Then why do I feel that after you absorbed so much star power, your soul power hasn't increased much?"  Xu Xiaoyan showed a strange expression, "There's a loss for every gain. My martial soul has been repaired, but some things have also been lost. My Starwheel Ice Staff should now be renamed Star Staff. My ice attribute was washed away by the star power. Only the pure Starwheel is left."  Tang Wulin was surprised, "Is that possible? So, all your ice attribute soul skills are gone?"  Xu Xiaoyan nodded.  Gu Yue asked, "After your Star Staff changed, did the soul skills change?"  Xu Xiaoyan smiled, "Of course. Otherwise, it wouldn't be worth it. My martial soul has evolved, so naturally, the soul skills have also evolved. My three soul skills have all changed significantly. Let me show you in the next match. In the future, I will also be like the captain, a strong attack control type."  Tang Wulin gave a thumbs up. He could tell that after the evolution of her martial soul, Xu Xiaoyan seemed much more confident.  "Xinglan, what about you? You seemed to have absorbed some star power too. How does it feel?"  Ye Xinglan smiled slightly, "My martial soul is very compatible with star power, but it's quite stable. So the only thing that increased from absorbing star power is soul power. I'm level 40 now."  Level 40 now!  As soon as these words came out, even Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi in front couldn't help turning their heads.  Xu Lizhi said with joy, "Sister Xinglan, congratulations! You're finally level 40."  Ye Xinglan nodded with a smile.  A level 40 Ye Xinglan only needed to fuse with a new spirit and obtain her fourth soul ring to officially enter the Soul Ancestor realm.  She was also the first among the six team members to reach the level 40 threshold.  With Ye Xinglan's talent and the power of the Star God Sword, once she reached level 40, her overall strength would certainly not be much weaker than Yuanen Yehui.  Tang Wulin said to Xie Xie, "Don't rush to get on the highway yet, let's find a place to buy a soul communicator."  The only purpose of buying a soul communicator was to say, "Hello, are you Senior Zhang who graduated from Shrek Academy? We are from Shrek Academy..."  As Tang Wulin said, Shrek Academy had students all over the world, and they took great care of their juniors from the same academy.  Moreover, having outstanding students from Shrek Academy come for exchange and sparring was a good thing for these academies.  In the following days, their journey went smoothly, and they had two exchanges every day. They successfully completed the ninth assessment content.  Just one more time, and they could pass this term's final exam and also return to the academy.  "Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy doesn't have our seniors there? Aren't they also ranked among the top academies on the continent? Why is that?" Xu Xiaoyan asked curiously.  Tang Wulin said, "I heard from the senior at the previous academy that Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy was once destroyed, and this destruction had a direct relation with our academy. They have been hostile towards our academy ever since. So, Sun-Moon Royal Academy is the only one that doesn't want to hire teachers from Shrek Academy. Of course, our seniors also don't want to teach here. Although it's not as good as our academy, Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy's hostility towards us has never diminished."  Xie Xie said, "Then should we still choose this place? I've heard of Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, and the elites they cultivate are also quite formidable. Many high-ranking officials of the Federation come from this academy. Shall we switch to another one?"  Tang Wulin smiled faintly, with a flash of light in his eyes, "What's the purpose of our final exam? The academy took away all our things and sent us alone to undergo this final exam as a trial. We are not just to complete the exam but also to really gain something from it. Don't you have confidence?"  Xie Xie's eyes became resolute, and he gave Tang Wulin a thumbs up.  Xu Xiaoyan was eager to try, "In the previous few matches, I haven't even performed yet."  Ye Xinglan calmly said, "Yes, I haven't performed yet."  Gu Yue glanced at Tang Wulin, "This is the last match, right?"  Tang Wulin looked at her, and a smile appeared on his face.  Since it's a sworn enemy, they can only win, not lose.  "Win, and you'll get extra points."  At this moment, a cold voice echoed in the car. The voice appeared very suddenly, startling everyone.  "Wu Teacher?" Tang Wulin exclaimed in surprise. Then he saw Wu Zhangkong outside the window.  Wu Zhangkong seemed to be walking through space, lightly following beside their fast-moving car, and the voice was indeed coming from him.  Tang Wulin twitched the corner of his mouth, "Wu Teacher, can you hear us speaking?"  Wu Zhangkong looked at him through the window and nodded.  "You represent the honor of Shrek. Since you've chosen Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, you must not fail. I will accompany you there. As the lead teacher."  Having a teacher lead the team for the exchange matches made it much more official.  Tang Wulin tentatively asked, "How many extra points can we get?"  Wu Zhangkong said, "If you win, all six of you will get full marks, plus an extra ten points. That is to say, each of you can give out an extra fifty points to others."  "Deal!" Tang Wulin agreed without hesitation.  If they could get so many points, then his goal would also be achieved.  An extra three hundred points for six people was enough to help many classmates.  Wu Zhangkong said indifferently, "If you lose, then all your previous efforts will be in vain. You will all fail."  "That harsh?" Tang Wulin was stunned.  Wu Zhangkong said, "The grudge between the two academies is more severe than you think. So, if you lose, I will also take responsibility and resign from the academy." Chapter 451: The Ruthless Dance Teacher  It's not just us that he's tough on, the dance teacher is pretty tough on himself too! Tang Wulin began to somewhat regret choosing to go to the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy. The pressure was indeed quite significant!  Bright City! The most modern city on the Douluo Continent, Bright City is situated in the western part of the continent and is the core of the entire West. As soon as they entered the area of Bright City, Tang Wulin and the others saw a scene rarely observed in other cities.  "Is that a flying car? A high-altitude flying car?" Xu Xiaoyan pointed to a flying object in the sky and screamed.  Xie Xie said, "It should be. High-altitude flying cars are still in the experimental stage, and Bright City is the most important technological center of the entire Federation. It seems that the experiment has been very successful!"  The traffic flow ahead gradually became slow. From a distance, they could see that at the highway exit, there were dozens of mechas patrolling around, and it was unclear what they were doing.  Xie Xie suddenly said, "They aren't conducting identity checks, are they?"  As soon as he said this, everyone's heart skipped a beat.  Everyone had their own identity proof, a metal card that recorded their identity information. They all had one. However, before they left the academy, they were all confiscated!  Tang Wulin realized, "The academy made us come to Bright City as our last stop, there must be a purpose in it. This... The tests really are everywhere! No wonder even our identity cards were confiscated."  Xu Lizhi looked back at him, "What do we do?"  If they checked for identity cards and found none, they would certainly be questioned, and what would happen next Tang Wulin did not know! After all, none of them had ever faced such a situation, and they had not encountered it in the cities they had passed through before.  Tang Wulin glanced at the distance to the highway exit ahead and immediately said to Xie Xie, "Xie Xie, pull the car over to the side."  Xie Xie had been driving a lot lately, and his driving skills had clearly improved. He skillfully steered the soul-guided car towards the edge of the highway.  "Abandon the car?" Xie Xie asked, "Is there any chance that Dance Teacher could show our identity proof for us? Wasn't he following us just now?"  While speaking, he also looked outside the window, but he soon realized he was being naive.  There was no sign of Dance Master Long outside the window.  "Forget it, pretend I didn't say anything."  Tang Wulin said to Gu Yue, "In a moment you do this..."  As they drew closer to the highway exit, it was indeed as expected; there was a person responsible for checking the identity cards of the people inside the passing vehicles.  With a flash of silver light, Gu Yue disappeared from the car, and the next moment, she appeared dozens of meters away in the air, her hands forming a circle, and a huge fireball shot out, streaking into the sky.  The fireball was over three meters in diameter and carried a blazing momentum, like a newly risen sun.  As it flew, its size continued to increase, pulling out a dazzling trail of flames.  After the fireball was launched, there was a flash of silver light.  Gu Yue disappeared into thin air.  Whether it was the passing vehicles or those patrolling mechas, they were instantly attracted by the sudden fireball rising into the air. Several mechas quickly took to the sky, searching for Gu Yue's figure. But their attention was more focused on the fireball.  The car quietly pulled over to the side and parked. In the sky, the fireball suddenly exploded, accompanied by roars and blasts, and countless sparks scattered across the sky, like the most spectacular fireworks.  Without considering the attack power, what Gu Yue did was to make the fireball as imposing as possible.  The car door opened, and six people quietly got out.  They didn't leave immediately; in fact, many soul-guided cars had already stopped, and the passengers got out to watch the fireball in the sky.  Tang Wulin glanced at the surroundings and shouted in a low voice, "Go!"  The six people easily jumped over the guardrail and ran wildly towards the distance.  With the cover of buildings, they quickly rushed into a cluster of buildings next to the highway.  The alarm sounded from the direction of the highway at this point.  Tang Wulin, pulling Xu Lizhi, Ye Xinglan leading Xu Xiaoyan, the agile Bao Bao, and Gu Yue's wind element assistance, they all fled like flying.  After a wild run for several kilometers, they boarded a bus heading to Bright City's downtown area, and only then did the six of them calm down.  After all, they were only thirteen or fourteen years old and not easily noticed.  Tang Wulin bought bus tickets and distributed them to his companions, and then he saw a familiar face.  Dance Master Long was sitting in a seat in the back, looking out the window as if he was in cold contemplation.  Tang Wulin walked over to him and sat down with a plop.  "We can go straight to the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy now, right? Let's not search anymore, please take us there."  Dance Master Long glanced at him, "Not bad in reacting."  Tang Wulin chuckled.  But the next words from Dance Master Long froze the smile on his face.  "Aren't you quite stingy? You've lost two cars now, aren't you heartbroken?"  Three black lines slid down his forehead. Of course, he was heartbroken! But what could he do about it?  It was all because of the devilish final exam arranged by the academy.  Dance Master Long ignored him and rested with his eyes closed.  Tang Wulin couldn't help but grumble in his heart. The academy's comprehensive quality training was really tough!  At this moment, with Dance Master Long present, Tang Wulin was not in a hurry. Whenever the dance teacher got off the bus, they would get off too.  After all, Dance Master Long had said that as long as they could defeat the opponents in the exchange match with the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy, they would naturally get full marks for the final exam and even extra points.  The architectural style of Bright City was very different from Shrek City. Shrek City had more of a cultural atmosphere, a combination of classical and modern. Bright City, on the other hand, was a pure high-tech steel forest.  Tall buildings stood one after another, each with its own characteristics, and many buildings looked strange and eye-catching.  Bright City was really big and bustling. The so-called bus took more than an hour, and they only felt like they had entered a steel forest, without knowing where in Bright City they were.  Dance Master Long stood up, got off the bus, and the six hurriedly followed.  The passing pedestrians all seemed to be in a hurry, as if pressed for time.  Dance Master Long walked in one direction, and at a bus stop, they switched to another bus, and everyone hurriedly followed.  After switching buses three times in this manner, Tang Wulin still felt like they were in a steel forest.  In terms of city size, Bright City might not be as big as Shrek City, but in terms of building density and population, it was definitely far beyond Shrek City.  "I don't like it here, it's too rushed and too oppressive," Xu Xiaoyan pouted.  Xie Xie said, "I don't like it either, it looks so busy."  While they were talking, a building in front caught their attention.  There were several huge characters on top of the building: Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy.  It looked like a metallic building, and below, the group of buildings spread outwards, connecting to three other buildings, forming a complex.  Is this a school?  Is the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy like this?  What a place of distinct character!  Tang Wulin glanced at Dance Master Long, just about to ask whether they were going straight over or if Dance Master Long was going to propose a contest to the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy through Shrek's official identity. Dance Master Long had already walked over.  Dance Master Long arrived in front of the building, and with a flash of light in his hand, something appeared.  A horn, with a metal box behind it.  This is...  Before they could react, Dance Master Long pressed a button on it, picked it up, and shouted towards the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy's building in front.  "Students of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy, listen up, the six of us come from Shrek Academy, with an average age of fourteen years old. We challenge your strongest under twenty years old. We have come here just to tell you the gap between you and the strongest academy on the continent." Chapter 452: Does it have to be so ruthless?  The cold voice was like rolling thunder, loud enough for several streets around to hear clearly. What Wu Zhangkong held in his hand was essentially a soul-guided megaphone! After saying these words, he pressed a button, then stuffed the megaphone into Tang Wulin's hands.  "Teacher Wu, does it have to be so ruthless?" Tang Wulin said helplessly.  Wu Zhangkong indifferently said, "Is it that easy to get a perfect score?"  Just as Tang Wulin was about to say something else, the soul-guided megaphone in his hand sounded again, "Students of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, listen up. The six of us are from Shrek Academy, with an average age of fourteen. We challenge your strongest under twenty. We have come here to tell you about the gap between you and the strongest academy on the continent."  What the heck, this thing even has a recording feature...  Then, Wu Zhangkong disappeared...  A cool breeze blew by, carrying a desolate feeling! Teacher Wu, what about leading the team? What about the trust between people!  The soul-guided megaphone sounded for the third time. Xie Xie looked at Tang Wulin, "It seems we have been trapped."  Xu Xiaoyan swallowed and said, "Is this what they call getting more without paying extra? It's indeed not easy to get a perfect score!"  Ye Xinglan pinched her fingers, "Just fight. If it were me, I would have shouted the same."  Xu Lizhi raised his plump hand beside Ye Xinglan, "Support!"  Gu Yue walked up to Tang Wulin, took the soul-guided megaphone, and looked at it, "It seems nothing wrong was said."  Tang Wulin sighed, "I want to give Teacher Wu a nickname, how about 'Pit King'?"  He finally found the switch on the soul-guided megaphone and turned off the megaphone that had already shouted four times.  In just these few minutes, they were already surrounded by onlookers.  There were students and staff from the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, as well as passersby.  A middle-aged man with blond hair came out of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy building. Seeing Tang Wulin turning off the megaphone, his expression had already become extremely gloomy.  "Shrek Academy?" The middle-aged man walked up to Tang Wulin and the others, asking with a somber expression.  Tang Wulin put the megaphone into the ring given to him by his master and said, "We come from the first grade class of the outer court of Shrek Academy."  "You want to challenge us, right? Very well. Follow me." After saying these words, the middle-aged man suddenly emanated a strong aura.  The aura was sharp, shooting straight into the sky, giving the surrounding onlookers a feeling as if their bodies were about to be split apart.  Everyone was shocked.  "Disperse, if you want to see the results, wait a moment, it will be broadcasted on the big screen."  After saying this, the middle-aged man suddenly retracted his aura and turned to walk inside.  Is it that easy? Tang Wulin looked at his companions, feeling a chill in his heart.  From the aura emitted by the other party, it was not difficult to see that this person had strength they could not contend with, and he might be on the same level as Teacher Wu.  The Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy has a prestigious reputation on the continent, second only to that level of Shrek Academy.  Just as Wu Zhangkong said, it's not easy to get a perfect score!  But no matter what, they had no way out now but to move forward bravely.  The pressure suddenly increased a bit, as they represented not only themselves but also Shrek.  At the street corner, Wu Zhangkong stood quietly, watching Tang Wulin and the six of them follow the staff member of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy inside, his expression still cold, but with a slight smile at the corner of his mouth.  This competition is the real tempering for them.  Entering the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, the first feeling Tang Wulin had was like walking into a modern factory.  Everything was filled with a metallic texture, and a giant metal ball quietly rotated in the center of the hall, obviously containing surging soul-guided energy, with a core array inside.  It emitted a faint light, making the whole hall's light bright and soft.  The reception desk looked more like that of a large company rather than an academy.  The white metallic reception desk had faint cloud patterns fluctuating, what was this? Clearly, it was a rare metal! Truly extravagant.  It's a pity I didn't bring my forging hammer, otherwise, Tang Wulin really felt the urge to refine it.  The middle-aged man didn't speak, just walked ahead, leading Tang Wulin and the six of them forward.  Passing by the reception, two beautiful receptionists stood up and respectfully saluted him.  There were quite a few people in the hall at this time, of various ages, many wearing the same clothes, white uniforms, which were clearly the students of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy.  Most of them looked at Tang Wulin and the six with curiosity, and in addition to curiosity, there was also rejection and malice.  The Shrek Academy, which is welcomed everywhere else, seems to be a big enemy here.  It seems that the students here have all been brainwashed.  Tang Wulin criticized in his heart and also silently observed the surroundings.  He could only hope that the upcoming competition would be a fair one, otherwise, if they specifically wanted to trap them, with the foundation of such an academy, it would be no problem at all.  The spacious elevator was also white metal; white seemed to be the color of honor here.  The elevator went up, fast and steady, without too much of an impact.  The middle-aged man always remained silent, and Tang Wulin and the six of them could only communicate with each other through eye contact.  They all seemed very calm.  The elevator stopped on the sixteenth floor, and the middle-aged man was the first to walk out, with Tang Wulin and the others following.  They came all the way to a place like a conference room, "Sit." The middle-aged man even omitted a word of politeness.  Tang Wulin was also mentally prepared, since they were here to smash the place, they had to be ready.  It would be strange if the other party's attitude was good, Teacher Wu, you really are the Pit King!  "Here to challenge us, right?" The middle-aged man seemed to want to confirm again, speaking to Tang Wulin.  Tang Wulin nodded, "A friendly competition."  The middle-aged man said, "Okay. In a moment, we will provide you with a space and choose opponents for you. Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy will not take advantage of your age, state your ages."  Tang Wulin felt a little relieved inside, secretly calling it a relief, if it's people of the same age, they really were not afraid of anyone.  "We average fourteen years old," Tang Wulin said.  The middle-aged man narrowed his eyes slightly, "Very good, we will send out students who are no older than fifteen. Their age is basically the same as yours. But there are two things I want to inform you in advance. First, this competition will be watched by our entire academy. Second, this competition will be broadcast on all the big screens in Mingdu City."  Tang Wulin felt solemn, "Isn't it just a private competition? Isn't it a bit too grand?" he asked tentatively.  The middle-aged man indifferently said, "It's needed! If you win, it will be an encouragement to all the students of our academy. If you lose, we can severely slap Shrek's face, so, it's needed."  Such a big grudge! So ruthless.  Tang Wulin now truly understood why Wu Zhangkong would use this method to let them issue a challenge. It seems the conflict between the two academies is much more intense than they imagined.  But things have already reached this point, they have no way out, and this will be a competition that they cannot afford to lose.  "Alright!" Tang Wulin's reply was just one word.  "Wait here." The middle-aged man stood up and left, leaving only Tang Wulin and the six of them in the conference room.  Just as Gu Yue was about to speak, she was stopped by Tang Wulin's raised hand, "Everyone adjust your state and prepare for the upcoming competition." This is their place, who knows if there are listening devices, talking too much can lead to problems.  Don't say anything, just fight and leave.  Gu Yue immediately understood his meaning, and all six sat cross-legged on the chairs, meditating, adjusting their states.  What they didn't know was that because of their arrival, the entire Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had already started to take action.  For the upcoming competition, within a short hour, various promotions had already spread throughout Mingdu, and even the entire Federation.  The Sun Moon Television, which spans all the cities of the Federation, announced that it would broadcast the competition half an hour after Tang Wulin and the others arrived.  And they named this competition, The Young Peak Battle of the Soul Master World.  On the street corner, Wu Zhangkong watched the big screen on the building in front of him, listening to the same voice echoing down street after street, his eyes slightly narrowed.  At this moment, his soul communicator rang.  "What's the situation?" Shen Yi's voice full of surprise came through.  Wu Zhangkong indifferently said, "Nothing much, those kids came to challenge the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, and I added fuel to the fire." Chapter 453: Showing Off to Us  Shen Yi said in a deep voice, "This is a big deal! Senior brother, why didn't you mention it earlier? The academy will be quite passive. The Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy has been promoting the event with great intensity. Now the entire Mingdu and the nearby cities already know about it, and the whole alliance has also received messages from various sources. If we lose this match, it will be a huge blow to the reputation of the academy. Have you considered all these?"  Wu Zhangkong replied, "I understand my disciples, that's why I made this decision. The greater the pressure, the better it can stimulate their potential. If they lose, I will take the blame and resign. But if they win, I believe that in the future, they will have the qualifications to challenge the title of this generation's Shrek Seven Monsters. I trust them to uphold the academy's reputation with everything they have, and I have confidence in my students."  Shen Yi was silent for a moment, "Alright, I'll ask about the academy's attitude first. I'll get back to you later."  Five minutes later, the soul communicator rang again.  "Cai Lao said that you should let go and do it. Winning or losing doesn't matter, no matter the outcome, you have to bring the kids back safely. They are the hope for the future. Moreover, Cai Lao also said..."  "Said what?" Wu Zhangkong asked, slightly surprised.  Shen Yi said, "Cai Lao said that she would prefer to see Tang Wulin and the others lose this match. Sometimes, losing isn't necessarily a bad thing."  Wu Zhangkong said decisively, "Failure is the mother of success, that’s true, but only by continuously achieving victories and building up one's momentum can one truly reach the pinnacle of success. I believe that they will definitely win this match."  Shen Yi said, "Alright, the academy will also make arrangements. Just take good care of them."  Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy conference room.  Tang Wulin opened his eyes and glanced at the clock on the wall, frowning slightly. It had been two hours since the people from Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had informed them about the match. Were they deliberately leaving them hanging here?  Through meditation, his condition had already reached its peak. Just as Wu Zhangkong had said, because of the pressure he was feeling, Tang Wulin's mental state was actually at its best, feeling as if he had endless energy.  The others also ended their meditation one after another.  "Still no movement? Should we go out and have a look?" Xie Xie asked Tang Wulin.  Tang Wulin said, "Let's wait a bit longer. Since they called us here, I think they won't just leave us here. It might be that they need some preparation work, or they are selecting opponents for us. Let's just wait and see."  As they were talking, the door of the conference room opened, and the middle-aged man from before entered again.  "The match is ready and will be held in our academy's Grand Spirit Arena. Do you need any more preparation?"  Tang Wulin replied, "We are also ready."  "Then follow me," said the middle-aged man, who, from beginning to end, had no intention of introducing himself or asking for Tang Wulin and his companions' names, and turned around to leave.  Following him, they took the elevator again, this time directly to the thirty-sixth floor, where they switched to another elevator. The elevator seemed to move horizontally and then descended. After sitting for two full minutes, the elevator finally stopped.  When the elevator doors opened, the previous metal texture suddenly disappeared. What appeared before their eyes was a stone space, with everything around constructed of stone, looking quite ancient. However, within these ancient stones, there seemed to be very strange energy fluctuations. Entering it, Tang Wulin felt a boiling sensation in his soul power.  The others had similar feelings, as if there was something here that allowed them to manipulate their own soul power more effectively.  The middle-aged man said nothing, just walked ahead.  This stone space was very spacious. Soon, they arrived at a hall about five hundred square meters in size. The surroundings were all stone, and the top was adorned with magnificent murals.  Tang Wulin looked up and saw that the mural seemed to tell a story. A young man was sitting in a square, surrounded by people, all wearing the uniform of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, but there were some differences compared to the current uniform, looking more ancient. However, the youth sitting in the center was wearing the uniform of Shrek Academy.  Who was this...? Tang Wulin felt somewhat familiar with the figure of the Shrek Academy youth in the mural.  On one side of the stone hall, there was a pair of giant doors forming a huge archway over fifteen meters high and thirty meters wide, easily allowing a mecha to pass through.  "This is the waiting area of the Grand Spirit Arena. You will be notified when it's time to enter the arena for the match," the middle-aged man pointed to the stone benches on the side, indicating that they could wait there.  Just the waiting area was this big? Tang Wulin had initially thought this was where they were going to compete.  He could vaguely hear some noisy sounds from outside. Although not clear, he was certain that the sound was real. This match was increasingly giving him a sense of oppression.  Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy must have made thorough preparations in the past two-plus hours.  The middle-aged man walked toward a side door and left. Just then, the originally faint noise suddenly erupted. The roaring sound startled Tang Wulin and the others.  A rousing voice echoed, "Shrek Academy has come to challenge us, can we tolerate this? Students of Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, let us unite and cheer for our contestants. We will make the people from Shrek leave in disgrace. We will announce to the continent that we are the strongest academy on the continent."  Is this... the sound from the competition site?  Amidst these inflammatory words, the roaring sound crazily erupted. Shouts of support and curses were interspersed.  "Are they showing off to us?" Gu Yue narrowed her eyes.  Tang Wulin said, "They probably want to put some pressure on us. Everyone, relax."  Xie Xie rolled his eyes, "What is pressure? How much does it cost per pound?"  Xu Xiaoyan was excited and eager to try, "It seems there are a lot of people out there. To show my evolved martial spirit in front of so many people, do you think I have a chance to enter the inner court too?"  Ye Xinglan said indifferently, "My Star God Sword is already longing for battle!"  Xie Xie burst into laughter, "Longing for battle doesn't seem like a phrase girls should use, right?"  "Do you want to die?" two voices said simultaneously.  Apart from Ye Xinglan, the other was from Xu Lizhi, and then a big meat bun was stuffed into Xie Xie's mouth, silencing him.  Xie Xie dodged behind Tang Wulin, removing the bun and said with a scared face, "Captain, I'm so scared."  Tang Wulin rolled his eyes, "Your acting skills are too poor. Xinglan, I don't know him. If you want to beat him up, I can help you hold him down."  Ye Xinglan snorted, "I'll take note of that, we'll talk about it when we get back. Wulin, arrange the tactics."  Tang Wulin's eyes flashed, and he nodded. Gu Yue raised her hands, and a ring of icy blue light rose under her feet, gradually forming an ice shield that enveloped the six of them.  It could isolate everything from the outside world, including sound. It was a completely enclosed space.  Ten minutes later.  "The match is about to start; please prepare to enter the arena," a cold voice came.  The ice shield did not shatter but quietly melted from the top, and the melted water elements evaporated into the air.  Watching the gradually disappearing ice shield, the middle-aged man's eyes flickered slightly. This control was very strong!  Ahead, the two giant doors of the archway slowly opened, and the noise that had already been loud became even stronger, and a fervent atmosphere rushed towards them.  Beyond the archway, the world was very bright, somewhat blinding.  The middle-aged man was the first to walk toward the gate. Chapter 454: Entering the Arena  Tang Wulin walked with his head high and stride bold, leading the way at the front. Behind him followed Gu Yue, Ye Xinglan, Xie Xie, Xu Xiaoyan, and Xu Lizhi, five people in total. They all puffed up their chests, for from this moment on, they were not representing themselves, nor were they completing their final exams. They were fighting for the glory of Shrek!  Only upon truly entering the grand Soul Fighting Arena could one feel its magnificent scale. Even Shrek Academy did not have a building of this size. It was a place constructed in complete imitation of an ancient colosseum, with a huge square that was over one thousand five hundred meters in diameter. The surrounding stands could accommodate more than one hundred and fifty thousand people at the same time.  Tang Wulin dared to say that this was probably the largest stadium on the entire continent. This should be the central area surrounded by the high-rise buildings of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. At this time, the stands were not to say completely full, but at least sixty to seventy percent of the seats were occupied. These people could not all be from the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy; an academy with ten thousand people would already be quite impressive. But so many people were seated, it was unknown where they had come from.  From the main platform in the center, Tang Wulin could vaguely sense several auras as heavy as mountains, all their attention was on the six people who had just walked out. The moment Tang Wulin and his group entered the grand Soul Fighting Arena, the originally noisy stands suddenly quieted down, and in an instant, over a hundred thousand pairs of eyes all fell on the six of them. Even though they were in a good mental state, facing such a scale of scrutiny, the pressure they felt was enormous for a moment.  Xu Xiaoyan and Xu Lizhi were faring the worst, their complexions having turned slightly pale. It must be known that almost all the spectators present bore hostility towards them. Each person had a different aura, and when these auras came together and bore down on them, it would have a considerable impact on their mental strength and mindset. The scene was more difficult than they had previously assessed.  Tang Wulin took a deep breath, suddenly stepped forward with his right foot, and a ring of golden light rose from under his foot. The halo burst with radiance, and instantly, with his body as the center, a strong surge of blood essence suddenly erupted. His entire body suddenly grew a bit taller, and that strong blood essence spread outwards. Although invisible, it enveloped all his companions within it.  Feeling the surging and rolling blood essence emitted from Tang Wulin, the other five people felt the pressure lighten. The noise from the outside seemed to fade, and more importantly, under the protection of Tang Wulin's blood essence which seemed to be burning, their previously suppressed momentum rose again.  On the main platform.  The old man sitting in the center frowned slightly, "Golden soul ring?"  "Rare. Could it be a million-year soul ring? Impossible! Even the Spirit Pagoda doesn't have million-year soul beasts. In the historical records, there have only been one or two occurrences of million-year soul beasts."  The middle-aged man sitting next to the old man frowned deeply. "But those one or two times, they were all related to Shrek Academy. Keep a close watch," the old man said in a deep voice.  "Yes!"  Seeing the golden soul ring released from his body and his suddenly taller stature, the pressure coming from the spectator seats decreased a bit, but soon, the cursing voices that had paused earlier escalated exponentially.  Tang Wulin did not look at the stands at all, walking with his head high towards the center of the grand Soul Fighting Arena. At this moment, he had already seen six people standing there in the center of the great Soul Fighting Arena. They were all dressed in the white uniforms of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, and it seemed that they were indeed about the same age as his own team.  Apart from the six people, there was also a middle-aged man floating in the air. He looked to be in his forties, covered in a layer of armor – soul armor. Judging by the magnificent degree of his soul armor, it was actually a three-word battle armor. Is he the referee? Or is he deliberately here to put pressure on us?  It was their first time facing such a grand scale scene. It was impossible not to be nervous, but Tang Wulin was just that sort of person; the greater the pressure, the more intensely his potential was stimulated. Just like his companions often said, this guy was like a spring: the harder you press it, the harder it bounces back.  Walking with his head high, he approached the opponents and lined up with his six people.  They were not wearing the uniforms of Shrek Academy; the uniforms had been taken away. Instead, they wore dark green sportswear, representing the vibrant dark green of Shrek Academy.  "Now, the competition rules will be announced," the middle-aged man floating in the air said in a deep voice.  "What?" Tang Wulin gestured that he couldn't hear clearly.  "I said the competition rules will be announced now!" The middle-aged man's voice included a bit of soul power.  "What are you saying? I can't hear you clearly! It's too noisy here," Tang Wulin asked innocently.  The middle-aged man's face darkened, "Are you here to compete?"  "I can't hear, what are you saying? There are so many flies here. I really can't hear. Can you spray some insecticide first to quiet down the flies?" Although Tang Wulin said he couldn't hear, his voice was very loud. With the infusion of soul power, his voice was not only spread throughout the entire arena but at least the venue's sound system could record and broadcast his voice.  "Raise the protective shield," the middle-aged man ordered with a stern face.  A layer of white transparent shield slowly rose from all around, looking almost solid, and after rising, it converged together in the air at a height of a hundred meters. The protective shield also had a soundproofing effect, and suddenly, the world became quiet.  "Can you hear clearly now?" the middle-aged man asked Tang Wulin coldly.  Tang Wulin nodded, tilted his head, and pinched a paper ball out of each ear, smiling, "The world is quiet."  Not just him, but Gu Yue, Ye Xinglan, and the others also took out paper balls from their ears.  The middle-aged man's facial muscles twitched visibly. If it were not for the fact that he was under the watchful eyes of the public, he really wanted to rush down and beat them. This match was not only visible to so many people on the spot but was also being broadcast to the soul guide TV stations across the continent as much as possible. The purpose was to hype up this match. All the preparations made earlier were to pressure these students from Shrek. After all, with an average age of just fourteen, no matter how strong they were, their youthful nature could not be changed. As long as they were intimidated, the possibility of winning for his side would increase a bit.  However, what he did not expect was that they would encounter Tang Wulin, who did not play by the rules. Just this act of pulling out paper balls had caused a stir in the audience, with curses coming from all directions. Unfortunately, with the protective shield's soundproofing, Tang Wulin and his team inside could not hear any of it.  However, for those watching the match through the soul guide TV without bias or who were leaning towards Shrek Academy, they could not help but laugh out loud. Shrek Academy really did cultivate a few treasures.  "Now, the competition rules will be announced," the middle-aged man said sternly.  "Okay, go ahead," Tang Wulin said obediently this time.  The middle-aged man said, "This match is primarily for sparring, but in order for both sides to truly display their abilities, only when facing the threat of severe injury, disability, or death will I, as the referee, terminate the match. Or eliminate some people from the match. The final victory depends on which side still has people capable of fighting after the other side is completely defeated. Did everyone understand?"  Tang Wulin said, "So you mean, aside from not being able to kill them, anything goes, and there are no other restrictions, right?"  As soon as these words came out, the six people opposite all glared at him.  But due to the majesty of the person in the air, they dared not make a sound.  "You can understand it that way," the middle-aged man said indifferently, with a flash of cold light in his eyes. Chapter 455: No Joking Around Anymore  Tang Wulin said, "Can I say a few words before we start fighting?"  The middle-aged man said, "Go ahead." In front of so many spectators, it would seem very ungracious not to let Tang Wulin speak.  Tang Wulin said, "First of all, although we are students from Shrek Academy, we came here this time solely because we have long admired the strength of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, and specifically came to challenge it. However, since we have only enrolled in Shrek Academy for one term, we really can't represent our academy. So, we are here to compete on our own behalf, and I want to make that clear. We are the worst of Shrek Academy and cannot represent it."  "What?" The middle-aged man was greatly surprised. Neither he nor the high-level officials of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy expected this youngster to say such a thing! They had been busily preparing for the past few hours, aiming to make the most impressive showing possible. They were very confident about this competition. Winning would greatly enhance the prestige of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy; on the other hand, it would be a huge blow to Shrek Academy.  But now, with Tang Wulin’s words, he placed himself and his five companions at the very bottom of Shrek Academy, and he said they were not representing the academy in the competition. Wouldn't this mean that even if the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy won, it wouldn't have the expected effect? And if they lost, where would they put their face?  Looking at Tang Wulin’s innocent smiling face, the middle-aged man in the air could hardly contain himself. He controlled his body and descended from the sky, landing in front of Tang Wulin.  "Weren't you the ones who said you came to exchange pointers and challenge our academy on behalf of Shrek Academy?" the middle-aged man said angrily.  Tang Wulin sighed, a flash of light appeared in his hand, and he took out the soul amplifier he had used earlier, then pressed the button.  Wu Zhangkong's cold voice echoed throughout the competition venue, "Students of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, listen. The six of us come from Shrek Academy, with an average age of fourteen, challenging your strongest under the age of twenty. We came here this time just to tell you the gap between you and the strongest academy on the continent."  "These words don't say anywhere that we are representing Shrek Academy in the competition! It only says that we are from Shrek Academy, with an average age of fourteen. Then we want to challenge you. To show you the gap with our academy. But we represent ourselves!"  The middle-aged man was so angry that he almost spit out a mouthful of blood. We’ve prepared so much, and you say this? This is simply...  But these little guys are only fourteen years old! Can a fourteen-year-old child come up with such a shameless strategy?  Although they had been opponents of Shrek Academy for countless years, in the heart of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, the power and authority of Shrek were unquestionable.  So when Tang Wulin and his companions appeared, they didn't think twice and prepared to face them with the strongest lineup, while also wanting to strike at the reputation of Shrek Academy to the greatest extent.  But they didn't expect that this fully-powered punch would hit cotton.  The middle-aged man really wanted to ask, since when did Shrek Academy become so shameless?  But he couldn't really say that! Insulting Shrek Academy, he still didn't dare to do it.  Tang Wulin blinked, "Are we still fighting? If you admit defeat, we don't have to fight."  The light flowed on the middle-aged man’s battle armor, with an aura that seemed like it could erupt at any moment like an active volcano.  This was a three-word battle armor, equivalent to the level of a Title Douluo.  To kill Tang Wulin and the others would really be as simple as lifting a hand.  "Alright, alright. No more joking. We are representing Shrek Academy. Long live Shrek, fight for the glory of Shrek! Victory!"  Just as the middle-aged man was about to spit blood, Tang Wulin’s expression suddenly became serious, his voice high and full of momentum as he made the declaration.  The middle-aged man was stunned but also relieved that these little guys didn't continue to be unreasonable. Otherwise, how could he end this? Their Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy couldn't make things difficult for a few children, right?  "The competition is about to begin," he ascended back into the sky.  "Oh, and although we represent the academy, what I just said is also true; we really are the worst few of the academy," Tang Wulin emphasized deliberately.  The middle-aged man's figure in the air wobbled, almost falling from the sky.  Tang Wulin smiled slightly, stepped forward, and said to his opponents, "My name is Tang Wulin, from the first grade, Class One of the Outer Court of Shrek Academy."  This time he didn't say class president; after all, the Outer Court first grade was already the lowest level class.  Don't underestimate what Tang Wulin just said. With his words, the momentum that the entire venue had gathered for the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had quietly dissolved by more than half, and even the conviction of victory of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy students was affected.  "Long Chen!" The leader of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy was a tall and handsome young man, his whole body seemingly radiating light, looking about fourteen or fifteen years old, but already tall enough to compare with adults.  When Tang Wulin said those words earlier, he was the only one among the six from the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy who did not show any change in expression, young but as stable as a mountain.  Tang Wulin said, "Looking at how tall you are, you're not over twenty years old, right? If you're overage, it doesn't count even if you win."  Long Chen glanced at him coldly, "I hope your strength is as good as your mouth."  Gu Yue stood by Tang Wulin's side, "Gu Yue from the first grade, Class One of the Outer Court of Shrek Academy!"  The opponent stepped forward to Long Chen's side, also female, "Xueliu Shuang!"  This girl was extremely beautiful, with a slender figure, standing beside Long Chen, indeed quite a match.  In terms of appearance and figure, Tang Wulin was even better than Long Chen, only not as tall.  Xueliu Shuang did not look at Gu Yue but focused on Tang Wulin, seemingly very interested in him.  "Ye Xinglan." Ye Xinglan walked to the other side of Tang Wulin.  The third member of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy stepped forward, "Yu Dingqi!" This was a youth with a sturdy frame, broad shoulders, and powerful arms, clearly one who excelled in strength.   "Xie Xie!"  "Xu Xiaoyan!"  "Xu Lizhi!"  The remaining three from Shrek Academy stepped forward simultaneously.  The other three from the opposing side also followed suit.  "Jian Mochen!" This was a plump boy with a figure that could compete with Xu Lizhi.  "Kuang Zhan Tian!" A fierce and domineering girl!  Yes, this was a girl, with such a name. It could be considered quite unique.  When Tang Wulin heard this petite but fierce-looking girl's name, he almost told her that someone like her should come to Shrek Academy! Definitely a monster.  "Weng Daimin!" The last one was a girl with a gentle and weak appearance, with short blue hair that looked very pure.  Six against six.  But unlike the competitions they had previously gone to other academies for, this time, neither side took the initiative to declare what type of soul master they were.  Instead, they just said their names.  "Both sides, retreat and prepare for the competition. Retreat to a distance of one hundred meters," said the middle-aged man floating in the air, having regained his composure.  No matter what, as long as they won this competition, there were still many angles to work with.  At that time, even if Tang Wulin and the others did not admit to representing the academy, it would already be too late. After all, they were students currently studying at Shrek Academy.  Both sides slowly retreated, and the casual expressions on Tang Wulin's face had already quietly disappeared. This time, the opponents seemed to be about the same age as them. Each one emitted a different aura, and being in their own territory, they would definitely not be easy to deal with.  They had to be careful and cautious.  During the retreat, the six of them had already formed a triangular battle formation.  On the other side, the six from the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy also displayed their formation.  Long Chen stood prominently at the forefront, flanked by the short and stout Yu Dingqi and the rotund Jian Mochen.  Could it be that they were agility-type soul masters?  Behind them were Xueliu Shuang, Weng Daimin, and Kuang Zhan Tian, lined up in a row.  Weng Daimin was in the center.  From this formation, it could be seen that Weng Daimin should be a control-type soul master.  As for Xueliu Shuang and Kuang Zhan Tian, it was somewhat unclear.  The distance of one hundred meters was quickly enough for both sides to retreat, and they fixed their gaze on their opponents.  "The competition, begins!" Chapter 456: The Battle Begins  With a loud shout from the middle-aged man, the confrontation representing the two major academies, which was also the last match of Tang Wulin and his six companions' final exams, finally started.  This time, Tang Wulin didn't rush out immediately but released his martial soul together with his companions. A large number of purple soul rings rose up, with Tang Wulin's own three rings, three circles of purple soul rings flickering. Not many, but quite impressive for their age.  The six from the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy also released their martial souls. Long Chen stepped forward, the sound of dragon chanting followed, and then he grew three inches taller, with four soul rings rising from underneath his feet. Four purples! Yes, all four of his soul rings were purple. This was somewhat beyond Tang Wulin's expectations. Such cultivation could already be comparable to Wu Siduo. Long Chen, a name that seems to really exist on the list of young geniuses. It seems to be a bit lower than Wu Siduo? Keep in mind, Wu Siduo has a twin martial soul, and she also has a martial soul fusion skill. The person in front of him seems to have only one martial soul. To be ranked close to Wu Siduo with a single martial soul shows his strength. He must be the ace of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy in this age group.  By Long Chen's side, Jian Mochen and You Dingqi also released their martial souls. You Dingqi's martial soul was a hammer, not an ordinary hammer, a short hammer handle connected to a long chain wrapped around his arm, a meteor hammer. Three rings, three circles of purple soul rings. Indeed extraordinary. But still not four rings.  As for Jian Mochen, two yellow, two purple, four rings! His martial soul turned out to be a shield, a round shield with complex patterns on it. Faintly, it seemed to be the shape of a tiger head. A defense-type soul master! The shield was so large that it could completely cover his stout body behind it.  Among the three women behind them, Xue Liushuang, a four-ring soul master, all purple soul rings. Weng Daimin, three purple soul rings. Kuang Zhan Tian, three purple soul rings. Good fellow, among the six, there were three four-ring soul masters! This lineup was enough to compare with the young genius list in our class, right?  Tang Wulin silently praised in his heart, and while admiring, he felt that was probably it. The six people chosen by the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy were indeed excellent, but Tang Wulin believed that if they faced Wu Siduo's five, it was a bit hard to say who would win. And they had defeated Wu Siduo and her team.  The students of this generation of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy were indeed strong, but unfortunately, they might not know much about Shrek Academy. The outer court first-year students of this generation's Shrek Academy could only be described as stunningly brilliant.  What Tang Wulin didn't know was that after Shrek Academy had completed its admissions, the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy did get some information. They also knew that five of the young geniuses on the list had become freshmen of Shrek Academy. But that was about it.  While Tang Wulin and his companions were waiting just now, in fact, the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy was also conducting investigations. Among their six people, not one was on the list of young geniuses. So it was natural for them to believe in certain victory.  Long Chen stepped on the ground with his left foot, and his body suddenly soared up, charging towards Tang Wulin and his companions. The light of his second soul ring flickered, and a sonorous dragon chant followed. The second soul skill, Dragon's Chant! Rolling sound waves, like substance, emerged around his body, with faint golden figures appearing, vaguely in the shape of a giant dragon. A strong aura of light erupted.  His martial soul, the Light Holy Dragon. The ace among the aces of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy! Recognized as the most hopeful to become a four-word battle armor master among the younger generation, here, he was absolutely the favored son of heaven.  When Long Chen saw that among the six from Shrek Academy, not even one had four rings, he already recognized the truth in Tang Wulin's own words of being the worst. Long Chen was very clear that the match was being broadcasted live at the scene, and countless people were watching. This was a great opportunity for him to make a name for himself! To step on the Shrek Academy students and establish his position in the soul master world was absolutely perfect.  "Hehe!" Tang Wulin laughed, and not just him, his companions laughed as well. Tang Wulin waved his hand, signaling everyone not to follow, and he lightly touched the ground with the tip of his foot. It didn't look as domineering as Long Chen, just an ordinary speed heading forward.  Tang Wulin's three purple soul rings retracted, and the golden light rings that had once shocked the audience reappeared, with golden scales slowly emerging. "Roar!" Long Chen's Dragon's Chant became even louder. One-on-one, your three rings against my four rings, and my martial soul is the Light Holy Dragon.  Good! Long Chen was overjoyed in his heart, intending to crush the leader of the opposing side first, which would definitely be the best moment to perform. Both sides were getting closer, and suddenly Long Chen felt something was wrong; his opponent didn't seem to be affected by his Dragon's Chant. His eyes were very bright, and the look in his eyes was a bit off—was that pity?  What are you pitying! The distance of a hundred meters came in an instant, and Tang Wulin also soared into the air. As he rose, the golden soul rings on his body bloomed. Blood reversed, and the mighty aura of the Golden Dragon King erupted from the center of his body.  Long Chen stepped on the ground with his left foot, rushing into the sky, his arms spread, the first soul ring flickered, Dragon's Claw! He didn't underestimate Tang Wulin at all. Being the number one young talent of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, he was stable and solid, never underestimating his opponents no matter when. He knew he should be able to suppress the opponent, but he still gave it his all. So, while the first soul ring shone, the fourth soul ring also flickered. The dual rings shone simultaneously, a high-level soul master technique for controlling soul rings.  The fourth soul skill, Dragon's Force! The bloodline of the Light Holy Dragon within him erupted with powerful strength that suffused his entire body, a pair of dragon claws shone with dazzling golden light, and a layer of fine scales appeared on the surface of his body, although not real dragon scales, they already had some form.  He wanted to give his opponent a one-hit kill, directly crush Tang Wulin, and with their momentum greatly boosted, then crush other students from Shrek Academy. By then, even if the other side said he wasn't the strongest from Shrek Academy, they were still students of Shrek Academy! With such a defeat, what else is there to say?  At this moment, Tang Wulin's aura erupted. When the auras of both sides were sure to touch each other first. In that instant, Long Chen felt an indescribable fear suddenly arise from the deepest part of his heart. How is that possible? How could I feel fear? He was full of doubts, but everything was right in front of him. He felt as if his heart was gripped by something, and all his blood vessels trembled.  In front of him, Tang Wulin, who also soared into the sky, seemed to grow taller and taller, while he seemed to shrink in front of him. The power of Dragon's Claw diminished, and he gritted his teeth to drive his soul power, trying to control his trembling. But contrary to his wishes, Tang Wulin's aura was too strong, so much so that Dragon's Force directly collapsed. Dragon's Force was to enhance the aura of his Light Holy Dragon bloodline.  But at this time, the bloodline aura was directly suppressed, and even the effect of the soul skill was forced back. This was the gap between bloodlines, and also where Tang Wulin's Golden Dragon King bloodline was powerful. 
Chapter 449: "The Neighbor's Dog"  After carefully inspecting the house and determining there were no major issues, the decision was pretty much made. Nanfeng would talk with the real estate agent and the previous homeowner about the remaining matters.  Coily, the dog, was in an exceptionally good mood today, frolicking and enjoying itself thoroughly. Seeing this, Nanfeng laughed and said, "Coily, don't worry. Next time we come, you can move in directly and play as long as you want every day. You can swim in the sea and play with the little fish and shrimp too~"  After swimming in the sea and being called back to shore by Fang Zhao, Coily dug in the sand for a while. When it was time to leave, its doggy eyes kept staring out the car window, full of reluctance.  Coily was happy, lying in the car and starting to fantasize about its future happy life.  What impression does Coily have of the ocean? The impression is like enjoying a seafood buffet without having to pay.  Its cheerful mood continued all the way back to the dormitory.  After Nanfeng and the others left, Fang Zhao closed the dormitory door and called, "Coily, come here."  Coily rushed over, wagging its tail. "Did you have fun today?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Woof!"  "Is it fun over there?" Fang Zhao asked again.  Coily jumped up and barked again, wagging its tail vigorously. "Speak."  "Fun!" Coily said.  It was now able to switch languages proficiently, speaking clearly and fluently.  "Okay." Fang Zhao nodded and then turned on the learning machine.  Coily: "..."  Its ears twitched, and it discreetly moved a paw back, trying to retreat.  Fang Zhao ignored its retreat, turned on the learning machine, and showed it a newly created folder. Inside were newly purchased e-books:  - "Marine Environmental Protection Law" - "Youth Environmental Protection Knowledge Series" - "List of Protected Marine Wildlife" - "Marine Environmental Management" - "A Hundred Ocean Knowledge Points Every Modern Person Should Know" - "The Ocean, My Home" - ...  All were ocean-related books, twenty in total. There were not only e-books but also twenty sets of corresponding tests.  Coily: "..."  Its perked ears drooped.  "You know you read fast, it should be even faster now, right? After you finish reading the twenty books in the folder and get full marks on all twenty sets of test questions, you can go play in the sea. There are still no more than fifteen days until the move," Fang Zhao said.  For Coily, with its current memory and learning ability, getting full marks was not difficult.  Fang Zhao wasn't worried about Coily's safety in the sea; rather, he was concerned that Coily might eat some endangered animals to extinction.  Fang Zhao still didn't know the full capacity of Coily's stomach. During the "Port Star Record" show, Coily had secretly eaten in the desert and also in the sea. However, due to Fang Zhao's warnings, it had not really let loose and eaten freely.  After all, the stay on Port Star was short, and with Fang Zhao's control, as well as consideration for the other people on Port Star, it couldn't eat too much. But once they moved to the new house, Coily would have the opportunity to go to the sea every day. Without restrictions, it would be like an invasive species disrupting the ecological balance of the marine area with the force of one dog.  Fang Zhao had to make Coily understand some things in advance. It was not easy for marine life to recover to its current state, and it couldn't be destroyed by Coily.  Without getting full marks on the tests, it should not think about going into the sea and instead continue to accompany the learning machine.  That day, Nanfeng came to find Fang Zhao about the renovation of the new residence. As soon as he entered the dormitory, he saw Coily facing the wall, squatting there with its head drooping and tear stains under its doggy eyes.  Pausing for a moment, Nanfeng shifted his gaze away to find Fang Zhao and deal with the pressing matters at hand. As for Coily, this was normal, and Nanfeng was already able to approach the situation calmly.  After discussing the renovation, Nanfeng remembered something he saw that day and said, "By the way, boss, do you know about the stuff on the internet today?"  "What's up?" Fang Zhao had been writing a paper today and had his communications set to not disturb him unless it was important.  There had been many topics about him online lately, and many people were looking for him. Fang Zhao had to set his device to Do Not Disturb mode.  "Do you know about Will's painting?" Nanfeng asked.  "Do you mean the one about Will's graduation work?" Fang Zhao had seen Will's graduation exhibition and knew that it had received an A+ grade. One of the paintings was of Coily, titled "The Neighbor's Dog."  It had been two days since the exhibition, and Fang Zhao had been writing his paper in the dormitory since this morning, so he really didn't know what had happened online.  Nanfeng shared the information he knew with Fang Zhao. It turned out that after Will's graduation exhibition ended, the college displayed his paintings on the school's website, which sparked a lively discussion.  Will had successfully completed his advanced study plan last year—the short-term goal was to paint Fang Zhao, and the ultimate goal was to paint Fang Zhao's dog. The short-term goal had been achieved long ago; Will's "My Neighbor" had previously caused a stir online. Some netizens even joked that Will had painted Fang Zhao to look like an alien.  This time, following "My Neighbor," "The Neighbor's Dog" once again topped the hot search list for the day.  "The Neighbor's Dog" was the painting Will spent the most time on during his advanced studies, the one which he researched the longest and poured the most effort into, and also the work he was most satisfied with.  This painting's style was similar to "My Neighbor," only it appeared more incomprehensible. At least "My Neighbor" could be recognized as a person, whereas "The Neighbor's Dog" was unrecognizable as a dog, much less as a small pet dog. Unless someone saw the title of the painting, no one would think that the image was of a dog.  The colors were vibrant with life, mysterious, and imbued with a grand aura. It seemed too otherworldly, yet one couldn't pinpoint what was incorrect. The more one studied it, the more a sense of trepidation would arise from within.  "Is Fang Zhao's dog that terrifying?" A student from Huangyi, after seeing the painting, recalled the small curly-haired dog encountered on campus. They went online to search for Fang Zhao's dog, confirming their memory.  Those from Huangyi who had experienced Fang Zhao's graduation concert and analyzed Will's painting closely had a different impression. "If I really had to say, the feeling this painting gives me is similar to Fang Zhao's piece 'η.' It's a bit beyond the understanding of ordinary people."  Even laypeople standing in front of this painting, quietly observing for a few seconds, would feel inexplicably powerful and shiver uncontrollably, even if they couldn't understand it.  Online, the discussions were even more intense.  "I've realized that after his advanced studies, Will has completely let loose, his thoughts freely roving, beyond the comprehension of the likes of us."  "What grudge, what grievance! To paint Fang Zhao's dog like this!"  "The friend above definitely hasn't seen Will's previous work. Take a look at how Will painted Fang Zhao in 'My Neighbor.'"  "Maybe Will was bitten by a dog and has a psychological shadow over dogs. Otherwise, he wouldn't paint such a scary picture! A cute little thing was turned into a monster!"  "This is called art!"  "The world of artists is indeed not something we ordinary people can understand."  "Not to praise or criticize, but I stared at the painting for a full five minutes and still couldn't grasp what he's trying to express. Yet, I just feel like it's amazing, and there's this strange feeling in my heart."  "This kind of painting that explores deeper levels requires careful study."  "This painting can't be easy to sell, right?"  "You could buy it to ward off evil spirits."  "It's still worth investing in. I'm optimistic about Will as an artist; he's still young."  After Will's painting was displayed on the school's website, there were people who wanted to buy it. In the end, a collector from Muzhou bought "The Neighbor's Dog" at a high price, far exceeding Huangyi's estimated price.  Some people thought that the Muzhou collector was overly enthusiastic about Coily, and when it came to Coily, people from Muzhou always seemed to lack calmness.  Others thought it was pure hype, not for Will as a person but for Fang Zhao's dog. People from Muzhou are indeed incomprehensible when it comes to dogs, as if they had lost their reason.  Regarding this, Huangzhou TV's Arts and Calligraphy channel specially sent someone to interview the collector who bought the painting at a high price.  During the interview, the Muzhou collector said, "Many people buy Will's paintings, investing only in Will as a person, not in the painting itself. I'm different. I look at the painting and, of course, at the dog in the painting. I have a premonition that this painting will be hyped to sky-high prices in the future."  Seeing the interview live, Little Bear commented, "Muzhou people really have a terrifying intuition about dogs. Humans are indeed strange creatures."  Thus, due to Will's painting "The Neighbor's Dog," Coily also appeared on the hot search and made it to the headlines of Huangzhou's current affairs news.  After Nanfeng left, Fang Zhao flipped through the online news and said to Coily, "You don't need to go out these few days. Stand for five more minutes, then go back to reading. You only scored 62 on this morning's test; take another look at the section on protecting animals! Whales are not for eating! Neither is coral!" Chapter 450 Moving  Mao spent another two days on memorizing ocean conservation animals and plants, using videos and pictures to reinforce his memory. He studied both old and new century creatures, memorizing their appearances and behaviors. To obtain the permission to swim freely in the sea as soon as possible, Mao put in a lot of effort once again. The last time he worked this hard was to earn his own helmet.  Finally, Mao's test scores improved from barely passing to seventy or eighty points, and then to ninety. With one last reinforcement of his memory, he could succeed.  Nan Feng originally thought that Mao would have a small mood due to being restricted from going out because of something online and being scolded. Unexpectedly, Mao became even more spirited day by day, unaffected at all.  The follow-up work at Huangzhou Art Academy was already completed by Fang Zhi, and all the refresher courses had ended. After the other students in the refresher class had also completed their final assessments, the academy held a graduation ceremony for the students who successfully completed the Huang Art Twelve Rites refresher class and issued certificates.  The ceremony at Huang Art's highest academic hall was simple, as most of those who got into the Twelve Rites were no longer ordinary students and were more academically inclined. There was no need for anything fancy.  At the ceremony, Fang Laotaiye, as a family member, sat in the audience, watching Fang Zhi on stage with tears in his eyes. He took many photos and videos, shaking with excitement, and shared them on his Moments and the retirement home chat group.  After the ceremony, Fang Laotaiye hurried to Fang Zhi. "Let me see, let me see."  Carefully receiving the certificate that seemed to glow with gold from Fang Zhi, Fang Laotaiye couldn't stop smiling. He took several high-definition photos before handing the certificate back to Fang Zhi.  "Keep it safe; don't let dogs chew on it. There's an old man in our retirement home whose grandson's dog tore up his newly acquired diploma, and it couldn't even be glued back together," Fang Laotaiye warned, glancing at Mao.  Mao widened his innocent dog eyes as if bearing a great injustice.  Fang Laotaiye turned back to Fang Zhi, "Anyway, make sure you keep it safe."  How many people can get a certificate from the Twelve Rites refresher class each year? It's the most prestigious refresher class in the circle, and those who get in will be masters in the future—what a treasure! At least no one in the Yanbei retirement home has this.  After attending Fang Zhi's graduation ceremony and taking enough photos, Fang Laotaiye was satisfied. They had stayed in Huangzhou for quite some time, and it was time to go back.  Before leaving Huangzhou, Fang Laotaiye looked at his gentle and honest great-grandson and worriedly instructed Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, "You must protect Xiao Zhi's personal safety! I heard there are many crazy fans nowadays, and competitors use underhanded methods. My Xiao Zhi is just too good-tempered and unguarded, unaware of the malice of others."  Yan Biao, Zuo Yu: "......"  Do you remember what happened the year Fang Zhi served? Do you know how he became a reserve officer? Do you know how he dominates in games?!  How thick must the filters on the old gentleman be to say such things, or is it that memory fades with age, selectively forgetting some key events?  But then again, Fang Zhi does seem a lot more gentle now? Could this be the influence of art?  No matter what they thought, Yan Biao and Zuo Yu could only stiffly assure Fang Laotaiye, "Yes, we will definitely protect him!"  After another photo with Fang Zhi, Fang Laotaiye left contentedly, planning to visit again when Fang Zhi moved into his new home and had some free time.  The academic refresher was temporarily concluded, and the students were about to leave the school. However, before that, they would hold an academic conference report at Huang Art, mainly for students. It wasn't a formal and serious academic report, and the student union even set up a live stream for those who couldn't attend.  Fang Zhi didn't hold back; he shared all the experience and techniques he had summarized during the refresher year. The academic report lasted two hours, but the follow-up interaction and signing event went on for four hours. Some even suggested that Fang Zhi should stay at the school, as with his current strength and honors, he was qualified to become a lecturer at Huang Art.  "Ah, it would be great if Fang Zhi could stay at Huang Art permanently," a student sighed.  However, they soon found that although Fang Zhi had left, he still appeared in their exam questions...  ---  After completing a year of refresher studies and leaving Huang Art, Fang Zhi returned to Yanzhou to pack up and move. The weather was nice, and he moved from the city center of Qian Market in Yanzhou to the seaside.  Perhaps sensing the ocean, "Rabbit" was exceptionally lively today, moving around in its tank, with its "ears" always trying to probe outwards.  Fang Zhi had a large aquarium custom-made and transferred "Rabbit" from the portable small tank to the big one. In its new home, "Rabbit" crawled around in the aquarium, looking like a fluffy, moving cotton candy. However, this cotton candy almost stung two burglars to death. It was perfect camouflage. Not only the overly colorful ones are dangerous, but also those that look too cute.  The happiest about moving to the new home was Mao. It had completed the test the day before moving, and early this morning, it was running around, urging Fang Zhi to move. Watching the collection shelf move into the house and seeing that not a single game helmet was missing, Mao wanted to lock its own learning machine on the shelf, but Fang Zhi took it out.  "The learning machine is still needed," Fang Zhi said.  Mao whined in disappointment, walked out with its tail down, but soon perked up again, eager to inspect the new territory. Zuo Yu was on the lead.  Dogs have a strong sense of territory, and marking territory is their nature. The new home had a larger territory, and Mao happily patrolled it, howling a few times to greet the other dogs in the residential area. From today on, it would live here!  By the time Fang Zhi finished tidying up, it was dark. He let Yan Biao and the other two go home and gave them a couple of days off. Once they left, Mao, which was lying at the door, scurried over.  "I want to go swimming in the sea," Mao said.  "Just swimming?" Fang Zhi asked.  "...and also to find food," Mao cautiously watched Fang Zhi's expression. "Hungry."  During the refresher period at Huang Art, Mao was often in a state of hunger, only managing to sneak some food when Fang Zhi took it out. It had been seriously hungry this year.  Fang Zhi had noticed that Mao's appetite had been increasing. Its diet had also expanded. It would now sniff at things it wasn't interested in before, as if judging whether they were edible. Once, it sniffed around in the car for a while, and Nan Feng thought someone had tampered with the car and immediately sent it for inspection. In the end, apart from some unexplained scratches, there was nothing wrong with the car. Later, Fang Zhi asked it, and it said it was hungry at the time and smelled food.  What could be eaten and what could not, Mao knew. Even if it hadn't seen it before, it could distinguish. Before, it hadn't had the opportunity to eat freely, but now that it had moved to a new house, it didn't want to miss the rare chance to eat to its heart's content and didn't want to wait any longer.  Mao had been enduring all day, waiting for Nan Feng and the others to leave before suggesting going out to forage.  Fang Zhi checked the weather forecast, which promised clear skies for the next few days. Since Mao had met the test requirements and quickly and accurately answered several questions, Fang Zhi decided to let it go out.  However, it was easier to be noticed during the day, and people from the nearby neighborhoods were active along the coast. Fang Zhi had seen people going out to sea on yachts while moving. It was best for Mao to go out at night.  "Okay," Fang Zhi said.  "I want to swim further out to find food, awoo," Mao added, saying it would return before eight o'clock the next morning. It wanted to play a little longer.  Fang Zhi thought for a moment and agreed. "Pay attention to weather changes, avoid boats, and return immediately if something is wrong."  "Yes!"  "Remember, you can't eat protected animals!"  "I won't eat! Definitely won't eat!"  "Don't eat randomly either!"  "I won't eat randomly!" Mao promised.  "Go ahead."  Permission granted, Mao dashed out and plunged into the sea under the cover of night. Chapter 451 Disappeared!  Fang Zhao looked at the distant sea, placing the dog leash on the cabinet by the door. This was the first time he had let Curly go out on its own, and he was still somewhat worried. However, he couldn't always keep an eye on Curly. After such a long period of discipline, he was willing to give Curly a chance to go out independently. He would decide on what measures to take in the future based on Curly's performance this time.  Curly's affair was not a trivial matter. Fang Zhao had never relaxed his constraints on Curly. Without proper guidance, it could become a killing weapon in the hands of those with ulterior motives. Weapons have no concept of right or wrong; the rightness or wrongness lies in the person who uses the weapon. Fortunately, Curly had its own consciousness, cognitions, and notions; it was a complete living being.  Moreover, Fang Zhao had always felt that his rebirth was related to Curly, but so far, he had not discovered what exactly it was. Being strict with Curly was both guidance and protection.  "Don't go astray."  The wind at night had gotten a bit stronger, and the waves forcefully washed against the shore before retreating to an invisible place. Everything was filled with the unknown.  At the same time, completely unaware of Fang Zhao's worries, Curly was truly like an unleashed wild dog, swimming around in the sea and riding the waves. Oxygen? Breathing? It didn't need that. Once it plunged into the sea, it completely forgot there was such a thing. Ignoring breathing, water pressure, and light, Curly happily chased after schools of fish.  It couldn't eat coral, so it licked the stones next to the coral. Not tasty. It also went up to tease a sea turtle. It could even sing.  "La la la la la la, watching that sea turtle swim in the water~"  As a musical artist dog, if it could talk, it could sing. No one was around to hear it, so there was no need to worry about being discovered. If it sensed someone nearby, it would dive deep or hide.  Although hungry, once Curly entered the sea, it did not open its mouth to eat, deciding to play first. It could play for a long time this trip since Fang Zhao was not around and no one was watching it. After chasing turtles and fish for a while, Curly spotted a large fish, still among the protected marine animals, belonging to the category that could not be eaten, but this did not lessen Curly's interest in it.  Protected animals could not be eaten, but no one said they couldn't be played with~ Curly gave up on the schools of fish and the turtle, chasing after that fish instead, closely following it and occasionally touching it with its paws.  I'm not eating; I'm just touching.  The fish sped up, and so did Curly. With a stroke of its doggy paddle, it kept up easily, without thinking how it could swim as fast as a sailfish with its doggy paddle.  After playing for a while, Curly grew even hungrier and decided to eat something first. It would not eat any of the protected marine animals, not even a fin, even if Fang Zhao couldn't see, it didn't dare. After all, it was its first time running out, and it didn't have the gall yet. As soon as it thought of eating, the first reaction in its mind was the books Fang Zhao had shown it and the test questions in the learning machine, as well as the reflection after facing the wall.  As for those not among the protected animals, it would not be polite!  Time to eat!  While excited, Curly was also a bit confused. Where should it start? As the first time it could independently hunt in the sea, its first prey should be special; this should be the "sense of ceremony" that Nanfeng mentioned before, right?  Curly carefully searched for its first prey of the day. Finally, it found one. It looked somewhat like a fish in the protected animal album, but that was just in appearance. Curly recognized at a glance the differences in that fish and quickly analyzed multiple pieces of evidence, so even if it returned and Fang Zhao asked, it could respond confidently.  Having ruled it out from the protected animals, Curly had the confidence to act. Although this prey was not large, less than a meter long, it was very attractive to Curly. Once the target was determined, Curly dog-paddled and chased after it.  ---  One o'clock in the morning.  A certain counter-terrorism department in Yanzhou was still working tensely.  "No suspicious individuals have been spotted by the night duty team, and the sonar array has not detected any suspicious targets."  "Continue to strengthen the defense and control of the target area, pay attention to patrolling and near-shore detection, carefully identify subtle abnormal sounds and energy fluctuations; don't let even a bird or a fish slip by!"  They received a message that the notorious "Empire of Tomorrow" also known as the "T" organization, would launch an attack on Yanzhou at two in the morning Yanzhou time. They only knew the general area, the specific location was unknown.  Moreover, the "T" organization had stolen the latest bionic technology, and no one knew what kind of modifications those lunatics had made.  At the same time, in a hidden basement.  In the dim basement, only the glow from the screens could be seen. Seven or eight people, standing or sitting, were staring at one of the screens.  "We successfully bypassed a patrol boat!" one of them exclaimed excitedly, his bloodthirsty gaze sweeping over the area on the map marked with a blood-colored "T".  They had devised a new plan, the first operation in their plan, a probe—using a newly developed bionic torpedo to attack a port about a hundred kilometers from Qi'an City in Yanzhou. Although they only released one bionic torpedo this time, the high-energy material it carried was enough to destroy dozens of cargo ships in the port, causing a strong impact.  Bypassing those patrol boats was expected, but the resistance against coastal defenses was the key.  "Approaching smoothly, almost there!" The person holding the controller stared unblinkingly at the dot on the screen.  As they were about to enter the Yanzhou near-shore defenses, he had to be more cautious and see if their newly modified product could successfully deceive Yanzhou's defense system.  If this attack succeeded, the follow-up actions could immediately unfold!  Everyone in the basement was concentrating on the screen.  Just as they were about to enter the Yanzhou near-shore defense range, and everyone held their breath in anticipation, the dot on the screen suddenly disappeared.  Everyone in the basement: "???"  For a moment, they all doubted their eyes.  The person holding the controller had an expression that momentarily stiffened.  Where's my torpedo?  Looking again, it indeed disappeared, vanished clean, without warning.  This sudden turn of events panicked the few people in the basement.  They had considered several possible scenarios, but not the one happening right in front of them!  It seemed as if not even a splash was made before it ended. The psychological impact was too great, and they were unable to accept it for a moment.  "What's going on?"  "The bionic torpedo has lost contact! No energy reaction detected! Reason unknown!"  "Impossible! Could it be a display malfunction?"  "No, the display is normal, the controller is normal, but there is no response from the torpedo!"  They had spent a huge price, invested so much manpower and resources, and took so long to plan to create the current product!  And it just disappeared without a trace??  "Has Yanzhou's near-shore defense become this strong?... No... I don't believe it!"  The person holding the controller trembled his lips, his face twisted and ferocious, his bloodshot eyes filled with resentment and madness. He could not accept this failure!  Another person who had been sitting in a corner with a gloomy face said, "Notify others, all actions stop immediately! First, find out how their near-shore defense system intercepted it!"  They had taken a considerable amount of time to devise a plan targeting Yanzhou, and the first link in the attack action had failed.  On the other side, Yanzhou's counter-terrorism department was also confused.  They waited and waited past two in the morning, not daring to relax, not daring to take it lightly, and continued to wait until seven in the morning.  There was no movement at all.  The "T" organization's lunatics would not easily stop their actions. Even if they knew the news was leaked, they would not stop, but instead continue their madness in a provocative manner.  However, this time until dawn, they did not receive any news of an unidentified attack.  It was calm on land and also calm at sea; there should be no detection blind spots.  Why was there no movement?  It's really strange.  Was the information wrong?  ...  The night gradually retreated, and the clouds brightened.  The rays of the rising sun scattered across the sea, dispelling the coolness of the night.  Whoosh—  A dog's head emerged from the water, and its nose puffed out air as if suddenly remembering it could breathe, moving on the water's surface and inhaling the moist air of the morning.  Curly slowly swam towards the beach, its dog legs stirring up some splashes and sand.  After landing, it shook its fur refreshingly.  "Burp~~~" Chapter 452: Not a Big Eater  Fang Zhao gave Nan Feng and the other two a break, but Nan Feng considered himself a responsible assistant and a busy person. He left a message for Fang Zhao and, after getting approval, came over early in the morning.  After Fang Zhao left Huang Yi, many people sought him out for collaboration, thinking that since his studies were over, he could start business activities.  However, Fang Zhao had no intention of participating in various business events.  Despite being rejected, most people did not give up and turned to Nan Feng instead. After all, Nan Feng had a history in the entertainment industry of Huangzhou and knew many of the workers, making it much easier to contact Nan Feng than Fang Zhao.  Thus, Nan Feng, who had given himself the title of "part-time agent," was full of energy and brought his work with him.  After summarizing the work at hand, Nan Feng reported to Fang Zhao and then looked around but did not see Juan Mao.  In their small team, aside from the boss, Juan Mao, the dog worth nearly 300 million, was what Nan Feng cared about the most.  "Where's Juan Mao?"  After moving to the new house, Juan Mao had been very excited, so why was it not seen today? Did it play too much yesterday and found a place to sleep today?  Fang Zhao looked at the time and said, "It went swimming, but it's coming back now."  Nan Feng opened his mouth, wanting to say, "Are you out of your mind to let a dog worth nearly 300 million play in the sea by itself?" but eventually, he did not dare to.  Putting aside the documents, Nan Feng said, "Boss, I'll go check on the beach," and ran out.  As soon as he stepped out, Nan Feng received a call from Yan Biao, asking how things were here and if he and Zuo Yu needed to come over.  While on the phone, Nan Feng looked toward the beach to find Juan Mao.  At that moment, Juan Mao was coming out of the sea, shaking off the water, and running back towards the house.  Under the morning sun, Nan Feng thought that even the fur of Juan Mao shone with a metallic luster when it ran.  "Deserving of being our nearly 300 million worth dog! Even sunbathing can bring out a metallic sheen!" Nan Feng exclaimed, took a photo, and shared it in their group chat, "Even the footprints on the beach are so cute!"  Yan Biao, Zuo Yu: "..."  Nan Feng continued, "I'll turn on the camera for you guys, do you see it? That sparkling figure running, our little Juan really is the brightest pup in the area!"  Yan Biao: "Also the most expensive, right?"  "The boss, he..." Nan Feng wanted to say the boss was out of his mind but remembering Fang Zhao's hearing, he changed the subject, "The boss doesn’t have time to always watch the dog, we need to pay close attention when we're here, especially when it goes swimming in the sea, it's too dangerous!"  Saying this, Nan Feng ran toward Juan Mao.  Juan Mao, stopped by Nan Feng, shook its wet fur.  Burp~~~  Pfft——  Juan Mao burped and then farted.  Nan Feng was excited, only regretting that he didn't capture that moment, "The first time I’ve seen a dog fart in person, truly befitting of a dog worth nearly 300 million. Whether it's a burp or a fart, the scent is so lingering, and if you smell carefully, there’s even a hint of gunpowder."  Yan Biao, Zuo Yu: "..."  This comrade's brain has been deeply corroded by money.  There's no saving him from blindly praising!  Nan Feng kept finding unique ways to praise, "My dog is truly different," while Juan Mao had already run past him and dashed back into the house.  Checking the time, it was 8:02 AM.  He had told Fang Zhao he would be back before eight...  He was over by two minutes.  Juan Mao had to defend himself.  "I was onshore before eight o'clock! I just wanted to shake off the water outside before entering the house! Nan Feng even stopped me!"  Juan Mao wanted to explain further but hearing Nan Feng's footsteps, it hummed twice and then shut up.  "Dry your fur by the dryer," Fang Zhao said.  By the time Juan Mao was done drying its fur, Fang Zhao had already sent Nan Feng away.  Fang Zhao checked Juan Mao's teeth and found only a bit of green residue that looked like some kind of algae but nothing else.  "How much did you eat this time?" Fang Zhao asked.  Mentioning this, Juan Mao became confident.  "I ate one fish, just one! The rest were just small snacks."  Juan Mao wanted to prove that its appetite was not big.  It had heard many times that keeping pets was expensive, especially those that ate a lot, and they were easily abandoned.  Juan Mao had to clear its name.  Its appetite was not big!  "Really only ate one fish? Not hungry?" Fang Zhao asked.  He knew Juan Mao's appetite well.  "Really! Not hungry!" Juan Mao affirmed.  "…Did you steal a whale?"  "No! I didn't eat a whale! I didn't eat any other protected marine animals either! Not even a single fish scale! The fish I ate was just a bit longer than me, it just looked like a protected animal, but it wasn’t, I checked it several times!" Juan Mao quickly explained.  This needed clarification! It didn't want to face the wall!  "What snacks did you eat?" Fang Zhao continued to inquire.  "Just two shells, I ate some seaweed on the way back, and some other things I don’t know the names of, all just licked, none tasted good."  "Mhm."  After a careful look at Juan Mao, Fang Zhao noticed that aside from being a bit overly excited, there were no other abnormalities. Unsure if Juan Mao really wasn't hungry or just saying so, he decided to pour a bowl of dog food for it.  Just as he was about to stand up, he heard Juan Mao burp again.  Fang Zhao’s steps halted.  He carefully distinguished the scents in the air, his expression turning serious.  Putting the dog bowl aside, Fang Zhao approached Juan Mao, stretching and yawning, and examined it closely.  Thinking of something, Fang Zhao asked, "The fish you ate today, what did it look like? Have you seen it in a book?"  Juan Mao: "It looked a bit like one of the protected marine animals."  Fang Zhao brought over the electronic atlas and had Juan Mao point it out.  "This kind, it just looks somewhat similar, but it's definitely not! I can tell!" Juan Mao said with some pride.  Fortunately, it had observed carefully while hunting and remembered the differences between that fish and the protected fish species in the atlas.  Under Fang Zhao's questioning, Juan Mao detailed its findings, even pointing out each fish scale, including a "T" mark on the belly of the "fish" that wasn't easy to notice, all of which Juan Mao remembered clearly.  Fang Zhao took a pen and paper and, based on Juan Mao's description, drew a picture.  From the "fish's" swimming direction, Fang Zhao compared the map and gathered information, drawing several lines.  After pondering for a while, he marked three routes, one of which pointed to a port 100 kilometers away from Qi'an City.  Looking at the drawn routes and the "T" mark on the fish's body in the picture, Fang Zhao asked Juan Mao, "What was the texture like when you ate it? How hard was it?"  Juan Mao, confused: "I don't know. Anything bigger than me, I just swallow."  Fang Zhao: "..."  Perfect logic.  From this point of view, Juan Mao fully followed an instinct similar to that of wild animals — minimizing physical exertion for the highest energy intake.  Why bother chewing in batches if it can be swallowed whole? No one saw it anyway.  Seeing Fang Zhao silent, Juan Mao, unsure if it had done something wrong, cautiously continued to defend itself, "Although I don't know what the texture was like, I feel that its composition should be more complex than dog food... Definitely more complex! Or shall I chew it up next time to taste properly? The books I read before didn't discuss the meat quality of those protected fish species, so without a reference, I don't know how it compares to other similar-looking fish. It's just that I felt a bit full after eating."  Fang Zhao's gaze shifted from the notebook and he patted Juan Mao's head, "No need, you did very well."  Juan Mao, reassured by the praise, wagged its tail happily.  "How do you feel now?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Feeling? After eating that fish, it's like you guys eating compressed biscuits, so full."  Saying this, Juan Mao emphasized, "My appetite is really not that big!"  Still not reassured, Fang Zhao conducted a simple examination on Juan Mao.  After moving to the new house, the equipment used for Juan Mao's checkups was also moved.  The examination results showed that Juan Mao had no wounds and was very healthy, but the blood test showed abnormal results, with slightly higher levels of heavy metals than usual.  Juan Mao's blood had always contained higher levels of heavy metals than other dogs, and now after swallowing something that resembled a bionic torpedo, the change was only slight.  This surprised Fang Zhao.  After careful observation, Juan Mao's fur seemed to have changed in luster slightly.  Even when Nan Feng had done fur care for Juan Mao before, such a sheen had never appeared, and its fur wasn't easily altered by ordinary chemicals.  These were changes that happened overnight.  Just to be safe, Fang Zhao attached a miniature detector to Juan Mao's leg, so that if any crisis occurred in its body, he would know immediately.  "You shouldn't go into the water these next few days," Fang Zhao said.  "Okay."  Juan Mao had played to its heart's content this time and felt so full that it was getting sleepy; it would stay home to watch TV and sleep for the next few days!  "If you run far next time and find that kind of 'fish' that can fill you up, if you really want to eat it, swallow it whole, don't bite into it. Come back immediately and tell me after you eat."  "Okay!"  Juan Mao wagged its tail happily, looking forward to the next time it got hungry.  When it was truly hungry, it felt that one meal could last at least half a month!  This could save Fang Zhao a lot of money!  It's just that after eating, it always burped. Chapter 453 "Enemy Attack, Ao!!"  After a full meal and without being scolded, the curly-haired dog felt a sneaky joy of escaping disaster and went to sleep in the doghouse with a yawn. Fang Zhao originally planned to check out the nearby area today; he even inquired about renting a speedboat from the property management the day before. With his studies concluded and his thesis completed, he intended to relax for a while, go out to sea to leisurely fish for a few days, and incidentally catch some fresh seafood for "Rabbit." However, the incident brought back by the curly-haired dog made Fang Zhao give up his original plan.  Returning to his study, Fang Zhao scanned the drawings he had made in his notebook and displayed them on several screens in front of him, along with a map of Yanzhou. He marked out an area and reviewed it together with the previous drawings. "T" represents the organization from the Tomorrow Empire that always likes to conduct attacks and seemingly wishes to bring about another apocalypse. Fang Zhao's first encounter with them was during his service on Baiji Star, and he had also encountered them once on Whale Island.  Looking at the three routes drawn on the map, Fang Zhao analyzed the purpose of the enemy. As someone who had spent nearly a hundred years in the apocalyptic era, he was still very sensitive to many things. Some influences had penetrated deep into his soul, and even switching bodies or backgrounds, living in the peaceful era of the new century for such a long time, could not erase them.  The belch with the smell of gunpowder from the curly-haired dog almost instantly triggered Fang Zhao's nerves. In the apocalyptic era, the smell of gunpowder signified war and bloodshed.  Beep—beep—Just as he was thinking, a prompt tone from his personal terminal rang out, and Fang Zhao shifted his attention from the map to check the alert. It was from the miniature detector he had tied to the curly-haired dog's leg, which would notify him if there were any anomalies.  The screen that popped up displayed the real-time monitoring results. An hour ago, the blood's heavy metal content was only slightly above the standard, but now it was rising dramatically. No, it should be said that it was changing dramatically! Several metal contents suddenly increased and then dropped rapidly, and some heavy metals that should not be present in a normal dog's body appeared.  These metal elements must have come from something the curly-haired dog ate today. People also ingest some non-essential elements from food, but the current situation was obviously different. In less than ten seconds, according to the detector, the content of one or several metal elements in the curly-haired dog's body had plummeted from the highest alert level to zero and then rose to a staggering value!  Fang Zhao knew of no creature that could exhibit such changes! For instance, according to the real-time measurements from the instrument, if the content of several heavy metals detected were present in a normal human body, the person could not possibly survive. The same would be true for dogs!  But curiously, the curly-haired dog had not lost vital signs, and Fang Zhao could still hear its regular snoring. However, the sudden changes detected by the instrument were not normal at all!  Was the detector broken? Fang Zhao quickly stepped over to the curly-haired dog's bed and looked at the dog lying on its back, snoring in its sleep. He paused for a moment and then placed his finger in front of the dog's nose to test its breathing.  The curly-haired dog always liked to snore after falling asleep; it did not belong to the short snout breed, nor was it overly fat, yet it always snored. Fang Zhao had taken it to the vet for a check-up, and nothing was found. At the moment, the sleeping snoring dog breathed with strength, not too fast, but the temperature of the exhaled gas was abnormally high, much higher than what the detector on the dog's leg measured.  As a homeotherm, the temperature of the exhaled air was more than double the usual body temperature. Was that normal? Fang Zhao patted the curly-haired dog's head.  "Curls?" The curly-haired dog continued to snore.  Fang Zhao patted it again and said, "The game console was stolen."  "Ao wu..." The curly-haired dog gave a struggling low growl, licked its nose, changed its position, and continued to sleep, going from lying on its back to lying on its side, with all four legs making running motions. After a while, the snoring continued.  Fang Zhao's face grew more and more serious. Even the keyword "the game console was stolen" couldn't wake it up? It seemed that the situation was more serious than imagined.  However, he had never encountered such a situation before, not even heard of it, and Fang Zhao did not know what to do. Should he forcibly wake up the curly-haired dog, or continue to observe? He was not sure if forcibly waking it up in this condition would have adverse effects and dared not act rashly.  While Fang Zhao was pondering what to do, the alarm from the detector became more urgent and piercing, and the monitoring chart displayed on the personal terminal showed changes that made one's heart tremble with fear. Heart rate, pulse, blood pressure, and so on were also rapidly changing.  And these were just the detectable changes; who knew how many more were beyond the range of the instrument. The screen displaying the monitoring chart flickered, and the image appeared distorted as if pulled by some force.  The light sources in the room also became unstable, flickering as if they were being interfered with. The electrical appliances in use emitted urgent alarm sounds one after another. A series of ringing sounds caused strong discomfort, but luckily Fang Zhao could bear it. If it were someone else here, they might have already lost consciousness.  Chilly wisps of air seemed to flow through the air. Fang Zhao's instincts, honed in the chaos of the apocalyptic era, made him acutely aware of the unknown danger emanating from the curly-haired dog, and he rapidly retreated several steps.  The data collection of the detector was interrupted, and the sharp alarm sound stopped abruptly. The connection between the instrument and the personal terminal was severed. The lights that were on in the room burst simultaneously. Sparks flashed from the electrical outlets.  A cold metal reflection suddenly appeared, a huge... it seemed to be a... paw? It struck down impossibly fast, almost like an illusion.  Boom! Dust and debris from the floor were thrown into the air. A sudden powerful airflow made the curtains flutter loudly. The entire three-story building shook.  Then, the metallic light disappeared. From appearance to disappearance, it was but a blink of an eye, as if it were an illusion. Fang Zhao looked at the huge paw print in front of him and the cracks in the floorboards and fell silent.  The area overshadowed by the huge paw print still had a chair in it. It was a high-priced gift from Nanfeng to Fang Zhao for his housewarming. When Nanfeng was buying the chair, he felt that solid wood appeared more classy, as pure solid wood furniture was a luxury in the new century. However, the seller also mentioned that for those with dogs at home, it might be better to choose sturdier furniture, especially the legs of tables, chairs, and stools, as they were not resistant to chewing. Therefore, Nanfeng chose the alloy one. It was sturdy enough.  But at this moment, the "sturdy enough" high-end alloy chair praised by the seller had been flattened and was deeply embedded in the floorboards.  The curly-haired dog that had been sleeping all this time seemed to suddenly wake up from a nightmare. With its innocent dog eyes, it looked around at the chaotic scene, at the large cracks in the floor through which one could see the floor below, and at the ferocious paw print on the ground. Frightened, the curly-haired dog jumped out of its bed and barked loudly, "Enemy attack! Ao!"  Seeing Fang Zhao, the curly-haired dog quickly ran over and stood beside him, growling at the huge paw print that had appeared in the room at some unknown time. With its ears pinned back, the fur on its neck bristling, deep wrinkles on its nose, and exposed sharp teeth, the dog was in a combat state, as if it were a warrior sworn to defend its territory and resist foreign invaders. Its demeanor was extremely fierce.  "Ao!!" Fang Zhao: "......" Chapter 454: Can't Fit  Fang Zhao truly intended to rest low-key for a while, however, things just wouldn't stop. There was too much noise on this side, and the security network set up by the property management in the community detected the disturbance and quickly called to inquire.  "Is there any trouble where you are, do you need us to send someone over to help?"  "No need, it's just the dog causing trouble," Fang Zhao said.  The property manager responded with a smile.  Alright, if you say it's the dog causing trouble, then it's the dog causing trouble. I'll pretend to believe you on the surface.  The property management wouldn't continue to ask as long as it didn't affect other residents or endanger anyone else's life. Even if you tore down your entire floor, it wouldn't matter.  Although the houses here were somewhat distant, Fang Zhao had just moved in, and many people were watching the movements of this Yan Zhou celebrity, so any slight disturbance would be noticed.  Thus, when Nan Feng and two others received Fang Zhao's call and rushed over, others had already come to investigate.  A middle-aged businessman walked his dog over, claiming to be visiting, but his eyes always carried scrutiny and suspicion.  Fang Zhao didn't let the man into the house, just saying it was a bit messy inside, and entertained him in the yard where there were tables and chairs.  "The dog caused trouble? Ah, I understand your feelings, some troubles are only understood by those of us who keep dogs," the man said with a knowing look.  After talking for a while, the businessman felt that he had probed enough information and wouldn't get anything more by continuing, so he left with his dog.  As soon as he turned around, he told other friends in the same community.  "There was quite a commotion at his place today, seems like a lot of things were smashed... Didn't see the dog, I suspect he was hitting the dog... No, you know some people are different inside and out, they look fine outside, but who knows what they are doing at home, hehehe... They vent themselves at home after facing pressure outside, especially those celebrities, many of them have bad tempers in private... I understand, every family has its secrets, any disturbance can be blamed on the dog since dogs can't talk."  People living in this area wouldn't casually leak information to the media, they just talked privately.  Soon, a rumor spread in certain small circles.  It was said that Fang Zhao had violent tendencies and was not honest in private.  At the same time, there were various rumors.  Some said Fang Zhao was plotted against by rivals, was troubled by romantic entanglements, was attacked by terrorists, and so on.  There were also people who coldly observed and believed they had found the truth.  Trouble in a new home so soon, who had Fang Zhao offended?  Fang Zhao knew what these people were gossiping about privately, but he didn't plan to pay attention to it, instructing Nan Feng to repair the house quietly. The original damage caused by the curly-haired dog was too obvious, so Fang Zhao had to destroy that footprint himself, resulting in a direct hole in the already cracked floorboard.  The day after moving in, this newly renovated house had to undergo major changes again.  Yan Biao and Zuo Yu both wore ashamed expressions, such destructive power must have been someone's sneak attack! This was their dereliction of duty as bodyguards!  Although Fang Zhao had given them time off, the security systems inside and outside the house were personally supervised and arranged by them, but they didn't serve any purpose at all!  It was indeed their responsibility, they were sorry for the high salary their boss gave them!  The two discussed how to upgrade the house's security system.  Nan Feng's face was pale, and his trembling hand touched the floorboard embedded with a chair pancake.  What kind of force was needed to flatten an alloy chair that was said to easily bear the weight of an elephant?!  The first floor was not so bad, but the second floor suffered more damage, it was a mess, half of the newly bought household appliances were already scrapped, two-thirds of the lights needed replacement, and the walls needed to be repainted.  Nan Feng's mind was filled with various scenarios of assassination, vendetta, and crimes of passion, deeply concerned about Fang Zhao's personal safety.  He didn't dare to ask the reason, and seeing Fang Zhao's stance, he didn't seem inclined to tell, so they could only keep all their questions to themselves.  "Boss, do we need to hire a few more people?" Nan Feng asked.  "No need."  Fang Zhao let Nan Feng handle the house repairs and called the curly-haired dog, which had been shrinking in the corner with its head down facing the wall, into the study.  They were previously on the second floor, fortunately, the house was sturdy, otherwise, that slap would have brought it down.  It was also fortunate that they had moved. If it were in the previous house, who knows what impact the downstairs residents might have experienced.  After calling the curly-haired dog in, Fang Zhao closed the door to the study to isolate the sound.  The curly-haired dog was still doubting its dog life.  After Fang Zhao told it the truth, it remained in shock, far more than the first time it found out it sang while playing games.  "Do you really not remember?" Fang Zhao asked.  "I really don't," the curly-haired dog insisted.  It refused to believe it was the kind of dog that would destroy a home!  Fang Zhao nodded and took out a recording.  Although all the surveillance in the house was destroyed, there was a recording before it happened, which sounded like a series of tinnitus-like noise.  "Listen."  The curly-haired dog's ears moved, and it gradually went from being convinced that it wasn't that kind of dog to becoming a bit doubtful.  "It sounds familiar," the curly-haired dog said weakly.  Fang Zhao raised his eyebrows, wondering if something similar had happened before.  "When was the last time you heard this sound?" Fang Zhao asked.  The curly-haired dog thought carefully, "When you were locked up."  Fang Zhao: "......"  After searching his memory, the curly-haired dog was probably referring to the time Fang Zhao was isolated.  "On Whale Island?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Yes!"  "What did you do then?"  "I swallowed a person."  "......"  "But I fainted on the spot after swallowing! I wasn't discovered by anyone!"  "......Good. Any other similar situations? Think carefully."  This time, the curly-haired dog took a long time to recall.  "It seems there was another time, but I can't remember when."  The curly-haired dog couldn't remember, but Fang Zhao found a memory.  Once, Will wanted to find inspiration for painting and took the curly-haired dog to an art exhibition, but an accident occurred, and the curly-haired dog dragged Will out of the fire.  That time, the place where the dog was kept, the dog cages were all cut with gaps, all surveillance failed, and the perpetrator has not been found to this day.  And the curly-haired dog only remembers biting through the cage, it was unclear about the surveillance cameras.  At that time, the curly-haired dog didn't have that awareness.  Even now, the curly-haired dog didn't know that every time it underwent such a change, it would destroy the surveillance equipment.  From biting through the cage and destroying surveillance to swallowing people on Whale Island, to now suddenly growing a giant paw that almost tore down the building.  In just a short year, the changes were getting bigger and bigger, Fang Zhao speculated it was transforming into some kind of form.  Something like evolution.  But how long this process would last, no one knew.  What would happen was also unpredictable.  Even more worrying was that the curly-haired dog couldn't control these changes itself.  What to do if such a thing happens again next time?  They must find another place with no people.  Fang Zhao recalled the size of the paw that cracked the floorboards, that was just one paw, if it fully transformed...  The house can't fit it!  "How are you feeling now?" Fang Zhao asked.  "I don't feel anything... Does a slightly itchy paw count?"  The curly-haired dog lifted one of its front paws.  After the floorboard was cracked, Fang Zhao had checked its suspected giant paw, only finding some minor scratches.  But now, looking at the dog's paw again, all the scratches had disappeared, and the paw looked as if it had been carefully maintained.  After talking to the curly-haired dog for a while about what to watch out for, Fang Zhao flipped through his savings, worrying.  It's tough to provide for a family, sigh.  With a helpless sigh, Fang Zhao called Nan Feng over.  Nan Feng was worried about how to repair and further reinforce the house. He thought Fang Zhao was calling him over to discuss how to repair the house discreetly and had already thought of several plans, but...  "I want to buy an island," Fang Zhao said.  Nan Feng: "???"  Buy what?  Calm down, boss!  Don't buy an island!!  In Nan Feng's view, Fang Zhao had no need to buy an island, even many laypeople knew that private islands were depreciating!  There was a period in the new century when buying islands was indeed popular, a group of businessmen jointly drove up the island prices, but later due to environmental and other reasons, some islands were prohibited from being sold, and the number of private islands available for transactions decreased, making the island prices even higher.  However, with the continuous development of outer space, those with money in their hands have shifted their targets to investing in outer space, who is still investing in buying islands here? Tiny plots of land on this planet have been hyped up to exorbitant prices, especially those remote and unpopular small islands, which might even hide viruses that could end the world! What's the point of buying them?!  With more options, some things become less coveted.  Naturally, people will choose the better option.  Indeed, there are many private islands up for sale today, but they are difficult to sell.  Buying is easy, just prepare the money, and you can trade immediately, those island owners are very happy.  Nan Feng suppressed the shock in his heart, cleared his throat, squeezed out a smile, and analyzed the current island trading situation for Fang Zhao.  "People say buy on the rise, not on the fall, and the island prices on this planet have been falling, it's hard to sell once you have it in hand... Some people who followed the trend of buying islands, bought them and left them vacant, not knowing how many poisonous insects and plants are on the island, it's very dangerous, the island prices were originally high, and the upfront investment costs are also high..."  Nan Feng rambled on analyzing for Fang Zhao, telling him that this investment wasn't worthwhile.  After listening to Nan Feng's analysis, Fang Zhao said, "The curly-haired dog needs more space to move around."  Nan Feng looked at Fang Zhao with a numb expression, unable to see even a hint of joking in Fang Zhao's eyes.  Seeing that Fang Zhao had made up his mind, Nan Feng could only comply.  "Okay, I'll make a list and budget."  Nan Feng thought to himself: I don't know what exactly the boss has encountered, has it become so serious that he needs to hide from the world?  Nan Feng decided to go back and buy another insurance policy for himself.  He really wanted to ask Fang Zhao: Do you regret donating so much money? If you hadn't donated, as long as it's tradable, not to mention one small island, buying a whole group wouldn't be a problem!  While muttering in his heart, Nan Feng searched the internet for private islands on sale, filtering for small islands that could have buildings and helipads.  He estimated that after buying a small island, Fang Zhao's savings would be depleted.  If it were for any other reason, Nan Feng could understand, but if it was really for keeping a dog, that would be too...  That day, Nan Feng learned a life lesson from his boss—keeping pets can make one poor. Chapter 455: Not Knowing How Strange One Looks Without a Mirror  The islands on this planet were easy to buy, with plenty of choices. Nan Feng selected a few and showed them to Fang Zhao. Fang Zhao chose one of them.  A buyer came to inquire about the price, and the island owner was ecstatic. Having seen more and more people investing in planets outside of Earth in the past two years, he too was anxious and wanted to sell the island quickly, even compromising on the price during negotiations.  The transaction was swift. They inquired about the price one day, and the deal was settled the next.  Seeing Fang Zhao handle the procedures so quickly, Nan Feng felt helpless: Fang Zhao didn't know how to invest, he needed a wise investment advisor.  Even though he didn't know what exactly had happened in the house that day, it surely wasn't so urgent to buy an island, right?  Alas, the boss should just stick to his music and art. Investing loses too much money.  Not just Nan Feng, but the former island owner also thought Fang Zhao was foolish. Seeing the trend of falling prices for islands on this planet, yet coming to buy, isn't that foolish?  Indeed, still too young and impulsive.  The new island Fang Zhao bought was not too big but sufficient for Juan Mao to move around. It was located a bit remotely, at some distance from all the continents, and didn't have any distinctive shape or fame. The original owner hadn't lived there for nearly twenty years, only sending people over to do simple cleaning twice a year, making it a very pristine island.  The disaster at the end of the world was global, and there was no utopia untouched by it. This small island too had suffered from the catastrophe of the end times, but over five hundred years, it had recovered to its current thriving vitality.  The existing house on the island was built more than fifty years ago and had been upgraded twice due to frequent storms. Fang Zhao didn't make significant changes; as long as it was sturdy and livable, it was fine.  After the security system was set up, Fang Zhao sent Nan Feng and the other two back to stand by.  The island was not big and had limited food, which was mostly transported from outside. Fang Zhao stocked up on some supplies, and later on, whenever there was a shortage of goods, he would have Yan Biao and Zuo Yu bring them over.  After receiving the subsequent royalty payments, Fang Zhao bought two more aerospace flight vehicles, the kind that can only fly within the atmosphere.  The somewhat filled wallet was depleted once again.  Nan Feng and the others felt the pinch on his behalf. They all had the impression of "Has my boss gone mad?"  Of the two new aerospace flight vehicles, one was kept on the island, and the other was used for transporting goods to Nan Feng and the other two.  "Boss, you... are going to stay here alone?" Zuo Yu asked again worriedly.  "Uh-huh," Fang Zhao seemed a lot calmer.  "Don't you need more people?" Yan Biao also asked.  "No need."  "Well... if you have anything, contact us immediately, we are on standby at all times."  Nan Feng boarded the aircraft, looking back every three steps.  Watching Nan Feng and the others leave on the aircraft, Fang Zhao returned to the house and called Juan Mao, who had been hiding in the doghouse.  By now, Juan Mao had completed its psychological transition from "I can't possibly be such a dog" to "Should I go out and make money?"  It had thought that the "fish" it had swallowed would last half a month, but in less than a week, Juan Mao was starting to feel hungry again.  Fang Zhao brought out a big bag of dog food—50 kg in a large bag.  "You eat, I'll watch you," Fang Zhao said.  "Can I swallow it directly?"  "Yes."  Juan Mao licked its nose and quickly approached the bag of dog food.  Then, Fang Zhao saw something that looked like a big... mouth suddenly appear.  A flash of silvery metallic luster.  The 50 kg bag of dog food was gone.  "Full?" Fang Zhao asked.  Juan Mao hesitated for a moment, then nodded, "Still... a little hungry."  That meant it wasn't full at all.  Fang Zhao brought out another 50 kg bag of dog food, "Can you slow down this time? Slow down the swallowing?"  Juan Mao nodded decisively this time, "Slow swallow!"  This time, Fang Zhao saw even more clearly. The dog's head changed, but the rest of its body remained in its regular dog form. The slightly long curly fur seemed to shrink back into Juan Mao's body at that moment. The shape of the changing part of the head was blurry, as if composed of some metal, and it was not clear what it looked like. All that could be seen was a big mouth with sharp teeth that swallowed the 50 kg bag of dog food effortlessly.  Not to mention 50 kg, even 100 kg would probably not cause any hesitation.  Fang Zhao watched this scene thoughtfully.  Perhaps, this dog could no longer be simply classified as a carbon-based life form.  It might have another form.  Normally it's a dog, but what does it become after transforming? A metal dog? An unknown metallic life form?  The camera that had been placed in the room, unsurprisingly, malfunctioned. Only part of the footage was recorded, and from the moment the change began, it was already being interfered with.  Looking at the other monitors placed around the room, those that were close also suffered severe malfunctions, and the footage captured at that moment also showed tearing and distortion.  All electronic devices were affected.  Fortunately, Fang Zhao had prepared many backups when moving in.  As for these changes, Juan Mao was unaware, and since electronic devices couldn't be used, Fang Zhao went looking in the warehouse and moved out a fitting mirror left by the original owner.  Juan Mao swallowed dog food in front of the mirror again, but this time it almost choked. It was stunned.  It was almost scared to pee by its own reflection in the mirror.  Indeed, without a mirror, one wouldn't know how strange they look!  The shock was greater than when it realized it had demolished the house in a dream!  However, no matter how great the shock, it was replaced by the feeling of hunger.  After transforming a few times, Juan Mao felt exhausted, as if the three large bags of dog food had been fully consumed.  Hungry.  So hungry!  With no other choice, Juan Mao went to the sea to hunt for food again.  This time, with no other residents around, Juan Mao didn't have to wait until night. After getting permission from Fang Zhao, it rushed into the sea to hunt.  It was like flipping a switch; in the following period, Juan Mao's transformations became more frequent, sometimes enlarging its paws while digging holes, creating pits.  Fang Zhao didn't dare let it sleep inside the house. What if it dreamed of chasing thieves and destroyed the house in excitement?  Along with these frequent transformations was a massive demand for energy.  Food!  Fang Zhao really couldn't solve this, so he let Juan Mao hunt for food in the sea.  Fang Zhao emphasized some important issues and things to pay attention to every time. After making its daily rounds in the sea, Juan Mao swallowed two bionic torpedoes near the coast of Yan Continent in one week.  But now, one torpedo didn't last half a month, and if the transformations were too frequent, it would have to go out again after two or three days.  Juan Mao was quite happy, able to eat its fill and save money.  However, after swallowing the third bionic torpedo, it couldn't find any more. Juan Mao made several trips near the Yan Continent coast but never encountered them again.  Fang Zhao knew that the people from the T organization might have given up on using bionic torpedoes. He wondered what they would do next.  The anti-terrorism efforts in Yan Continent were good. Even without Juan Mao swallowing torpedoes, the likelihood of intercepting the bionic torpedoes was high.  With no more torpedoes, Juan Mao had to shift its target. This time, it planned to swim farther out.  Fang Zhao neither agreed nor disagreed, handing Juan Mao a set of comprehensive exam papers with questions he had personally devised. The questions were about responses to various critical situations and some issues he had emphasized repeatedly.  Juan Mao quickly completed the set, scoring 93 out of 100. After deducting seven points, Fang Zhao gave Juan Mao a supplementary lesson before agreeing to let it go out.  This time, Juan Mao was out for slightly longer, taking 12 hours to return. It seemed energetic upon returning, apparently having eaten and drunk its fill.  "What did you eat?" Fang Zhao asked.  "I ate a big box!" Juan Mao simply recounted its experience, which could be summarized as: After leaving the island, it swam and swam, seeming to find something delicious, so it ate it.  Fang Zhao asked some detailed questions and learned that the place where Juan Mao found "food" was a submarine sunk deep in the sea, and the "food" Juan Mao mentioned should be some sort of high-energy material inside the submarine. There were eight large boxes, and Juan Mao ate two at once.  Because the distance was a bit far, Juan Mao could not control its transformations and couldn't bring the boxes up for Fang Zhao to see. After swallowing the first box, it felt full and intended to bring one back to show Fang Zhao. However, while carrying the box, it swallowed it.  Juan Mao didn't want to swallow a third box, but with Fang Zhao's admonitions, it dared not forcefully break open the boxes and could only return to the island first.  "I'm so stuffed," Juan Mao said, rarely experiencing the feeling of being too full.  Without a submarine, Fang Zhao could not check and could only guess based on Juan Mao's description. With insufficient information and not knowing how old the sunken submarine was, and Juan Mao not recognizing it, Fang Zhao couldn't draw it. They could only wait for Juan Mao to go hunting again for clues.  After eating its fill, Juan Mao's effects were significant. From initially being unable to control the sudden transformations to vaguely sensing the feeling of change, it could avoid unnecessary destruction before each change, and no sudden pits appeared on the island anymore.  However, the transformations became even more frequent and intense.  To prevent being detected by patrolling aircraft or satellites in outer space due to abnormal energy fluctuations, Fang Zhao instructed Juan Mao to run to the sea whenever it felt a transformation coming. Land or sea had no effect on Juan Mao.  Over the next month, Juan Mao went out several times, swallowing the remaining boxes inside the sunken submarine in batches.  Fang Zhao, based on the information Juan Mao brought back and combined with the clues he found, could almost confirm that it was a submarine belonging to the T organization that was sunk by the Yan Continent navy a hundred years ago. Rumors said that there were at least eight tons of Grade-A energy ore on that sunken submarine...  Many had attempted to salvage it, not for the submarine, but for the eight tons of Grade-A energy ore inside. However, all attempts were fruitless. The area was prone to being swallowed by undercurrents, attacked by deep-sea creatures, and was rumored to be a magnetic anomaly zone where communication was easily interrupted, and diving equipment was prone to malfunctioning. For an uncertain rumor, it was not worth it.  Gradually, people forgot about that sunken submarine and the legendary eight tons of Grade-A energy ore.  Looking at the reasons for the sudden deployment of the Yan Continent navy back then, Fang Zhao was silent. His feelings were complicated. Chapter 456: Poor Signal on the Small Broken Island  Curl didn't have many thoughts in its mind. After devouring all eight boxes, it persevered and scoured the area a few more times but found no more of those boxes. Fang Zhao cautioned against randomly devouring marine life from the area, suggesting to scare them off instead of eating them. With no other choice, Curl gnawed on more submarine wreckage, especially the energy cabin.  Above the sunken submarine, three fully equipped submersibles cautiously approached the demonized trench zone. Nearing the infamous abyssal danger zone, they indeed experienced several communication disruptions. Fortunately, they did not encounter any strong undersea currents during their descent.  The extreme environment of the ocean floor imposed some limitations on the submersibles, creating an uncomfortable sense of oppression and fear towards this unknown realm. Humanity had ventured into space and to other planets, yet they still hadn't completely conquered the ocean. Many parts of the deep sea remained off-limits.  "Approaching smoothly... Yes, if the map we obtained is correct, we should soon reach our target point."  "No dangers detected, seems like we're lucky today."  They hadn't expected to succeed in one go; this was a probing action. Who would come here, risking danger, if not compelled by necessity?  It was strange that all three biomimetic torpedoes they fired off seemed to disappear from the world without a trace. Three failed fish attacks made them even more wary of the defenses near the Yan Continent. Truly, a hauntingly powerful interception!  Not even a sound was heard!  As a result, the "T" organization's other branches immediately halted their biomimetic torpedo attack plans to investigate this interception technology.  They had reasons to suspect whether the biomimetic technology stolen from the military had bugs or if the military intentionally planted them and let them be stolen!  In the process of stealing biomimetic technology, they had lost many men and exposed several bases. Now it seemed this was all part of a chain of plots targeting them! How cunning indeed!  They had to change their original plans as the organization's higher-ups were dissatisfied with the Yan Continent branch. If they didn't achieve something noteworthy, they wouldn't last in the organization, and the consequences would be dire.  Either they had to stage an attack or do something else to gain merit.  After losing three valuable biomimetic torpedoes, their funding was temporarily cut, all biomimetic torpedoes were reclaimed, and the original plans were halted. It seemed they were being left to hang dry.  The head of the T organization's Yan Continent branch was recently so worried he was nearly going bald. He had thought about bombing some crowded place with lax security, like certain shopping centers in Yan Continent.  But he also feared disrupting the organization's other plans. Lately, the organization seemed to be moving again, but their branch wasn't privy to the information. The actions of the different branches were separate, and it was impossible to get precise information.  Moreover, the Yan Continent military was watching them closely, and they probably wouldn't even get close to a shopping center before being intercepted.  With no other choice, they had to look for other ways to achieve merit, such as through supplies.  After much thought, he set his sights on the submarine that had sunk over a hundred years ago. One of his seniors had been on that doomed submarine, responsible for transporting energy ore. Unfortunately, they encountered the Yan Continent navy and failed to escape, eventually sinking the sub with everyone on board.  Eight tons of Grade A energy ore had sunk to the bottom of the sea. Eight tons! The result of so much effort to obtain eight tons of Grade A energy ore, all sunk to the bottom!  The incident had dealt a significant blow to the organization, leaving it demoralized for a long while and much more low-key, entering a period of recuperation.  Since then, the organization never transported more than two tons of ore at a time. Grade A energy ore was especially transported in dispersed quantities to avoid a repeat disaster.  Those responsible for the transport had been unlucky. Their well-planned energy ore transportation had not anticipated a sudden Yan Continent navy drill. Reportedly, it was due to a commemoration of the death of some significant figure from the Era of Annihilation, and a drill was held on a whim.  They hadn't received any prior information; it was too sudden. When they heard the news, they were baffled.  Damn the Yan Continent navy!  What was the name of that big shot from the Era of Annihilation? Something with the surname Fang?  Who cares? Dead is dead.  It was said that the organization had planned many times to bomb the martyrs' cemetery but were thwarted by the tenacious tomb guardians, never succeeding even once.  The T organization held grudges. Since the "eight-ton" setback a century ago, every head of the T organization's Yan Continent branch received orders: if there was a chance, they were to bomb the graves in the Yan Continent martyrs' cemetery, especially that Fang surname's grave.  Inside a concealed underground room, the head of the T organization's Yan Continent branch commanded the salvage operation with a somber look.  If he wasn't truly desperate, he wouldn't have set his sights on a submarine that had sunk into the trench a hundred years ago.  Although more energy ore discoveries had led to a slight price drop for Grade A energy ore, it was still worth around 14 billion by today's standards.  Luckily, with improved communication technology, the salvage operation had been going relatively smoothly despite a few interruptions.  As they neared their target without encountering undersea currents or deep-sea creature attacks, it seemed that fortune was with them!  "Stay alert for deep-sea monster attacks."  "Understood! But boss, are there really legendary monsters here?" asked someone from inside one of the submersibles.  "I don't know."  "The area we're approaching is very quiet. Maybe at this depth, there aren't any fish, let alone deep-sea monsters. Just dead water. Documentaries only filmed shadows, and it's uncertain whether they're the legendary abyssal creatures. There are also rumors that the production teams fake these things."  They said this, but deep down, they still believed in the existence of deep-sea monsters.  The people inside the three submersibles tasked with the salvage operation heightened their vigilance.  "We found it! There really is a sunken submarine here!"  The submarine that had sunk here a century ago was barely recognizable now.  "Search for the ore first!" came the anxious voice from the communicator.  "Right away, boss!" The people inside the three submersibles were also excited.  Eight tons of Grade A ore, worth more than 14 billion! If they completed this task, they'd be set for life!  Three submersibles: one carried out the mission while the other two provided protection.  However...  "Boss, we can't detect the ore."  "The boxes that contain the ore are made of special materials, hard to detect. Get closer and search for those boxes. The eight tons of ore must be in more than eight boxes."  After a while, the mission-carrying submersible reported back.  "Boss, the submarine is severely damaged, leaving only wreckage. The severed edges are uneven... as if gnawed by a dog."  "That's not funny," the voice from the communicator was ice-cold, clearly not in a good mood.  "Boss, I took a closer look, and it really looks like bite marks. There really is an abyssal monster!!!" The person inside the submersible grew fearful. If it could gnaw a submarine like this, wouldn't it easily do the same to them?  Honestly, they would rather bomb the Yan Continent cemetery than become fish food here.  "Find the boxes!" the voice from the communicator barked.  "Yes!"  Ultimately, the "eight tons of Grade A ore" overcame their fear of the "deep-sea monster."  However...  "Boss, no boxes found! This place is empty, and a large chunk of the submarine is missing! The energy cabin has vanished as well! Judging by the break... it looks freshly gnawed."  "..."  Heavy breathing came through the communicator, likely from someone very angry. It seemed like nothing had been going right for a while.  "Keep searching! Look around! See if there's any... *static*... fallen... *static*"  "Boss, what are you saying? Can't hear you clearly!"  The connection was lost.  But they didn't panic. They had encountered a few communication breakdowns during the deep-sea operation before, and it usually recovered after a short while.  However, as they waited, the communication did not resume, and the submersibles' control systems began to malfunction, worsening progressively.  Now the people inside the three submersibles panicked.  "Retreat, retreat, retreat! Quick, get back to shallower waters first!!"  The submersibles increasingly showed signs of losing control, becoming less responsive.  They had managed to ascend slightly when the control panels of the submersibles suddenly went dead, as if there was a power failure. A ringing noise filled their ears, and their consciousness began to blur.  ---  On the other side, Fang Zhao was talking to Nan Feng.  Nan Feng reported recent events to Fang Zhao. He had received many invitations—variety shows, news interviews, collaboration offers—and which to accept or decline depended on Fang Zhao's decision.  Since Fang Zhao moved to the island, Nan Feng's responsibilities had increased, but he wasn't complaining; in fact, he was pleased.  Fang Zhao gave him another raise, which of course wasn't the most important thing. The most important thing was that Nan Feng could meet more people, which would benefit his career path.  "I'll turn down the variety shows, accept an interview with Yan Continent TV, and about the collaborations... *static*..."  Nan Feng hadn't finished speaking when he heard static, and soon after, the communication was completely cut off.  Nan Feng said to Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, "I told you, places like that remote little broken island just have poor signal, always unstable."  Having lost contact with Fang Zhao's side, Nan Feng and the others were also concerned. They had planned to go check it out but received a warning from the Yan Continent Coastal Monitoring Station. They reported a minor earthquake near a trench and severe magnetic anomalies, advising people at sea to avoid the area if possible and to wait until everything returned to normal before going out to sea.  With no other options, Nan Feng and the others could only sit and wait. The minor earthquake wasn't much of an issue, but magnetic anomalies were troublesome. Who knew if the severity would increase? What if they lost all control mid-flight?  "Ah, the city is so nice, why did the boss have to move to a little broken island?"  At this time, on the island.  After the communication was cut off, Fang Zhao noticed flickering screens that he recognized. Stepping out of the house, Fang Zhao looked towards the sea.  Something was changing, happening right now. Chapter 457: Even Dogs Should Have Goals  The interference lasted for nearly two hours before it disappeared. Fang Zhao received a call from Nan Feng and the others, who reported that they were safe, but he didn't ask them to come over just yet. After the call, Fang Zhao didn't immediately go back inside. Instead, he sat on a stone by the shore and checked the online reports about the recent abnormal magnetic forces at sea.  There were no casualties. Since the area with the strongest magnetic anomalies had little human activity and the earthquake was weak, the public mostly glanced at the news and didn't pay it much attention afterward.  After browsing the news for a while, Fang Zhao heard something in the water approaching at high speed.  He didn't dodge but stood up to look.  Splash—  A dog emerged from the sea, landing on the shore with such speed that, possibly due to excitement, it didn't stabilize and rolled for quite a distance before stopping.  After shaking off the water and sand from its body, the curly-haired dog ran towards Fang Zhao, looking quite excited, its tail wagging exuberantly.  Fang Zhao didn't find any injuries on the curly-haired dog and patted its head, "Are you full?"  "Full, woof!" The "woof" was strong and carried a hint of pride.  "What happened? You caused quite a commotion this time."  Fang Zhao showed the curly-haired dog some news about the incident.  Looking at the news, the curly-haired dog became a bit guilty, but realizing it hadn't caused any serious problems, it relaxed.  "Can you transform now?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Yes!" The curly-haired dog was confident again.  Fang Zhao didn't let it transform there and then. Although there were no other people on the island, due to the recent magnetic anomaly incident, satellites were probably monitoring more closely, so one had to be careful.  "Go to the sea."  Fang Zhao changed into a diving suit and, with his equipment, swam out far.  One reason was to avoid satellite detection. The other was to prevent the island's electronic equipment from being affected, as the stock was already insufficient.  After reaching a certain distance from the island, he dived underwater before allowing the curly-haired dog to transform.  Sunlight penetrated the surface of the water, lighting up the sea, and one could see some floating particles in the water.  Various fish leisurely waved their fins.  Suddenly, a ripple spread, and the fish scattered in panic.  Below the surface, a massive creature appeared, with a metallic sharpness and coldness.  The sunlight passing through the water reflected a faint blue light off of it.  Light and shadow shifted with the flow of the water, adding a touch of mystery.  It had ears, limbs, a tail, and sharp teeth, and one could just make out a dog-like shape.  Fang Zhao's legs were not as long as its.  Judging by the size of the dog's mouth, it could easily swallow a person.  Fang Zhao watched this unfamiliar form in front of him with amazement. He couldn't imagine how the curly-haired dog, which looked similar to a small pet dog, could transform from a carbon-based life form into a new type of creature that seemed to be made entirely of metal. During the transformation, he even heard a high-pitched sound similar to a machine over-speeding.  After waiting for it to stabilize in its new form, Fang Zhao opened the underwater communicator.  "Very impressive. Can't you make yourself smaller?"  "Can't... I think?" The curly-haired dog tilted its large head and thought, "Not now, maybe later. I can control the transformation now! I just can't maintain it for very long." It emphasized, "As long as I don't transform into this form, I won't need to eat much!"  In the curly-haired dog's view, as long as it didn't transform into this large form, it wouldn't get hungry so easily, and it could save on dog food!  The curly-haired dog quickly reverted to its small dog form, paddling happily around Fang Zhao.  It believed it had finally solved a big problem and no longer needed to worry!  Fang Zhao had many questions to ask the curly-haired dog, but this wasn't the right place for a detailed discussion.  Back on shore and in the house, the curly-haired dog told Fang Zhao about the cause and process of the incident.  "There were no boxes to eat, and after gnawing on the submarine, I followed that trench and smelled food in a deeper area, which I dug out and ate."  "Food? What did it look like?" asked Fang Zhao.  "It was a white, round stone, about the size of a soccer ball."  The curly-haired dog couldn't say much more; it hadn't paid much attention at the time and was too hungry, so it just ate it after digging it out.  Fang Zhao guessed that what the curly-haired dog described might be a new type of energy mineral, possibly containing higher energy than Class A energy minerals.  The stone from the trench could either be native to the planet or a meteorite that fell from space. During the Era of Dusk, many meteorites fell, some containing energy minerals.  Fang Zhao was inclined to believe it came from outside the planet.  However, since the curly-haired dog had already eaten the stone, it was indeed difficult to confirm its origin.  As long as it was determined that the stone was beneficial to the curly-haired dog, that was enough.  "Did you find any more of those stones in the trench?" asked Fang Zhao.  "No more! Just the one."  The curly-haired dog felt regretful; if there were more such stones, it wouldn't need to spend money on dog food, and it could switch between two forms every day. It's a pity that such satisfying food was scarce.  Fang Zhao didn't dwell on it but asked about the causes of the magnetic anomaly and earthquake.  The curly-haired dog cautiously glanced at Fang Zhao, drooped its head, and defended itself, "I ate too much and couldn't hold it in."  After gnawing on the energy cabin of the submarine and swallowing a stone that might be a high-grade energy mineral, the curly-haired dog realized it was about to transform again and found a place to hide and wait for the period to pass.  "I didn't expect to complete the transformation this time. I checked that there were no people around, and there weren't many fish in the trench... I even tried to control it; I didn't want to cause a commotion."  Suddenly, the curly-haired dog's eyes brightened, and it wagged its tail at Fang Zhao, looking for praise, "After the transformation period, I found three submersibles not far away, all with people inside who were still alive, so I sent them to the nearest naval vessel! I pushed the submersibles secretly, without being discovered!"  At that moment, Fang Zhao noticed a new news update from the account he was following.  Fang Zhao clicked to read it.  The news reported that the Yanzhou naval patrol fleet had found three submersibles and confirmed the identities of everyone inside, all members of the T organization. The location data on the submersibles matched the epicenter of the earthquake and magnetic anomaly.  The public also suspected that the T organization was behind the unusual maritime event, and one could imagine how they were being criticized now.  Fang Zhao looked at the curly-haired dog squatting there, oblivious, tilting its head and scratching itself with its hind leg, and after a while, he said, "You handled this situation very well!"  The curly-haired dog immediately perked up, rubbing against Fang Zhao and looking at him with hopeful eyes, seeking praise.  "Then can I... can I have a gaming console?"  "Yes."  In fact, Fang Zhao had prepared some things in advance.  Fang Zhao took out two boxes from the warehouse.  The first box contained a gaming helmet.  The curly-haired dog's eyes went wide at the sight of the brand-new gaming helmet. A real gaming helmet! Not a deceitful study machine, woof!  Fang Zhao opened the second, smaller box.  Inside was a personal terminal in the style of a pocket watch, decorated with a small dog pattern.  The curly-haired dog's attention shifted from the gaming console to the new personal terminal. This was the terminal it had longed for!!!  The curly-haired dog licked its nose and approached Fang Zhao, wagging its tail in a flattering manner.  "Which one do you want? You can only choose one," said Fang Zhao.  The curly-haired dog struggled to choose between the gaming helmet and the personal terminal, whimpering softly in indecision.  "Actually, there's another problem," Fang Zhao spoke up.  The curly-haired dog looked at Fang Zhao with big, innocent, and pitiful eyes.  "Whichever you choose, you won't be able to use it for long," said Fang Zhao.  "That's impossible!" The curly-haired dog was very protective of its belongings. Even if it didn't want to use the study machine, it would place it on the collection shelf and ask Fang Zhao to keep it safe.  Fang Zhao presented evidence, starting from the time the curly-haired dog tore up the floorboards to the recent magnetic anomaly incident's collected data.  "Every time you transform, you interfere with electronic devices, and in serious cases, it leads directly to their failure."  Facing the evidence, the curly-haired dog fell silent and became dejected.  "However," Fang Zhao continued, "I've seen great progress in you. From initially not being able to control your body's changes to now being able to independently complete a full-body transformation, I believe you'll soon be able to do so without affecting electronic devices."  Hearing Fang Zhao's words, the curly-haired dog regained confidence.  Fang Zhao gave it time to make a choice, provided it could control its impact on electronic devices.  The curly-haired dog quickly entered a new training period.  Even dogs should have goals. Goals give motivation and direction.  Otherwise, all it would think about was what to eat today, tomorrow, and in the future, sleeping after eating, and thinking about playing games upon waking.  Fang Zhao rearranged the warehouse to accommodate the curly-haired dog's transformed size.  Even if the curly-haired dog accidentally grew too large, it wouldn't burst the house.  Every day, the curly-haired dog practiced swallowing dog food cans, fruits, and bones, trying to control and reduce interference each time.  Now that its control over bodily changes had improved, with only head transformations releasing less interference than before, nearby electronic devices wouldn't be directly destroyed.  The trial mirror was put back in the warehouse by Fang Zhao.  Occasionally, the curly-haired dog would look at itself in the mirror to see its new form.  Only by looking in the mirror could it know what kind of dog it looked like.  After settling things with the curly-haired dog, Fang Zhao contacted Nan Feng and the others to replenish supplies.  Even though there were plenty of fish in the sea and possibly energy minerals on the seabed, it was still necessary to stock up on supplies.  Receiving Fang Zhao's order, Nan Feng and the others were full of questions. The amount of supplies Fang Zhao wanted to restock was too much. Dog food cans were one thing, as they were for the curly-haired dog to eat.  But there were so many fruits, meats, and compressed biscuits. With only Fang Zhao on the island, could he finish them all?  Looking at the shopping list, Nan Feng said to Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, "I suspect the boss secretly keeps a shark... Or some other fish? Oh, seeing the amount of cargo this time, maybe he's keeping more than one." Chapter 458: A Good Dog Brings Its Owner Bone Sticks  The boss has secrets, but Nanfeng and the other two dare not dig too deep, as they don't want to lose their jobs.  When Nanfeng and the others delivered supplies, Juanmao was no longer training in the warehouse, but was lying on the sofa watching TV. After inventorying the goods, Nanfeng looked back and said with a smile, "Yo, little Juanmao is watching TV again?"  After finishing his work, Nanfeng stretched his muscles and ran over to sit on the sofa to watch TV with Juanmao. The TV was showing a program about dogs, with a dog owner proudly showing off his dog. "Having a dog and land, you can tell they're from Muzhou," Nanfeng commented on the program content while drinking water.  "Hey, look at that shepherd dog in there, it even brings gifts to its owner! Look how happy the dog owner is! Little Juanmao, let me tell you, a good dog is one that can bring its owner bone sticks. When will you bring one for your owner? Your owner will definitely be very happy!"  Nanfeng was just saying this casually. He knew that Juanmao's intelligence was almost like that of a child, able to understand some simple words and commands, so he was just teasing Juanmao and didn't take it seriously after saying it.  However, Juanmao's ears moved, it looked at Nanfeng and then at the TV program, lying on the sofa as if pondering something.  "Boss, the goods are all loaded, and the electronic list has been sent to you, please check," Zuoyu said to Fang Zhao.  "Hard work," Fang Zhao replied.  "Do you want a domestic robot next time? It can sweep, cook, and even chat with you," Yan Biao suggested.  "Not for now," Fang Zhao shook his head. Before Juanmao could fully control its interference ability, it's better not to have too many electronic devices.  A while later, Nanfeng and the others left. Juanmao on the sofa immediately jumped up and shouted to Fang Zhao, "I'm going out for a bit!"  "Going far?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Not far, just swimming around the island."  Juanmao looked left and right but did not look directly at Fang Zhao. Fang Zhao's eyebrows twitched, knowing the dog had some small idea, but still said, "Go ahead."  "Woof! I'll be back soon!" After saying that, Juanmao ran off.  Fang Zhao wanted to see what the dog was up to, but he received an incoming call. It was from Molang.  After graduating from the Imperial Art Advanced Class, Fang Zhao had been in frequent contact with Molang. Fang Zhao went back to the room to take the call, as the wind outside was strong and there was too much noise.  Molang first asked if Fang Zhao had encountered any trouble and if the previous magnetic anomaly incident had affected him, advising Fang Zhao to hire more people. The Yan Zhou Navy had just caught some terrorists at sea, and Molang was worried about Fang Zhao's safety.  Of course, the reason Molang called was not only to express concern for Fang Zhao's safety after seeing the news but also to tell Fang Zhao an important piece of information.  "There's a very important performance, and all the invitees are very prestigious musicians. The organizers also have their eyes on you. Do you want to go?"  Hearing Molang's words, Fang Zhao remembered that one of the judges had mentioned a very important performance during the graduation concert, which was likely to be confidential.  "Who are the organizers?" Fang Zhao asked.  "The military. The venue is a bit far."  "Going."  Molang smiled, pleased with Fang Zhao's reply.  "This kind of performance will be beneficial for you in the future. Someone will contact you within a week. If you have any questions, you can ask them directly. You have nearly a month to arrange things on your planet."  "Alright."  One month should be enough. According to Molang, the performance venue was on another planet, and Fang Zhao couldn't know which one yet. However, if he were to participate in the performance, it wouldn't just be for three or five days. Fang Zhao felt uneasy if he didn't personally keep an eye on Juanmao, but there were risks in taking him to the performance. He could only wait and see Juanmao's performance over the next period.  If Juanmao could control not to interfere with electronic devices, Fang Zhao would take Juanmao to the performance. Of course, that was provided the organizers allowed dogs.  Even if he couldn't bring a dog, as long as Juanmao could skillfully control its abilities, it wouldn't be easily exposed. With the stimulation of the gaming helmet and personal terminal, Juanmao had made significant progress over the past few days, reducing the interference range to within the warehouse. Outside the warehouse, electronic devices were rarely or almost unaffected by interference.  After talking with Molang for a while, the call ended, and Fang Zhao checked the time. He had been talking with Molang for over half an hour.  Juanmao had not yet returned.  "Juanmao?" Fang Zhao walked out of the house and called a few times.  No response.  Listening carefully again, he heard sounds from beneath the sea near the island, like digging.  Fang Zhao didn't call out again but opened an electronic book and sat by the shore to read.  He was reading a legendary work revered by the people of Muzhou— "Su Mu Talks About Dogs." Written by an old war buddy he knew from the Era of Destruction.  As the leading figure in the battlefields of Muzhou, Su Mu's influence was significant, and his opinions and stories were collected and compiled into books by the people of Muzhou. "Su Mu Talks About Dogs" is about how Su Mu raised dogs. Of course, only part of it contained words actually spoken by Su Mu; the rest were analyses and expansions by later generations.  The people of Muzhou loved dogs partly because of the influence of their ancestors. However, true to his reputation as the first person recognized in the Era of Destruction for raising dogs, the content in the book made sense.  Fang Zhao thought he still had to learn more from this old war buddy with rich dog-raising experience.  Even if Juanmao turned into a mechanical dog, it was still a dog at its core.  As he was reading, Fang Zhao heard Juanmao coming ashore. Juanmao walked out of the sea without even bothering to shake off the water on its body, carrying a bone much larger than its head, trotting all the way.  Fang Zhao's eyelids twitched when he saw the bone. Probably for fear of breaking that bone, Juanmao was very careful, holding it in an almost sea lion ball-balancing pose, moving slowly with the bone that was five or six times its size.  Only when it reached Fang Zhao did Juanmao put down the bone. The bone had tooth marks and was cracked.  As a dog that could easily chew up a submarine, maintaining this was already the result of Juanmao's controlled effort.  After putting down the bone, Juanmao seemed much more relaxed, shook its fur, and shook off the seawater.  "This bone is too soft! It breaks on touch! The ones grown in rocks aren't even as hard as the rocks! I saw bones in the rocks when I was digging for fun underwater last time, but they don't taste good, not filling at all. But they're big! Especially big!" Juanmao wagged its tail, looking at Fang Zhao with a look that sought praise.  The bone it brought back was much larger than those the dogs from Muzhou brought back on TV.  "Amazing!" Fang Zhao said, patting its head before picking up the bone in front of him.  The bone wasn't whole; Juanmao had snapped it, and the break revealed some granular crystals. Part of the bone was still attached to a rock, as Juanmao wouldn't do such meticulous work while digging bones.  There were some lines on the bone, similar to blood vessels.  A fossil! A fossilized bone of some giant creature that lived tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of years ago!  The disasters and wars of the Era of Destruction destroyed too much. Survival was the priority, and everything else was secondary. Anything could become a sacrifice in that century-long battle for survival.  After the end of the Era of Destruction, people of the new era gradually became interested again and obsessed with those prehistoric giants. They tried to excavate again, but most of the time, they could only find fragments. Finding a complete skeleton could make a museum's treasure and give them something to boast about for many years.  The huge skeletons displayed in museums were mostly made using old-world materials and technological means, not real fossilized bones!  And according to the fossil trade records of the last twenty years, a tooth from a carnivorous dinosaur from seventy million years ago could be worth an apartment of over a hundred square meters in the center of Yan Zhou's Qian Market!  "Juanmao, your dog food is secured." Chapter 459: Dominating the Headlines in a Unique Way  Curl didn't quite understand what Fang Zhao meant; it truly didn't find the bone tasty at all, nor was it filling. However, it could tell that Fang Zhao really liked this "gift."  While Curl was standing proudly with its chest puffed out, waiting for Fang Zhao to continue praising it, Fang Zhao said, "Curl, if you can control your transformations within a week to not affect electronic devices within one meter, you can have both the terminal and the gaming helmet."  Curl was so surprised by this that it momentarily froze, and then it leaped up and vigorously wagged its tail to confirm with Fang Zhao, "Really?"  "Mhm. The timer starts now."  Curl immediately dashed off to the warehouse to practice.  Fang Zhao carefully placed the fossilized bone fragment that Curl had brought back and, after changing into a diving suit and gearing up, entered the sea and headed to the spot where Curl had dug the hole.  The sea near the island wasn't too deep. There were many signs of digging underwater, as Curl often dug holes and played with things underwater near the island.  The hole where Curl dug up the bone was small, only big enough for Curl itself to enter. Fang Zhao didn't use any tools to dig but instead took out a small energy wave emitter.  Without a professional detector, Fang Zhao had to rely on his own hearing to get a rough idea of the situation within the rock layer. Listening carefully to the changes of the sound waves within the rock layer, Fang Zhao's brain was like a tomographic imaging device, sketching out a rough picture of the situation inside the rock layer.  There were many disturbances within the rock layer, but Fang Zhao had gained a preliminary understanding.  After returning to the shore, Fang Zhao marked several spots on the ground and started digging with tools. Of course, he wasn't planning to dig out the giant beast's fossil, which had been buried for who knows how many years, by himself with limited tools. He was just doing some preliminary work to divert people's attention and cover up the "abnormal" traces left by Curl's digging process.  Over the next few days, Fang Zhao did this work, which was made easier by the fact that part of the giant beast was large enough to be directly excavated on the island, though the digging was a bit deep.  On the other hand, Curl, stimulated by the promise of a gaming console and a personal terminal, made rapid progress. It didn't take a week; in just five days, Curl managed to reduce the interference range to within one meter and then eagerly ran to Fang Zhao to ask for its reward.  A gaming console! A personal terminal! How long had it waited!  It felt great not having to choose between the two!  Fang Zhao didn't deceive Curl. After checking and finding that Curl really met the requirements, he gave Curl both the gaming helmet and the terminal, even specially modifying the pocket watch-style terminal into a dog collar and putting it around Curl's neck.  "You can use these two things normally, but keep them away during transformations. Remember to take off the terminal before transforming," Fang Zhao instructed as he put the terminal-equipped dog collar on Curl.  "Roar!" Curl responded.  Curl would always be mindful of these instructions; after all, these were hard-earned rewards. How could it not take good care of its very own gaming console and terminal, the first it ever owned in its dog life!  After putting on the special collar, Curl even ran to the warehouse mirror and admired its reflection for nearly two hours. Curl was familiar with the gaming helmet, and the terminal was new to it, but the operation was very simple. After reading the electronic manual written by Fang Zhao once, Curl remembered it. Now, Curl didn't need to run to Fang Zhao to talk; it could just speak through the terminal!  While Curl was admiring itself in the warehouse mirror, Fang Zhao looked over the "Children's Terminal Usage Instructions" once more and deleted it.  However, the fact that Curl managed to reduce the interference range to within one meter in just five days was beyond his expectations. It seemed that Curl's control over its abilities was getting stronger and stronger. He would have to raise the standards in the future.  After dealing with Curl's matter, Fang Zhao contacted three people named Nan Feng and started a voice group chat.  When they received the group chat notification from Fang Zhao, the three didn't dare to delay and immediately went online to wait for their boss's orders.  The trio guessed that the boss usually contacted them once a week, and now it had only been five days. Had the island run out of supplies? That shouldn't be the case; they had sent so much last time, enough for a month of food and drink. Had something happened? But looking at the boss's demeanor, he didn't seem to be in a hurry. Or possibly... was he finally going to reveal his secret to them? For example, keeping a group of sharks on the island?  Suppressing the surging curiosity in their hearts, the trio patiently waited for Fang Zhao's words.  "Curl dug up a bone," Fang Zhao said.  Nan Feng's voice was excited, "Our little Curl is already bringing bones home!"  Left Yu ignored Nan Feng's silly expression, "Boss, is it human or animal bones?"  The now sober Nan Feng, with a serious expression, asked, "Is there a problem?"  According to the island purchase contract, the island was not a deadly one. Since the last owner bought it, there had been no accidental deaths. After all, the previous owner didn't live there much, and besides some simple renovations and building construction, nothing else had been buried there.  Could it be that there was some malevolent event that even the previous owner didn't know about?  If it were just ordinary bird or beast bones, there would be no need to contact them.  The three watched as Fang Zhao seemed to be not frightened, so they patiently waited for the rest of what Fang Zhao had to say.  "After preliminary identification, it is a bone fossil, belonging to a giant beast from tens of millions or even a hundred million years ago," Fang Zhao continued.  The trio: "..."  Sounds of sharp intakes of breath could be heard.  "A fossil?" Left Yu's lips were trembling.  Yan Biao didn't know much about fossils but was still relatively calm... calm my foot!  "Is it a dinosaur? The legendary prehistoric giant beast!" As a dinosaur enthusiast, Yan Biao wished he could fly over there immediately.  He loved listening to dinosaur stories as a child and even fantasized about becoming a dinosaur hunter!  "It's not necessarily a dinosaur; it could also be some kind of marine reptile," Fang Zhao said.  "To me, they're all dinosaurs!" Yan Biao didn't care about the specific definition of a dinosaur; land or marine, in his eyes, those creatures from that period were all dinosaurs!  Yan Biao asked Fang Zhao to send several more photos of the bone fossil, "This bone is really big! There must be a big creature buried underground! Boss, you can't dig it out by yourself; I'm coming to help you now!"  Nan Feng, on the other hand, had been silent, but there was some noise. After a while, when Left Yu and Yan Biao had calmed down a bit, they heard Nan Feng speak.  "Boss! I just checked the relevant laws and consulted a few authoritative lawyers. In the new century, fossils have become a commodity that can be traded, and anything dug up from a private island is privately owned! Boss!! You've hit the jackpot!!!" The latter half of the sentence was screamed, showing how excited Nan Feng was at the moment.  Private island transactions had all been explored before. However, early explorations were mainly to detect whether there were energy minerals or dangerous substances such as the doomsday virus. The island Fang Zhao bought was the same.  Don't even think about energy minerals; if they were there, they would have been mined long ago, and even the island might have become non-tradeable. Therefore, islands without energy minerals, after a certain range is delineated, become commodities for merchants to buy and sell, including everything on the island.  Fossils are a big deal for circles such as new century archaeology, collecting, and paleontology research. Over the years, if not for the fact that the number of fossils dug up is really too small, they would not have gradually been ignored by people.  In fact, countless fossils of ancient creatures that have passed through millions of years of historical mist, such as certain insects and plants, can still be dug up even after the doomsday century, but people still have a special fondness for dinosaurs; it's just that dinosaur fossils are too rare.  However, who would have thought that under such a remote little island, there would be ancient creature fossils from tens of millions of years ago?  Fossils! Real fossils!!  Different from the excitement of Nan Feng and the others, Fang Zhao calmly arranged the fossil excavation related matters. To excavate fossils, it's still necessary to find a professional team.  Therefore, Fang Zhao took photos of the excavated bone fossils and also shot a video of the excavation site he had made, posted them on social media platforms, and expressed that he was sincerely looking for a professional team to cooperate with.  After the post was sent out, Fang Zhao's personal terminal never stopped ringing. Those research bigwigs always found a way to get his contact information. Major media outlets also directly called to inquire.  That day, many people were stunned by the real-time pushed news headlines.  "Fossils? Are those the ones mentioned in textbooks from millions or even hundreds of millions of years ago... the fossils of prehistoric overlords? Are they real or just hype?"  "Looking at the already excavated bones, they are big enough, and the rest still haven't been dug out; it's definitely a big creature!"  "Is it Fang Zhao again? This way of dominating the headlines is truly unique."  "Was it his dog that dug it up? I suspect the bone with the scent of earth my dog gave me yesterday was also a fossil! But I threw it in the garbage processor— I feel like I've lost billions!"  ...  Fang Zhao, who already had a following, plus the fact that dinosaur fossils have special significance in the new century, made this a big event, and the whole world knew—on a small island recently purchased by Fang Zhao, his dog, yes, the nearly three billion-dollar Curl, dug up a dinosaur bone from tens of millions of years ago.  The news was so significant that it directly moved the traffic of several circles for a while. At the same time, more professional excavation teams were flying to Fang Zhao's island. Chapter 460: The Bustling Island  The discovery of dinosaur fossils by Fang Zhao on the island caused many island owners, who had originally planned to sell their islands, to hurriedly take down their for-sale signs and contact professional detection teams to check their own islands and the seabed nearby. No, they wouldn't be reassured until they contacted at least three different teams to check more than three times!  "Quick, quick, quick! See if the island I bought has buried fossils!" For a time, many professional fossil detection teams, which had been almost on the verge of disbanding and had been ignored by people, were revived!  It's a pity that all the senior research teams are now focusing on Fang Zhao's island. They don't know about other islands, but they are sure there are fossils on Fang Zhao's island, and it's a big one!  As a result, the anxious island owners could only find geological survey teams or other non-scientific research teams. Some teams that had already flown to Fang Zhao's island changed their route temporarily due to high compensation offers, planning to check the employer's island first. Who knows, they might detect fossils too?  The most frustrated one was the former owner who sold the island to Fang Zhao. He knew all too well the many flaws of his island: its remote location, difficulty in management, and the huge costs that would be required for transformation. Considering market conditions, it could not be commercialized quickly. How happy he was when he sold it, getting rid of a problem.  But how long had it been since he sold it? Half a month? Watching the news that was being pushed to him, the former owner almost spat out a mouthful of blood. He was filled with regret and hatred, his face twisted in frustration.  However, that's how business transactions are. It's hard to say who the winner is. Yesterday, he thought he was the big winner, but today he found himself losing face. Look how many jokes are being made about the person who sold the island to Fang Zhao online!  Thinking of the fossils buried beneath, the former owner's heart was bleeding. Regret! He should have re-investigated the island back then!  Fang Zhao! Sinister! Too sinister! He didn't believe that Fang Zhao hadn't received advance news! He must have known about the dinosaur fossils beneath the island and that's why he was in a hurry to buy it!  Indeed, every one of Fang Zhao's actions is purposeful! Every move is worth studying, you can never guess what he will do next!!  Because of the news stirred up by Fang Zhao this time, people around the world were discussing it so much that even Molang, who didn't usually pay attention to the news, got to know about it.  Molang originally thought Fang Zhao would be preparing for a performance on that remote island, but he didn't expect that just a few days later, there would be another commotion! Concerned, Molang quickly called Fang Zhao to make sure he wouldn't forget about the upcoming performance due to the fossil matter, as it was a very important event related to his future!  Of course, Fang Zhao hadn't forgotten about the important performance. Recently, besides dealing with the fossil matter, he had been preparing for the performance.  After reassuring the anxious Molang and ending the call, Fang Zhao saw Curly approach him.  Curly ran up to Fang Zhao, lifted its chin, and looked up at him almost as if gazing at the sky.  "The new collar looks good, quite nice," Fang Zhao said.  Curly barked happily and expressed, "Next time I'll dig bones in a different place!"  "Do you like digging bones?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Like!" Curly replied without hesitation.  There's a game console to play with when digging bones! Look, this time it dug up half a bone and got a game console and a terminal. What a good deal!  Fang Zhao thought of something and nodded, "Alright."  He had changed his mind. He originally planned to exchange the fossils for dog food, but now Curly could control its own transformation and could hunt for food in the sea by itself. As long as it didn't stay transformed for too long, the consumption wasn't too big, and he could still afford to keep it.  Moreover, this fossil event could probably earn him a sum of dog food money, so there was no need to rush to sell the fossils.  In the future, if Curly brings back more bone fossils or some other things, he would also help Curly to keep them. Didn't his old comrade Su Mu's book say it, "Take every gift they give you seriously"? Fang Zhao thought that made sense.  Or, he could just set up a private collection museum and collect everything Curly picked up into the museum.  The more Fang Zhao thought about it, the more he felt it was a good idea.  Digging bones is better than playing games at home all day.  Fang Zhao had already told Curly about the arrival of many strangers on the island. Curly wasn't worried; it could now control its interference and wouldn't suddenly transform and scare people. No matter how many came, it wasn’t worried about being exposed.  However, with more outsiders coming to its territory, Curly decided to patrol its territory more, both on water and underwater!  "Is this terminal waterproof?" Curly asked worriedly.  "Water-resistant up to 200 meters. As long as the diving depth doesn't exceed 200 meters, it should be fine," Fang Zhao replied.  "Only 200 meters?" Curly decided to be more careful and not to wear the terminal when patrolling the water.  Hearing the sound of a flying vehicle landing, Curly looked over and then ran towards the direction with its dog legs spread out.  It was Nan Feng and his two companions arriving.  After receiving Fang Zhao's call, Nan Feng and the others rushed over immediately. Even before they landed, they had noticed that the southeast part of the island was already riddled with holes.  But it didn't matter! Digging up fossils, they wouldn't mind even if it was all dug up!  Just getting off the flying vehicle, Nan Feng saw Curly running up to them. Curly raised its head to show them the new terminal on its neck.  If it were any other time, Nan Feng might have noticed, but now his mind was filled with dinosaur fossils, and he didn't pay attention to Curly's subtle emotions.  Now, looking at Curly, it was like looking at a hen that lays golden eggs. "Look at our little Curly, knowing that it has done a great thing, standing tall and proud! Good job, Curly!" Nan Feng said excitedly.  Curly's pair of dark dog eyes looked at him.  Then he heard Nan Feng continue, "Your owner is going to make a fortune this time. That's a dinosaur! And a very big one. Thousands of years ago, a small dog like you wouldn't be enough to fill the gaps between its teeth!"  Curly glanced at them again and walked away.  Nan Feng had no time to care about so much now. He first learned about the situation from Fang Zhao, then went with Yan Biao and Zuo Yu to dig out two fossil bones themselves, excitedly turned on the camera, and took a mad flurry of photos, showing off on social circles and social platforms.  Since there were others coming soon, the three of them didn't have much leisure time. After digging up the fossils, taking photos, and showing off, they each got busy with their own things.  The fossils buried under Fang Zhao's island were likely the first complete prehistoric behemoth fossils over 20 meters long to be discovered in the new century for over 500 years, attracting a strong interest, and various teams arrived quickly.  However, the island was privately owned, including the surrounding areas, all belonging to private property. Trespassing without the owner's permission, Fang Zhao could directly open fire.  Nan Feng was responsible for communicating with these teams.  Fang Zhao also hired some people to come over to maintain order on the island and its surroundings. The Yanzhou Navy also said they would send a team over to help. There were too many people coming, all from various continents, and the Yanzhou Navy had to take it seriously.  This time, even if it wasn't Fang Zhao, if it were someone else, they would negotiate with the island owner.  Fortunately, Fang Zhao was very cooperative.  After Fang Zhao sent out that message looking for partners, professional research teams from various continents actively requested to participate in this excavation operation without asking for compensation, as long as Fang Zhao allowed them to join the excavation.  Some people even fought over it, just to compete for a spot.  In addition to these teams, various media outlets were not far behind, and Yanzhou TV even scheduled an interview with Fang Zhao.  The originally quiet island became bustling, and some temporary housing was quickly erected.  The sea near the island was also full of ships of various sizes, and the number was still increasing.  If they couldn't land on the island, they would live on ships!  People who wanted to see the excitement also grouped together to charter boats to go there. As long as they did not enter the private island's territorial waters, it would not be considered trespassing.  There were many private flying vehicles in the sky. Without permission, they did not dare to fly into private areas, only flying around nearby, with people holding telescopes to observe. There were also those who did live internet broadcasts.  This excavation operation was very significant, and competition among the teams was fierce.  Fang Zhao chose twelve teams from twelve continents, mostly research-based teams, from among these teams.  Such a large project being divided among them, the teams were not very happy at first, but they understood Fang Zhao's intentions. If anyone was unwilling, they could leave.  There were still many private teams waiting eagerly on the side, just waiting for a team to leave so they could squeeze in.  Therefore, even if they were not happy about sharing with others, the twelve teams still agreed. No one wanted to give up this opportunity, and now they could only cooperate.  Fortunately, Fang Zhao did not micromanage, saying that he trusted the professionals with professional matters.  This time, Fang Zhao also met with the representatives from the world's number one collecting family, the Blaine family, who had come to him proactively.  Fang Zhao had some impression of the Blaine family. During the era of world destruction, this family made a huge contribution in the imperial continent's battlefield. Today, they own the largest private museum in the imperial continent—the Blaine Museum.  The Blaine Museum has the only Tyrannosaurus rex skull in the world, as well as a complete Velociraptor fossil.  Apart from those precious collections, what the Blaine family is most famous for are the people in their family.  The Blaine family members, regardless of gender, are very attractive. However, it is well known that this family does not value looks. Not long ago, a family member almost turned into a wild man just to find a hundred-million-year-old amber insect.  This time, the leader of the Blaine family and also the director of the Blaine Museum, knew that private teams were not easily able to participate alone, so they joined forces with the imperial continent's museum to form an excavation team to cooperate with Fang Zhao.  He came to Fang Zhao hoping that after the dinosaur is dug up, they could rent it for two months each year, with the Blaine Museum and the imperial continent's museum each displaying it for a month.  It would be great if they could buy it directly, they didn't mind paying more, but Fang Zhao made it clear when they first arrived that he wouldn't sell.  So, they could only ask for the next best thing. If they couldn't buy it, then they would rent it.  Fang Zhao didn't want to talk about these matters right now: "Let's talk after it is dug up."  He had to see the performance of these teams before deciding.  The management capability of different museums and their attention to collections vary. Fang Zhao didn't want the dinosaur that was dug up to be ruined by careless museums.  The Blaine Museum director didn't expect Fang Zhao to agree now, he just hoped that after the fossil was excavated, if Fang Zhao was looking for partners, he would consider them first. They came with the greatest sincerity!  The Blaine family brought five people with the museum director this time, regardless of gender. They all personally participated in the excavation work.  Sweat was shed, dust flew, and their faces were smeared with mud and water so that their appearances could not be clearly seen, only those pairs of fervent eyes were visible.  They didn't care about the cameras that followed them, nor did they mind appearing in front of a global audience like that. After all, the style of their family had long been famous.  What is a face worth? The fossil is what's important!  With many professional teams properly assigned, the work efficiency was much higher.  While they were busy digging fossils, Fang Zhao was already surrounded by reporters.  A reporter from Yanzhou TV, which had the advantage of being local, was the first to come to interview Fang Zhao.  "How did you first discover the fossils? Was it really your dog that found them?" The reporter glanced at the dog sitting next to Fang Zhao and asked with a smile.  "Yes, it was it that dug up the first bone," Fang Zhao confirmed.  The camera turned to Curly, which was sitting next to Fang Zhao.  Curly's dog head lifted slightly, showing off its collar and the terminal with a little dog pattern, not letting a single dog hair cover it.  On the other side, the camera, after filming the dog for a while, turned back to Fang Zhao.  The reporter asked some questions that the public was very curious about, such as why Curly was able to find the underground fossils.  Fang Zhao explained, "Just after buying the island, there was reconstruction on the island. Due to the construction, the rock layer below was exposed, but nobody paid attention to it. It was Curly that dug up that bone."  Nan Feng and the others who were following the interview: "......" To weaken the power of his own ears, the boss even pushed this to Curly? Don't other people know, but don't they know? There were no large-scale constructions on the island!  As for why Fang Zhao would buy this island, he simply said he wanted to find a quiet place that wouldn't be disturbed, and that discovering the fossils was really just luck.  Luck? Most people didn't believe it.  Ha, what luck! Does he still need to cover up his ears now?!  Regardless of what the reporters thought internally, they kept a face of "So that's how it is" on the surface, and followed the conversation by praising the obedient Curly sitting next to Fang Zhao.  Curly, being praised by everyone, was very proud and excited! After the interview, it ran around to patrol its territory, and when the time came for the broadcast, it stayed in front of the TV.  As an official television station in the Yanzhou region, the news was quite serious. The interview segments that were broadcast were Fang Zhao's original words, with no distortion or ambiguous editing.  Curly's footage also got several seconds of airtime. In today's environment where even tabloid news is in ultra-high-definition, the official TV station's news footage was clear enough for viewers to see the dog.  The terminal on the dog's collar, probably to avoid suspicion of advertising, was pixelated by the TV station.  Curly, which had been guarding the TV: "......" Chapter 461: The Watchdog  Curly, who failed to show off his new collar, was deeply struck and became listless. Fang Zhao went to the excavation team, and when he returned, he saw Nanfeng anxiously saying something to Curly, but Curly just walked slowly with his head down.  Seeing Fang Zhao, Nanfeng quickly reported the abnormal behavior of Curly. "Boss, is Curly having a stomach problem? Or is he not used to the strangers coming to the island? Is he sick? He was fine before."  Fang Zhao took the leash, signaling Nanfeng to go about his business, and he would handle it here.  Walking Curly back to the house, Fang Zhao could roughly guess the reason for Curly's behavior. "Curly, I have a task for you," said Fang Zhao.  Having something to do, Curly wouldn't have time to dwell on other things. Curly looked up at Fang Zhao.  "A large warehouse has been built on the southeast side of the island, and all the unearthed bone fossils are stored there. Help me guard it, and don't let anyone steal them."  The prehistoric creatures buried under the island were too large, and excavating them was difficult to minimize damage to the fossils. Although there were twelve teams responsible, they couldn't finish in one or two days.  Fang Zhao built a temporary large warehouse on the southeast side of the island, not only to store fossils but also tools and supplies for the excavation teams, including a temporary rest area.  Although a security system had been installed, Fang Zhao trusted Curly's abilities more and at the same time wanted to divert Curly's attention.  Recently, there were too many people on the island, and Curly always needed someone to lead him when moving elsewhere, requiring a leash which restricted his movement.  Now, Fang Zhao simply let him move freely inside the big warehouse. It might be a bit small, but there was no need for a leash.  "If you perform well, I'll take you to an alien planet to play after a while," Fang Zhao said.  Curly's eyes brightened, and he perked up instantly. He knew that Fang Zhao would leave for a performance after a while, and he might not be able to follow.  Now that Fang Zhao said this, of course, he was happy.  So, Nanfeng, who had just finished a phone call and was walking back, saw Curly rush into the warehouse like the wind, full of vigor.  "What's this?" Nanfeng asked Fang Zhao, puzzled.  "Guarding the warehouse door," replied Fang Zhao.  Fang Zhao greeted the warehouse staff and hung a sign next to the "Notice" at the warehouse entrance: Danger! No entry for non-staff!!!  The warehouse staff stared at the three exclamation marks on the warning sign, wondering what the danger was. They had been working there for two days and hadn't noticed any dangers in the warehouse. It was just a dog that had been added.  "Will the island owner's dog chew on the bones?" someone worried.  "If it's placed on the table, it can't reach it."  "Since Fang Zhao chose to let it in, he'll be responsible if something happens."  Even though the warehouse staff were reluctant to see a pet dog in such a place, who could argue when Fang Zhao was the island owner?  Alright, you're the owner, you can do as you please.  Curly, who had entered the warehouse, was already in work mode. To show results and have Fang Zhao take him to an alien planet to play, he inspected the warehouse very carefully.  He walked around the warehouse, checking every nook and cranny, not letting even a bug slip by.  After patrolling, Curly lay at the warehouse entrance, watching the staff coming in and out without barking or running around, taking his job as a watchdog seriously.  Meanwhile, at a distance from the island, a yacht was at a standstill, surrounded by many other boats that were there to observe the situation. This one was inconspicuous.  "We've successfully infiltrated the island and are very well disguised! The current bionic technology is amazing, it was worth the high price we paid on the black market, the seller didn't cheat us!"  "According to the manual, this is the latest bionic technology that can bypass most civilian security systems. It's useful but expensive, and we can't be sure how long it will last. We've invested a lot of our fortunes into this."  "And it's also small, only able to carry objects under twenty kilograms."  "I'm not greedy, I just want a small piece of bone. With such a large skeleton, missing one or two small ones certainly won't be noticed."  "I'm not greedy either, I'll be satisfied with just one bone."  "We'll split the money from the sale!"  "There's a night guard at the warehouse, we need to be extra careful."  "Don't worry, I've added a dissolving anesthetic needle, strong enough to knock out an elephant, and the needle can't be found."  "Fang Zhao is too impatient. As soon as he found the fossils, he made it public without being prepared. On this isolated island surrounded by sea, with so many people coming, there aren't enough security personnel."  "Moreover, Fang Zhao trusts so-called intelligent security systems too much, he's still too young, not knowing the pace of electronic equipment upgrades."  "Shall we act at night?"  "Yes, it's more convenient at night."  The sun set, and the night grew deeper.  The busy excavation team returned to their quarters, and after a simple cleanup, they rested. At first, they were too excited to sleep, and on the second day, they slept late. By the third day, the workload wasn't very large during the day, but it was particularly draining. A slight inattention could damage the fossils, and they didn't trust intelligent machines to excavate on such an important matter. They all chose to do it themselves.  So, when night came, they seized the time to recuperate.  According to the current progress, in two more days, the entire beast buried under the island could be unearthed, and they would be able to see the skeleton of this prehistoric giant that had been buried for tens of millions of years!  The excavation staff entered their dreams with smiles on their faces, unaware that in the darkness, many shadows were stirring.  The island was much quieter at night, and nocturnal insects came out one after another.  A small reptile crawled out from the bushes towards the warehouse.  On the sea outside the island, in a certain yacht, a few people stared at the monitor screen.  The footage was from the reptile's perspective, approaching the warehouse, and the next moment, it was about to squeeze through a window crack.  The people watched intently, and just as they were about to rejoice at having entered the warehouse, they heard a harsh "zzt—" sound, and the connection was lost.  "What happened?"  "Was it discovered?"  "Has the civilian security system been upgraded?"  "That shouldn't be the case. How could it be upgraded so soon after the new generation of bionic technology came out? It wasn't this fast before."  "The security system in the warehouse was set up by Fang Zhao's bodyguard and a security company. Maybe they used military equipment?"  A repressive silence followed.  That was most of their fortune!  On the sea outside the island, on many inconspicuous boats, similar incidents occurred.  The high-priced detection devices, stealth photography tools, and intelligent theft tools they had bought through various underground channels and said to be made with new bionic technology were all lost as soon as they were deployed. Each one went offline as soon as it entered the warehouse, some seemed to be crushed, others just disappeared abruptly.  Whether they flew in, crawled in, or burrowed in from underground, the result was the same.  Forget stealing a bone, they didn't even manage to take a single photo!  They also quietly inquired about which company helped with Fang Zhao's security system.  However, they didn't believe the information they found out.  It must be a superficial message, released to mislead people!  Indeed, the more powerful you are, the more secretive. Fang Zhao must be hiding a trump card!  Could it be that Fang Zhao really sought the help of the military?  Inside the newly built warehouse on the southeast side of the island, Curly carefully carried a severely deformed reptile in his mouth, placing it in a box in the corner.  The fifteenth one!  Collecting twenty would earn him an extra chance at a game console! Chapter 462: Top Apex Predator  The security system at the warehouse was mainly controlled by Zuo Yu and Yan Biao, who took turns on watch. Juan Mao's behavior was, of course, under their surveillance. Juan Mao knew about the cameras in the warehouse and understood that this was another test given by Fang Zhao. To prevent Juan Mao from developing a bad habit of eating anything it sees, Fang Zhao had indeed made considerable efforts, and this was also a test to see if Juan Mao had corrected its behavior.  Juan Mao was very willing to participate; it could swallow these small bugs even without transforming, and they wouldn't even be detected by the surveillance, or should it just catch a few for fun? But if catching twenty bugs would earn it an extra gaming session, it certainly wouldn't want to miss out. It counted each bug carefully as it released them, worried that someone might tamper with its box.  Yan Biao, on duty in the monitoring room tonight, couldn't help but be amazed. "Deserving of a dog that has done inspection work!" He had already noticed that the number of bugs in the warehouse was unusually high tonight, even though pest control had been done.  Watching Juan Mao catch each bug one by one and put them into the box Fang Zhao had prepared, Yan Biao knew something was wrong when one of the bugs emitted sparks as Juan Mao stepped on it. He immediately contacted Fang Zhao.  Fang Zhao instructed that the warehouse should be personally guarded by Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, without substitutions or allowing others near the monitoring room. If they needed to take leave, they could directly explain to Fang Zhao, and Nan Feng would cover for them or Fang Zhao himself would come to guard.   If there was any abnormal event at the warehouse, they must inform Fang Zhao immediately and not leak any information to the outside.  Yan Biao and Zuo Yu simply thought Fang Zhao was attaching great importance to the fossils and didn't find his orders unusual. However, after Yan Biao promptly reported the anomalies to Fang Zhao, Fang Zhao only told him to keep an eye on the monitors and not to worry about the things Juan Mao had caught.  Yan Biao also consulted some retired comrades to gain some insights. Recently, there had been a surge in sales of bionic devices on the black market, although they were pricey and rarely purchased. With the recent fossil news from Fang Zhao's side, the sales of these bionic devices on the black market had skyrocketed. Just now, he had received a warning from a comrade.  It turned out that the security system was not as useful as Juan Mao. None of those released devices had managed to get close to the dinosaur fossils!  Watching Juan Mao pull out a seemingly ordinary weed from a crack and throw it into the box, Yan Biao sighed deeply, thinking that it was time to upgrade the security system tomorrow. If everything depended on Juan Mao, wouldn't he become utterly redundant?  For the next two days, various disguised objects, some looking like insects, others like plants, all with excellent camouflage, attempted to infiltrate the warehouse. However, none of the skeletal fossils sent to the warehouse were stolen, and no unauthorized photos leaked.  There were also attempts to bribe the staff, but Fang Zhao's selected team consisted of experienced members with strict internal management. If there were any, they would be expelled from within before Fang Zhao needed to take action.  When they signed the contract with Fang Zhao, it stated that if anyone within a team caused an issue, the entire team would be held responsible. They would not only be expelled from the project but also have to pay a hefty penalty. Because of this, they were even more active than Fang Zhao in rooting out any traitors.  One noon, a digger feeling unwell was asked by the leading professor to rest in the warehouse's resting room. As the worker entered the warehouse carrying a box, he was stopped by Juan Mao's barking.  The warehouse guards gathered around, and other workers also turned to look. The worker holding the box turned pale, not because he was guilty but because he was genuinely scared.  The guards took him aside and opened the box that Juan Mao had been staring at. Juan Mao pointed its paw at a geological hammer inside the box. The stopped worker's expression changed dramatically: "This isn't my hammer! My hammer has my name engraved on it! There's no name on this one!"  He quickly contacted the leading professor, "Professor! My box has been tampered with!"  In order to protect his prized student and keep his team in the project, the professor reacted swiftly and cooperated fully with the investigation. Soon, the team members proved their innocence and helped catch three suspicious individuals.  The incident in this team made other digging teams more vigilant. Besides themselves, no one was allowed to touch their toolboxes! They checked their clothing every day and were extremely cautious around anyone who tried to approach them.  Before, they were eager to be interviewed by mainstream media; now, the media were the ones trying to block them every day. If it hadn't been for the tampered box incident, they might still be somewhat complacent, but the day's events served as a cold reality check.  It was the final stage of the excavation, and the skeletal fossils were nearly all unearthed. Being kicked out of the project at this moment would be a huge regret! They couldn't afford to stumble at this critical time!  Soon, others on the island noticed that while the digging teams used to work with laughter, the atmosphere had now become very serious. No matter how busy, there was always a team member responsible for watching the surroundings.  With the combined efforts of the twelve teams, the skeletal fossils buried beneath the island were finally excavated. The skeletons were relatively intact with not many parts needing replacement. After computer simulation and reconstruction of the skeletons, they proceeded with the mounting process.  The moment the mounting was completed, they looked up at the nearly fifty-meter-long skeleton, as if they had traveled through time and seen the apex predator of the seas from seventy million years ago. A young worker on site was beside himself with excitement, while several older professors in charge of the mounting were moved to tears.  "I never thought... I would be able to see the top predator of the seas from seventy million years ago with my own eyes!" After an hour of non-stop discussion around the newly unearthed gigantic skeleton, they had to face one issue.  "It needs a name," said one of the leading professors.  After searching through a lot of data and finding nothing corresponding, they were certain that what they had unearthed was an unknown species, so it needed a name. But the problem was that this find was not discovered by a single team but by several teams together, and the skeleton belonged to the island's owner.  "Should we follow the naming rules?" "Do we have the right to name it?" "What about Fang Zhao? Hey, Fang Zhao, the island owner! This naming..."  "Whatever you decide is fine," Fang Zhao said.  The leading professors were thinking of how to persuade Fang Zhao if he named it casually, but to their surprise, Fang Zhao left the naming decision to them.  In the old century, such paleontological fossils of scientific research value belonged to the state. Although the new century's cultural relics management law was different, Fang Zhao did not have much attachment to these matters. If it hadn't been for Juan Mao, Fang Zhao might have directly donated the skeleton to one or several museums.  Fang Zhao glanced at Juan Mao, who was yawning next to the box of insects. Apart from games and eating, this dog really had no interest in anything else.  Hearing Fang Zhao say he would leave the naming to them, one elderly professor trembled with excitement, and his quick-thinking assistant immediately gave the old man a couple of pills.  The twelve excavation teams engaged in a heated debate over the naming. In the end, they named this prehistoric apex marine predator "Hai Huang Long" (Sea Emperor Dragon). It was the largest skeletal fossil discovered to date, and judging by the teeth, it was carnivorous, undoubtedly an apex predator of its time. The word "Emperor" was fitting.  Next was the documentation process, which led to another intense debate among the twelve teams. Strictly speaking, the newly unearthed Sea Emperor Dragon should be classified as a marine reptile, and theoretically not a dinosaur. However, mainstream culture commonly referred to creatures living during that period with distinctive characteristics as dinosaurs.  There was a proposal in the new century for paleontologists to re-establish classifications. Gaps were significant in the new century's paleontological research, and the limited data left from the old century were only taken as a reference, not wholly believed. They only trusted their own research.  After the documentation was complete, a paleontologist professor held Fang Zhao's hand, "I see you have a connection with dinosaurs, would you be interested in participating in paleontology research?"  Fang Zhao: "...No."  These people were asking him to study paleontology under false pretenses; their actual goal was the Sea Emperor Dragon's skeleton.  In the following two days, news about the "Sea Emperor Dragon" almost dominated their screens on various online platforms. Whether it was the archaeological circle, entertainment circle, dinosaur enthusiasts, early childhood education, life sciences, geology research, and so on, it was all about the Sea Emperor Dragon.  The general public felt a sense of shock and comfort, thinking, "Our planet also once had such huge creatures, not inferior to those alien creatures that have been revealed." They went online and raved about it, making up all sorts of stories as if they had seen it with their own eyes.  "Those 'ocean masters' discovered before now seem like little brothers." "Unbeatable! Truly unbeatable!" "Apex predator of the ocean! Looking forward to a Sea Emperor Dragon movie!" "I wonder if the Sea Emperor Dragon skeleton will be on public display?" "The skeleton is too valuable; I guess it won't be open to the public." "A model would do, when will the Sea Emperor Dragon model be available?" "This... That probably depends on Fang Zhao's decision." "I declare, the only one who can stand on the Sea Emperor Dragon's head is Fang Zhao!" "...Huh?" "That's right, actually. Fang Zhao is literally living above the Sea Emperor Dragon's grave, so saying he's standing on its head isn't wrong."  Soon, a new topic emerged. #FangZhao, TheManWhoStandsOnTheSeaEmperorDragon'sHead#  Nan Feng laughed at the suddenly trending topic on the social networking platform. These days, because of the Sea Emperor Dragon's skeletal fossil, other things aside, just the rent collected was a substantial amount.  "Boss, you really struck it rich this time! If you sell the skeleton, you'll return to the billion-dollar club!"  "I'm not planning to sell," said Fang Zhao.  After a moment of surprise, Nan Feng had a moment of realization: "Right! How could you sell such a unique and valuable item in the world? It must be kept in your hands for a couple of years!"  "I plan to open a collection gallery, not just for the Sea Emperor Dragon, but I might gradually add some other things," Fang Zhao added.  "A collection gallery?" Nan Feng was surprised again, then realized, thinking: That's the boss for you, always thinking long-term.   Temporarily not selling the skeletal fossil and opening his own museum to play with, he could also make money with various peripheral products! The Sea Emperor Dragon is the largest living creature unearthed on this planet to date. There might be larger creatures on other planets, but for paleontologists, their own planet's history was still unclear, so how could they have the energy to look at extraterrestrial ones?  Moreover, people's attachment to their own planet is irreplaceable, with the history of human development and a shared history for all. Emotionally, there's a bias.  Apart from these, under the current policies and management, there is a strict limit on extraterrestrial organisms. In terms of collection value, those from this planet undoubtedly take precedence; others cannot replace them.  Feeling like he had guessed Fang Zhao's thoughts, Nan Feng was satisfied. His boss still had an investment mindset.  Nan Feng looked at the various possible appearances of the Sea Emperor Dragon simulated by the research team and exclaimed: "Worthy of the ocean's apex predator, no matter which one looks fierce enough. It's a good thing it's extinct."  "It's just that I don't know what the universe's top predators look like."  Nan Feng began to fantasize again, "They must also be quite impressive."  Fang Zhao glanced at Juan Mao, who was still counting insects beside the box, and said, "Not necessarily. Some creatures look cute but have great lethality."  Nan Feng: "Hahaha, boss, you're so funny!"  Fang Zhao: "...One day you'll understand."  Nan Feng showed agreement on his face, but inside, he laughed again.  Alright, you're the boss, so whatever you say is right. Even if you say Juan Mao is the top predator, I fully support you! Chapter 463: Impossible to be Worse than a Dog  The overwhelming reports about the Sea Emperor Dragon have led to a surge in the publication of paleontology research papers. Many things previously thought impossible in documentaries have been overturned. A student studying ancient vertebrates said with a laugh during a media interview: "Our teachers used to say that just like documentaries and archaeological excavations, they are always subject to being disproven as new information emerges. The discovery of the Sea Emperor Dragon is a significant event for us, and we believe that there are many more surprises waiting to be discovered in places we don't know about."  The excavation of the Sea Emperor Dragon on Fang Zhao's island has shifted everyone's attention from the land to the islands and oceans. In those rarely visited places, more ancient creatures that have luckily avoided cataclysmic extinctions are surely buried. Islands have increased in value! Although not a sharp rise, the number of people interested in buying islands has increased, and the price of islands has quickly stopped falling and started to rise.  Even a paleontology enthusiast has specifically bought an island to set up his own research base and established a new exploration team, targeting the rock layers beneath the sea. After the Sea Emperor Dragon was unearthed, Fang Zhao and the Brian Museum, as well as the Huangzhou Museum, signed a cooperation agreement. For the next two months, the Sea Emperor Dragon will be transported to Huangzhou for exhibition in these two museums. It is said that the online ticketing channel sells out every day as soon as it opens, and tickets for the two months available for pre-sale are all snapped up, quite the frenzy.  As for the Yanzhou Museum... the director is so frustrated he wants to cry.  There's no helping it. The Yanzhou Museum does have a geographical advantage, after all, Fang Zhao is from Yanzhou. But! In terms of strength, they are not yet able to handle the various pressures that come with the Sea Emperor Dragon. However, with two months of buffer time, they will certainly be ready to welcome the Sea Emperor Dragon! Otherwise, where would they put their face!!  After the Sea Emperor Dragon was moved out, the attention was shifted elsewhere, and Fang Zhao's island became quiet again.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Fang Zhao plans to build a museum, but the island is not a good place for it. His time away is unpredictable, and should someone cause trouble on the island, he wouldn't be able to take care of it. He wouldn't want the things Curly Hair has dug up to be stolen. He hasn't found a suitable location at the moment, and also lacks sufficient funds, so he can only wait until he has saved enough money to proceed.  With the Sea Emperor Dragon rented out, some businesses have approached him for cooperation. However, Fang Zhao's focus is still on the upcoming extraterrestrial performance. He has received an invitation from the organizers. It was only at this time that Fang Zhao found out who the organizers that Molang had not told him about were.  Hidden Star.  The foremost of the three major extraterrestrial military strongholds!  There's little other information, and even military reports rarely cover events on Hidden Star. However, Hidden Star is unanimously recognized as having the highest scientific research capabilities.  "......These are the basic matters to pay attention to, I will send you a detailed electronic document, and the itinerary will be arranged uniformly, someone will notify you at that time......" The other party briefly explained the issues to pay attention to Fang Zhao, then asked, "Do you have any other questions?"  "Can I bring a dog?" Fang Zhao asked.  There was a pause on the other end of the communicator, and the voice which was usually devoid of emotion showed a rare fluctuation: "Are you talking about Curly Hair? It can be brought, other dogs cannot. Of course, if you don't have time to feed the dog during your stay on Hidden Star, we can help. We can also let it interact with our spaceport anti-smuggling team."  Fang Zhao was not surprised that the other party knew about Curly Hair. Curly Hair has indeed been registered with several military districts and departments and has made notable contributions. Every spaceport anti-smuggling department wanted to snatch the dog. Hidden Star's spaceport did have intentions for Curly Hair, but when they knew Fang Zhao was unwilling to let the dog go, they didn't make a sound.  Of course, they were also very interested in Fang Zhao's ears, but since Fang Zhao was too focused on musical arts, it was even harder to poach him.  After finishing the call with the organizers on Hidden Star, Fang Zhao received an electronic document that included guidelines for accompanying personnel and pets. Fang Zhao mentioned this to Nanfeng and the other two, but did not tell them the destination was Hidden Star. The three expressed their desire to follow.  Nanfeng, with his sharp insight, guessed that the place Fang Zhao was going to must be of high standards, so he was definitely unwilling to be left behind! Hearing that Curly Hair would also be brought along, Nanfeng worriedly said, "Didn't they say the place we're going is strictly managed? Can dogs be brought too?"  Although he didn't know exactly where they were going, a place with such complex and strict approvals that allowed pets to be brought along?  Fang Zhao didn't explain much, only saying, "I'll give you the application link; just submit the application for Curly Hair when you do yours."  "Understood, boss!" Nanfeng acted quickly, calling on Yan Biao and Zuo Yu to submit their accompanying applications together.  The scrutiny for these accompanying personnel was much stricter, with political vetting in the first round. Inappropriate public remarks or blemishes on one's record could block the application.  "Even pets need political vetting?" Nanfeng found it novel, but still followed Fang Zhao's instructions and submitted the application for Curly Hair.  A minute later, Curly Hair's political vetting was approved.  Nanfeng: "......"  Is the vetting for pets so fast nowadays?  An hour later, Yan Biao was approved.  Another half-hour later, Zuo Yu was approved.  Nanfeng...  Nanfeng hadn't received any notification by dinner time.  "Why did you guys pass the vetting so quickly? Then me... I... couldn't be..." Nanfeng's face was pale, and his speech trembled.  Yan Biao consoled him: "It's probably because you've been in the entertainment industry for a while, so they're scrutinizing you more closely."  Nanfeng's heart was still hanging high. He had been in the Huangzhou entertainment industry and worked at the bottom level, where he might have been more casual in his speech and actions, but he certainly hadn't said anything he shouldn't have, nor had he done anything outrageous!  Nanfeng didn't sleep that night.  Fortunately, he received the approval message the next day, and his heart finally settled down.  "OK! Apply for the next round of vetting!"  The following few rounds of vetting went smoothly, but the last one required them to go to a designated location for a physical examination within seven working days.  Fang Zhao went with them.  "Boss, you've already passed everything, right? You don't need to come with us, I can handle this." Nanfeng said.  Physical examinations are simple!  "I'll go and have a look," Fang Zhao said.  At the designated place, the three men and the dog entered different testing channels.  Fang Zhao found a bench to sit down and read a book.  Half an hour later, Curly Hair trotted out with its little dog paws, easily and without pressure.  Two hours later, Yan Biao came out of the testing channel.  Seeing that Zuo Yu and Nanfeng were not there, Yan Biao felt somewhat proud. Look, he was indeed the strongest. Having served on Baiji Star for many years, he had an advantage! As for Curly Hair, Yan Biao didn't take it seriously. He thought that the standards for pets must have been relaxed here.  Curly Hair yawned.  When Zuo Yu came out, Curly Hair yawned again and found a comfortable position to continue lying down.  By the time Nanfeng came out of the testing channel, Curly Hair had already fallen asleep next to Fang Zhao's feet.  Nanfeng, who had just walked out of the testing channel, still felt a bit dizzy and nauseous.  "This test was quite strict, and the standards for the physical fitness test were set very high."  From the physical fitness test inside, it was evident that the place they were going to perform was certainly not a very comfortable one.  Zuo Yu mocked from the side: "I say, Nanfeng, you used to be from Baiji Star, right? Not good, you've regressed! You need to start increasing your training from tomorrow!"  Yan Biao also agreed: "You do need to enhance your training. You say you, you can't even beat a dog, aren't you embarrassed?"  Nanfeng looked at Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, who were already sitting on the bench, and then at the snoring Curly Hair, his expression bewildered.  "No... impossible... I can't be worse than Curly Hair!"  After being discharged for so many years, have I really degenerated to the level of a weakling? Chapter 464: Departure  After all the applications were approved, Fang Zhao turned down all subsequent collaboration invitations, not even attending the opening ceremony of the first public exhibit of the Sea Emperor Dragon's head in Huangzhou.  On the day of the Sea Emperor Dragon's head exhibit, a long queue formed outside the Huangzhou Museum. People attracted by the Sea Emperor Dragon were so excited that their faces flushed red, enduring the slow security check in line. Next to the queuing channel, there were also some dinosaur-related models and toys for sale, and those waiting in line couldn't resist buying a few to play with.  The invited media reporters entered the museum through the press channel and furiously snapped photos of the Sea Emperor Dragon. Not all of them were allowed to visit Fang Zhao's private island, so they hadn't been able to take any photos before and mostly just shared reports from other outlets.  The directors of the Huangzhou Museum and the Brian Museum had continuous smiles during the opening ceremony, but once they returned to their offices after the interviews, the smiles disappeared from their faces. The director of the Huangzhou Museum looked at the several bionic mechanical reptiles on the desk with a very ugly expression.  The Brian Museum's director was also relieved: "If it weren't for Fang Zhao's reminder to conduct a special upgrade, there would have been losses this time."  When Fang Zhao handed over the Sea Emperor Dragon fossils to them, he reminded them and suggested a security upgrade against bionic mechanical technology. The two directors took Fang Zhao's advice seriously, and before the transfer of the Sea Emperor Dragon, they had already arranged for a special upgrade to be carried out in their museums.  While the two directors were both angry and relieved, a group of people who had set their sights on the Sea Emperor Dragon were hopping mad.  "Not being able to get into Fang Zhao's warehouse is one thing; we can assume that he is using some kind of military equipment. But not being able to get into both Huangzhou and Brian Museums, what does that tell us?"  "This technology is outdated!"  "I spent so much money only to buy outdated stuff!"  "The seller tricked me!"  The so-called latest bionic machinery hyped by the seller was a total pitfall!  Spending so much money all for nothing!  If the technology is outdated, it's worthless. Black market goods are expensive, but there has never been such a scam!  Feeling thoroughly cheated, the people who thought they were scammed tried to get a refund from the seller, but couldn't find anyone. In a fit of anger, they spent a lot of money to put a hit on the original seller and warned others: "There's a lot of shoddy goods in the black market!"  Within the T organization, the person tasked with selling the bionic technology was now in a sorry state of flight.  Ever since they discovered that the stolen bionic technology was ineffective against Yanzhou's sea defenses, the people in the T organization had been thinking of ways to make more money with bionic technology, and just at the time when Fang Zhao discovered the fossils, they seized the opportunity to create a batch of bionic machinery and made a fortune on the black market!  However, not long after, people who bought the bionic machinery started clamoring for refunds.  This convinced the T organization that the "bionic technology" was a conspiracy against them!  It was acceptable for military use, and they would admit defeat if it couldn't get past sea defenses, but even civilian security systems had been upgraded to anti-bionic technology versions. They had expended so much effort only to steal an outdated technology!  Fang Zhao, who caused all this, had indirectly stabbed the T organization once again.  After discovering the presence of bionic reptiles on the island, Fang Zhao reported the matter. Following the upgrades at Huangzhou Museum and Brian Museum, more critical locations would undergo upgrades against bionic technology.  However, Fang Zhao currently had no time to pay attention to the security upgrades, as he was now packing to head to Hidden Star. This departure would also take a bit longer, so he informed his grandparents. He didn't provide details, only mentioning that he had matters to attend to and would be out of contact for a while, and if they couldn't reach him, he asked the elders not to worry.  "Boss, the eighty million... should this 'rabbit' be left at home?" Nan Feng asked.  "Mhm," Fang Zhao replied, glancing at the water tank. He had placed the "rabbit" in his seaside residence, not on the island, because if anything happened here, the alarm would sound and the property management could respond quickly.  "Alright." Although still somewhat worried, Nan Feng didn't say more and continued with the report, "The construction team on the island is making smooth progress. Everything should be restored by the time we return."  Due to the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil, the island had undergone digging, building, and dismantling, so now people were hired to restore it. The big pit from the digging had to be filled, and other areas on the island needed to be repaired and rebuilt.  After packing, Fang Zhao received a call from the military district's personnel sent to pick them up.  The aircraft landed on the tarmac.  Two soldiers came to verify identities.  Fang Zhao, as well as an assistant, two bodyguards, and a dog.  Nan Feng noticed that the soldier checking identities lingered on Curly Hair for quite a while, as if to confirm whether this was indeed the dog listed on the application form.  Four people and one dog, identities confirmed and luggage checked for security, the two soldiers led them onto the aircraft, heading to the Yanzhou military district.  Fang Zhao would travel to the outer space port with other invited personnel from Yanzhou to assemble.  Nan Feng's trio, one with a special forces background and two with extraterrestrial garrison experience, all puffed out their chests and stood tall, showing their steely demeanor in front of the Yanzhou military district's personnel. At this time, they couldn't let Fang Zhao down.  However, after boarding the aircraft, the two soldiers only glanced briefly at the trio and then focused their attention on Fang Zhao and Curly Hair.  The soldiers' orders were to take extra care of Fang Zhao and his dog, while Nan Feng's trio wasn't in their care remit, and verification of their identities was enough.  In fact, they weren't specifically there to pick up Fang Zhao; they were just the closest after completing a mission and were assigned to pick him up.  Inside the tightly closed energy cabin, there was a box of energy ore and some cargo, all destined for the military district; this trip was just conveniently picking up some people on the way.  Curly Hair lay quietly at Fang Zhao's feet, its glossy dog eyes sweeping around, licking its nose, and then looking up at Fang Zhao, whimpering a couple of times.  Fang Zhao glanced at it and patted its head.  Curly Hair lay back down contentedly, but occasionally licked its nose and smacked its lips.  Seeing this, a soldier asked, "Is it thirsty?"  "Yes, it's thirsty. Nan Feng, take out its water bowl," Fang Zhao said calmly.  "Yes!" Nan Feng flipped out the dog bowl and handed it over.  Yan Biao watched the scene and thought to himself: Geez, pets are really pampered.  Fang Zhao held the bowl, accepted the water offered by a soldier, and after thanking him, he poured half a bowl of water in front of Curly Hair, tapping its head as a warning.  Ever since Curly Hair was able to transform, its diet had expanded, and its appetite had grown. It had been let out to forage for food just yesterday.  Thirsty? No, it was just greedy for a taste.  Of course, Fang Zhao wouldn't say the real reason. He couldn't possibly say it.  Otherwise, how could he explain it? Say that Curly Hair was drooling over the energy cabin of someone else's aircraft?  Fang Zhao was somewhat troubled. It seemed that he still needed to keep the dog close to him; otherwise, he wouldn't be at ease. He would have to keep a close eye on it this time; if he wasn't careful, it might run off and eat something strange, not even leaving behind any scraps. Chapter 465: No One's Stealing The Dog  At the Yanzhou Military Region, several journalists were preparing to interview a certain armored division that had just returned from a mission. While discussing the upcoming interview, a surprised voice from one of the journalists was heard, "Isn't that Fang Zhao?!" The others turned to look. "It seems like it!" "Judging from the dog following him, it's definitely Fang Zhao!" "What's he doing in the Yanzhou Military Region?" "I just noticed that they came off a military aircraft, escorted by two soldiers." "Interesting, what is he up to this time?"  A young journalist was about to take some photos but was stopped by the others. After calming down, he also regretted acting impulsively. Once inside the military base, unless it's a scheduled event, no random pictures should be taken. So, although they were dying of curiosity, they still had to control themselves, or else they would be kicked out directly, and their careers could end there.  However, even without taking pictures, they would still gossip privately. "I think Fang Zhao is up to something again." "Lately, it's all been about him in the news. I thought he was busy with the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil matter, but I didn't expect to see him here." "Now that you mention it, there hasn't been any news of his whereabouts recently. The leaks online are all about the fossils, none about him." "I heard from a friend that many entertainment journalists are looking for him, but can't find him. The entertainment journalists nowadays have regressed. Back in my younger days, those journalists were so quick that they would dig out news before we could even report it."  Indeed, as these journalists said, due to the hot discussion about the Sea Emperor Dragon, everyone naturally paid attention to Fang Zhao. However, what was different this time was that many investors were also keeping an eye on Fang Zhao. They analyzed the Sea Emperor Dragon excavation process and believed that Fang Zhao must have received the news in advance, which is why he rushed to purchase the island.  Analyzing Fang Zhao's path to fame, it always felt like every move he made would lead to a big event. The Sea Emperor Dragon fossil incident was definitely not the end! This time they were watching Fang Zhao closely, especially his movements, wanting to know if he had secretly gone to dig up more fossils? Or had he found something else valuable?  However...  He freaking disappeared again! Fang Zhao, including his assistant and bodyguards, as well as that dog capable of digging up fossils, all freaking disappeared! He didn't even attend the Sea Emperor Dragon's first exhibition ceremony. There must be something more important!  But there had been no recent mention of him attending any events.  Investigate! Find out what that kid has been up to recently! Is he going to cause trouble again?!  However, as they waited and waited, there was still no news. Not to mention the investors who were holding back their frustration, even the online crowd anxious for updates were getting impatient. The last time Fang Zhao appeared in public was in Yanzhou, so the netizens from Yanzhou began to exert effort.  As usual...  "Wang Die, you failure!"  "Wang Die! Come out and work!"  "Wang Die, look, we've even started a crowdfunding campaign, see? It just launched and already more than ten million people have participated. Conservatively estimated, by this time tomorrow, it will definitely surpass a hundred million! If you can dig up news about Fang Zhao, all this money is yours! Surprised? Unexpected? Happy?"  Thus, the crowdfunding campaign, which saw its popularity soar rapidly, pushed Wang Die into the trending topics.  Wang Die: "......" Thank you on behalf of your whole family!  While the online crowd was busy crowdfunding to trap Wang Die, Fang Zhao had already transferred from Yanzhou Military Region to the outer spaceport. They needed to stay at the spaceport for two days before heading to the hidden star.  At the spaceport, Fang Zhao met other artists invited to the hidden star and also encountered an old friend. During the filming of "Genesis," he had collaborated with the villain specialist & wife dazzler Qiao Tingzheng. His wife, Windsor, was invited to perform on the hidden star, and this time he accompanied her as a family member.  Seeing Fang Zhao, Qiao Tingzheng was very happy and said he would come over to chat with Fang Zhao after settling his luggage.  Nan Feng approached Fang Zhao and whispered, "Boss, looking at the artists invited this time, you are the youngest among them."  And also the least experienced. Although Nan Feng didn't finish his sentence, Fang Zhao understood his implication. Being the least experienced, he might have to endure some grievances. However, Fang Zhao was prepared for this.  While they were talking, a middle-aged artist passed by them, his gaze sweeping over the curly-haired dog at Fang Zhao's feet, frowning deeply, showing extreme dissatisfaction, then looking at Fang Zhao, wanting to say something, he opened his mouth but ended up snorting and left angrily.  Fang Zhao, who was about to greet the other party, was left puzzled: "??"  Fang Zhao knew this middle-aged artist who stormed off for reasons unknown—David Herl, one of the three great violin masters in the world, and the teacher of the "Fiery" Fai Harmonic who plays the violin with flying red hair. Recently, Fai Harmonic seemed to have started another battle with Saro, sparring online. However, Fang Zhao hadn't followed their battle recently and didn't know the outcome.  Unlike Fai Harmonic, who was always in entertainment news, David Herl, his teacher, was much more low-key. Other than music concerts and lectures, he rarely appeared in public. Fang Zhao had never spoken to him before, and they didn't have much interaction. This was the closest they had been, but Fang Zhao didn't understand what the world-class violin master was angry about.  After David Herl walked away, Nan Feng approached and whispered, "I also know the guy who just passed by, a violin master, his student is Fai Harmonic, who has a strong presence in the entertainment industry and is often compared with you. He probably doesn't like the look of you. He already has prejudices, and now seeing you attend a performance with a dog, he must be even more unhappy."  Such things were too common in the industry, and Nan Feng believed he had found the truth. Even if it wasn't the exact truth, it was close to it.  Fang Zhao didn't think it was as Nan Feng said, but he really didn't understand where David Herl's anger came from. The question was answered when Qiao Tingzheng came over to chat with him.  "David Herl? Oh, him," Qiao Tingzheng glanced at Fang Zhao and the curly-haired dog beside him, "Of course he's angry! Because his request to bring his own dog was denied, before coming here I heard someone consoling him saying 'you can't bring dogs to perform on an alien planet,' and he was feeling depressed. As soon as he arrived at the spaceport, he saw you with a dog. How could he not be angry?"  Qiao Tingzheng shared with Fang Zhao the story of the renowned violin master's journey as a dog slave, all of which he had heard from his wife.  "......The thing he loves most now, apart from his violin, is his dog. In front of these two, even his direct disciple Fai Harmonic has to step aside. There, that's his beloved dog."  Qiao Tingzheng showed Fang Zhao a photo of David Herl's beloved dog that he had saved. David Herl's beloved dog belonged to a new century artificially bred dog breed, with the genes of three elegant old-century breeds and a hunting dog. Its signature was the "long hair," which indeed looked elegant when groomed.  Nan Feng also took a peek. "This master... seems to have a special fondness for long hair."  Qiao Tingzheng laughed and said, "Right, he does like long hair." Then he looked at the curly-haired dog at Fang Zhao's feet, "Your dog's fur isn't particularly long; he probably doesn't care for it. But you can rest assured, he's good to dogs. It's just envy, jealousy, and hatred towards you. You don't need to mind, he's not really angry with you."  Qiao Tingzheng then looked at the curly-haired dog, knowing that it had made big news recently, "Did it really dig out the first Sea Emperor Dragon skeletal fossil?"  "It did," said Fang Zhao.  "I thought the news was just making things up," Qiao Tingzheng said, looking at the curly-haired dog as if it were a rare animal.  The curly-haired dog opened its mouth and stuck out its tongue, droplets of saliva dripping down, continuously licking its lips, seeming somewhat restless.  "Is it feeling too hot in here?" Qiao Tingzheng asked. Although he didn't understand dogs, he knew some common sense, such as dogs sticking out their tongues and panting to cool down when hot... No, that couldn't be saliva, should it be considered sweat from a dog?  However, Qiao Tingzheng checked the indoor temperature and pressure, which were all normal. It shouldn't be like this.  "It's just not very adapted," Fang Zhao said calmly.  "Right, most pet dogs have difficulty adapting to the atmosphere of a spaceport. I heard that dogs are afraid of heights, so going to outer space is kind of like being afraid of heights, haha!" Qiao Tingzheng laughed at his own joke.  Fang Zhao also smiled politely, but was actually even more worried. The dog had gone to the sea to forage the day before departure, hadn't transformed frequently, and hadn't consumed much energy, so why would it be hungry? It was just greedy.  The spaceport had too many energy sources, and for the curly-haired dog, whose diet had expanded, that was a huge temptation. Fang Zhao even suspected that if he didn't keep a close eye on the curly-haired dog, it could eat the entire spaceport if it really started eating.  Seeing the curly-haired dog's reaction, Fang Zhao strengthened his restraint on it and even gave it a lesson in private. The curly-haired dog then restrained itself somewhat, at least it wasn't constantly drooling, but its eyes were still sneakily looking around.  Fang Zhao and the others invited to perform were occasionally called to meetings, so it was impossible to always keep the curly-haired dog by their side. Therefore, he entrusted the task of watching the curly-haired dog to Nan Feng and the other two. He brought three people to keep an eye on the dog.  "Keep a close watch on it."  Nan Feng and the other two solemnly replied, "Understood!"  No one's stealing the dog! Chapter 466: Rational Star Chasing  Yinxing is a globally militarized managed place. Apart from a few areas where people gather and live, vast spaces are used for various product experiments and military exercises. The natural environment here is not suitable for human habitation, but due to Yinxing's rich energy mineral deposits, the first extraterrestrial military base was built here. The current top aerospace technology, more than 90% of it, comes from Yinxing.  From departure to landing on Yinxing, Fang Zhao and the others couldn't see the outside situation at all. During this period, they also signed a confidentiality agreement. In short, they were invited to participate in a cultural performance, and as for other matters, they were advised not to be too curious.  When Fang Zhao and his group exited the aircraft, they had already landed in the designated area of Yinxing. The special nature of Yinxing means that there is very little real information about it on the internet. Even the veterans in their art troupe who have visited several times only know some art-related information; they don't understand, and they dare not delve too much into other matters.  As a first-time visitor to Yinxing, Fang Zhao didn't know much else, but he was certain that the energy mineral deposits of Yinxing were extremely rich and abundant—the drool of his curly-haired dog just couldn't stop.  Upon exiting the aircraft, they could see a huge protective shield enveloping the area above. Without protection suits, they could only move indoors, but it didn't feel narrow or crowded.  "This is the accommodation arranged for the teachers..." A person wearing the standard uniform of Yinxing introduced to them.  This was a reception center, with dormitories, a cafeteria, and an activity area. They had been informed of some things to note in advance, and they had signed the confidentiality agreement. For the following time, they just needed to follow the arrangements and collaborate with Yinxing's bands and dance troupes for the cultural performance. During their free time, they could move around as allowed.  Regarding accommodation, family members were allowed to stay together, but assistants and bodyguards were arranged in another building.  "Fang Zhao, your dormitory is over there," the guide said.  "Can dogs be brought over?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Yes."  Fang Zhao took his room card to the assigned room. The space inside was not large, but it was fully equipped, with two bedrooms and a living room, as well as a study. The decor had a technological feel and was also infused with some artistic style. In addition, there were dog bowls and a dog toilet. Truly thoughtful.  After settling in briefly, the team leader gathered them for a small meeting to explain the plans for the next few days and the distribution of tasks. Their invited team consisted of musicians, dancers, actors, and painters, among others, with different specializations. After arriving at Yinxing, they would collaborate with different partners.  The people Fang Zhao would be working with were from a youth art troupe of Yinxing. The personnel in these art troupes of Yinxing were mostly amateurs, and they couldn't be held to professional standards.  "Fang Zhao, you will be the conductor of the youth orchestra. Any problems?" the team leader asked.  "No problem," Fang Zhao replied.  The piece chosen by this youth orchestra of Yinxing was a major composition by Molang, the epic series "Genesis" overall ending theme, a ten-minute long piece titled "Legend." On this, Molang insisted that the conductor must be Fang Zhao. This piece was co-created by Fang Zhao, who understood it better than anyone else.  This was also a test Molang gave to Fang Zhao.  After the meeting ended, everyone went back to rest, and in the afternoon, they were arranged to visit the exhibition hall.  Only those invited personnel could visit these exhibitions, and most of the accompanying personnel were not allowed, not even Qiao Ting, who was a family member, let alone bodyguards and assistants. Therefore, Fang Zhao arranged for three people, Nan Feng, to take care of the dog and did not bring them along.  The exhibition hall was mainly about aerospace research products, and it was Fang Zhao's first visit, so he was very interested in these things.  In the exhibition hall, what Fang Zhao was most interested in was the warp engine. The warp engine ushered in the era of space travel and is recognized as the greatest invention of the new century.  The guide in the exhibition hall was introducing information related to the warp engine. "What's placed in front of you is part of the first generation warp engine. It's this engine that made space warp possible. However, the energy needed to maintain the warp engine is far beyond everyone's imagination. The old energy sources could not support the engine's operation, so people sought new energy sources..."  The guide went from the warp engine to the innovation of energy technology and then to ore mining, but he didn't mention the key points. Such as how the warp engine was born, its development process, how long it took to research and develop, how far it could support space travel, and other questions Fang Zhao was particularly curious about; none were mentioned.  However, the people who came along all knew that here, they should listen to what others say and not ask too much. What the guide didn't mention was definitely not allowed to be mentioned, and no matter how much you asked, they wouldn't tell you.  From the discovery of energy minerals, the continuous upgrading of energy conversion technology, to the classification and mining of energy minerals, these stories were just like listening to tales for the other members of the art troupe. Perhaps they would laugh and pass it off, or perhaps they already understood, but Fang Zhao was listening very seriously.  Since the warp engine could not be understood in depth, Fang Zhao still wanted to listen more about energy minerals. The more he knew, the more he was moved in his heart.  It's too fast! The breakthroughs in new energy and aerospace technology in the new century are too rapid, far beyond Fang Zhao's expectations. During the era of the world's destruction, he had repeatedly asked related scientific researchers whether space travel could be realized. The reply he got was, "Perhaps by the day humanity is extinct, there may not be any significant progress."  However, just a hundred years after the end of the era of destruction and the establishment of the new century, the warp engine had already appeared, creating the pioneering "Dream Team" of seven spacecraft for the exploration of space in the new century. This was probably beyond the expectations of anyone who lived through the era of destruction.  A hundred years seems long, but Fang Zhao knew all too well the situation at the end of the era of destruction. In his view, a hundred years might just be used for recovery and rebuilding. The actual development speed of the new century, in Fang Zhao's view, was nothing short of miraculous.  The warp engine appeared within a hundred years of the new century, and now it's been over five hundred years since the new century began; who knows how many generations of warp engines have been developed. Unfortunately, he couldn't see it.  However, it was still very good to see a part of the original warp engine. He felt quite comforted in his heart.  What Fang Zhao felt in his heart, others didn't know. The artists invited here might not be interested in these things, so they didn't stay long in the exhibition hall. After that, there was a small fan meeting, where fans from various departments of Yinxing came to meet their idols.  With signatures, group photos, and many people around, it was not chaotic but very disciplined. The special management environment of Yinxing made this kind of fan meeting more efficient.  The fans who could come had been selected, as too many people wanted to come, so the number had to be controlled.  Fang Zhao's fans included both young and old, especially the elderly who had watched the "Genesis Yanzhou Episode," who looked at Fang Zhao with eyes full of pity.  Not far away, two high-level management personnel who organized the fan meeting walked over, seeing the long queue at Fang Zhao's side, they laughed.  "It's not apparent, but Fang Zhao has quite a few fans here in Yinxing!"  "Our families, old and young alike, like him a lot. This kid is indeed good; it's just a pity he didn't continue to develop in the military."  "Speaking of which, why haven't I seen Xiao Yuan? Wasn't he clamoring to prepare a big gift for Fang Zhao?"  "Right, I looked for him and didn't see him anywhere. Ever since the list of invited personnel was confirmed, Yuan Zheng kept asking me about the invited artists. I gave him the schedule."  "There's only half an hour left for the fan meeting."  "Did he oversleep? Or got too involved in work and forgot about the time? Or maybe there's a sudden mission and he can't get out?"  ——  Yinxing Warp Engine Technology Research Institute.  Inside the security checkpoint at the entrance of the institute, a young man who looked about the same age as a college student was sitting on a chair, tapping his fingers anxiously on the table and constantly looking at the time.  The security personnel of the research institute, sitting opposite him, had an expressionless face as he took out the last checked item from the gift box and placed it properly on the table.  "So, you want to give these..." The security personnel pointed at the items on the table, "a star interstellar voyage fleet, to a celebrity?"  "That's right!"  "But these have not been made public yet. Not to mention the confidential technology involved, at least two of the models will probably not be announced for at least ten years."  "These are just models!"  "Even models are not okay. Please be rational."  Yuan Zheng took a deep breath, "I chase stars, but I am a rational fan. I am different from those brain-dead fans who blindly praise without any bottom line! Please do not belittle my intelligence!"  "I don't doubt the intelligence of a Golden Badge engineer."  The security personnel's face was unchanged, "Wasn't your previous idol the Master of Eternal Stars?"  "My idol is still the Master of Eternal Stars! He is a god in the hearts of everyone in our research institute! One can only look up to him! However, my Brother Zhao is more down-to-earth. Brother Zhao is my idol, and I just think he is exceptionally awesome! What does star chasing chase after? It's the shining things they have! My Brother Zhao, that's a huge shining body! Tell me, which entertainment figure can achieve so many honors at his age?"  The security personnel nodded, indicating understanding. He knew about Fang Zhao; his cross-field influence was so strong, not to mention Fang Zhao also carried military honors. It was rare for someone in their twenties to be invited here to perform.  Seeing that the other party's expression had softened, Yuan Zheng continued, "Have you heard a saying? 'The goal is in front, the idol is by your side.' It's a kind of spiritual motivation, understand? Progressing together, understand! I even have a poster of Brother Zhao in my room!"  The security personnel nodded again, indicating understanding. He had heard that when Fang Zhao won the Galaxy Award's Star Prize, Yuan Zheng had put in a lot of effort to be promoted from a Silver Badge engineer to a Golden Badge.  Of course, it's understandable for young people to chase stars impulsively. He also admired a basketball star from Mazhou when he was young, but that basketball star didn't pass the review and couldn't come here. Those who are invited to come here must have gone through layers of review. Not only their professional abilities but also their character and personality must be examined.  In comparison, Yuan Zheng was lucky; at least he could see his idol in person. However, Fang Zhao, even though he had strong abilities, was still too young and might not be able to keep secrets. Unreleased model types should not be given away.  Seeing the other person's face becoming stern again, Yuan Zheng quickly played the emotional card. "Uncle, you've seen me grow up. You know what kind of person I am. When facing my idol, of course, I want to show off my achievements. Uncle, you've also chased stars before; you can understand, right? I've made models of some of the models involved in the projects I've participated in. Some key parts have been blurred. There's absolutely no intention of leaking secrets!"  "Of course, I believe you," the security personnel's demeanor softened, however, "Second application, denied."  "Uncle..." Yuan Zheng looked pitiful.  "All models are confiscated. I'm sorry, duty calls."  Yuan Zheng's eyes were almost filled with tears. The space fleet models he had prepared for so long were stopped at the security checkpoint!!  Seeing Yuan Zheng sitting there dejected and devastated, the security personnel sighed, "How about this."  Yuan Zheng looked up at him with hopeful eyes.  He saw the security personnel pick up one of the spaceship models... and dismantled a small part of the engine... and placed it in front of him.  Yuan Zheng sat there dumbfounded, holding his breath.  Then he said with a collapsed face, "My Brother Zhao finally came to perform, and I'm giving him... a part?"  The security personnel said expressionlessly, "This is the bottom line. Kid, be rational when chasing stars." Chapter 467: Second-Generation Fold Engineer  When Yuan Zheng arrived at the venue for the meet-and-greet, it had already ended, and the artists had left on their return vehicles. With no other choice, Yuan Zheng had to make a detour to seek them out. It was not easy to have the chance to meet his idol; he couldn't miss the opportunity.  For the artists invited to Hidden Star, the first day was quite busy, with the older ones already showing signs of exhaustion and fatigue. After returning from the meet-and-greet venue, Fang Zhao took over the care of Curly Hair.  "Boss, is Curly Hair not used to the environmental conditions here? Why do I see it drooling and panting all the time?" Nan Feng was worried.  "It'll adjust in a couple of days," Fang Zhao said.  Nan Feng thought for a moment, "That's true, it takes time to get used to the environmental conditions here on Hidden Star. Even Left Yu, Yan Biao, and I felt a bit dizzy when we first arrived."  Nan Feng handed over the newly received dog food and pet supplies to Fang Zhao, "The reception gave these, and said to collect more when they are used up."  Seeing that the other artists were all tired and preparing to rest, Nan Feng didn't say more, "Then boss, you go back and adjust yourself. If there's anything, just communicate with us, we'll handle it, ready at any time!"  "Okay, you guys also go and rest."  Fang Zhao took Curly Hair back to his room and poured a bowl of dog food for it. Curly Hair ate reluctantly, cherishing each piece. After finishing the bowl, it would have to wait another four or five hours for the next meal.  After arriving on Hidden Star, it could no longer do whatever it wanted. Apart from dog food, it couldn't eat anything else, and it couldn't eat too much.  "You need to learn to control yourself," Fang Zhao said. "If you behave well, you can watch TV. The television broadcasts here are synchronized with the rest."  Curly Hair gulped down the dog food in the bowl and pushed the clean bowl towards Fang Zhao, meaning—Look, I didn't even eat the bowl, am I behaving well?  "Alright, go watch TV yourself."  As soon as Fang Zhao finished speaking, Curly Hair ran to turn on the TV in the room, switched to the current affairs news channel, and sat down with a serious dog expression.  After a while, Fang Zhao went to the study.  Curly Hair peeked inside and saw Fang Zhao buried in work. It quietly changed the TV channel to the gaming competition channel and watched a live broadcast, engrossed.  Inside the study, Fang Zhao sighed silently. He was aware of Curly Hair's little antics but pretended not to notice. It was good to have something to distract it, so it wouldn't keep drooling around.  Sorting through the musical scores, Fang Zhao continued to modify the plan. For the upcoming performance, he had to rework "The Legend" to give it new vitality. The reworked score had already been reviewed and approved by Moron.  When it came to understanding the work and the will of the composer, Moron only trusted Fang Zhao.  So, Fang Zhao had a lot to do. Next, he needed to communicate with the orchestra members, supervise their rehearsals, point out flaws in the process, and provide solutions.  Just as he was organizing the plan, the doorbell rang.  Fang Zhao hadn't put up a 'Do Not Disturb' sign at the door and wasn't sure who would come to find him at this time since the other artists had gone to rest.  Opening the door, Fang Zhao saw a young man and two soldiers standing outside.  Scanning the young man's golden badge, Fang Zhao was surprised. Although new to Hidden Star, he already knew what the badge represented; the two soldiers were likely responsible for the young man's safety. People with golden badges usually had security when they went out.  However, to reach the golden badge level at such a young age, he must be an extremely important talent; it was natural for him to be protected.  When the young man saw Fang Zhao, he was excited and somewhat restrained.  "Zhao-zhao-zhao-zhao-ge, hello! My name is Yuan Zheng! I'm your die-hard fan!!" His words were forceful and loud, especially the last three.  The two soldiers behind him: "......"  Wasn't he supposed to be a rational fan before coming?  Too nervous and said it wrong?  However, Yuan Zheng didn't realize he had said anything wrong, nor did he remember what he had just said. At the moment, his mind was filled with excitement at seeing his idol.  "Zhao-ge, am I disturbing you?" Yuan Zheng scratched his head awkwardly.  "No, come in," Fang Zhao said with a smile.  "Ah! Thank you, Zhao-ge!"  When Yuan Zheng entered the house, the two soldiers followed. Yuan Zheng quickly explained, "Zhao-ge, these two are for my safety. According to the regulations, we golden badge engineers need to have at least two soldiers accompany us for protection."  "That's appropriate."  Fang Zhao also poured two cups of water for the soldiers and then turned to Yuan Zheng.  In front of his idol, Yuan Zheng tried to show his excellence. Before coming to Fang Zhao's place, he had worn all the medals he had received and polished his small golden badge, symbolizing the level of a Hidden Star engineer, not wanting to embarrass his idol.  "I was born on Hidden Star, and I am currently a golden badge engineer at the Fold Engine Research Institute. My parents are also fold engine engineers; I am the second generation in our family. Zhao-ge, you can also call us 'fold-second-generation'! I have participated in many important projects..."  "Cough!"  Yuan Zheng had just started speaking when one of the soldiers next to him coughed softly, reminding him there were some things he couldn't say.  Interrupted, Yuan Zheng paused, skipped the part about "important projects," and continued, "Anyway, I'm very awesome! In terms of talent, I am the first... second in our institute, except for little Bear who came not long ago, I am the youngest golden badge engineer in our institute!"  As he said this, Yuan Zheng was a bit upset. He used to be the number one talent in the institute, but ever since that kid surnamed Bear arrived, he had been bumped from the first place.  "I even prepared a big gift for you knowing you were coming! I made a fleet model with my own hands! Unfortunately, after passing the security check, only one part was left... I couldn't make it to the meet-and-greet this afternoon."  The more he spoke, the lower Yuan Zheng's voice became, and he put on an awkward and bitter smile, handing over a piece the size of a fingernail.  A fleet model went through a security check and only one small part remained. Yuan Zheng had no choice; this was the limit set by the security officers. Even he, a genius golden badge engineer, could not make an exception.  Yuan Zheng had no other suitable gifts on hand, and due to the rush, he was not fully prepared, so he had to give away the part.  "Zhao-ge, you'll be staying on Hidden Star for a while, I'll go back and make a gift that can pass the security check!"  "This is already very good," Fang Zhao said, taking the seemingly insignificant small part. "This is part of the fold engine from the model, isn't it?"  "Right!" Yuan Zheng wanted to say more, but the soldier next to him coughed softly again, and he held back.  Yuan Zheng felt aggrieved.  It's so hard! Being a golden badge engineer and a fan is too difficult! He couldn't talk about this or mention that, and even the prepared gifts couldn't be given away, making it embarrassing to even speak in front of his idol!  Scratching his head over how to explain, Yuan Zheng looked up and saw Fang Zhao looking at him. A smile, kind.  Confused by Fang Zhao's gaze, Yuan Zheng saw Fang Zhao hand over a palm-sized box. Inside was a model of a Sea Emperor dragon skeleton.  "For me?" Yuan Zheng stammered with excitement.  Fang Zhao nodded.  Yuan Zheng extended his hands solemnly to receive it, holding it as if he were receiving a sacred decree.  "Zhao-ge, could you... sign your name on the base of the model?"  "Sure."  Fang Zhao found a suitable pen and signed his name on the base of the Sea Emperor dragon skeleton model.  Not wanting to disturb Fang Zhao's rest, Yuan Zheng didn't stay long and soon left. Even as he walked out the door, Yuan Zheng held the box containing the Sea Emperor dragon skeleton model tightly in his arms.  Walking further away, Yuan Zheng's eyes were red. "I'm so moved! I only gave away a broken part, and I received a gift from Zhao-ge!"  However, the two soldiers following him couldn't share his sentiment, "According to the rules, any external gifts you receive must go through a security check. Please cooperate."  Although the luggage brought by the invited artists had gone through rigorous security checks, Yuan Zheng's received gift still had to be checked again. This was also for his safety.  Yuan Zheng reluctantly handed over the model box, "Be careful, don't break the bones, especially the base, don't rub off the signature!"  When Yuan Zheng returned to the research institute, Fang Zhao didn't continue his previous work but looked at the small gift he had just received. Although Yuan Zheng had revealed little information, Fang Zhao could still make some guesses.  Combining it with previous questions in his mind, he had a hypothesis. He also remembered what Barbara had said when they first discovered the Yao Guang—the "Dream Team" of the elder-level exploration team carried the pinnacle of intelligence from that era.  "The pinnacle of intelligence from that era..."  Fang Zhao looked at the small part in his hand and murmured. The "Dream Team's" Yao Guang was a ship that existed four hundred years ago.  Yuan Zheng had also mentioned "Little Bear," which was very likely the seemingly ordinary child with a mechanical core that he had met before, the one who had been on the Yao Guang. Capable of perfectly disguising oneself among people, that was no ordinary artificial intelligence.  During the era of the Catastrophe, Fang Zhao had also come into contact with many great scientists of that time, and he knew that with every flash of human intelligence, the world's development would leap forward.  But artificial intelligence, energy technology, space folding, spaceships, and so on, all these fields undergoing multiple flashes of intelligence and stacking up in just a hundred years since the establishment of the new century, how likely is that?  This period also required the world to recover from a devastating disaster, city planning to be rebuilt, and the new order of the Twelve Continents to be formed.  "Is it a burst of intelligence, or..."  Fang Zhao's gaze stayed on the small part in his hand, as if through this tiny piece, he was looking at a much more distant scene.  There was another possibility.  "Outsider."  Star visitor. Chapter 468: I'm Still a Baby  It's impossible for Fang Zhao to confirm the truth right now. However, from what he has understood, if there were outsiders, the most likely "aliens" would be the legendary creator of the warp engine and the founder of the Poly-Universal Foundation, the "Master of Stars," who brought many changes and established the special status of the Foundation.  No one knows the purpose of the "outsiders," or how many there are, but at least for now, they seem to have no hostility and have even nurtured many top talents. But these are all just speculations.  Fang Zhao is reminded of the shock he felt when he "resurrected" in a small rented room in the black street and saw this new world. Looking at the unremarkable small component in his hand, Fang Zhao smiles and puts it into a box.  "The future has arrived." —— Hidden Star Warp Engine Technology Research Institute.  Inside the security checkpoint. The same security officer, different visitors to be checked.  A child with a golden badge is lying on the table, crying loudly. "Wahhh—You can't confiscate my 'Little Fortune'! My 'Little Fortune' wahhh!" The sobs were full of ups and downs.  The red-rimmed eyes and trembling lips, occasionally hiccuping, gave the security officer sitting across the table a sense of guilt.  The normally expressionless face of the security officer showed a rare sign of distress. He had no idea that the child would burst into tears at the drop of a hat. Headache-inducing.  The security officer softened his voice: "That black ball... that thing, your 'Little Fortune,' is still under inspection."  Speaking to this child, a more talented engineer than Yuan Zheng, he was worried that raising his voice might scare him. However, as soon as he finished speaking, the child burst into tears again.  "It's already been fifteen minutes and seven seconds! Why is security so slow! Has something happened to my 'Little Fortune'?" The child wailed without lifting his head from the table, tears flowing even more intensely.  The security officer glanced at the time displayed on the wall monitor, thinking to himself: As expected from a golden-badge engineer, he doesn’t even need to look at the time to be so precise to the second. But the situation is complicated, and security naturally takes longer.  Yuan Zheng's fleet model took even longer before. It's only been fifteen minutes.  After nearly five more minutes, the black small sphere was brought over. Seeing the approval mark on it, the security officer handed it over quickly, pinching it as he did. It felt good to the touch, suitable for stress relief, no wonder the child liked it.  After "Little Bear" got 'Little Fortune' back, he said, "I also want my 'Egg' and 'Leftover'! What rules did they break! Without them, I'll feel lonely and scared!"  "Those are dangerous items; you can't take them out without permission. As for your safety, don't worry, we will assign someone to protect you," the security officer said.  "I want them! My 'Egg' and 'Leftover' wahhh—poor things wahhh—" While crying, he took out a bottle of water from his backpack, gulped it down, and continued crying after finishing it.  The security officer continued to feel the headache; they had already asked the superiors how to deal with the two mechanical dogs. They indeed belonged to Little Bear's personal possessions, but were also equipped with weapons and needed to be handled with caution.  While anxiously waiting, the security officer rummaged through a drawer and handed over a lollipop. "Here, have some candy, stop crying."  Little Bear, still sobbing, put the lollipop in his pocket and then continued to sob.  The security officer: "......" My head hurts.  Amidst Little Bear's sobbing, they finally received the approval.  The security officer let out a sigh of relief and pulled a smile he considered friendly.  "Alright, it's approved. You can take your 'Little Fortune,' 'Egg,' and 'Leftover' and leave, but remember to follow the rules when playing outside."  "Okay!" The crying stopped, and Little Bear leaped off the chair, holding two mechanical dogs in one hand and the black sphere in the other, happily leaving.  The security officer: "......" That was a quick change of face.  What an actor! Are kids nowadays all this impressive?!  The security officer felt like he learned something from today's events.  The already departed Little Bear was very proud. Pretending to be a child is great! Being young means you can be willful! At the institute, people are very tolerant towards genius children. Now, with the institute developing a new generation of warp engines, Little Bear's contributions are significant. Compared to that, his occasional tantrums are trivial, so everyone indulges him.  However, speaking of the warp engine development, Little Bear is dissatisfied. He has been driving the Yao Guang for four hundred years, and there's only been so little progress. It's too slow!  Back then, seven super-intelligences plus the Master of Stars were developing at such a fast pace! Engines were updated quickly, their efficiency was superb, and current spaceship pilots can't even keep up!  It's just a pity that, after four hundred years, the other six super-intelligences either rebelled and were destroyed or malfunctioned and went into hibernation. Now, he's the only one left who can get things done.  Alas, the seven super-intelligences that accompanied the Master of Stars! Now, only he remains.  It's really... exciting!!  Hahaha, no one can bully me now!  I'm the biggest now! Those six above me finally rolled away!!  Who needs peers? Humans are so much more fun!  Especially these ones here, weak and non-threatening.  I just like playing with these emotionally rich species!  Whenever I get bored, I can just create a few playmates for myself.  Little Bear is very satisfied with his life now. Since returning from the Yao Guang, his days have been carefree.  ...Just one thing isn't good.  Why do I have to work! I'm still a baby!  I was a baby four hundred years ago, and I'm still a baby even after four hundred years!  The world is so beautiful, and I haven't had enough fun yet!  If it weren't for paying off debts, who would want to come here?!  My movements are restricted, and I have to go through security checks when I go out to have fun. I almost got 'Little Fortune' confiscated!  And I have to be followed when I go out.  Little Bear glanced at the two soldiers following behind him and pouted unhappily.  Pouting is something he learned from a child star on TV, supposedly making him look cuter and more likable.  However, Little Bear only pouts in front of outsiders. If he deliberately acted cute in front of the big devil Cuihua, he would be punished.  Although the Master of Stars is dead, his descendants still have ways to restrain him, like Cuihua.  In Little Bear's eyes, Cuihua is a big devil, a demon who always makes people work overtime!!  It was just borrowing some money to buy music rights, was it necessary to throw him into this place full of workaholics?!  Fortunately, he's good at pretending to be a child.  Little Bear continued to feel proud. He liked how these weak humans treated him with the attitude they reserve for minors, saving him a lot of trouble.  Apart from the high levels of Hidden Stars and some core managers of Poly-Universal Foundation, no one here knows his real age.  Heeheehee~~~  Thinking about this, Little Bear cheered up again.  Let's just work overtime, as long as there's fun to be had!  Little Bear was planning excuses to take leave in the future to go out and have fun, leading a dog with the air of a young ruffian on patrol towards the reception area.  He was going to find Fang Zhao to play.  He had heard someone mention Fang Zhao in the institute, and the artists invited to the Hidden Stars Art and Literature Gala had already arrived today.  Fang Zhao knew his secrets and was easy-going, so Little Bear was happy to interact with Fang Zhao more.  At least with Fang Zhao, he could act cute as he pleased without worrying about being hit by Fang Zhao.  Last time, when he said he cried watching "Genesis," Fang Zhao even reminded him to drink more water.  What a nice person!  The reception manager recognized Little Bear, who had a high recognition rate, a kid with a golden badge leading two mechanical dogs. There's only one like that in the entire Hidden Stars.  Moreover, Little Bear stayed there for two days when he first came to Hidden Stars, so everyone had a deep impression.  However, due to Little Bear's status as a golden-badge engineer, people usually didn't call him "Little Bear" or "Master Bear," "Teacher Bear," "Master Bear," but jokingly referred to him as "Young Master Bear."  For such advanced technical talents, everyone is always tolerant.  After all, he's still a child!  Seeing Little Bear coming over and saying he was looking for Fang Zhao, the reception staff personally took him upstairs to find him.  As they entered the elevator, Little Bear took out a lollipop from his pocket and gave it to the building manager.  Bribery is not accepted, but a lollipop is a gesture of goodwill, especially from a child, so the building manager did not refuse. He took the lollipop, thanked him, and showed a kind smile. He wanted to pat Little Bear's head, but seeing the golden badge, he withdrew his hand.  The head of a golden-badge engineer is not something you can just touch.  This is respect for high-level talents!  Fang Zhao's room.  Curly, who was watching the game channel and the esports arena live broadcast, moved his ears, licked his nose, and reluctantly shifted his gaze from the TV screen to look at the door, then walked over drooling and lay down next to it, his clear dog eyes fixated on the door.  Fang Zhao, who was editing sheet music, also looked at the closed door.  On the other side of the door.  Little Bear approached step by step, but the closer he got to the door, the smaller his steps became and the slower he moved.  The previously rosy complexion turned pale, and sweat beaded on his forehead.  He stopped in his tracks.  He had been too pleased with himself just now and overlooked something important.  Now, he remembered.  In Little Bear's hands, the slightly relaxed 'Little Fortune' once again became a perfect circle.  Seeing Little Bear suddenly stop, the building manager said, "Fang Zhao's room is right ahead, less than five meters away."  "No, I think now is not a good time. It's better not to disturb him," said Little Bear, shaking his head vigorously, not taking another step forward.  Noticing Little Bear's pale face and profuse sweating, the building manager panicked. This kind of genius cannot have anything happen to him!  "Are you feeling unwell? I'll take you to the medical room downstairs!" The building manager said and was about to contact the medical staff.  "No, no, no, I just remembered something important. I have to go! Bye!!"  "Evil Young Master" with the dogs, turned, and slipped away.  Running out of the reception area in one go, Little Bear wiped his sweat, swiped his employee card at the water dispenser for a bottle of water, and gulped down the entire bottle. He was severely dehydrated today and needed to rehydrate.  Looking at 'Egg' and 'Leftover,' who seemed unaware of the recent crisis, Little Bear regretted it: "I can't believe I spent all my salary on you two intelligent crutches!" 
Chapter 455: Reversal 3  "This is to let you experience the fluctuation of aura; it's really very simple," another sorcerer nearby couldn't help but laugh and interject.  "Then please," Lin Sheng nodded.  He needed to find the other fragments at the fastest speed. Originally, he was planning to conquer more evil spirits and obtain more pure soul power.  However, now that he has encountered such an opportunity, the fastest way to get it in hand is the best approach.  Soon, the sorcerer elder led Lin Sheng to stand in front of a gate of evil spirits.  The two stretched out their hands and gently touched the frame of the gate of evil spirits, closing their eyes.  The sorcerer elder quickly used his special abilities to start building a spatial baseplate as a coordinate confirmation.  Then, following the ritual fluctuations of the gate of evil spirits, he carried Lin Sheng's perceptive consciousness and emitted it together with the ritual fluctuations.  "Ordinary teleportation gate rituals are point-to-point directional teleportations."  "But when we generally explore other space secrets, we change this point-to-point into point-to-many. This only requires a little modification of some small parameters on the teleportation baseplate."  The sorcerer elder led Lin Sheng's consciousness while teaching him the relevant techniques.  "In this way, the gate of evil spirits will spontaneously transmit our consciousness to the possible places of many similar target spaces. This is actually using energy to take a chance; with good luck, we can immediately hit the space secret we want, but with bad luck, we have to waste energy and try a few more times."  "That's quite random," Lin Sheng was speechless.  Once his perception entered the gate of evil spirits, it was immediately scattered and emitted by the ritual fluctuations within.  At the same time, it was as if his consciousness had split, dividing the perceptive consciousness into more than ten parts, simultaneously sensing more than ten completely different space auras.  "Generally speaking, it's very difficult for our consciousness to maintain integrity during the transmission process, so we can only try to remember the space coordinates that the main consciousness has come into contact with. The memory of the coordinates requires us to leave a simple marker..."  The sorcerer elder outside was still explaining in a low voice, guiding Lin Sheng and teaching him how to make a simple marker to determine the coordinate code.  But he had no idea that Lin Sheng's soul consciousness was so strong and resilient that after being split, he could remember the coordinates of all the spaces his more than ten consciousnesses had touched.  It was just a matter of multitasking with more than ten focuses. For Lin Sheng who could multitask with N focuses in his soul consciousness, this was nothing. He practiced the skill of multitasking with dozens of focuses every day.  He could control and observe each summoned creature through the divided soul consciousness.  So now, although he could not control many summoned creatures to act independently at the same time, he could easily remember the fluctuations of aura and establish coordinates separately.  Moreover, his soul was more resilient than ordinary people and had existed for a longer time.  This was still very easy for him.  Ten minutes later. The consciousness was exhausted and dissipated.  Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked towards the sorcerer elder and the others.  "Set the coordinates for this space secret," he immediately said one of the special space secret coordinates under the astonished gaze of the sorcerer elder and others.  This space secret, which had the same origin as the fragment of the Yin to Evil Wheel in his arms, was exactly what Lin Sheng had perceived.  "Was it a success in one go?" The sorcerer elder felt a bit bitter in his heart. When he first sensed the aura of space, confirmed the coordinates, and recorded them, it took him a full half a month to succeed.  "It's a simple operation. Start it, establish the teleportation gate. I want to go over," Lin Sheng instructed.  "Yes."  "Wait, my body," the soul transmission of Tian Gongxia made Lin Sheng's actions pause.  "What is it?" he watched the sorcerer elder and others start to instruct the evil spirits to move the material resources over, walking aside to wait, and meanwhile communicating with Tian Gongxia in his mind.  "There's a situation here. A big change has occurred on Bisha Island!" Tian Gongxia's tone was somewhat solemn.  This was a sign Lin Sheng had never seen before.  It should be noted that even when he told Tian Gongxia about the existence of the King of Night, he had never seen her so serious.  This gave him a sense of unusual tension.  "Miyue should be at an absolute disadvantage, right?" Lin Sheng frowned and asked.  "Or has new combat power joined?"  "No, it's not new combat power," Tian Gongxia said seriously.  "Miyue deceived everyone! Qiluo Tower has already been successfully summoned. He has already succeeded in summoning Farudo! Using himself as a sacrifice, he has merged with it!"  Lin Sheng's consciousness froze for a moment.  "Using himself as a sacrifice?... This madman!"  "So, what we're facing now in the three great secret realms is the merged monster of Miyue and Farudo..."  Lin Sheng was at a loss for words.  "What should we do now?" Tian Gongxia asked gravely.  The combination of Farudo and Miyue was not as simple as one plus one equals two but rather a result of three times ten.  "Don't be agitated. For Miyue and Farudo, the biggest enemies are still the three great secret realms and many other major forces. Plus, this world is not as simple as you think," Lin Sheng recalled the information he had investigated before.  "The Big Star Pool and those with the divine artifacts of fate are all not simple characters. As long as they don't provoke us, we can't be bothered with how they develop."  "I understand what you mean. But it's best to prepare early," Tian Gongxia reminded.  "I've had that level of destructive power before. It was during the period when I was controlled by the demonic sword. So I know very well what kind of outcome that level of power can lead to."  Lin Sheng was silent.  Among all his lieutenants, Tian Gongxia was the most special one.  Because Tian Gongxia had once been influenced and controlled by some peculiarly powerful existence.  At that time, even in her memory recall, she had noticed Lin Sheng's peering.  Just a mark of an image in memory could discover Lin Sheng who was peering into the memory.  Such power had already exceeded Lin Sheng's understanding.  "I understand," Lin Sheng replied again.  "I will be prepared. Don't worry."  At worst, he would activate the strongest special state, summon all the lieutenants' power, and merge it into himself.  After disconnecting from Tian Gongxia, Lin Sheng quietly stared at the newly constructed evil spirit gate.  His thoughts returned to the original plan.  "It's ready. Your Excellency," the sorcerer elder said in a low voice.  Lin Sheng stared at the teleportation gate, silent for a moment.  "Call the Fairy King over. Also, Degaal!"  "Here."  Degaal's magic hand had already arrived nearby and was waiting.  Hearing the summon, he immediately walked in from the doorway.  "Your Excellency, I am at your command," Degaal's magic hand said.  Lin Sheng nodded.  "I will open multiple teleportation gates at the same time to explore multiple evil spirit spaces."  "Select one hundred great evil spirits, divide them into different numbered teams, and explore separately."  "Understood!" Degaal's magic hand felt solemn, knowing that perhaps his Excellency had encountered some turning point.  Otherwise, he wouldn't suddenly undertake such an urgent large-scale exploration. Chapter 456: Moving Forward  1. Following Lin Sheng's instructions, they set out to explore the various secret worlds. After receiving the order, Degar's Demon Hand quickly went down to dispatch the troops. On the other side, the sorcerers also sent a message to the Fairy King, starting to gather forces.  Soon, the Fairy King, accompanied by several elite messengers, stepped out from one of the Gates of Evil Spirits. "Your Excellency, what are your commands?" Standing in front of Lin Sheng, this being with a perfect figure yet only one eye on her face bowed.  "I need the Fairy Empire to send a slave army to explore the new spatial secret realms. Arrange the exploration however you see fit; I only want the results." Lin Sheng knew he couldn't be as rough with the Fairy Empire as he could with the Evil Spirit race. The Fairy Empire had largely become a race that was a combination of fairies and humans. Their emotions and bonds were deeper. Giving them the task and asking only for results was the best approach. Let them accomplish the objective in their own way.  "Your subordinate obeys," the Fairy King said calmly. Compared to Degar's side, she undoubtedly had more methods to explore the new spaces with minimal damage.  After instructing the Fairy King and Degar's Demon Hand, Lin Sheng quickly sensed the new spatial secret realms, continuously searching for spaces that might contain fragments of a certain essence. Sensing, determining coordinates, then opening, establishing portals, and dispatching troops to explore.  One portal after another was opened in the square. Time slowly passed. Massive armies of Evil Spirits and the Fairy Empire's troops set out. They were first teleported here and then flowed toward other secret realms.  A vast amount of teleportation resources were consumed, and various materials were used as consumables. Following this, an incessant stream of over ten thousand Evil Spirits and Fairy Empire troops set out into the various opened portals.  Several days later. Some of these portals were canceled because Lin Sheng determined they were worthless during the exploration. Others were kept due to their richness in resources or research value, among other reasons.  Lin Sheng found three realms that definitely contained the essence of the fragments. He sent a large number of troops to these three realms for a detailed exploration and investigation. The feedback from the troops indicated that the spaces on the other side were relatively vast and complete, with intelligent life activities.  After some thought, Lin Sheng decided that he couldn't trust his subordinates to find such divine-level treasures. If they found them and kept them for themselves, that would be a real loss. So after a moment of deliberation, he decided to first let his people investigate the information and environment of those spaces, and then he would personally enter. He aimed to quickly find the fragments and leave with them once he obtained them.  ..............................  ..............................  Bisaga Island.  "Soul Gaze." Millie, or rather Farudo, raised his head as numerous dense gray tentacles grew from his back, forming a giant human face. The face was covered with hundreds of red eyes. The eyes fixated on several fleeing Lieutenants.  Hum! An invisible fluctuation followed a mysterious channel, instantly crossing thousands of meters, and precisely landed on the bodies of the fleeing Lieutenants.  "No!!!" One of them screamed in terror as layers of protection around him popped like soap bubbles. Once the protections were gone, his body twisted and deformed rapidly under the effect of a mysterious force field.  Boom! In an instant, this family head from Oro Hell's Flames twisted like a pretzel, and with a crackling sound, his body was severed into pieces and scattered, falling into the sea. Seeing this, the others fled even faster without a word. They were beyond the point where they could overcome this by sheer numbers. No matter how many more came, it would just be delivering themselves to their deaths.  Farudo had reached a higher realm than the Lieutenants. Without power on the same level, they would be marching to their deaths by facing him.  "Black Hand." Farudo opened his mouth, and a pitch-black shadowy arm extended from it, reaching towards the escaping individuals.  Plop, plop! Two Lieutenants, like lambs to the slaughter, burst into a spray of blood with light sounds and fell into the sea below.  On Bisaga Island, blood and chunks of flesh were scattered everywhere. The last burst of power from the dying Lieutenants had left the island in utter ruin. The ground of the entire island had been blown away layer by layer, and its altitude had dropped by more than ten meters.  Farudo stepped on the white flag of the Heaven's Tower on the ground, glancing at the strongest of the Heaven's Tower, the golden-armored white-winged man, and the red angel, who had been turned into mummies by his absorption of their life force.  "What a pity. In the end, I am the winner," he said, with a mysterious smile on his almost-rotted face.  "Do you think... you've... won?" From a protruding rock formation in the distance, an old man nailed to it, covered in blood, spoke with a heavy voice.  "You're not dead yet?" Farudo raised an eyebrow, looking at the old man. "Xi Ji, if you hadn't meddled in this mess, you wouldn't have ended up like this."  He had merged with Millie's memories, and in fact, he was now a human amalgamation of Millie and Farudo. Naturally, he retained Millie's personality and emotions. In reality, he wasn't the complete Farudo, but rather a spokesperson.  "Heh... I lost this time... but this world is not as simple as you think. Just wait, someone will avenge me. Just wait..."  The old man spoke coldly. "I'm looking forward to it," Farudo said as he reached out his hand. At the same time, a giant grey arm automatically condensed behind him, grabbed the old man fiercely, and squeezed.  Pop! A burst of blood spattered from the grey palm. "It's such a pity. One less old friend..." Farudo looked up with a sigh, feigning lament.  Around him, not a single intact body of the Lieutenants from Oro Hell's Flames remained.  While he was pretending to lament, an invisible, silent silver spike shot out from behind him, aimed directly at the back of his head. The one holding the spike was the strongest of the Blank Paper, Solar Crowned Kesha. His face was pale, evidently, he had been seriously injured in the chaos that had just occurred.  He had successfully hidden himself, but at this moment, the entire surroundings of Bisaga Island were enveloped and suppressed by a powerful red ring force field. Any contact with the edge of the force field would reveal his presence.  With his current strength, at his peak, he could barely withstand a casual blow from Farudo. If he couldn't hide afterward, certain death awaited him. So he had no choice but to return and look for an opportunity.  "Soul Piercer... Just one hit, regardless of injury, can stun a living being's soul for a day," Kesha thought grimly, knowing that if he didn't suppress Farudo quickly, he would have no chance of escaping safely.  Instead of sitting and waiting for death, he chose to strike back!  His Lieutenant ability was to conceal his aura and life fluctuations. This ability allowed him to hide in an invisible interstitial dimension. Only during an attack would his presence be revealed. This was also one of his biggest reliances on being the strongest of the Solar Crown.  The silver spike inched closer to the back of Farudo's head.  Five meters. Three meters. Two meters. One meter.  Suddenly, the spike accelerated, thrusting forward. "Curse Word: Intimidate!" Farudo suddenly uttered.  Shhh! A ring of pure gray shockwaves spread out from his body in all directions. Chapter 457: Moving Forward 2  The ripples carried an extremely strong sense of shock, and almost in an instant, they pushed away the star behind Faraldo.   "Curse Words - Tenacity." "Curse Words - Spirit Binding." "Curse Words - Suffocation." "High Order Killing Intent Shackles." "High Order Death Gaze." "Ultimate Enhanced Extreme Flame Demon Blade."  As Faraldo unleashed a series of magical words, dense and numerous colorful spiritual lights burst and flashed upon him.  At the same time, a series of oddly shaped magical word effects exploded upon the star.   Bindings, soul suppression, death gaze, ultra-high-temperature flame damage, air deprivation, mental intimidation, and so on.  A series of high-level demonic powers, which normally would require at least a day to prepare, were as simple as ordinary tricks in Faraldo's hands, easily cast through spoken words.  By the time the star regained his senses, he could only resist and neutralize two of the magical word effects, and there was no way to deal with the rest.  Layers of magical word effects perfectly bound and wrapped him up, turning him into an immobile gray-black giant rice dumpling.  Pfft!  Without any nonsense, Faraldo stretched out his right hand and pierced through the star's brow.   His hand, like a sharp knife, easily entered the star's skull, shattering and mashing his brain.  Boom!!  The moment the star died, as a ranked envoy, the huge energy aggregated in his body suddenly exploded, turning into a fiery light and suddenly enveloping Faraldo within.  The red flames quickly dissipated, revealing an unharmed Faraldo.  He looked up and gazed into the distance at the numerous warships that were rapidly turning to flee.  "Next, as long as I open three different underworld passages, my true body can completely descend here. At the same time, the hand of the netherworld can also be resurrected ahead of time."  "...Struggle, let me feel more surprises... Otherwise, it would be too dull for having been bored for so many years, wouldn't it?"  With a step forward, Faraldo softly recited a magical word.  "Curse Words - Swift Movement."  Whoosh!  His body instantly turned into a gray light, shooting out like a meteor, charging towards the warships.  ................ ................  Unknown secret world.  On the vast white snowy plains, tens of thousands of evil spirit armies were crazily battling against the opposing centaur army.  The blood of the centaurs dyed the originally pure white snow.  The evil spirits' natural immunity to physical attacks meant they could only be harmed by a small number of energy weapons.  Only one-third of the centaur army had such energy weapons.  And this was already the peak power of this secret world.  Lin Sheng rode a demon-like colossal warhorse, Blood Demon. Clad in heavy pure white armor, he stood silently on a hill, overlooking the battlefield below.  His face was covered by a mask, his expression unclear, but his eyes revealed a trace of indifference and coldness.  "Have you found what I was looking for?" he suddenly asked in a deep voice.  "It's found. The tailbone chieftain had it secretly hung on the ankle of his second son, which I discovered and immediately took down."  The Fairy King's figure suddenly appeared, kneeling on one knee to Lin Sheng's right.  In her hands, she held up a platinum-colored bone that looked like a ghost face or a symbolic text.  The palm-sized, curved bone had fine cracks on the surface, as if it had suffered significant damage.  Lin Sheng grabbed it, closing his eyes to feel the heartbeat-like pulsation on it.  "This is it."  He clenched the bone, then cast a final glance at the centaur tribe fighting desperately below.  The Misher tribe, a powerful force that once dominated this secret world, was brutally suppressed by the evil spirit army simply for refusing to give up what he wanted.  "Let them submit and surrender, those who are unwilling, deal with them," Lin Sheng left these words behind and rode away.  The remaining leaders of the Fairy Empire knelt on one knee, respectfully seeing him off.  In just four days.  Lin Sheng had continuously flattened eleven different secret spaces.  These spaces varied in size, with the largest being as big as a province in Miga, while the smallest was only as large as the city of Hengruika.  However, the number of powerful beings hidden within them was not small.  The most resistant among them was the centaur tribe that ruled over the human-horse secret space.  The white snowy plains were all under the dominion of this powerful tribe.  They had been invincible for too long, having forgotten how to treat those stronger than themselves, completely lacking the respect they should have.  Thus, when Lin Sheng's envoys arrived here, contradictions and conflicts began to unfold.  After Lin Sheng's envoys were mercilessly beheaded.  Under Lin Sheng's command, the evil spirit armies gathered and surged into this white snowy plains secret space.  The arrogant Misher tribe finally tasted the bitter fruit of defeat.  And the price was nearly the annihilation of their tribe.  Two days later, the strongest of the Misher tribe, Centaur King Kul · Warlance, visited the evil spirit palace with sorrow and pain to meet Lin Sheng, who sat upon the throne.  His tribe had been slaughtered, with only the last branch of bloodline remaining.  Under such circumstances, he, who was originally most passionate about cultivation and battle, had to take on a heavy responsibility at the moment of crisis, become the new king, and join Lin Sheng's ranks in exchange for clemency for the centaur race.  Like the Fairy King, in order to protect the last bloodline and heritage of his race, he had to seek compromise and join Lin Sheng's ranks, becoming one of his minions.  From then on, Lin Sheng's subordinates included the Fairy King, the Centaur King, and the Dejarl Demon Hand, three great legion commanders.  They each represented the powerful forces of three different races.  Both the Fairy King and the Centaur King were truly powerful beings who had reached the level of ranked envoys.  ............ ............  As Lin Sheng was mustering troops and scavenging for the Yin Zhuan Evil Wheel fragments, in reality.  Faraldo also truly committed a huge atrocity that shocked the world.  After crushing and killing most of the ranked envoys, Miyazuki, or rather Faraldo, also caught up with the World United Fleet and personally initiated a terrifying massacre.  And it was not just a simple killing.  Instead, he used a large-scale sinking curse word to freeze and sink eighteen warships, with a total of more than thirty thousand people, near Bishaga Island in the vast ocean.  These frozen soldiers did not die but were physically immobilized, their spirits only able to sink to the bottom of the sea, gradually falling into madness amidst the endless silence and desolation.  Boom!!!  Above the blue sea, a half-formed gray smoke figure appeared behind Faraldo.  The figure raised its right arm and caught a giant long-barreled missile falling from the sky.  The white intercontinental missile continuously emitted huge high-temperature orange flames, exerting an unimaginable force trying to break through the gray figure's hand.  At the same time, a diamond-shaped green crystal was embedded at the top of the missile.  The crystal flickered with a large amount of demonic energy, providing even more terrifying momentum to the missile.  But it was to no avail.  Faraldo's hand tightened.  Squeak.  The more than ten-meter-long white intercontinental missile, like a lump of scrap metal, was twisted and mashed into a lump in his palm.  Various liquids and powders leaked out, scattered over the sea's surface, without any signs of explosion or combustion.  As if some strange force was suppressing the missile's explosion. Chapter 458: Moving Forward 3  Boom boom boom boom boom!!! Amidst the thunderous cannonade, a dense barrage of shells rained down on Phaludo from afar like droplets of water.  "Curse Speech: Reflect." Phaludo pointed with his hand raised.  A huge square gray barrier suddenly emerged in front of him. The surface of the barrier was etched with patterns resembling maggots, with a large lion's head in the center. The ends of all the maggots were connected and fused with the lion's mane.  Boom boom boom boom!! In an instant, all the fel cannonballs hit the barrier and then paused for a moment before being sharply reflected back.  All the cannonballs returned along their original trajectory.  Boom!! Explosions and flashes of fire could be heard in succession from the distant sea, and distant roars of infuriated fel users shouting to abandon ship could be heard.  Phaludo gazed into the distance from where the cannonballs had come.  "The nearest place is Redion. Then let's head to Heaven's Tower first." He smiled, tapped his foot lightly, and suddenly the seawater exploded, forming a huge swirling vortex that rapidly spun.  In the instant the water splashed, Phaludo had already disappeared from his original spot.  .............  .............  Evil Spirit Palace.  Click.  Lin Sheng gently placed the white-gold bone on the black crystal column.  Something miraculous happened. The white-gold bone actually began to change its shape autonomously, fitting tightly onto the black crystal column. The crystal column itself also began to slowly deform, becoming thinner and wider. Its edges gradually evolved into sharp and thin blades.  In less than ten seconds. This originally rough black crystal column had transformed into a wide-blade, black greatsword over two meters long. The hilt of the greatsword was made from the transmuted white-gold bone, and the blade was pitch-black, without luster, and extremely rough. At a glance, it looked like the most common style of a heavy-backed cleaver.  Lin Sheng reached out to grasp the hilt and lifted it. Buzz. The blade began to tremble violently, emitting a sound like a tuning fork.  "Having fused two fragments, it's starting to reveal its true form, isn't it?" In the dim palace, Lin Sheng gently stroked the weapon fused from the fragments of the Yin Turn Evil Wheel. He could feel that this was not the true form of the Yin Turn Evil Wheel.  "Judging by the gaps in the fluctuation of the aura on this, at least two more fragments are needed to fully reconstruct the Yin Turn Evil Wheel." Lin Sheng lifted the greatsword in front of him with both hands supporting it.  "Just one more fragment, and it feels like it could activate its initial power."  The Yin Turn Evil Wheel, one of the strongest artifacts ever known in the Evil Spirit Realm, was said to grant its holder the power to control the entire Evil Spirit Realm and become the supreme overlord.  Although Lin Sheng did not believe the legend that the holder could dominate everything, he was still greatly coveted by the Yin Turn Evil Wheel, which was said to possess many various Evil Spirit abilities.  He sat in his seat, gently caressing the greatsword in his hand, carefully feeling the mysterious and hidden powerful energy flowing within.  "It's close... so close... The third fragment will soon be found. The secret world where the third fragment lies, I have already predetermined it. Just go and get it."  Lin Sheng's expression was calm, but his heart was full of anticipation.  At this moment, the Centaur King and the Fairy King had already gone to the world of the third fragment, to conquer this most difficult and vast space.  Lin Sheng quietly waited for the good news to arrive. With two high-ranking beings like the Centaur King and the Fairy King, dealing with a secret world should not pose a problem.  Before he could carefully study the fused greatsword in his hands, a messenger officer led a half-bodied Evil Spirit soldier rushing into the hall.  "Your Highness, something has happened!" The messenger officer's face was grave as he handed Lin Sheng a black scroll.  Lin Sheng took the scroll, shook it lightly, and it immediately exploded, turning into countless green light spots.  "Is it the Fairy King's Shadow Recording Technique?" He furrowed his brows slightly. This kind of long-distance shadow recording scroll was very precious and could passively record a lot of key important information. Generally, it would only be activated when the holder was seriously injured, recording the critical moment at that time.  He was unclear about what had happened. But since the shadow recording scroll had been activated, it must mean that a formidable enemy had appeared.  Soon, the light spots from the scroll converged, forming a triangular screen. The screen began to slowly display the scenes that had taken place before.  In a wide hall with white columns, a tall black giant wearing golden bracers was roaring and fighting fiercely with the Fairy King.  The black giant wore a black metal vest with extreme defense, and each punch and kick he threw exploded with tremendous concussive force. The floor of the hall was continuously pitted with holes.  The Fairy King was resisting head-on, clashing, but as time went by, she was slowly losing ground.  On the other side, the Centaur King, with a giant spear in hand, was clashing hard with a white giant with a human upper body and a fish tail.  The Centaur King had already entered a berserk state; this was his giant form when his combat power was fully unleashed. His already large frame, more than twice the size of a human's, had grown to over five meters tall and three meters wide after becoming a giant, resembling a towering mound of flesh.  However, the opponent of the Centaur King was also not to be underestimated.  The white giant with a human upper body and fish tail was also over four meters tall. Every swing of his trident brought fierce wind tornadoes. The gray tornadoes continuously bombarded the Centaur King, disrupting his attacks and defenses, greatly restraining the Centaur King from unleashing his killing power.  "While conquering the secret world you ordered, the two legion commanders discovered this hall of giants. Inside, there are two Giant Kings, who are the two top powerhouses ruling the entire secret world." The messenger, a half-transparent Evil Spirit with a snake's head, now spoke solemnly, adding a chilling atmosphere to the palace.  "Giant Kings?" Lin Sheng gently stroked the hilt of the greatsword, pondering.  "Yes, through translation of the Evil Spirit language there, the natives indeed call them the Twin Giants Kings," the snake-headed Evil Spirit replied.  "So, that place is also part of the Evil Spirit Realm? Including the Twin Kings, they are all Evil Spirits?" Lin Sheng immediately understood.  "Yes."  Lin Sheng fell silent for a moment, then lifted the greatsword and stood up.  He walked out of the palace and arrived at the teleportation gate area in front of the main gate. Most of the teleportation gates had been replaced by Evil Spirits under the command of the Djall Magic Hand.  Only the secret worlds that had not yet been conquered were still guarded by space sorcerers from the Fairy Empire.  Hiss... Just as he stepped onto the space, a slim figure stumbled out from the last teleportation gate. It was the Fairy King, clad in tattered green armor.  As soon as she stepped out of the teleportation gate, her body wavered, nearly collapsing to the ground. Luckily, a space sorcerer nearby quickly supported her.  "Your Majesty!" A group of space sorcerers from the Fairy Empire hurriedly approached and called out anxiously.  The Fairy Empire was different from other Evil Spirit races; they had a high sense of belonging and recognition for their ruler, the Fairy King.  Lin Sheng raised his hand, and a beam of pure white holy power enveloped the Fairy King, beginning to rapidly heal her wounds.  Only then did he notice that the Fairy King's right arm had been cleanly severed, leaving just a bare wound.  "Your Highness... I have failed your trust..." The Fairy King kneeled on one knee towards Lin Sheng with an expressionless face.  Lin Sheng looked at her, silent. Regardless of whether the Fairy King had truly exerted herself, at least her injuries made it impossible for anyone to criticize her, and it was not appropriate to reprimand her further.  After a moment of silence.  Suddenly, the red-haired figure of Tian Gongxia emerged from one of the teleportation gates.  "Come with me." He looked at Tian Gongxia.  "Alright."  The two of them, one after the other, passed by the Fairy King and stepped into the teleportation gate. Following them were also the Evil Spirit King's guards and high-ranking Evil Spirits like Djall Magic Hand.  With the Evil Spirit King personally taking action, these close guards would face unpredictable consequences if they did not follow. Chapter 459: The Chase 1. The Realm of the Giant Evil Spirits.  Ahhhh!!! The Centaur King roared furiously as he smashed his spear against the weapon in the hands of the Merfolk Giant. Behind the Merfolk Giant, an even larger cyclone had condensed, the grey tornado forming a strong pulling force, like fine threads, constantly restraining the Centaur King from all directions.  "Burning Blood Spear!! Kill!" The spear in the Centaur King's hand suddenly transformed from pure black to silver, and the tip of the spear lit up with a sharp and dazzling white light, thrusting forward.  Boom!! This thrust was once again blocked by the Merfolk Giant wielding a trident. The power and speed of the spear were severely interfered with by the tornado, becoming increasingly slow and blunt.  The Centaur King tried to retreat several times, but the gaze of another black giant king not far away made him dare not show any signs of backing down. He remembered that this black giant was previously engaged in a fierce battle with the Fairy King, and unexpectedly, he had now left the battle and come here.  Obviously, the Fairy King was either defeated or had fled. "Damn it!! This damned one-eyed woman!!" He angrily swung the giant spear, his powerful ability as the Centaur King made him stronger and faster the angrier he became.  Therefore, his actual combat strength was considered the best among all Centaur Kings in history. At this moment, his rage was like flames rolling fiercely, and the power and speed of the Centaur King were almost more than double than usual.  He was completely suppressing the Merfolk Giant across from him. But whenever he wanted to buffer time for a big move, he was immediately threatened by the black giant's gaze, preventing him from gathering strength.  This frustrating situation had already lasted for two to three minutes. The Centaur King already felt his rage subsiding. Fury could indeed greatly enhance speed and strength, but the price was the rapid consumption of his physical and mental energy, and it was a proportional consumption.  "No! It can't go on like this! I must find a way to turn things around!" While swinging his giant spear to suppress the opponent, the Centaur King secretly surveyed his surroundings, looking for a chance to escape.  But the evil spirit army he had brought was already mostly wiped out by the barbarians in the Giant King's palace. These elite barbarians were dressed in rough capes and armor, wielding either hammers or giant bone knives in their hands.  Before each swing of their weapons, they would let out a loud shout, unleashing a strange vibrational power. It was the same vibrational power as that of the black giant. This power could penetrate the surface and destroy the internal core, which was very astonishing.  The evil spirits were shaken by this power, their core weaknesses were found, and they were killed one by one. "If this continues, I will die here!" The Centaur King became more and more anxious.  But no matter what he did, the Merfolk Giant on the opposite side stuck to him closely. If he retreated, the opponent advanced. If he advanced, the opponent retreated.  It seemed the two giants were trying to exhaust his strength, aiming to take him down without damage. "Damn it, damn it, damn it!!! Aaahhhhh!!!"  The rage in the Centaur King's heart grew even more intense. But as strong as his fury was, after burning for so long, his body became less and less able to bear it.  "You scum! Do you think you can kill me? Kill the great Centaur King Kurl War Spear??!!" "I will let you know the price of mocking me!!" The Centaur King swung his giant spear with all his might.  The thick war spear whistled through the air, instantly severing all the threads of pulling force emitted by the tornado. He stepped back, gasping for breath, his eyes blood-red, ready to use his last burning blood secret technique.  It was a powerful combat secret technique that required burning one's lifespan to burst forth. It could restore oneself to the best condition in a very short time, and in each attack and defense, it would generate a blood-shielding ability to help resist damage.  But unless it was absolutely necessary, he was reluctant to use this secret technique. Because each use would consume one-third of his lifespan. It was not a fixed amount but a proportional consumption.  As he hesitated, the Merfolk Giant saw a gap when he was distracted and swung the trident forward fiercely, striking like lightning.  Slash!! The Centaur King's chest was unexpectedly slashed open with a large wound. He then realized that his opponent was not someone easy to deal with, but a formidable enemy of the same level as him, one that would require at least a hundred moves to determine a victor.  "Outsider, this is not a place for you to come. Since you have come, rest in peace here, and become a bone of honor under the seats of my brother and me. This is also a glorious end for you." The Merfolk Giant spoke in a particularly awkward style, as if carrying an ancient tone, or as if he hadn't spoken for a long time and suddenly began to use his voice.  The Centaur King breathed deeply, his blood circulating rapidly to desperately eliminate the fatigue and decadence in his body. But each swing of the giant spear brought tremendous strain to his flesh, making it increasingly difficult for him to recover.  "No... How can I fall here!! How can I!!??" The Centaur King finally made up his mind, ready to use the burning blood secret technique, and go crazy one last time.  "I will assist you!!" Just then, the black giant who had been watching the battle also jumped into the fray, with his right fist suddenly expanding in mid-air, bringing up a huge shockwave and smashing towards the Centaur King.  Sssss!! A large number of arm-thick black metal siege crossbows shot out with precise and stable trajectories, carrying a strange twisting halo, and bombarded the Centaur King. His huge body at this moment was essentially a massive target.  At this moment, even if he wanted to burst out with the burning blood secret technique, it was too late. The black giant, the Merfolk Giant, and the huge siege crossbows shooting from all around.  All the attacks converged at this instant, focusing together. The Centaur King needed a moment to adapt to the secret technique's activation.  But now, he didn't even have that moment's time. "No!!" He opened his eyes wide, only to watch helplessly as the black giant's huge fist fell from above.  At this moment, the Merfolk Giant fully blocked his war spear, preventing him from freeing his hands to deal with the strike. "I will die...!"  "I... will die...!!" At this instant, everything seemed to slow down. The flying crossbow bolts. The black giant king's fist. The Merfolk Giant's trident.  And the circles of translucent mysterious spells that emerged around, which were the Giant King's subordinates using spells to bind him. Time seemed to have stopped.  The Centaur King was unable to move, and aside from his thoughts, his body was similarly unable to act. Everything was like an insect frozen in amber.  "Am I going to die?" He watched this strange scene in horror, unwillingness, and anger. Such a scene was rare in his life, and he had heard that at the moment of death, one would encounter incredible things.  Perhaps this moment right now was such a case. What puzzled him, though, was that he seemed to be able to see the surprise in the eyes of the black giant other than himself.  And the twisted and puzzled expression on the face of the Merfolk Giant. "Great Frost Flow, Extreme Cold Sword."  "Do you see? This is one of the supreme mysteries of my swordsmanship, known as the freezing sword intent that can instantly extinguish everything."  "The so-called sword intent is the ability to make people feel the threat of sharpness and the blade even when the sword is not drawn. And my sword intent has been able to, with my will, force living beings into a state of frozen instant extinction."  "When life believes it is dead, it will wither." Chapter 450: Pursuit 2  The Centaur King looked toward the sound, and his pupils suddenly contracted. He saw a red-haired woman standing quietly behind the mermaid giant and the black giant king. She leaned against a palace pillar, quietly watching them. She had no weapon in hand, merely her palm seemingly holding something. Although she held nothing, it gave the impression that she was wielding a sharp sword.  "Hear my intention, and you can feel the terror and shudder. This is the Sword Intent."  The Centaur King watched the red-haired woman as she slowly raised her hand and gently made a downward slash. Subsequently, he saw a clear bloodstain appear on the right shoulder of the black giant king.  Hiss!! A large spray of blood gushed out, scattering on the ground.  "So it's not that time has stopped... but we have stopped..." the black giant king fell to the ground with a thud, his face full of horror and weakness.  "Because you are too weak," said the red-haired woman indifferently.  Boom! Suddenly, the palace door was pushed open heavily. A towering figure clad in white heavy armor strode in, not glancing at the two giant kings or the Centaur King. Instead, he walked straight through them to the highest giant throne and turned around to sit down. Even though his stature did not match the grand giant throne, the figure sitting upon it exuded an indescribable sense of oppression and pressure.  "I will give you only one chance."  "Submit, or die," said the figure on the throne flatly.  "This palace is built on the highest peak of the Sakureimon Mountain Range in this realm of evil spirits, surrounded by icy tundras. A very nice location. It is perfect for our use," said the red-haired woman with a smile.  "What's the use of keeping these two pieces of trash alive? They are useless even if they survive. It's better to kill them cleanly." Upon hearing this, the mermaid giant and the black giant frantically tried to break free from the strange freezing force.  "No... Impossible...!! Want me to submit?! Don't insult me!! I am the Giant King Bo Yinhanerla!!" The black giant's muscles swelled rapidly as he roared furiously. His black fists began to grow countless smoke-like black threads. All the threads wrapped around his fist, quickly forming a layer of black metallic armor.  "Ah ah ah!!" With a punch, he actually broke free from the Sword Intent of Tiangong Xia and turned to smash her behind him. The giant fist shot out like a missile and then hung suspended in the air, less than half a meter from Tiangong Xia's face.  Whoosh!! A strong gust of wind blew Tiangong Xia's hair back and forth. But the fist could not advance any further.  "Good, now you've proven that you're not trash," Tiangong Xia's eyes showed a trace of appreciation. "One who can break free from the lock of my Sword Intent is certainly not a mediocre person! I acknowledge your bravery."  The black giant opened his mouth to roar but could not make any sound. At this distance, he was even deprived of the right to roar.  "Do you feel it?" Tiangong Xia's mouth curved into a sinister smile. "This is my Sword Domain, Silent Clarity."  She stretched out her slender index finger and lightly tapped the black giant's forehead. "Your blood."  "Too noisy."  Zizz... As she tapped her finger, the black giant's blood flow began to slow down drastically, and then slower, and slower. In a matter of seconds, he was forcibly plunged from a state of boiling blood to a state of blood stagnation.  "Do you know what will never make a sound?" Tiangong Xia's hand changed from a finger to a palm, gently caressing the black giant's face. "Only death will always be silent."  "Enough, Tiangong Xia," finally came the indifferent male voice from the throne.  Tiangong Xia took a step back with a smile. "Wasn't I just joking with him? He actually tore off the arm of the fairy princess. I just wanted to teach him a little lesson."  "The arm of the Fairy King can be reattached. It's not a big deal," said Lin Sheng calmly from above.  "Alright, then I'll follow your orders, Holy Emperor." Tiangong Xia smiled again and stepped back, and the oppressive and heavy terrifying pressure around her gradually dissipated as well.  The previously frozen sounds once again returned to the surroundings.  The black giant fell to the ground; although only a little time had passed, it was enough to completely rob the black giant king of his combat power. His entire body's blood was forcibly stagnated, resulting in many negative effects that were hard to describe.  Lin Sheng sat on the giant throne, looking down below.  Two giants, stiff all over, were scared rigid on the spot by Tiangong Xia. As well as the surrounding crowd, which was also shocked.  To be able to come here from the harsh environment outside, they must be beings with strong vitality and strength. This was also why Lin Sheng intended to give the two giant kings a chance. He needed more troops and stronger beings to conquer more realms of evil spirits.  "Big brother!" The mermaid giant saw his brother, the black giant, in a dire situation, and instantly became worried and furious. However, just because his brother could break free from the Sword Intent's constraints did not mean he could do the same. The mermaid giant struggled frantically, trying to break the invisible bonds around him. But his strength was much less than his brother's.  If the black giant's strength was at the peak in terms of power, similar to the power of the three great secret realm enforcers, then he was only equivalent to an ordinary civilian enforcer. Civilian enforcers, who often came up with their own research, were not comparable to the academy's secret realm enforcers, neither in power nor in natural force fields.  And the mermaid giant belonged to this level. This was the lowest level among the enforcers. If not for his brother being decent, Lin Sheng would not bother to recruit such a weak individual.  The mermaid giant's struggles and painful roars brought a sense of tragic bravery to the great hall.  "Tiangong Xia. Disperse," Lin Sheng ordered coldly.  Whoosh. Suddenly, the heavy pressure that had enveloped the giant king abruptly lightened. The two giants first trembled, then simultaneously leaped up and dashed towards the palace door like lightning.  The black giant, still in mid-air, threw a punch back in Lin Sheng's direction. His fist was extremely heavy; as he threw the punch, the air moaned and wailed. The fist stirred a large distortion, like water ripples, flying rapidly towards Lin Sheng.  This distortion was purely the result of his own strength's shockwave. It seemed like a natural response to the punch, but it was actually the full force of the black giant's shockwave ability. If anyone mistook this distortion for a normal aftermath, they would be dead.  Lin Sheng watched as the shockwave distortion approached rapidly. He stopped Tiangong Xia, who was about to intercept, and instead extended his left hand, erecting it in front of him. His palm faced the incoming shockwave distortion directly. Chapter 461: Pursuit 3  Whoosh! With a light sound, the shockwave distortion was forcibly compressed and flattened, trying to break through Lin Sheng's palm. Yet, even though his palm was less than one-tenth the size of it, it was firmly blocked mid-air. Soon, the invisible shock distortion had nowhere to propagate and was forcefully annihilated on Lin Sheng's left palm. The group of shock distortion, just like real residual shockwaves, was naturally and casually dealt with by Lin Sheng.  Seeing this scene, the heart of the dark giant grew cold. Here was another top-tier powerhouse whose depth was completely unfathomable. Understanding what had just happened, even he himself began to doubt whether the punch he had just thrown was really just a residual wave. If it weren't for the significant depletion of shock energy in his body indicating that the punch had indeed been effective, he might now be doubting his life.  "How... How is this possible?!"  The merman giant also witnessed this scene and similarly began to doubt whether his brother had forgotten to use his mana. It was this moment of delay. The centaur king, having regained his senses, had already blocked the entrance to the great hall, cutting off the two giants' path of retreat.  At this point, in the domain of the Heavenly Craft Xiá's sword, aside from the members of the Holy Temple, only these two giant kings had their movement restrictions lifted. However, the many warriors and sorcerers under the other giant kings were still frozen in place, standing there like amber, maintaining their original postures.  "Get back!!" A spear stopped the two giant kings.  The centaur king was now thrilled. Just a second ago, he was prepared to desperately struggle like a dying dog, fighting chaotically. At this moment, with the arrival of the boss and Heavenly Craft Xiá, the situation had instantly reversed. The dying dog was transformed into a powerful being in an instant, blocking the doorway and looking down on the two embarrassed giant kings from a superior position.  "Crazy, huh? Weren't you very arrogant just now? Saying you wanted to beat me to death? Hmm??"  At this moment, the centaur king was completely invigorated. It was only now that he felt how exhilarating it was to have a strong backer. Especially when following a very reliable boss, watching the opponent who could have beaten him into a dying dog, now about to become his victim. This exhilarating feeling was simply indescribable!  The centaur king punched hard on the right cheek of the dark giant king. With a loud bang, the dark giant king was sent flying high, tumbling backward and falling in the center of the great hall. He landed right in front of Lin Sheng.  Seeing that the dark giant king couldn't even put up a decent fight, the centaur king felt a thrilling sensation from his tailbone rushing up his spine and then all the way to the back of his head, as if he was on cloud nine.  "Damn, that's satisfying!!!"  The centaur king laughed loudly, and at that moment, his loyalty to the Holy Emperor soared.  He was laughing in relief, but the two giant kings were in distress and felt like vomiting blood. Just a moment ago, the centaur king, who was defeated by them, was now able to show off in front of them, blatantly slapping their faces. Just looking at the centaur king's ugly, smug face, a surge of malicious anger blasted out from the two giant kings. Just the sight of his face made them want to beat the centaur king to death, not to mention the current reversal of the situation.  "Still not submitting? Are your bones really that tough?" The centaur king sneered with a hehe.  "But it doesn't matter, I, old horse, like guys with tough bones. Hehehehe!"  He snickered, put away his war spear, and walked toward the two giant kings, rubbing his hands in anticipation.  What in the world did this centaur king learn from you, Heavenly Craft Xiá... Lin Sheng looked at Heavenly Craft Xiá speechlessly. In his absence, it was Heavenly Craft Xiá who was coordinating the overall situation. The centaur king only associated with those stronger than himself, which is why he was the most convinced by Heavenly Craft Xiá.  Originally, Lin Sheng had asked Heavenly Craft Xiá to teach some real-world common sense to a few of the legion commanders, as a way to broaden their general knowledge. But now, looking at the results...  Watching the two giant kings struggling on the ground like little wives, frightened and trying to avoid the approaching centaur king, Lin Sheng couldn't help but feel the urge to facepalm. Where has the style of this painting gone??  He came to subjugate two rank-holders, not to watch a live broadcast not suitable for minors.  "Are you going to surrender or not!!?" The centaur king's sleazy and triumphant laughter echoed in the great hall.  "Just kill me! Your father here would rather die than surrender!! ....... No!! No... I surrender! I surrender!!"  The black giant king painfully hugged his brother and desperately retreated backward. If they didn't surrender now, they feared they might be stripped by the centaur king into little lambs. With so many subordinates watching, and with their own numerous children present. If they were really stripped and hanged up for whipping, it would be a tremendous disgrace that would be remembered for ten thousand years even in death!  And it turned out that the centaur king's effect was quite good. Watching the two giant kings glare fiercely at the centaur king, wanting to kill him with their gaze, Lin Sheng couldn't help but contemplate whether to let the centaur king try his hand at specialized interrogation. Perhaps, compared to combat, the realm of punishment might be a better fit for him.  Two tough guys, in order to maintain their image, finally submitted under the humiliation of the centaur king and joined Lin Sheng's forces, becoming two of his great generals under the Dark Spirit King. The strength under the Dark Spirit King's command grew even further, becoming more powerful and expanding.  After subduing the giant kings, Lin Sheng finally found the whereabouts of the third fragment in the giant kings' palace. In the giant's treasure vault, the fragment lay quietly in the form of a crystal ball, having been there for thousands of years. If Lin Sheng hadn't come knocking, the giant kings might never have realized how important this crystal ball was a fragment. Because there were at least a hundred crystal balls identical to this one in the treasure vault. Moreover, these crystal balls were all identical in shape, even the patterns and textures were completely the same. Only the first fragment possessed by Lin Sheng could sense the fluctuations of this fragment, thereby identifying which crystal ball it was.  After entering the treasure vault, Lin Sheng quickly selected a large number of various treasures. He did not pick out this crystal ball alone but concealed it among a large collection of various treasures and took it out together. Gold, crystals, gems, silver, all sorts of rare and exotic treasures, and a variety of strange and curious artifacts. The treasure of the giant kings greatly enriched Lin Sheng's personal treasure trove as the Dark Spirit King and Holy Emperor.  And just as he found the third fragment in the Dark Spirit Realm, ready to integrate it at any time and initially grasp the power of the Yin to Evil Wheel, in reality...  Farudo, who had taken over Miyuki's body and was known as the Magistrate of the Netherworld, a being above the rank-holders, finally set foot on the land of Redon, which belonged to the Heavenly Tower.  And at the same time...  All over the world, all the people of destiny who held the holy artifacts of the heavenly mandate, heard the guidance from the Great Sage of the Great Star Pool. Guiding them to converge in a small city named Descher in Redon, to unite the power of all the holy artifacts and to vanquish the Magistrate of the Netherworld, Farudo.  ............... ............... Chapter 462: Power 1  At a wooden hut in an abandoned manor on the western border, sunlight filtered through a faint black fog, casting strange, twisting lines on the ground.  The wooden door of the hut creaked open. Adolf, looking haggard with a scruffy beard, walked out of the house and looked up at the sky.  "The erosion of the Dust World has reached such a severe level?" He sighed.  Despite the increasing erosion of the Dust World and the Black Tide, it had no effect on those like him, the holders of the fated holy artifacts. Their power was enough to shield the surrounding dust and black fog.  After realizing that he possessed a fated holy artifact and would eventually be sought after by the terrifying enemies of the Dust World, Adolf thought for a long time before finally coming up with a clumsy lie and resolutely leaving his birthplace, Shumingdon. He left behind his deeply benevolent teacher, Lin Sheng, and many companions and elders from the temple who were close to him as family.  Knowing the terrifying strength of the enemy, Adolf knew that the future would have to be faced alone. He couldn't involve others; it was too dangerous for them.  Adolf took out a recently received letter, the delicate handwriting on it clearly documenting the evil deeds of a Netherworld demon officer named Faludo, who slaughtered messengers and froze tens of thousands of people, sinking them to the bottom of the sea.  "Gather everyone's power, to summon the strongest force and rebuild everything? The fated holy artifact... what exactly is it..." With a sigh in his heart, Adolf put away the letter, donned a wide-brimmed round hat, lowered the brim, and quickly left towards the distance.  This journey, whether it led to life or death, had to yield a result. If successful, everything would be restored to its original state. If not, the worst outcome would be his death, without implicating his family and friends. This was the resolution belonging to him, Adolf.  ...  ...  Lin Sheng had never thought he would come to this point.  Sitting in the rough stone hall of the Evil Spirit Palace, there was a cup of hot tea on the table in front of him, emitting a faint white steam.  The stone hall was not large, just the size of a small basketball court, with round entrances and exits at both ends. On the left and right sides were some armors and weapons obtained from the treasury of the Giant King. Above hung a huge crystal chandelier filled with candles.  The floor was carpeted in red, and in the center stood a large statue of him riding a blood demon warhorse.  Lin Sheng gently caressed the crystal ball. The surface of the sphere was smooth and icy, with what seemed like a silver nebula slowly rotating and glowing inside. The entire sphere was silver-blue, and its base was made of an unidentified pale redwood, exuding a refreshing fragrance.  "The evil energy has basically reached a suppressive level by now, and it's not so easy to advance further. My goal is to use evil energy to enhance holy power, to stimulate it. But in fact, now that I have stepped into the rank of a messenger, the role of evil energy is not great."  Lin Sheng pondered the power systems he currently possessed. He had many powers, but they were mixed and impure.  "Evil energy, dragon blood power, holy power, soul power, it's now somewhat affecting my further advancement. If I want to improve the quality and concentration of the energy, I have to make a choice."  Lin Sheng was aware that his body was like a giant compressor; only pure, concentrated single energy could be compressed more quickly to reach a higher quality.  Since he had broken through to the rank of a messenger with the help of holy power, he began to feel that the improvement of his strength and cultivation was slowing down.  To advance and break through the suppressive level of evil energy would require a long accumulation of time. Holy power had just broken through and had not yet stabilized. Dragon blood power was already fixed at such a strength; it depends on opportunities and the purity of the bloodline. His current dragon blood proportion had reached a fairly saturated state. To continue to improve, he could only increase the purity of the bloodline. But purity cannot be increased casually; it also requires compression and purification.  "My power is too mixed inside my body; there is no environment for purification. I must make a decision."  Lin Sheng picked up the hot tea and took a sip. The faint aroma of the tea refreshed his spirit.  "Firstly, evil energy can be given up. I do not have an innate talent for evil energy; learning it was only to broaden my horizons."  He first ruled out evil energy.  "Secondly, dragon blood power, this depends on the bloodline. I initially wanted to use the dragon blood to enhance my physical strength to be able to contain more holy power. Now that I have broken through to the rank of a messenger, theoretically, I can continuously connect with the Sea Gate and use the chaotic soul power of the Lingji Sea to transform it into pure holy power."  "So, this can also be set aside for now."  "Thirdly, chaotic soul power... This is the power I accidentally obtained after connecting with the Lingji Sea. Although it's infinite, it lacks a systematic framework, it's not easy to advance, and there's no clearer direction."  Lin Sheng pondered.  "I won't let go of this for the time being; after all, the essence of holy power is the soul. I should focus on the soul, continuously strengthening and purifying it."  Everything's core is the soul. Understanding this, Lin Sheng quickly cleared up what should be his focus.  "Soul power is my foundation. With soul power, holy power and evil energy are just derivatives."  He drained the tea, stood up, and picked up the crystal ball, walking slowly to the inner hall.  The Evil Spirit Palace was built and perfected by the combined efforts of the craftsmen from all the evil spirits and the Fairy Empire, under the orders of the Demon Hand of Degaal and the Fairy King. Initially, it was the Demon Hand clan that began construction. Later, to flatter Lin Sheng, the higher-ups of the Fairy Empire, apart from the Fairy King, started to work from the people and things around him. This increasingly luxurious and delicate inner palace was one of them.  Power is always fascinating, and that's where the obsession lies.  "Seize power, and everything else will follow."  This phrase flashed through Lin Sheng's mind. He walked under the inner hall's plaque, looked up at the plaque engraved with "Yin Yang Hall," and then strode in.  The guards of the inner hall were two strong and sturdy half-human, half-insect giant evil spirit generals. Their upper bodies were human males, while their lower bodies were like centaurs with huge insect bodies. Dozens of black legs supported them firmly on the ground like a mountain. These powerful warriors with shiny black carapaces kneeled on one knee and silently saluted him as Lin Sheng approached.  Lin Sheng ignored them and looked straight at the amazing giant knife inserted into the ground in the center of the inner hall. After a long absence, the Yin Turn Evil Wheel had undergone some unknown changes. The knife as a whole had shrunk quite a bit and had become much thinner.  "Three pieces... Now, let's see what kind of changes will happen after fusing three pieces..."  Lin Sheng reached out and gently grasped the handle of the giant knife. Then, with the other hand, he lightly pressed the crystal ball on top.  Hiss...  Something amazing happened. The crystal ball, as if liquefied, floated up and merged onto the surface of the giant knife. In just a few seconds, the crystal ball completely disappeared from Lin Sheng's hand. Chapter 463: Power 2  Lin Sheng calmly held the giant blade, quickly absorbing the holy power he had left on it as a precaution. To prevent other creatures from touching this treasure, he had highly concentrated his holy power in advance and attached it to the surface of the giant blade to better isolate its aura and fluctuations. The highly concentrated holy power could also protect the treasure. If anyone tried to approach and take the giant blade, Lin Sheng would detect them immediately and track them down. Unless the other party could dispel the high concentration of holy power he had left on it. But if such an opponent appeared, there would be no need for them to sneak in to steal; wouldn't it be simpler to just come in and take it by force?  Lin Sheng dissipated the holy power attached to the surface. He quietly watched the three fragments merge into one to form the Yin Evil Wheel. Suddenly, there was a crisp snap. The giant blade, held in his hand, suddenly fractured and fell to the ground, starting to melt and collapse. It was like ice cream melting under the sun, except the melting process was accelerated countless times. Lin Sheng didn't even have time to react before he saw the giant blade break and fall to the ground, silently dissolving into a pool of black viscous liquid.  For a moment, he seemed to hear the faint buzzing of dense insects and the rustling of raindrops hitting leaves. The sound quickly transformed into the roar of waves crashing against rocks. It was as if someone was whispering in his ear, as if countless images were flashing before his eyes. A vast amount of knowledge and information, like tangible black smoke, rose from the black viscous liquid at Lin Sheng's feet. His entire being was shrouded and surrounded by this black smoke containing countless sounds, knowledge, and information. Time seemed to slow down at this moment.  A flood of knowledge about evil spirits and supernatural abilities rushed into Lin Sheng's mind. It was a very strange feeling. It wasn't simply cramming a massive amount of knowledge into Lin Sheng's brain, but through a complete scenario evolution, a more vague and general yet complete way, he understood the root of the evil spirits' supernatural abilities.  "Yin turn..." A vague female voice murmured in Lin Sheng's ear. "Yin turn..." "Yin turn..." The voice kept repeating. As if hypnotic, it made Lin Sheng's mind overflow with a deep drowsiness. He slowly closed his eyes, and in the pitch darkness before him, a gigantic gray wheel slowly emerged from the darkness. The wheel, like an enormous gear, had four empty slots on its edge for inlays. Soon, one by one, the inlay objects began to appear. One inlay was a black crystal column. Another was a white bone piece. Another was a crystal ball. And there was one inlay slot that was empty. The wheel creaked and turned slowly but made a strained, faulty creaking noise due to the missing inlay. It seemed that because of the missing inlay, the entire wheel couldn't continue to rotate smoothly.  Lin Sheng watched this wheel, noticing the intricate patterns of flowers, insects, fish, mountains, and rivers on its edge. The surface was crawling with characters that looked like insects. This wheel, rather than being a wheel, was more like a circular mystical treasure. He opened his mouth, wanting to speak. But before he could come to his senses, a small opening suddenly appeared in the center of the wheel, and from it silently flowed three streams of dark red liquid like blood. Amid the sound of rushing water, these blood-like streams quickly approached, swirling around Lin Sheng and then drilling into the center of his chest. A total of three streams of blood left three different fine patterns on Lin Sheng's chest. The three patterns together formed a huge, complex wheel.  Lin Sheng opened his eyes and removed his armor, tearing open his clothes to look at his chest. Indeed, there were three blood-red marks on his chest. Together, the three marks resembled an incomplete puzzle; once fully assembled, they would form a red wheel that covered his chest. At the center of the wheel was a pattern like an eye, which continuously emitted a faint grey glow in all directions like a living thing. Within the glow, numerous symbols and patterns seemed to flow.  Lin Sheng looked at his hands; the giant blade no longer existed there. Nor was there the pool of pitch-black liquid at his feet. The so-called Yin Evil Wheel seemed to have completely transferred to his body. He closed his eyes, feeling the vast amount of information that had just poured into his mind. "So this is the so-called Yin Evil Wheel... Rather than an evil wheel, it's more like a forbidden tome."  The Yin Evil Wheel was crafted jointly by eighty-eight of the most powerful super evil spirits at the zenith of the Evil Spirit world. At that time, evil spirits did not have innate supernatural talents. They were merely creatures with a special body structure and did not have many other differences. But ever since the super evil spirits crafted this artifact, they used it to forcibly elevate the entire race of evil spirits through some mysterious and special methods into a race naturally endowed with powerful supernatural talents. This artifact, rather than being a treasure, is more like the condensed essence that the evil spirits once used to break through their racial limits and elevate their bloodlines. It was the great creation forged by the most powerful evil spirits of the past to break through the limits of their bloodlines and race.  Correspondingly, possessing the Yin Evil Wheel did not mean fully understanding how to unleash all evil spirit supernatural abilities. Instead, one would automatically receive the protection of supernatural abilities bestowed by the eighty-eight super evil spirits. "Eighty-eight protections..." Lin Sheng's eyes widened. He reached out his hand and gently clenched it. He could feel a strange power surrounding his body like a force field. Within this force field, dozens of different auras and forces roamed. These forces were like giant serpents lurking in his shadow, revealing their fangs only when needed.  "Eighty-eight types of protection, eighty-eight types of abilities, can generally be categorized into four types," Lin Sheng began to classify according to the information in his mind. "First, the wheel that enhances one's own existence." "Second, the wheel that weakens the opponent's fate." "Third, the wheel of free movement." "Fourth..." Lin Sheng's brows suddenly furrowed. "The fourth is incomplete... Indeed, the final piece is needed to completely merge and obtain the ultimate complete power."  "Eighty-eight protections, I have already received the first three types, which add up to more than seventy protections. Only a few protections are missing. Looking at it this way, these missing protections are very likely to be the most important ones." Lin Sheng understood in his heart. He looked around and did not immediately try out the power of the protections in this place. Instead, he quickly walked out of the inner hall and exited the Evil Spirit Palace amidst the bowing and saluting evil spirits. Then he stepped into the evil spirit gate that had led him to the black crystal column before.  Hiss... As the world spun and Lin Sheng regained his senses from the teleportation, he saw a pale white flame surging towards him. Before he could react and defend, a layer of gray light naturally rose from his body, firmly blocking the flame's onslaught. Lin Sheng felt his chest getting a little hot and looked down at the torn open collar. The red wheel pattern on his chest had become clearer and more blood-red. Chapter 464: Power 3  "Is this the blessing of the Wheel of Existence?" Lin Sheng pondered thoughtfully. Walking forward, engulfed in flames, the terrifyingly frozen earth fire, equivalent to the strength of five wings, couldn't even touch his skin. He did not use any of his own powers, whether it was demonic energy, holy power, or dragon blood abilities.  It was just the newly acquired protective power that was automatically defending him against everything. Within the thick white pillar of flame, Lin Sheng slowly descended from midair to the ground. "There was a slight deviation in the teleportation just now, and I was directly teleported into the flames."  Stepping out of the fire column, he looked around and stomped on the ground. His body effortlessly leapt up and flew away towards the distance. After running several thousand meters in one direction, Lin Sheng stopped on a slightly elevated hilltop and quietly surveyed the vast terrain around him.  On the flat ground, grey-white earth fires spewed out everywhere. This space was like a severely wounded soldier covered in injury after a great battle, on the verge of death, still struggling desperately.  "Testing the power of the protection here should be fine." Lin Sheng wanted to try out the power of the protection. He stretched out his hand, flicked his index finger towards a spewing earth fire pillar in the distance, and then tried to activate the power of the Wheel of Calamity.  Whoosh! An invisible wave shot out from Lin Sheng's fingertip, hitting the surface of the earth fire pillar with precision. In silence, the earth fire pillar first rapidly became transparent, then its color faded more and more until it completely vanished from its spot, as if it had never existed.  Lin Sheng lowered his finger and quietly waited. After a long time, the earth fire pillar did not reappear. "So, the Wheel of Calamity within the protection is about completely erasing the existence of the opponent from the root?" Lin Sheng pondered.  The artifacts forged by the top evil spirits naturally contained their philosophies. What kind of methods were the ultimate goal of weakening the enemy? In the world of evil spirits, the ultimate evil spirits believed that the answer was to completely annihilate the opponent from the root of the soul.  "So the Wheel of Calamity, which combines dozens of different abilities, ultimately manifests the power that comes together, which is to completely erase the opponent?" Lin Sheng understood a bit more.  "Then there is the Wheel of Enhancement that strengthens one's own existence." He looked down again at the blood wheel pattern on his chest. Then he stretched out both hands again and gently set up a hand seal in front of him, with his fingers crossed like a wheel.  "Open!" His eyes suddenly snapped open, and a massive amount of blood-red light burst forth from his chest, shrouding his entire body. Whoosh!!! A five or six-meter-thick blood-red light surged into the sky, stirring up the clouds above to roll. Large swaths of grey-white clouds were dyed red by the blood light, emitting bursts of thunderous roaring.  Soon, the blinding red light on the ground turned into a huge flame. Within the flame, a clear human figure slowly spread its arms. "For the evil spirits, what kind of power is the best way to enhance oneself?"  "I didn't expect the answer to be this..." Surrounded by the blood light, Lin Sheng's face and figure were no longer visible, only a pair of pale golden eyes swirling with golden light. "Too strong... I am already... Even I am afraid of this kind of me..."  "I'm afraid that I will destroy everything unintentionally." Lin Sheng raised his eyes and looked into the distance, intoxicated by this special state of immense power. With such power, no one could stop him from doing anything. No one!  ...  ...  In reality, at the Redwing Heaven Tower.  "Hahahaha!!!" In the grey-white sky, Farudo, dressed in a black robe with his white hair wildly blowing in the wind, laughed loudly, releasing rings of grey energy shockwaves from his body. The massive shockwaves spread outwards, annihilating everything nearby.  Below, the demonic energy users of the Heaven Tower formed armies, bombarding and shooting round after round. It was as if there was a thick layer of cotton between them and Farudo, not even qualifying to touch him. The cannon shells and demonic spells seemed like weak and powerless insects, constantly trying to break through the layer of grey shockwaves. But each attempt was futile, only to weakly deflect back.  "Do you feel despair?" Farudo laughed loudly. "This is too disappointing... Humans from a thousand years ago were not so insignificant. Back then, heroes emerged in large numbers, and there were countless strong individuals. Even for a powerful underworld priest like myself, caution was necessary."  "But now? Look at you?" Farudo's eyes revealed a hint of boredom. "It's a contradictory feeling... I both hope you can be stronger, to entertain me, and I don't want you to be stronger, to avoid wasting my energy."  "Farudo, do you really have to eradicate my Heaven Tower?" Among the many demonic energy users in the front rows on the ground, a burly old man with white hair and beard, and an eagle perched on his shoulder, stared coldly at Farudo in the sky.  "As a priest of the underworld in charge of curses, instead of serving the Lord of the Underworld properly, you come to the surface. Aren't you afraid of turmoil in the underworld?" The old man's tone was calm, but his knowledge of the underworld was clear.  "Oh?" Farudo was slightly surprised. "It seems there are still people on the surface who remember my existence, Farudo." He looked down at the old man. This was the first time he had faced a human so squarely since leaving Bisha Island.  "A mere human knows about the internal affairs of the great Underworld. It seems that my assessment of the Heaven Tower needs to be adjusted." He began to smile. "What if I destroy this land? We hide in the sanctuary, and after a few decades, we come out again, and everything starts over. But what about you? The underworld's rogue priest Farudo. When you return, what price will you pay to survive this calamity?"  The old man's face was cold, as if the near-extinction of most humans was not a big deal in his eyes. "Really ruthless... Compared to the number of people the sanctuary can accommodate, it's vastly different from the outside world. And you dare to give up everything with one sentence?"  Farudo was also surprised by the other party's decisiveness. "Isn't this the result that Miyue wants? The end of the old era, the beginning of a new one." The old man said coldly.  Beside him, the other demonic energy users of the Heaven Tower were angry, their faces flushed with rage. Clearly, many of them were thinking of this terrifying future. At this moment, looking at Farudo, they all wished they could rush up and fight him to the death. After all, most of the friends and family of the demonic users are in reality, and the sanctuary simply cannot accommodate so many people. So the destruction of reality is equivalent to cutting off their lineage and annihilating their relatives. No one could accept such an outcome.  "Is that so?" Farudo raised an eyebrow, "Since that's the case, let me try and see how many of you are really willing to hide in the sanctuary..." He looked meaningfully at the demonic users behind the old man.  "Since words don't work, let's try. If you want to destroy the Heaven Tower, let's see how much you're willing to pay!!" The old man's eyes turned cold, and a thick ice staff quickly appeared in his hands. "Form up!!" he commanded with his staff.  In an instant, a huge silver-white magic array lit up on the ground, placing Farudo in the sky right in the center of the position. Chapter 465: The Last Fragment 1  In the midst of a melodious harp melody, a bard dressed in a splendid robe, indistinguishable in gender like a butterfly, gently played a poem styled after the Fairy Empire. The bard's voice was also difficult to distinguish between male and female, neutral and soft, winning nods of approval from the legion commanders present.  The poem was a labor of love by the old nobility of the Fairy Empire, moving in song, beautiful in tune, and ornate and philosophical in diction.  "However, praising me in my presence, isn't that a bit too embarrassing?" Lin Sheng sat on the throne of the Demon King, glanced at the Centaur King beside him, and then at the Fairy King to his right.  The Centaur King was lost in the song, nodding his head in rapture. The Fairy King, on the other hand, drank fine wine with her eyes closed and her expression unchanged. But since one of her eyes took up her entire face, it was hard to decipher any expressions.  Deigar Demonhand, in this hall where strength was revered, was seated at a lower position, which made the demonhands of the Demonhand clan feel indignant but that was the reality, his strength was indeed too weak.  The Giant Kings, having newly descended, sat silently at the end of the table, drinking and eating meat without a word.  Suddenly, a heavy sound of footsteps came from outside the hall.  "The Dragon Tomb's Sin Dragon Mother has arrived!" The herald's announcement drifted in at this moment.  "Sin Dragon Mother?" The numerous legion commanders present were all slightly taken aback. They had learned about the existence of the Dragon Tomb from Lin Sheng and Tiangong Xia, but they did not know the specifics and had never seen its powerful members.  And now was the time to meet this unfamiliar new member.  As the footsteps approached rapidly, a woman in a black dress with a seductive figure and blonde hair walked into the hall with ease and a smile.  She stood in the center of the hall amidst the melodious singing and curtsied slightly to Lin Sheng.  "Mighty Demon King, the Sin Dragon Mother brings many dragon souls from the Dragon Tomb to await your orders."  The Sin Dragon Mother's voice was slightly hoarse, melodious and sexy, hinting that she must have been an irresistible top beauty in life. If not for the pallor of death characteristic of ghostly spirits on her face, the legion commanders present, such as the Centaur King and the Giant King, would probably be joining the ranks of those pursuing her.  "I want to marry her!" The Centaur King, upon seeing the Sin Dragon Mother for the first time, was utterly captivated.  He swallowed his saliva uncontrollably, and his blood seemed to boil as it circulated rapidly. His eyes quickly filled with blood, revealing an indescribable desire and anticipation.  "You may," Lin Sheng couldn't help but smile. "If you don't mind that the Sin Dragon Mother's true form is dozens of times larger than you, I think she would be delighted to accept your pursuit. Provided you don't get crushed to death on your wedding night."  "Uh..." The Centaur King was doused with cold water, and the passion in his eyes faded as he awkwardly scratched his head. He was already one of the top powerhouses in controlling blood and energy, stronger than the average legion commander.  If anyone saw him get hot-blooded and looked ready to act impulsively, there was no doubt that it was an act. Or he really intended to do so.  Despite being the powerful Centaur King with a strong natural physique, he was actually the least impulsive of all. So now, he quickly snapped out of his entranced state and returned to normal.  "I better not, then. I'll leave her for a supreme being like you to enjoy."  "Show respect to the strong!" The Sin Dragon Mother, being disrespected and insulted in such a manner, flashed a fierce look in her eyes. A black force field condensed into a line and shot towards the Centaur King.  With a puff, the Centaur King reacted, stomping and shattering the line of black force field.  "How dare you! With the supreme being here, you dare to commit violence in the hall!? Do you even have the supreme being in your eyes! Is your Dragon Tomb planning to rebel??" He immediately stood up and shouted.  The Sin Dragon Mother's cherry lips parted slightly, completely stunned by the Centaur King's shamelessness. She hadn't expected such a seemingly honest and brave man to be so smooth in his trickery. He was quick to put a label on her.  "I was just responding to your disrespect for a stronger being. As the weak, you should learn to be humble!" The Sin Dragon Mother, after all, was an old hand who had lived for thousands of years, and immediately retorted.  "If the supreme being were not here, you would already be dead in the Dragon Tomb and turned into fertilizer!" Her voice was cold and filled with a thick deathly aura.  "Heh, you're not worth my time," the Centaur King was not intimidated.  "You're seeking death!!" The Sin Dragon Mother was immediately provoked and about to take action.  "Silence!" Tiangong Xia, sitting on the side, spoke impatiently. "I can't even hear the music anymore! If you want to fight, take it outside, don't disturb my listening!"  With her words, both the Sin Dragon Mother and the Centaur King had to suppress their anger and remained silent. They both knew Tiangong Xia's strength. Among those present, aside from the supreme Demon King, no one else was a match for Tiangong Xia.  "Alright, take a seat, Sin Dragon Mother," Lin Sheng spoke at the right moment. "Musicians, you may withdraw."  He looked towards the fairy musician next to the stone pillar on the right. The musician immediately signaled for the bard to stop playing and quickly led him away.  Soon, fairy attendants fluttered their wings and flew up to the hall, each carrying trays with fruit and fine wine and other refreshments, placing them on the low tables in front of the legion commanders.  The stone doors of the great hall slowly closed, sealed by a magical formation.  Lin Sheng surveyed the strong figures present.  To his left were Tiangong Xia, the Fairy King, and the Giant King brothers. To his right were the Centaur King, the Sin Dragon Mother, and Deigar Demonhand.  In a blink of an eye, he had subjugated five commander-level powerhouses as his subordinates.  The power of the Demon Palace had expanded at an indescribable rate, quickly becoming a colossal entity.  The legion commanders were commander-level, and below them were the Demon Marshals.  This level of powerhouses included several individuals from the Fairy Emperor's Fairy Empire and a few under the Centaur King's command.  Moreover, the dragon souls in the Dragon Tomb each had the combat power of commander-level, but they had not been completely subjugated by Lin Sheng and only obeyed the Sin Dragon Mother.  The Demon Marshal level, just below the commanders, was equivalent to the pinnacle of six wings. The total number of these figures that the Demon Palace could mobilize was likely to be in the double digits.  The third level was the Demon General level.  There were too many powerhouses at this level. The Demon Lair alone had hundreds, and Lin Sheng had also created many monsters of this level in his previous experiments.  Additionally, there were hundreds more under the Fairy Empire and the Centaur King.  This level was equivalent to a three-winged demon.  As for the ordinary demons, their numbers were in the tens of thousands.  The Demon Palace was now capable of arm-wrestling with the three great secret realms of reality, to see who would emerge victorious.  But this was not enough. What Lin Sheng wanted was far more.  "I am glad that you all could arrive here on time," Lin Sheng opened his arms and spoke loudly. "This is the Demon Palace. The supreme land of the demon world. It is also the foundation from which I will unite all demons in the future."  His voice carried far and wide, rolling and reverberating like thunder inside and outside the hall. Not only the legion commanders inside the hall could hear it, but the demon generals nearby could also hear it clearly.  "This gathering is for the purpose of bestowing upon you a path to even higher power," Lin Sheng hinted. Chapter 466: The Final Fragment 2  "A higher power?" The Mother of Sin Dragons' eyes flickered with intense wariness. Having lived for so many years, she had never seen a fool who would give away power for no reason. Was the King of Evil Spirits a fool? Of course not. Her gaze peripherally swept over the opposing Tian Gongxia. The red-haired woman's face betrayed no emotion, displaying only boredom and disinterest. If the Mother of Sin Dragons felt this way, the rest were even more restless.  The Centaur King didn't care about these twists and turns. He had decided to follow Lin Sheng completely, so as long as it was Lin Sheng's decision, he would certainly comply!  "It seems that our lord despises our weak strength! Hahahaha! But actually, it still depends on who we compare ourselves to. However, since it's a benefit granted by our lord, I, Old Ma, will be the first to unceremoniously accept it!" He laughed heartily, showing his loyalty.  When the boss spoke, how could there be no support? Wouldn't a lack of response be even more embarrassing?  "I look forward to it," the Fairy King replied softly. Her severed arm had been reattached, and it seemed she had recovered without a trace of injury.  "The decision of our lord is our will," proclaimed Dejial Demon Hand overtly with flattery.  The Giant King brothers were silent, showing no expression. They had just been defeated, their treasury plundered, so their mood could only be sour.  Lin Sheng was indifferent. "In fact, I do think your strength is a bit weak," he said calmly. "The times are changing. Power cannot remain stagnant either."  He stretched out his hand, palm facing upwards, slowly releasing a pure white sphere of holy power. Hiss. The sphere emerged from his palm and hovered quietly a few centimeters above it, floating up and down slowly.  "This power is called holy power," Lin Sheng explained. "The quality of holy power is higher than soul power, and it is superior to all the powers you possess. If you do not believe it, you can try it for yourselves."  Lin Sheng gently squeezed the sphere, and it shattered, immediately emitting several rays of holy power that landed precisely in front of the legion commanders. The rays turned back into smaller holy power spheres, floating in front of the commanders.  "You can touch this sphere of holy power with your own power to neutralize it and see whose quality is stronger. If you're sure you want to master this new power, you can come to me later. I will grant you the seed of initiation."  Having said that, he didn't wait for the commanders to ask questions and directly moved on to the second topic.  "We'll not discuss this for now. Next, let's proceed to the formal topic."  Lin Sheng extended his hand, and the Fairy King immediately condensed a blue water sphere that floated to Lin Sheng. With a touch from Lin Sheng, the sphere dispersed and unfolded into a giant transparent polyhedron, several meters in diameter, displayed in front of everyone.  The polyhedron, crystal-clear like a gem, slowly revealed a clear image of a black desert. In the image, the desert stretched endlessly to the horizon. Infinite sand dunes under a scorching and eerie purple sun, and a one-horned camel struggling through the dunes. This was a region so hot that even the air was twisting and steaming.  "This is the Evil Spirit Realm that you will conquer next," Lin Sheng introduced. "Generally, we categorize such small secret worlds to see if it is an Evil Spirit Realm by looking at one key point: whether it has spawned pure soul beings like evil spirits."  He pointed at the one-horned camel in the image. "Every place that naturally spawns soul beings will become one of the subordinate worlds under my Evil Spirit Palace. As for the world you see before you, it's larger than usual. Whether it's an Evil Spirit Realm or not, you will have to inspect and patrol it yourselves."  "Within three days, I want a complete assessment report of this secret world. I need to know how long it will take to completely conquer this small world."  "We will follow your will," the many legion commanders bowed in response. They didn't know why Lin Sheng wanted to conquer so many small Evil Spirit Realms, but since it was the lord's command, they had to fulfill it.  Lin Sheng did not reveal his intention to find the last fragment in this secret world. He did not plan to tell anyone about the matters of the Yin Evil Wheel.  Not letting others know the extent of one's strength was the way to ensure lasting prosperity. If your strength's depth and breadth are unknown, others would not dare to act recklessly, for they might inadvertently clash with your strongest point, which would be a path to their doom.  After that, Lin Sheng inquired one by one about the development of the Evil Spirit Palace. All of these were managed by Dejial Demon Hand. He was akin to the grand steward of the Evil Spirit Palace, representing Lin Sheng's will. Therefore, no one present dared to underestimate him.  Dejial Demon Hand stepped forward to report on the recent developments and changes, and also on the initial exploration of this brand-new Black Desert Evil Spirit Cavern. Upon learning that there were many suspected human tribes and cities living in this desert, the sitting legion commanders became very interested.  The meeting lasted over an hour before it adjourned. The legion commanders returned to their respective territories, beginning preparations to mobilize their troops to conquer the Black Desert.  Lin Sheng, taking advantage of his previous train of thought, returned to the Yin-Yang Hall to organize his current power system. To thoroughly purify himself and achieve the optimal environment for enhancing the quality of his power, he needed a perfect, impurity-free enclosed environment. Among the Eighty-Eight Protections of the Yin Evil Wheel, there was one that could meet Lin Sheng's needs.  The Eighty-Eight Protections, broadly used, could be categorized into four major types of results. However, Lin Sheng could actually use any one of the eighty-eight protections individually. Although he currently lacked some of the potentially most critical protections due to missing fragments, there were still numerous existing protections he could use to achieve his goal.  After dealing with the matters of the Evil Spirit Realm, Lin Sheng used the portal to return to Hengruikala. Having not been back for a long time, he had nearly forgotten the impact of the different flow of time. Sometimes, he would really think that many days had passed, and since he hadn't checked in with his family, he would call home as soon as he returned, only to be told that he had just called the day before.  In reality, Hengruikala remained unchanged, operating smoothly under the shelter of the Sunset Tower, like a large and precise instrument.  Now, Hengruikala had uniquely formed a social system centered around the Holy Temple, with the clergy as the core. The clergy gradually became an emerging profession. They practiced holy power, worked in various industries, used extraordinary powers to heal and help people. The grand and purifying light effects of the holy light, as well as the purifying field's inherent ability to cleanse the spirit and relieve fatigue, gave the Holy Temple and the clergy higher social status, gradually becoming synonymous with positive mainstream forces.  Justice and dignity, but also kindness and the power to heal the body and mind, this was the public's perception of the holy light. Chapter 467: The Final Fragment 3  Lin Sheng calculated the time he had spent in the realm of evil spirits. He had been in the realm of evil spirits for over a month, but when converted, it was less than a week in the outside world. The difference in the flow of time made it hard for him to adapt to the notion of dates.  Walking on the streets of Hengrui Kala, within the city's safe zone, building after building that had once been abandoned and deserted were now rejuvenated due to the influx of a large number of people. The gasoline vehicles that used to crowd the streets had been cleared out and replaced with cleaner electric vehicles. Most of these electric vehicles had been modified into a more practical compact structure to accommodate more people and to alleviate the congested traffic within the limited space of the safe zone. The workshops of Bain University had transformed these vehicles, which were now half the size of ordinary vehicles and could even engage in short bursts of low-altitude flight, greatly easing the traffic pressure in the safe zone.  As Lin Sheng walked down the street, he saw cars driving on the ground and shuttling between buildings in mid-air. This scene, which seemed to belong to a futuristic city, was now clearly presented before his eyes.  "Hengrui Kala is already quite developed, the enhancement of the Twilight Sanctuary had been overlooked due to the interference of the Underworld's Hand. Now, it's time to deal with it," Lin Sheng thought to himself as he strolled leisurely, soon arriving back at the research center and then to the branch of the sanctuary.  The accumulated holy power in the Twilight Sanctuary was immense, and the grand holy power pool had been in a state of overflow for quite some time. The holy power that diffused even caused faint white fluorescence to shimmer in the air around the sanctuary. That was holy crystal. Whenever the sanctuary needed to use holy power, these crystals would spontaneously transform back into pure holy power.  Lin Sheng walked into the sanctuary without disturbing anyone, quietly arriving at the prayer hall. The hall was empty, and the doors were tightly locked. Normally, no one was allowed to enter or leave outside of prayer times.  Lin Sheng approached the prayer podium and slowly closed his eyes.  Hiss... In the darkness before his eyes, a huge map of Hengrui Kala appeared. The map was like a sandbox, gently rotated clockwise by Lin Sheng's will.  Click... A faint noise emanated from the map as the sandbox-like terrain slowly sank and then split in the middle. The entire map of Hengrui Kala was divided into two, and a gray-black stone pillar rose from the split. There was a clear palm print on the black stone pillar.  "Please verify palm print. To initiate the next phase of advancement, the palm print of the person bound to the sanctuary is required," a gentle female voice rang out again.  Lin Sheng stepped forward and lightly pressed his right hand onto the palm print on the stone pillar.  "Palm print confirmation complete. Welcome to the selection interface," the voice announced.  In an instant, a new tree diagram appeared before Lin Sheng's eyes. Starting with the words "Twilight Sanctuary," lines extended upward, forming six different branches.  'Addable divine techniques: 1——Wish Power Sanctuary. (Can absorb the power of living beings' wishes to create illusory lamp spirits.) (Illusory Lamp Spirits: Level 8 energy beings, adept at long-range magical control and attacks.) Holy power required: 50,000. Can be upgraded up to three levels.  2——Crimson Dusk Pool. (Absorbs the power of dusk to taint and transform a special holy power pool. The water can transform ordinary beings into special holy light creatures with a certain chance.) (Holy Light Creatures: Affinity with holy power, possessing strong physiques and regenerative abilities.) Holy power required: 10,000. Can be upgraded up to three levels.  3——Protection Ring. (Uses a large amount of holy crystals to condense into a solid form, creating a special force field that protects all beings within the sanctuary. The force field can protect the followers by reducing spiritual and soul-based attacks.) Holy power required: 100,000. Can be upgraded up to three levels.  4——Holy River Convergence. (The vast holy power is liquefied and taints the land, making the beings born in this land naturally more attuned to holy power and better suited for cultivating holy power.) Holy power required: 1,000,000. Not upgradable.  5——Judgment Light. (Combines the power of dusk with the vast accumulation of the holy power pool, using the holy chant as the activation key, can instantly judge and attack any existence within the sanctuary's range. The might of the Judgment Light corresponds to the amount of holy power accumulated in the pool. The more holy power, the stronger the might.) (Please note that the authorization for Judgment Light can only be given to three individuals. Releasing the Judgment Light once will consume all the stored holy power in the pool. Use with caution.) Holy power required: 1,000,000. Not upgradable.  6——Holy Crystal Pool. (Can increase capacity to 10,000,000. Over a certain period, the holy crystals will spontaneously select individuals with sufficiently pure and strong souls, consuming the holy crystals to transform them into holy spirits.) (Holy Spirits: Strong spiritual lives fused with holy power, retaining all memories and personalities from before, akin to resurrection.) Holy power required: 1,000,000. Not upgradable.'  Lin Sheng noticed at the end of the light screen, there was small text that read, 'These six divine techniques are the final upgradable versions. Once the divine techniques are fully upgraded, the construction of the complete Twilight Sanctuary will be finished. This guide program will self-destruct.'  "Are these the final forms?" Lin Sheng felt a tinge of disappointment. But on second thought, the ritual formation for constructing the sanctuary was actually a product created by the masters from Black Feather City. It wasn't very high-level to begin with. To reach this point was probably already their limit.  He glanced at the grand holy power pool capacity at the bottom. There was precisely one million holy power in total. Without hesitation, he chose the option for the Holy Crystal Pool.  Buzz. It was as if something vibrated in the darkness, then quickly ended. The total amount of holy power instantly dropped to zero. It then quickly rebounded to around 200,000.  "Is this the amount of holy crystals that transformed back?" Lin Sheng guessed.  Two hundred thousand holy power was not a lot, but not a little either. He decided to invest it all into the Protection Ring, upgrading it to level two.  After making his selections, all advancements would be completed in the following days. Lin Sheng exited the operation space. After confirming that both the Hengrui Kala and the Western Lun sanctuaries' headquarters were without issue, he casually returned to the research center. He gave some instructions to the little girl Taozi in the gallery below and then went back through the evil spirit gate to the evil spirit palace.  Now was the critical moment when the last fragment was about to be found, and he needed to stay alert, ready to go in person at any time.  As soon as he stepped into the evil spirit palace, he was immediately presented with military intelligence.  Degar's demonic hand quickly presented the urgent military report. Lin Sheng stood in front of the evil spirit gate, taking the report and scanning it.  'High-level beings have appeared in the Black Desert, the vanguard army has been defeated, and the Centaur King has been seriously injured.'  "Hmm? So soon after entering, they encountered a powerful enemy?" Lin Sheng was somewhat surprised. The strength of the Centaur King was considered average among his forces, stronger than Degar's demonic hand and the Fairy King.  But to be seriously injured right after deployment?  "What's the current situation? Get me in contact with the Centaur King," he casually threw the military report back to Degar's demonic hand.  "The Giant King brothers and Sin Dragon Mother have already gone to support. They should be able to retreat soon," Degar's demonic hand replied.  "Do we know anything about the opponent?" Lin Sheng asked again.  "We've gathered some information," Degar handed over a second report to Lin Sheng.  Lin Sheng took it and after scanning through, he showed a hint of surprise. "Interesting. Quite interesting!" A smile played at the corner of his mouth, unable to hide his cryptic amusement.  Degar quickly said, "The one who defeated the Centaur King is a tall man with a transparent round gem embedded in his chest. He calls himself the Messenger of the Wish Moon Stone, claiming to have received a prophecy to come and exterminate invaders from other realms. After confirming the identities of the Centaur King and the evil spirit army, he immediately launched an attack."  "How did he defeat the Centaur King?" Lin Sheng had a rough guess of the opponent's identity and asked lightly.  "That man's strength is very strong, his martial skills are also very proficient, and most importantly, his resistance is terrifying. Whether it's soul attacks or any other type of elemental magic, none of it works on him. Even if you behead him or take out his heart, it won't kill him. He can recover in an instant. The Centaur King was caught off guard and was seriously injured in a sneak attack," Degar reported.  Lin Sheng nodded. "Tell the Fairy King, the Giant King brothers, and the Sin Dragon Mother to take their forces and enter. I want that man captured alive."  If he wasn't wrong, the last fragment, which seemed to have developed self-awareness, was controlling the powerful being that had been bestowed with power to lie in wait. Because when Lin Sheng sensed it, it also sensed this side and retreated upon contact. At that time, Lin Sheng thought it was a spontaneous energy reaction from the last fragment. He hadn't expected it to be an important manifestation of the last fragment's self-awareness. Chapter 468 Fierce Battle 1  The ancient verses echoed in the sky along with the mysterious melody. At the entrance to the Tower of Heaven in Redon. Huge three-dimensional arrays of white, red, and blue continuously rotated, filled with massive runes and nefarious energies.  Countless energy sources surged from inside the Tower of Heaven, guiding various energy particles from around the world to converge here. Thousands of arrays condensed into a final, immensely large sealing array.  To deal with a powerful being like Farudo, sealing was the best method. The methods Lin Sheng could think of, the Tower of Heaven naturally could too, and they did it even better. They had gathered many blood descendants with sealing blood many years ago.  Now, suddenly using it was an indescribable surprise attack for Farudo. At this moment, his body was suspended in mid-air, his expression solemn as he looked down. The gigantic array with a diameter of thousands of meters perfectly surrounded him at the center.  Outside the array, strands of massive energy, like countless threads, converged and bound around him. Even fragile spider silk, when converged enough, could far exceed steel cables. Let alone the nefarious energy threads condensed by these arrays now.  Countless nefarious energy threads, under the condensation of the Tower of Heaven and guided by the remaining several Archons, faintly revealed translucent angels with double wings on their backs.  "Angels? Heh, it's been many years since I've seen such a scene..." Farudo looked at the scene before him, suddenly feeling somewhat nostalgic.  "But, using angels to seal me? Do you think I'm that simple? A thousand years ago, I could slaughter angels single-handedly, not to mention now!"  Farudo looked down at his feet, already entwined and bound by numerous transparent threads. The threads there were becoming more and more numerous and dense.  "However, to make even this form of mine feel somewhat troubled, you can indeed be proud." He raised his right hand.  "Curse Word·Primordial Stone Power."  "Curse Word·Godspeed."  "Curse Word·Glow of Fear."  "Curse Word·Spiritual Assassination."  "Advanced Enhancement·Ambrose's Divine Tile."  "Advanced Enchantment·Netherworld Light."  His lips moved slightly, and within a mere two seconds, a great number of magic words and spell texts immediately took effect. His body sparked with various energy flows like electricity.  Hiss... At the same time, around him in the void, four slender and sharp spears appeared centered on him.  The spears were translucent, with ribbon-like runes revolving around the tips.  Shick!! In an instant, the four spears disappeared from their original spots, appearing among the crowds at the four directions of the array on the ground.  Boom boom boom boom!!! The crowds exploded into transparent shockwaves in an instant.  "This is an attack targeting the spiritual soul, it can't be blocked, it can't be avoided. One can only endure." Farudo smiled.  As the crowd below dispersed, many people were even dizzy from the spiritual explosion. The operation of the array slowed down for a moment.  "I will intercept his attack. The rest of you, continue!" An elder from the Tower of Heaven gestured and shouted loudly.  He took a step forward, and his upper body clothes suddenly burst, revealing the silver-white close-fitting armor underneath.  "Ice Dragon Armor Technique!"  He spread his arms, and a massive amount of green nefarious energy flashed behind him, and a grey-black vortex suddenly appeared above his head.  The vortex seemed to pour out a vast amount of pale green nefarious energy like sea water. As soon as the nefarious energy fell, it turned into hard cold white ice under some strange power, covering the elder's body.  Soon his entire body grew rough and sharp white ice spikes, all of which together formed his strongest defense, the Ice Dragon Armor Technique!  "Intercept me?" Farudo chuckled.  "If you know that I am an official of the Netherworld's curse words, then you should also know that what I'm best at is not fighting head-on..."  He lifted his head, his white hair rapidly growing longer and denser, weaving into a huge grey-black half-giant in the sky. This grey-black giant had a single horn on its head, muscles twisted like tree roots, and a pair of tiny wings almost growing out of its back. It also held a huge black stone pillar in its hands.  "Netherworld Pillar Bearer. Go, destroy this place!" Farudo said calmly.  Heh... The grey-black giant behind him gently responded and flew forward, its hair breaking and accelerating rapidly, smashing down towards the array on the ground like a meteorite.  But quickly, an Archon from below leaped into the sky, using a delicate and ancient giant tower shield to accurately block the Netherworld Pillar Bearer.  Unconcerned that the summoned creature was blocked, Farudo considered it a minor character he casually called forth. The reason he summoned this minor character was to buy time for his subsequent actions.  "Madoluene, Deep River Fang Bearer, Chief of Ambush, Flowing Shadow Beast, my most loyal first mate. In my name, Farudo, I summon you to descend here!!"  He loudly recited the full name and true name of another powerful being. True names are not so easy to recite. This kind of imprint engraved into the depths of the soul is a unique representation in space and time. When reciting, one must imagine the complete image of the other party, as well as most of the other party's powers, deeds, history, characteristics, etc. Finally, with the other party's permission, the summoning can be completed in the form of a true name.  And that is what Farudo was doing now. Only, what normally would require a lot of preparatory work and a significant consumption of resources and manpower for the ritual, he had drastically reduced and simplified with his powerful curse word ability, eventually forming this easy-to-use verbal summoning.  As Farudo's summoning incantation went on, a two-meter-tall male warrior with thirteen pairs of arms on his back gradually began to appear behind him. The warrior wore rough leather armor, barefoot, and his armor was tattered, as if he had worn it for a long time without repair. Most notably, the man had two faint purple curved and slender blades on his back.  The summoned man seemed mindless, with blood-red eyes. As soon as he appeared, he let out a fierce roar. With a backhand draw of his sword, he slashed downward.  Shick!! Two intersecting X-shaped silver sword lights fell like shooting stars. The sword lights were simple at first, but as the distance grew, they rapidly expanded, replicating and instantly turning into hundreds of blade lights. And each blade light upon landing turned into a tangible silver metallic monster.  These metal monsters had sharp heads like knives, bodies slender like willows, and unmatched speed, like snakes crashing into everyone within the array.  "Kill!!!" A large group of the Tower of Heaven's nefarious energy wielders knew it was a critical moment and resolutely charged forward. The sealing array had lasted so long and had been able to stalemate Farudo until now, which showed it was very effective. Just a bit more effort and perhaps Farudo could be completely sealed back to the Netherworld. Chapter 469: Close Combat 2  Near the battlefield, at the edge of a shallow pit in a clearing, the air imperceptibly twisted. A group of men, women, and children of varying attire appeared simultaneously on this chaotic battlefield. Their clothes were diverse; some looked as if they had just left home without having time to change out of their pajamas, some were dressed in racing suits like those worn for motorcycle racing, complete with helmets. Others appeared bewildered, holding a spatula in hand.  "This is the place..." In the crowd, a young man dressed in a white cloak with a handsome appearance looked up at Farudo in the sky.  "So fast? We ran from the border to the river in an instant?" The person holding the spatula was astonished.  "It's just a teleportation array with fixed points," an elderly voice resounded in everyone's ears.  "Now, Farudo is right ahead. The bearers of the Destiny Holy Artifacts, how you decide and act is all in a moment's thought. Your fate is for you to determine."  "Heh, that sounds nice. You've forcibly brought us here; can we even leave if we don't participate?" A woman in pajamas said coldly.  "Alright, now that we are here, I'm sure everyone understands our purpose. In fact, there are heroic spirits within the Destiny Holy Artifacts themselves. As long as we get close to Farudo and activate the power, then let the heroic spirits take over," said a burly old man wearing sunglasses gravely.  "No matter what, since we have come, it means that you have all made your resolution," Adolf looked at the others and remained silent. He gazed at Farudo in the sky and suddenly felt homesick. The elders in the temple, his praying companions, and the Night King who absolutely didn't want to get out of bed...  "Let's go. How to summon the heroic spirits within us, the Holy Artifacts will tell us the answer," the man with sunglasses said in a deep voice, being the first to head in the direction of Farudo. The rest fell silent and hurriedly followed.  Adolf was somewhat puzzled, though. These people claimed to have Destiny Holy Artifacts on them. But he himself was carrying a Holy Artifact, and logically, he should be able to resonate with them. Yet here, he had not felt the slightest aura from these people, only the presence of Destiny Treasures. Although curious, he figured that no one would joke with their lives so foolishly, so he guessed there might be some method unknown to him that could conceal their presence.  ...  Boom! In the desert sky, thunder rolled like rolling boulders, crushing across the thick clouds overhead.  In the black desert, the atmosphere was oppressive and somber. On the sandy ground, hordes of evil spirits ran or flew, with fairy warriors closely following, all charging towards the desert camp's army.  The desert army was predominantly white, clad in special armor imbued with some kind of extraordinary ability. The evil spirit army was a mixed black and red corps, a hybrid of pure soul life and flesh life, forming a unique and powerful three-dimensional attack pattern. Evil spirits used long-range attacks, while up close, fairy warriors engaged in hand-to-hand combat.  The soldiers in the desert, aside from their armor, were only a little stronger than ordinary people, whether in body or soul, and were very ordinary. Facing the three-dimensional attack, they suffered heavy casualties and were forced to retreat.  Lin Sheng rode on Blood Demon, walking slowly but straight into the battlefield. None of the evil spirits or the opposing army's soldiers could approach within ten meters of him.  On a dune in front, the Giant King brothers were jointly battling the mysterious desert powerhouse. The fight had been going on for a long time. This time, having learned some of the opponent's secrets, the Giant King brothers were much more cautious. The man with the gem embedded in his chest, having reappeared, had several powerful-looking warriors emerge from his army's ranks.  These warriors had small, delicate green wings on their backs, like willow leaves, hanging down when not in use, barely noticeable as part of their bodies.  Lin Sheng quietly watched the battle, with the Fairy King and Sin Dragon Mother standing quietly beside him, both with calm expressions, also observing the Giant King brothers.  In the opposing camp, several strong souls glanced over at Lin Sheng's side and stood off against them. However, as soon as their eyes met Lin Sheng's, they recoiled as if shocked by electricity, not daring to probe further.  "It's too slow," Lin Sheng remarked, looking toward the Sin Dragon Mother.  She immediately understood. As a member of the Fate Corpse Dragon race, skilled in magical rituals and formations, the Sin Dragon Mother had instinctively released a charming spell when she first saw Lin Sheng, which had been unsuccessful but had left a deep impression on him.  The Dragon Mother stepped forward, a purple magic circle appeared under her feet, and in a blink of an eye, she was teleported into the middle of the battlefield. She appeared behind the desert powerhouse, caught him off guard, and lightly touched the back of his head with her finger. A circle of purple light burst open, transforming into complicated array patterns, sealing on the back of the man's head. The man immediately felt dizzy, his eyes rolled back, and he collapsed to the ground.  "Doesn't it seem very easy?" she said with a smile, looking at the Giant King brothers.  Pfft! In an instant, an axe was viciously swung from behind her. The Sin Dragon Mother's slender waist was chopped, and she was knocked over ten meters away into another dune.  "Idiot!" the Black Giant King sneered coldly, raising his fist and rushing towards the desert man who was regaining consciousness. Their colliding fields of force warped the air and crashed into each other, causing a large wave of sand.  Ah!!! The Sin Dragon Mother, humiliated in public and her dress destroyed, furiously burst out of the sand dune, her body swelling and enlarging dramatically. In an instant, a massive dragon over ten meters long stood on all fours and roared ferociously at the desert man.  Buzz! The dragon's body was black, resembling a giant lizard with a pair of wings on its back that seemed to have atrophied into two spine-like protrusions. She opened her mouth to roar, and a large amount of fine gray mist sprayed out. The mist touched the ground, turning the sand into gray stone. On contact with corpses, they too turned into stone sculptures.  Two more people flew up behind the desert man, heading towards the Sin Dragon Mother with a solemn air, their hands emanating a golden glow that neutralized the petrifying breath. Both joined the battle, blocking her.  "With so many strong fighters... it looks like they're well-prepared," Lin Sheng said through his thick visor.  "You go too," he said, turning to Tian Gongxia who had followed him.  "I hope I can swing my sword a few more times," Tian Gongxia licked her lips and strode towards the battlefield. Lin Sheng, however, did not watch the battle but shifted his gaze to the northwest. There, a power wave similar to his own was stealthily observing the battle here.  "The last fragment?" Lin Sheng's lips curled.  "Launch the full assault. Fairy King."  "The battle there hasn't been decided yet. A full assault now might cause friendly fire," the Fairy King advised in a low voice.  "Do as I say," Lin Sheng was unmoved.  Swoosh! Suddenly, a sharp sound exploded behind him. Lin Sheng immediately felt a chill from the back of his heart. His force field was instantly breached, and the assassin's weapon penetrated the gaps in his Dawn Heavy Armor, piercing his skin. Chapter 470: Fierce Battle 3  Thud. The sound of the assassin's sharp blade, as precise as it could be, stabbing at Lin Sheng's back, was akin to chopping wood. Surprisingly, it didn't pierce through. Everything came to a standstill in an instant. The blade was stiffly stuck in the armor's gap, unable to move. At the same time, a massive and extremely dense natural force field suddenly replaced the previously calm and somewhat ordinary force field.  Lin Sheng didn't turn his head; instead, he struck back with a palm. His hand moved incredibly fast; as soon as it was raised, it had already instantly penetrated the assassin's chest. "This time, the assassin's strength is not bad," he murmured as he shook off the corpse, and his white holy power flashed past, instantly purifying the blood and dirt on his hand.  Wooooo! Amid the long sound of the horn, all the armies of the Evil Spirit Palace surged forward. The reserve legion in the rear began to move quietly and swiftly. The army, almost endless at a glance, suddenly engulfed and scattered the opposing desert legion like a tidal wave. Lin Sheng didn’t bother with the outcome; instead, he rode the Blood Demon step by step toward the direction where the aura fluctuations were coming from.  Every step the Blood Demon took seemed slow, but in reality, it was incredibly fast. This strong and burly Evil Spirit powerhouse carried Lin Sheng towards that direction. Soon, he had crossed several sand dunes, leaving everyone behind.  The Blood Demon automatically stopped at the edge of a dark green oasis, looking at the three people standing by the oasis from afar. These were three powerful desert warriors, each with a red gem embedded in their chests. The three of them looked at Lin Sheng solemnly.  This enemy they had been waiting to ambush was dressed in heavy armor, riding a black warhorse that was so strong it didn’t look like a horse at all, and even the horse was draped in thick armor. Before they even got close, they felt a suffocating pressure envelop them.  "Evil demon! It's him!" The only woman among them said coldly. "The Moonstone has lured him here for us! Kill!!" She drew the curved sword from her back, blue electricity flickering and leaping around her body as she charged toward Lin Sheng first.  At the same time, the other two men drew their swords and attacked from two other directions. The three coordinated seamlessly, as if they had been fighting together for many years. Three streaks of purple lightning surged from the three long swords, roaring into three lightning dragons that rushed towards Lin Sheng.  Several robed women quickly emerged from the bushes in the distant oasis. They chanted under their breaths, and a mysterious power fluctuation suddenly descended from midair, instantly suppressing most of the dark rotational force field protecting Lin Sheng.  "Oh?" Lin Sheng raised an eyebrow, "No wonder you dare to lure me out. It turns out there really is a way to suppress the protective force on my body."  He remained on horseback, facing several attacks and suddenly grabbed with his hand. Shiiing! Highly condensed holy power suddenly turned into a three-meter-long giant sword in his hand. Whoosh! The holy power giant sword slashed towards the three people coming at him.  Before the sword even touched their blades, an invisible and terrifying force field firmly suppressed the lightning dragons released by the three. Puff puff puff! The three lightning dragons collapsed in the blink of an eye. The giant sword, with its terrifying force, slammed down in front of the first woman who narrowly dodged.  Boom!!! A ten-meter-long pitch-black crack appeared out of thin air in front of Lin Sheng. He pulled out the giant sword and looked down from a height at the female swordsman who had just dodged by a hair’s breadth.  "What just dodged my attack? What power was that?" "Answer me!" He opened his eyes and swung his sword into the air on his right.  Boom!! An invisible wave was instantly shattered and exploded. The robed figures who were casting spells in the distance suddenly spewed blood from their mouths, fell to the ground weakened, their faces pale as paper.  "Evil demon!! This is the birthplace of the Moonstone, known as the original pool of the Immaculate Land! Regret it, daring to come here alone. Next year on this day will be your death anniversary!!" Another imposing elder emerged from the depths of the oasis.  The elder held a giant war hammer in each hand. Each war hammer was almost as big as an adult. The two war hammers together, just by their appearance, were clearly no ordinary weight. The elder's hair was all braided into tiny braids, with a messy beard draped over his chest, wearing a somewhat ancient and fierce black armor, in sharp contrast to Lin Sheng's pure white armor.  "At such an old age, instead of enjoying peace at home, you come here to seek death." Lin Sheng's eyes flickered with interest as he sized up the elder.  "I am five hundred and four years old this year, and I just had my birthday not long ago. I never expected that at the end of my life, the heavens would bestow upon me a great battle," the elder laughed heartily.  "If you want to kill me, let's see if you have the ability!" Behind him, a tiger's roar sounded, and a huge, majestic pitch-black tiger appeared out of nowhere. The tiger seemed to be already equipped with armor and weapons. He mounted the tiger, wielded the war hammer with a heavy strike.  "My head is here, come and take it!!" With a fierce roar, the elder spurred the tiger to leap forward, jumping high and covering more than ten meters to pounce towards Lin Sheng.  Lin Sheng narrowed his eyes, clearly sensing a strong fragment fluctuation vibrating and spreading from the elder's body.  "Putting all the treasures on this old guy?" He sneered and lifted the sword for a slash!  Whoosh!! Boom!!!!!! The blade brought out a streak of white light, suddenly colliding with the war hammer coming from above. A transparent ripple exploded from between the two, scattering in all directions. Where the ripple passed, the ground's gravel flew, and the shrubs of the oasis were torn and cut apart. It was as though an invisible blade had cut through everything in the blink of an eye.  The strength of this elder was astonishing. To confront Lin Sheng head-on and not be outdone was a shock to Lin Sheng's heart. He had almost given up half of his human bloodline to break through the limit in exchange for the blood of a rock dragon. With the blood of a rock dragon, he was almost as powerful as half a rock dragon. Yet in this situation, this old man could stand against him?  His heart was taken aback, but his hands did not stop. The giant holy sword, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, constantly collided with the war hammer.  The two realized the other was a formidable enemy they had rarely encountered in their lives. The elder, as an undefeated war god in this realm of evil spirits, had been invincible for hundreds of years, with no one ever surpassing him. Whether it was martial arts or physical strength, he had reached the limit of what humans could achieve. But unexpectedly, the man before him could contend with him head-on and even slightly suppress him.  Lin Sheng, with the soul memories of countless fierce battles merged, was extremely experienced in combat and proficient in many sword techniques and killing moves. Because he used to be able to easily resolve battles with other powers, he seldom had the chance to use his exaggerated martial prowess. But now, as his protective forces were suppressed and he temporarily did not want to reveal his trump cards, he wanted to first figure out the details of the opponent. So he only used his physical martial arts.  Unexpectedly, he was blocked by this old man?  The two wielding heavy weapons exchanged blows like lightning. The giant sword and war hammer collided and blocked each other, emitting terrifying shockwaves of destruction. Within a radius of several tens of meters, it had become a death zone. Chapter 471: Conflict 1  Adolf gazed at Farudo, who was continuously sealed in mid-air. A sense of ominous premonition grew heavier in his heart. However, this premonition was not something he could easily discuss with others. At this point, they were bound by the so-called righteousness of the human race. Whether they were willing or not, they were forced to this stage. If he suddenly said he had a bad feeling and wanted to withdraw, no one knew what the outcome would be.  The group quietly approached the sealed battlefield, concealed by the ability of a Destiny Sacred Artifact that provided stealth. From a distance, it didn't seem dangerous. But as they drew closer, they felt the dangers of the battlefield. The chaotic energy fluctuations collided and compressed against each other. The energies of different people contained their wills. Energies determined by different wills, like soldiers, clashed and fought against each other. Standing merely a hundred meters away from the battlefield, they could feel the ground shaking with every intense explosion. The cries of battle and the roars of monsters came in waves, one after another. Just standing at the edge of the battlefield made Adolf's scalp tingle. Not just him, the others who accompanied him also felt weak in the knees, pale-faced. They lived in a peaceful environment without the experience of battlefields, and now they were abruptly facing this supernatural and fierce war.  Looking at the battlefield's edge littered with severed limbs, flesh, and viscera, as well as the carcasses of ferocious, sharp monsters, one of the women in pajamas couldn't help but start retching.  "Alright, let's not delay any longer. We just need to activate the power of the Destiny Sacred Artifact and then converge it together, right?" said the leading old man in a deep voice.  "Yes. After that, the heroic spirits will take over everything," the voice of the Great Sage echoed in everyone's ears again.  "Then, let's begin," the old man turned back and looked at the others.  Everyone heard the voice of the Great Sage and knew what they needed to do next. Adolf stood among the crowd and nodded slightly. Together with everyone, he began to release his internal power. However, as he did so, the sense of foreboding in his heart became even clearer.  ...  "Kill!!" In the black desert.  Two tall figures once again swung their weapons and collided fiercely. The clash of the blades emitted a sharp, piercing sound. The elder, wielding his weapon with overwhelming force, pressed down hard.  Boom!! The black behemoth under the elder couldn't bear the load and let out a piteous cry, its front legs kneeling on the sandy ground.  The elder's expression changed drastically. They had been fighting for at least three hours. Yet, the demon opposite him not only showed no signs of exhaustion, but his strength seemed to be growing stronger, fighting more vigorously as the battle went on. Any wounds inflicted on the opponent would heal in a short time. Moreover, the heavy white armor worn by the adversary was incredibly difficult to penetrate. Even as a War God, he had never seen a fighter maintain such high-intensity combat for so long.  If it were his younger days, perhaps he could have persisted twice as long. But things were different now. He was old.  "What a pity, the power of the Wish Moonstone has suddenly disappeared. Otherwise, my power would be far greater than it is now," he said as he pushed back his opponent and retreated dozens of meters with the giant tiger.  "Wish Moonstone? Where do you think the power of the Wish Moonstone has gone? If not for it, would my strength be limited to this?" Lin Sheng also sneered in response.  "Alright. You should understand by now what the Wish Moonstone has brought you here for," he said with an implication.  The elder was slightly startled and followed Lin Sheng's gaze around him. He saw that many of his companions, who were previously lively and unharmed, were now affected by the aftermath, with heavy casualties. He suddenly had a bad feeling.  "Or do you really think that it wants you to eliminate me? In other words, do you really believe that you people could kill me?" Lin Sheng spoke loudly.  The elder suddenly noticed a detail. On several bodies on the field, the Wish Moonstones on their chests had disappeared, mysteriously missing.  "Could it be...!?" He suddenly thought of the most terrifying possibility.  "You guessed right; it's reclaiming the power it once granted you. If I'm not mistaken, these powers should have already integrated with you. And the only way to take back the power is to kill you," Lin Sheng said with a hint of pity.  The elder also thought of this possibility. However, having possessed the Wish Moonstone for hundreds of years, he did not want to think in that direction.  "Your strength is not bad. Even without the Wish Moonstone, it's extraordinary. Among those at my side, there is only one who can be compared to you," Lin Sheng stated frankly.  So, do you want to come under my command? I will grant you a longer lifespan. In return, you fight for me."  This old man's strength was indeed strong. Among those around Lin Sheng, only Tian Gongxia could be compared to him.  The elder's weapon carried an indescribable enormous impact. This impact was different from the Giant King's vibrational force. He could enhance the power of smashing, hitting, and hammering techniques to the extreme. Moreover, it seemed that the elder had cultivated an ability to resist various energy resistances.  Therefore, this guy was essentially a powerful berserker with advanced magic resistance. His strength was too strong, making the force fields used by the others seem like thin bubbles that would burst upon contact.  "Moreover... I was just playing with you before," Lin Sheng shook his slightly cracked holy light greatsword, condensing and restoring it to its pristine condition.  Scales and sharp spiral horns extended from his body. His figure also rapidly expanded and grew, becoming at least half a size larger than before.  "Now, enjoy the battle!!" With a dragon's roar, he charged towards the elder on his steed, swinging his greatsword like a flash of white light, and struck the elder's shoulder with a thunderous impact.  The speed of this sword strike was so fast that the elder, still reeling from his previous shock, had not had time to react before being hit.  His strength had actually reached a level close to that of Tian Gongxia. Yet even at that level, he was no match for Lin Sheng at this moment. His strength had skyrocketed to an unimaginable level after obtaining the Yin-turning Evil Wheel. Most of the protections from the Eighty-Eight Blessings were suppressed by the Wish Moonstone, but the essential changes and enhancements to Lin Sheng's own being were still present.  The speed and power of this sword strike had reached the limit that the surrounding air could accommodate. When the sword was swung, the excessive speed generated a tremendous thunderous noise, accompanied by flames and lightning from the friction.  Only when the elder was struck by the sword did the sound of Lin Sheng's strike reach his ears.  The elder, along with the giant tiger, burst into a mass of crisp sounds, smashed forcefully into the sand by the greatsword, unable to move.  He couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood, his will to fight already lost due to the Wish Moonstone's sinister intentions. After being struck by this sword, he found it even harder to continue.  "So you're saying, you're not a demon? The Wish Moonstone is?" he asked with a bitter smile, wiping the blood from his mouth.  "Of course, I am the Holy Spirit King. My vast holy power originates from the power to heal and save living beings. How could I possibly be a demon?" Lin Sheng said earnestly. Chapter 472: Conflict 2  "The Holy Spirit King....." The elder still had doubts in his heart. However, the Wish Moonstone Crystal on his chest, which kept trying to break free, forced him to make a choice at this moment. It was a choice between dying in a meaningless battle for the Wish Moonstone or temporarily setting aside his doubts and submitting to the other party. The answer was self-evident.  "Have you made up your mind?" Lin Sheng could already see the elder's decision in his eyes.  "Can you give me some time?" the elder asked with a wry smile.  "Of course. Those who are outstanding and capable deserve preferential treatment," Lin Sheng said with a smile.  There was no longer a reason for the two to fight. The elder no longer had any hostility.  After being healed by Lin Sheng with holy power, the elder experienced the strong healing capabilities of the holy power for himself. His belief in Lin Sheng's claim to be the Holy Spirit King was further solidified.  The elder's name was Ning Jia. He detailed the situation of the desert for Lin Sheng. Long ago, a divine stone known as the Wish Moonstone fell from the sky, teaching countless people a cultivation method called Wish Moon Power.  Lin Sheng inquired carefully about the cultivation method of Wish Moon Power.  He then obtained something called a Wish Moonstone Crystal from Ning Jia. It was the red gemstone embedded in his chest.  As expected, the so-called Wish Moonstone Crystal was actually a part of the Wish Moonstone itself. It was a sub-entity intentionally absorbing the life force cultivated by these people.  Holding the crystal, Lin Sheng had elder Ning Jia lead the way to other places to search for the original landing site of the Wish Moonstone.  At the landing site, Ning Jia finally saw the many Wish Moon Power cultivators who had died without any battle, simply collapsing to the ground.  The Wish Moonstone had not only absorbed their Wish Moonstone Crystals but also their entire life force.  This made Ning Jia truly see the true face of the Wish Moonstone. Under the recovery of Lin Sheng's holy power, he finally resolved to lead the army of the Evil Spirit Palace to turn against and campaign against the Wish Moonstone.  The campaign did not last long.  After Ning Jia defected, under his considerable reputation and connections, and with the continuous appearance of many corpses drained of their Wish Moonstone Crystals, the entire desert secret realm began to become the Evil Spirit Palace's guide at an exaggerated pace.  Although Ning Jia no longer had the Wish Moonstone Crystal, Lin Sheng also bestowed upon him a seed of holy power. His soul was strong and tenacious to the extent that even the Wish Moonstone could not absorb it through the air, and his cultivation of holy power advanced by leaps and bounds.  Moreover, the effect of the holy power nourished his aging body in return.  Although he lost the cultivation he had accumulated for a long time, the characteristics of holy power compensated him in terms of pure strength and physical power.  Thus, his strength did not decline too much. He was still capable of defeating anyone aside from Tian Gong Xia and other ranked envoys. He was even a notch stronger than the Sin Dragon Mother.  After cultivating holy power, he truly became another top powerhouse under Lin Sheng's command.  The Evil Spirit Palace's army no longer had a reason to fight, and most began to withdraw slowly.  With the support of the war god elder Ning Jia, the power of the Black Desert was fully mobilized.  Many who were not qualified to cultivate the Wish Moonstone Crystal, as well as powerhouses like Ning Jia who were too strong to be absorbed by the Wish Moonstone from afar, automatically joined Ning Jia's forces under panic and a shared enemy, becoming a subsidiary force of the Evil Spirit Palace.  They led Lin Sheng directly to the location of the Wish Moonstone in the secret realm of the desert—Black Gold City.  Now their intention to destroy the Wish Moonstone was even stronger than Lin Sheng's.  After all, this was now a matter of life and death for them.  And at this moment in reality, the sealing battle at Redwing had come to a close after several days of stalemate.  Redwing had officially switched its allegiance to the Underworld.  The entrance to Heaven Tower was tightly closed, and the plains outside were a mess of wreckage.  There were no bones to be seen, nor traces of the previous formations.  Everything had turned into a massive change. The land seemed to be completely covered by a thick layer of red soil.  The red soil buried and erased all traces.  Some strong beings of evil power crossed the Black Tide monster tribes to investigate the situation at Heaven Tower, but the maze was sealed, and no fluctuations of aura could enter.  And the unparalleled giant demon Farudo had also disappeared without a trace.  Some speculated that the sealing might have been successful. Others guessed that Farudo might have entered the secret realm.  But no matter what, the world had temporarily calmed down.  ................ ................ Heaven Tower Secret Realm.  In the towering white spires of the forest, inside the Ice and Snow Council Hall, which belonged to the deepest part of Heaven Tower.  The Council Hall had now completely become a dark abyss filled with grey-black smoke and Underworld energy.  Stone pillars rose from the ground, topped with dark red chains, binding one naked, howling person after another.  These living people were all strong beings of evil power who once belonged to Heaven Tower.  They were unwilling to submit to Farudo, and Farudo did not care about these trash, as subduing them would waste his time.  He simply turned them into Underworld pillars to accumulate energy for himself to open the channel to the Underworld.  This war made him realize that attacking a secret realm was somewhat troublesome.  Therefore, he decided to immediately open a channel, bring down a projection of part of his true body, and strengthen himself once more.  But before that, he had to deal with some unexpected little surprises he had caught.  He quickly walked into the rear side of the Council Hall, where there was a small rest area meant for temporary accommodation for those waiting.  Now, it had been transformed by him into a special experimental site.  Six people, six ordinary humans with special powers in their bodies, were captured by him on the edge of the battlefield.  At that time, he had just crushed the entire power of Heaven Tower, and then he encountered this group of sneaky little fellows on the side, who released a faint malice towards him.  To his age, these people indeed could be called little fellows. After all, their ages didn't even amount to a fraction of his.  He was very interested in the strange powers these people possessed.  So after confirming they posed no threat, he easily defeated them all, brought them into Heaven Tower, and left them here.  Farudo activated the Eyes of the Dead. It was a special ability that could, to a certain extent, see through the essence and origins of power, one of the special powers of an Underworld Spell Officer.  The Eyes of the Dead scanned over each person.  Soon, the special power of one of them made him pause slightly.  "What is this? Light? White power?"  Farudo's Eyes of the Dead suddenly stopped on Adolf.  He was attracted by the somewhat dazzling light.  In the gloomy palace, he slowly walked up to this bearer of the Destiny Holy Artifact who had been captured for a long time.  "Tell me, what is this??" He grabbed Adolf's chin and transmitted a stream of Underworld energy to awaken him.  Underworld energy, as a special power only high-ranking beings of the Underworld possessed, had the ability to stimulate potential and temporarily revive. Chapter 473 Conflict 3  Adolf, already seriously injured, was now also starved for a long time, without water for several days. At this point, he was nearly at the end of his tether. He was unclear why in the end, despite all abilities converging, the so-called fated heroic soul still did not appear. But regardless, this was his own choice. He had no regrets.  "Heh..." He forced a faint smile, not wanting to reply at all.  "Admirable spirit," Farudo said with appreciation. "But it's a pity. The stronger a person is, the quicker they tend to die in reality."  "Then... kill me," Adolf said calmly.  He had left in the first place to avoid involving anyone else. Now that everything had reached an outcome he had anticipated, nothing really mattered anymore. He would die. Then all consequences would be borne by him alone, without involving or implicating anyone else.  "Pitiful," Farudo noticed his thoughts. He let go of his grasp, looking at the six fated holy relic holders he had caught.  "Infernal Curse," he raised his right hand. "From order to the chaos of disorder, the shadow of radiance, the land of decay, in the name of Farudo. I hereby summon."  Slowly, a mass of pitch-black hair began to grow in the palm of his hand. The numerous strands of hair, like the deepest black of night, flowed out to cover all the floors around the great hall.  "Infernal master of demonic words, my voice is the voice of the abyss. With flesh and blood as a sacrifice, summon my true form sleeping within the great divine pillar. Let this pact be established."  Farudo lowered his hand, and the hair in his palm was cleanly cut off, scattering on the ground like living creatures, crawling in all directions. He walked slowly towards the six people.  "Evil Soul's Eye." He switched to another type of eye technique. This one was specially used to capture living souls, a special sacrificial eye. It could use the souls captured within it as offerings, amplifying the effect nearly tenfold.  He walked up to the first person, his eyes flashing with triangular pyramid-shaped purple-black patterns, staring at the person's forehead.  Hiss... Soon, a pale, bubble-like blue human figure slowly floated out from the person, then turned into a long thin line, shooting rapidly into Farudo's right eye.  "The first one." He continued towards the second person.  Quickly, another human-shaped soul was slowly drawn out, flying into his right eye and disappearing.  Then the third person.  Xie Qiaoyue leaned against Adolf in a daze, watching Farudo capture souls one by one, her body instantly breaking out in goosebumps, feeling as if she were a lost soul. She too had rushed over because of this summons, but unfortunately was captured before succeeding. Due to a long period without food, she was also at the point of weakness and had no strength to resist.  Quickly, Farudo walked up to her. Those soul-capturing eyes stared straight at her.  Suddenly, he paused slightly, his gaze attracted to Adolf beside her. Seeming hesitant, he still walked over first, standing in front of Adolf. He decided to first absorb this somewhat suspicious fellow to prevent any accidents.  An invisible force of capture began to operate slowly, with Farudo's pupils releasing a strange, eerie force field, enveloping Adolf. This power began to quickly erode Adolf's body, and his soul was drawn out from within.  At that moment.  Shu!! Suddenly, a white light burst forth from Adolf's body.  The light was pure and majestic, with a flash that isolated the soul-capturing power.  Feeling the strength of the capturing force, the white light seemed to be affected, quickly covering Adolf's entire body.  "En!?" Farudo was slightly surprised; was there actually a power that could resist his Evil Soul's Eye?  He operated the Evil Soul's Eye again, increasing the power as he looked towards Adolf.  "Capture!"  The power increased. In an instant, it provoked a reactive stimulation from the white light.  A vague and powerful will, full of defiance, began to slowly awaken from within the light.  "The one who defeated my disciple, is it you?" The will slowly vibrated, expressing consciousness.  "Who are you?" Farudo's gaze sharpened.  The other party was able to demonstrate their own will through pure power. This ability was not something ordinary beings could possess. Clearly, the individual within the white light was no simple character.  "Me? Just a nobody," the consciousness in the white light echoed back. "But since I have awakened. My main body will also sense it."  "So, you can defeat my disciple, but you cannot kill him. A person's life is full of many failures. But as long as he does not die, I can give him another chance."  "Cannot kill him?" Farudo's expression turned into a cold smile.  "This is my advice to you," the consciousness in the white light calmly said. "Other people's lives, even if they fail, will still have many opportunities. But you are different. Since you have encountered me. Then you only have one chance to answer me."  "Very well. Then my answer is." Farudo suddenly stretched out his finger.  Puff.  His fingertip precisely pointed at the center of Adolf's forehead. A surge of dark nether energy rushed in, instantly destroying and mashing Adolf's brain.  "This is my answer." He withdrew his hand. "Capture the soul!"  Suddenly, the invisible soul-capturing force beside him greatly intensified and became stronger. It forcibly began to pull out the pale blue transparent soul from Adolf's body.  As an infernal official of demonic words, Farudo would not care about such a threat. He held no regard for the entire human realm, let alone a mere consciousness hiding within energy.  Accompanied by a piercing scream, the blue soul seemed to be crazily tugged by two forces. The divine light's power was pulling it back into the body, while the Evil Soul's Eye's power was pulling it into the pupil.  "Good! Very good!!" The will within the white light laughed in extreme anger. "We will meet soon."  He gave Farudo a deep look, the divine light's power quickly began to dissipate; this small amount of power was only a part left in Adolf to protect his body, naturally it couldn't withstand Farudo's direct action.  "I will wait for you here."  Farudo smiled, grasping Adolf's soul with one hand, his pupils flashing with deep purple magical array patterns.  ...  ...  Evil Spirit Palace.  Lin Sheng sat on the throne, his hair hanging low, sitting motionless.  Boom!!!  Suddenly, he swept the low table in front of him aside. The violent power of the dragon sent the drinks and cakes placed on top, along with the table, flying and crashing into the palace wall.  A dragon-shaped sculpture carved on the wall had its neck broken and rolled to the ground, scattering debris everywhere.  "Infernal official of demonic words? Farudo??! Heh..."  He stood up, with all his trembling servants kneeling down, he strode towards the inner hall, the Hall of Yin and Yang.  Ever since he had mastered the Yin Evil Wheel, he had been smooth sailing, never encountering any major setbacks. This had somewhat inflated his ego.  But at this moment, that one finger from Farudo made him experience the feeling of defeat he hadn't had for a long time.  It also made him lose a disciple he was very close to forever.  It was his fault. If he hadn't shown up, perhaps Adolf wouldn't have been killed so easily...  Rage boiled in his chest.  Lin Sheng walked into the Hall of Yin and Yang. He started to manipulate the scenery technique set up by the Fairy King. It was a special communication technique that could connect all legion commanders.  He was about to activate the technique with his hand, informing all legion commanders to gather here, ready to officially step into reality.  But a more crazy idea suddenly formed in his mind.  "Protection of Teleportation." He pointed at the ground with his hand. Instantly, a light red vortex door slowly emerged and formed.  Without hesitation, Lin Sheng stepped into it, his figure quickly disappearing into the vortex door. Chapter 475: Rescue 1  Legend has it that this place was born here. History is obliterated here. A huge gray and black vortex eternally rotates in the sky. On the ground, massive dark twisted columns of smoke can be seen everywhere, with faces of agony intermittently visible on the surface, floating up and down within the smoke. These are the countless souls absorbed from other worlds. Among them, some are humans, some are non-humans. But regardless of the race, once their souls arrive here after death, they are destined to become fodder.  Columns of giant black smoke stretch from the earth to the sky, like colossal pillars supporting the heavens and the earth, transforming this entire world into a cavernous space. The Underworld, also known as the Dust World, is a vast world that exists on the reverse side of our world, subsisting for a long time by absorbing numerous souls. To this place, the souls of the world, whether they are good or evil, are considered excellent nourishment for itself.  Columns of pitch-black smoke densely cover the land filled with black cracks. Within one of the thickest smoke columns—Splash! A giant black claw slowly extends from the smoke. The claw has three sharp and thick spikes, followed by a thick and strong gray arm, upper body, and a huge crocodile head. The being that walks out from the smoke column is a towering crocodile man hundreds of meters tall. Its green eyes flicker with a wild and ruthless light, following a faint summons in its consciousness.  It tears open the space in front of it with a swipe of its claw, creating a pitch-black fissure and steps into it slowly. "So soon, Farudo wants to summon more of his essence? Ridiculous, I, Demon Blade Officer Silvis, respond to your request," a vast and indistinct voice reverberates around. Just as it prepares to close the space fissure, a beam of pure white light descends from the sky out of nowhere, accurately landing next to the huge smoke column, right at the edge of the fissure it tore open. The light column, slender and sharp compared to the smoke column, is like a white spike driven into the earth. Although much smaller in volume, its power fluctuations are not weak.  "Is this the Underworld?" As Demon Blade Officer Silvis is taken aback, a deep voice resonates from within the light column. Hiss!!! In an instant, the white light column, like ink dropped into clear water, swiftly spreads out a massive amount of white light patterns. Among the countless light patterns, a knight clad in heavy white armor quietly floats within the light column, slowly rising and falling.  "This place is the Great Divine Pillar, where many of the Underworld's god officials slumber. Who are you?" Demon Blade Officer Silvis, feeling the pure white light's somewhat domineering aura that sweeps through everything, takes the initiative to ask.  "I am the Holy Spirit King!" The pure white knight's body suddenly swells and grows larger, with two sharp spiral horns emerging from his head, and a more terrifying chaotic soul force infinitely mingles with the holy light, spreading outwards in all directions. These holy lights and chaotic soul forces, once entering the Underworld, are like wolves rushing into a flock of sheep, where they meet no resistance in their path of destruction.  Boom!! A massive amount of holy power and chaotic soul force form a formidable force beyond the rank of Emissary, exploding in an instant and radiating to the surrounding hundreds of meters. The area within hundreds of meters is enveloped in white. This causes Demon Blade Officer Silvis, who had somewhat underestimated its size, to immediately become cautious. Instinct tells him that the nature of the opponent's power seems to be very restraining to him. If they really fought, even if he was stronger than his opponent, the outcome might not be optimistic.  "Holy Spirit King? I am the Underworld's vanguard, Demon Blade Officer Silvis!" From within the spatial fissure, the crocodile man steps back out to his original position, looking down from a height at Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng, too, lifts his head to gaze at this towering behemoth. The two have a vast difference in size, yet their auras seem to be evenly matched.  "I have never heard of the title Holy Spirit King, although there is a nearby space where a group claims to be a race of evil spirits." Silvis, having lived a long life, naturally has heard of evil spirits.  "My powers are not yet fully activated, and you, the Demon Speech Officer Farudo of the Underworld, dare to take advantage of my unpreparedness, killing my disciple and seizing his soul!" Lin Sheng coldly says, not directly answering the other's guess.  "Demon Speech Officer Farudo?" Demon Blade Officer Silvis suddenly bursts into laughter. "It seems you are also intending to trouble that fellow. Demon Speech Officer Farudo has quite a few enemies in the Underworld. How about it? Shall we join forces to kill him?"  "Enemy?" Lin Sheng originally thought there would be a great battle upon entering, but he didn't expect to hear such intelligence content right away. Fortunately, they are both top soul force manipulators, and they communicate directly through soul force without worrying about the language barrier. Otherwise, he might really miss important information here.  "That's right," Demon Blade Officer laughs, "otherwise, why do you think so many god officials exist, and yet only he manages to sneak out so quickly? There are not a few god officials inside the Great Divine Pillar that he has offended in the past. It's just that there are too many enemies here, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to mix in. If those god officials knew he sneaked out, they would not let him go easily."  "Is that so?" Lin Sheng's thoughts race in his mind.  "That being said, you should know where Demon Speech Officer Farudo's essence is, right?"  "I don't know. If other god officials could easily find out his essence, Farudo wouldn't have been able to live so well for so many years," Silvis replies with a sneer, "From the fluctuations of your aura, it seems you are not from the human world. We need to find another portal to the human world..."  "I can open a portal to the human world," Lin Sheng states calmly.  "However, since both of us want to kill Farudo, what good plan do you have?"  "There is a plan. Farudo has too many enemies in the Underworld, so he has to find opportunities to escape. This time he found one, so we must strike a fatal blow and completely eradicate his soul. Therefore, the plan cannot be easily told to you," Silvis candidly states.  "I understand," Lin Sheng nods, "But if I help you open a portal to the human world, that should be enough to prove that I am not Farudo's inside man, right?"  "That can work," Demon Blade Officer agrees readily, "As long as you can open the portal to the human world and locate Farudo's essence. I have already pulled in another god official, and we will take action together."  "It would be best to let Farudo completely summon his essence before we act. I want his soul to be annihilated without a trace!" Lin Sheng declares fiercely.  "However, in that case, you must first take us into the human world. Otherwise, if we arrive at the last minute, we won't have enough strength to kill Farudo completely. Even if we can't beat him, as a Demon Speech Officer, his ability to escape is extremely strong. We cannot be the slightest bit negligent," Silvis whispers.  "Okay," Lin Sheng agrees, appearing angry on the surface, but his heart remains undisturbed. This big guy seemingly wants to kill Farudo and also take the opportunity to enter the human world for enjoyment.  What he doesn't realize is that the human world is not actually the most critical threat to the invasion from the Underworld. The most dangerous is actually the Black Tide. The Underworld of the Dust World and the Black Tide are threats of completely different levels. It's just that on the surface, the Underworld's nether energy and death qi look similar to the Black Tide's black qi. But in reality, they are two different types of forces. 
Chapter 805: The Last Story  "In the East Campus?" Zhou Tu hesitated for a moment. Whether it was seniors or teachers, they had all warned the freshmen not to approach the East Campus. They did not specify the reasons, but from their tone, it was clear that the East Campus was dangerous.  "You have a deep misunderstanding about the East Campus. It's actually not much different from here; it's just that the two campuses are managed in completely different ways. They live in real terror, while you live in false happiness," Chen Ge looked into Zhou Tu's eyes. "Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope because at least they know who they are and know how to find liberation."  Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu. Whether it was students from the East Campus or the West Campus, all of them were trapped in this school.  The memories of the students in the West Campus had been altered, repeating the life scripted by the manipulator behind the scenes. The students in the East Campus, at least, knew to look for scapegoats and ways to escape.  "Students from the East Campus are closer to hope? But I heard that only the unwanted trash from the West Campus would be sent there."  Zhou Tu had been persuaded, but he still felt somewhat uneasy.  "No matter what the criteria for judgment are, any school that treats its students as trash is definitely a rubbish school," Chen Ge pointed to the high wall between the two campuses. "Do you know why that wall exists?"  "Why?"  "Because the school fears losing control. They use various methods to reshape human nature, but they forget that human nature is the most complex thing in the world. The events have already happened, and no matter how much they are forgotten, the scars will always be branded on the heart. Not remembering anything doesn't mean they don't exist, so some of the school's plans are doomed to fail."  Chen Ge said something that the club members couldn't understand. They didn't know why Chen Ge said this, but they felt that there seemed to be some truth to his words.  Children are inherently curious, and Chen Ge kept telling them the truth about the school, eventually sparking the club members' interest.  "So we're going now? To be honest, I really don't believe that there would be the art studio of my dreams in the East Campus," Zhou Tu whispered.  "Now is not the time," Chen Ge turned his head to look at a shadow. The dark figure in dormitory 413 was still sleeping, but its body had undergone a significant change.  If one looked closely, they would notice that Chen Ge's shadow was different from others—dark as ink, as if all light that shone upon it would be swallowed up.  It seemed to have become much stronger.  The enormous potential of the dark shadow was a good thing for Chen Ge. Once it awoke, Chen Ge would lead the students back to the East Campus to target isolated evil spirits again.  This would not only enhance his own strength but also muddle the stagnant waters of the school, covering for another "murderer" in the academy.  "We are still in the stage of accumulating strength. Before the school master notices this little bug, I need to prepare as many cards up my sleeve as possible," Chen Ge turned his head to look at Wang Yicheng, the club member who joined first and was a boy with a limp. Chen Ge was familiar with the stories of the other three club members, leaving only his.  "Our next destination is Wang Yicheng's dormitory."  "To my dormitory?" Wang Yicheng reacted strangely, waving his hands repeatedly, "Forget it, there's nothing interesting about the dormitory I live in."  "When you say this sentence, your voice is higher than usual, your speech rate is faster, and your eyes are evasive. You really are not good at lying," Chen Ge gently put his arm around Wang Yicheng's shoulder. "Why don't you want us to go? Are you worried about what we might see?"  "I..." Wang Yicheng struggled to find the right words and finally turned his gaze elsewhere. "It's nothing, let's just go directly."  "Alright."  Wang Yicheng lived in dormitory 413 of the West Campus, and Lin Sisi lived in dormitory 413 of the East Campus.  The dormitory numbers were exactly the same, but in the West Campus's 413, students occupied all the beds except for bed number four, while in the East Campus, it was the opposite—only bed number four was occupied, and the other beds were empty.  "Let's not tell anyone else the secrets of our club. Everyone try to keep a low profile. There are teachers like me in this school, but also some who are not so easy to talk to," Chen Ge was always on guard. The noise they made in the laboratory building was too loud, and the school authorities were likely to have started investigating.  "There's not much time left for me. After visiting dormitory 413, I'll need to lay low for a while."  There are four dormitory buildings in the male student dormitory area of the West Campus, several times more than the number of students in the East Campus. The lights had not yet been turned off, and it was the liveliest time in the male dormitory, with sounds of washing, plastic basins dropping, and conversations clearly audible even from downstairs.  "This building is similar to the one in the East Campus."  Chen Ge acted very naturally, following the four students into the first building.  The dormitory supervisor’s small living quarters had a closed door, but the glass window was open, and inside, a woman in her fifties was humming a song, looking in a good mood.  Next to the small window, there was a notice that strictly prohibited the use of high-power electrical appliances in the dormitory and forbade students from cooking in the dormitory.  "I remember that the notice in the East Campus dormitory building said—recently, a vicious case occurred, and students are prohibited from going out after lights out."  A wall apart, it was almost two different worlds, just like inside and outside of a "door."  Passing through the corridor, Chen Ge and the club members arrived at the door of dormitory 413.  "This dormitory is no different from the others."  Wang Yicheng opened the door, and after entering the room, the other people in the dormitory acted as if he didn't exist, doing their own things without speaking to him.  After Wang Yicheng walked a few steps inside, the boy sleeping on the bed next to the door suddenly lifted his mosquito net and glared at him: "How many times have I said it? Close the door when you come in. Your leg is lame, are your ears also not working?"  The boy's words were unpleasant, and he seemed to have a strong dislike for Wang Yicheng.  "He didn't close the door because there are still people coming in after him. If you need an apology, we can apologize on his behalf, but I'm not sure what form of apology you require," Chen Ge grabbed the door handle and entered the room, giving the other people in the dormitory a glance.  The boy behind the mosquito net was intimidated when he saw Chen Ge, said nothing, and pulled the net back down with a dark face.  "Mr. Bai, this is bed number four. Since no one lives here, we use it to store luggage," Wang Yicheng pointed to bed number four, which had a few suitcases thrown on it. Only his luggage was stored under his own bed; the others had tossed their miscellaneous items and luggage onto bed number four.  Chen Ge was familiar with bed number four; he had lain on it himself in the East Campus.  Approaching bed number four, although no one was sleeping there, it was made up with bedding and sheets, which were now dirtied by the luggage and miscellaneous items. Zhang Ya's Extra Chapter: Let's Register Our Marriage (Birthday Special Free Chapter)  The city was enveloped in dark clouds, and the sky seemed almost within reach. Li Man stood by the window, watching the rainwater slide down the glass, leaving behind trails. The ticking of the clock on the wall filled the small room with the monotonous passage of time.  "5:30, time to get off work." Li Man stretched lazily, moved the succulents from the windowsill into the room, and walked over to her desk. She put away the sign that said 'Marriage Registration Office' into a drawer, glancing at the wall that read—Administer by Law, Civilized Service.  "With such heavy rain today, it's unlikely that anyone will come to register their marriage."  Humming a tune, Li Man began to clean up; the empty marriage registration office only had her inside, as the staff from the divorce registration office had left fifteen minutes earlier.  "Hello, is this where marriage certificates are processed?" The door opened, and a mature, magnetic male voice came from the entrance.  With such a pleasant voice, the man must be handsome.  Li Man looked up and saw a man in a black raincoat standing at the door of the marriage registration office. He had an ordinary appearance, but there was an indescribable aura about him.  "Yes, do you... want to apply for a marriage certificate?" Li Man scrutinized the man carefully; it was her first time seeing someone wearing a raincoat and carrying a heavy backpack to apply for a marriage certificate.  "Yes, I made an online appointment for today."  "What's your name?" Li Man asked.  "Chen Ge."  Li Man typed the name 'Chen Ge' into the computer and indeed saw his appointment request: "I'm about to finish work. Let's make this quick. Did you bring everything? The household registration books for both parties, IDs, and proof that you two are not direct blood relatives or collateral relatives within three generations."  "I've brought everything."  The man opened his backpack, rummaging through it. Li Man faintly heard a cat meow and curiously glanced into the man's backpack. Inside were a repeater, comic books, stuffed dolls, ballpoint pens, and a large white cat.  "Thank you for your trouble." The man handed over two household registration books and two ID cards to Li Man: "Everything is here. I've met the woman's family, and they are very satisfied with me."  "It seems you've made a lot of preparations."  After registering the man's information, Li Man was about to register the woman's details when she realized that the magnetic strip on the woman's ID card was unresponsive. Looking at the name on the woman's ID card, she suddenly realized something.  The man in front of her came to register for marriage, prepared all the documents, and even brought a cat, yet his girlfriend was nowhere to be seen.  "Wait a minute, sir." Li Man stopped what she was doing: "You're here to get married, right?"  "Yes."  "Where's your girlfriend? How can you get married alone?" Li Man said with a wry smile: "Both parties must be present to register for marriage."  The clock on the wall ticked, the rain outside grew heavier, and the man slightly pursed his lips, looking up at Li Man: "She's here, standing right behind me."  The rain hammered against the window, and the air inside the room started to feel tense.  "Sir, please don't joke. Marriage registration requires both parties to be present. I can't help you if you're alone."  Li Man clutched her chest, suddenly feeling a little short of breath.  "She really did come. We are inseparable; where I am, she is too." The man's eyes were clear, his tone stubborn.  Li Man, holding the demagnetized ID card in her hand, thought of a possibility. She flipped open the woman's household registration book and on the page with the woman's name was a stamp declaring her death, dated several years ago.  "Sir..."  Li Man wanted to say something, but seeing the man's obstinate expression, she felt moved. Her eyes swept over the man's backpack, and she looked at the items inside. Were these things the girl had once used? Were these preserved treasures memories of their time together? Was this cat a pet the girl had kept before she passed away?  In an instant, Li Man understood why the man had brought a heap of things to the marriage registration office and why he said his girlfriend was always with him. With eyes stinging, she held the girl's ID card, unsure of what to say, whether to comfort the man or to tell him the harsh truth.  Her lips parted slowly, but Li Man couldn't bring herself to speak the words she had prepared. She looked at the man in front of her, who seemed like a child, her feelings complex.  She forced a smile: "Sir, you must have loved her very much. How did you meet?"  "She pursued me. The first love letter I ever received was from her." The man's gaze drifted, as if reminiscing: "Our first date was at an abandoned school."  "An abandoned school? For a first date?"  "West City Private Academy. That place holds her obsessions and past. I stood in the hall where she used to practice dancing, my back against the mirror, against her, and we confided in each other."  Li Man listened silently, imagining the scene. On a quiet night, the two of them reminisced about the past in their deserted alma mater; the once lively and beautiful academy now only had them, back to back, nestled against each other—a tragically beautiful love.  "Our second date was at a psychiatric hospital. She wore a red dress, stunningly gorgeous, boldly beautiful."  "A psychiatric hospital?"  "Because of my parents, that day I..."  "I understand, sorry."  Li Man apologized before the man could finish, not wanting to pry into someone else's wounds; perhaps his parents were another sorrow in the man's heart.  "Our third date was in a building. I cornered the man who had once upset her in an elevator and taught him an unforgettable lesson."  "You really spoil your girlfriend. I bet she was very happy to hear about that."  "She was right beside me then."  The man's expression was tender as he recalled the scene in the haunted house club's building, with the elevator wrapped in black hair.  "That must have been a very romantic, heartwarming moment." Li Man thought the man was incredibly devoted.  "Our fourth date was in the morgue of the forensic medicine academy. She had been hurt but didn't tell me. She sat quietly beside me, as if she even snuck a hug."  The man's voice was very pleasant, husky with mature charm, as he reminisced about the past, an air so subtle that even Li Man unconsciously overlooked the morgue as an unusual dating spot.  "Our fifth date was on the rooftop of a small town, much like today, with heavy rain. She leaned against me."  Compared to the abandoned school, psychiatric hospital, and morgue, this dating spot was so normal that Li Man felt a bit uneasy: "Did you confess to her that day?"  The man nodded lightly: "I stood at the highest point of the town, shouting my feelings to that strange world, believing there's nothing more romantic than being inseparable for life."  "Wow."  Li Man had heard many people's stories, but none as shocking as Chen Ge's, perhaps because she had seen the death certificate on the household registration book and already knew the outcome: "What happened after that?"  "After that..." Chen Ge took a deep breath: "She fell asleep, it will be a very long time before she wakes up, and I've been waiting for her."  The death certificate on the household registration book felt like a needle piercing Li Man's heart, and tears involuntarily welled up in her eyes. Bowing her head, Li Man pretended to look for something, secretly wiping away tears behind the computer.  The room was silent until the man broke the quiet, his hand gently resting on an empty seat beside him as if his girlfriend were sitting there: "Our sixth date..."  It didn't matter what the man said next; Li Man knew that after his wife's accident, the man had trapped himself in a prison called love, believing his girlfriend was still in this world. Out of deep love, he refused to accept the reality of her departure.  Her hands clasped together, knuckles white, Li Man wanted to tell Chen Ge the truth, but she couldn't bear to do so. She buried her face behind the computer, entering all the information into the application form, wanting to fulfill the man's dream, but when she pressed the confirm button, the computer displayed a page indicating a mismatch in household registration data.  The girl had died many years ago; she no longer existed in the household registration data.  Reality struck Li Man like a bucket of ice water. She looked at the man's face, lost in memories, bit her lip, and said: "Sir, our data is incomplete, the system is being upgraded, and I can't process your application right now. Please come back in a week."  Li Man wanted to help the man, even if it meant creating a similar, albeit legally ineffective, little red book.  "Alright, then sorry to trouble you."  The man slowly stood up, packed everything, and walked towards the exit. At the door, he suddenly took off his raincoat, holding it over his head as if someone else was there beside him: "Zhang Ya, don't stray too far, the rain is getting heavy."  Li Man had a clear view from inside the room; there was no one under the man's raincoat but himself.  Watching the man's retreating figure, Li Man wiped the corner of her eye: "Perhaps this is love, infatuated with you, loyal to you, wholehearted for you, ending with you." Chapter 806: The Possible Existence of a "Door"  "Why are there so many things on the bed? If the student of bed number four comes back at night, where will he sleep?" Chen Ge muttered to himself as if he was talking to himself, "Could it be that he sleeps on someone else's bed?"  Ever since he entered, the students in dorm room 413 couldn't help but glance at him. After all, it's hard not to pay attention to someone who walks in wearing the school's work clothes.  "Are you a school teacher?" A tall and thin student sitting on the bed opposite bed number four asked. He wore thick glasses and looked a bit odd, "Bed number four is unoccupied. We are just making reasonable use of the space by placing things there."  "The bed is made with sheets and a quilt. Are you saying no one sleeps there?" Chen Ge smiled at the tall, thin student, "Maybe it's just that you can't see him. Be careful when you sleep at night, don't sleep on your side, beware that there might be someone else lying behind you."  Chen Ge stood next to bed number four and moved all the luggage to the floor, "It's outrageous to even take advantage of a ghost."  "Hey! Don't mess with our stuff!" The mosquito net guy at the door stuck out his head again.  "I'm saving you guys. This bed has its own owner; he has always been here at this school."  Chen Ge found many things in the 413 dormitory of the east campus and looked forward to the 413 dormitory of the west campus.  "Do you also know about the legend of bed number four in the 413 dormitory?" The glasses-wearing guy had a stiff face, "That's just to scare Wang Yicheng, you actually believed it?"  "True or false, you'll know when you encounter it."  After clearing the bed, Chen Ge took off the pillowcases and duvet cover, making sure there was nothing hidden inside.  "You say there's someone on bed number four, then why are you moving their stuff?" The tall, thin student pushed his glasses up, not quite liking Chen Ge, probably because Chen Ge spoke up for Wang Yicheng, which was contrary to the atmosphere of their dormitory.  "I don't care. After all, I don't live in this dormitory. If he gets angry, you guys will be the first ones he comes looking for."  Chen Ge's way of speaking was far from what the students imagined a people's teacher to be, but of course, he was an impostor and didn't care about such things.  Lifting up the mattress, Chen Ge stopped bickering with the people in the dormitory and his gaze froze on the bed board. On the edge of the bed board near the wall, there were five blood fingerprints.  "This isn't another one of your pranks, is it?" Chen Ge scratched at the blood fingerprints, scraping off a bit and sniffing it at the tip of his nose. It seemed to be coagulated blood.  Why was there fresh blood on bed number four?  "Teacher, what is that?" Because the location of the blood fingerprints was very concealed, Wang Yicheng also just noticed it.  "Coagulated red pigment, I've studied painting, I'm very familiar with this smell."  Chen Ge glared at the other students in the dormitory, "Someone wants to play a prank."  He didn't linger on the topic and took out Lin Sisi's cellphone for lighting, looking under the bed board.  Similar to a scene in the east campus, there was writing under this bed.  Tiny characters, which seemed to have been carved little by little with a knife.  "Why doesn't anyone talk to me?"  "Why does everyone ignore me?"  "I didn't lie to them! There really is a ghost! I really saw a ghost in the toilet!"  "This place is dangerous! Why doesn't anyone believe me!"  Chen Ge looked at these sentences and felt they were somewhat familiar. He continued to read down and found a name that was even more familiar.  "I, Lin Sisi, swear on my life, there really is a ghost in the restroom! It's true, they are watching me!"  "I know everyone hates me and wants to play jokes on me. I'm happy, I understand, but there really is a ghost in the restroom! This time I'm not lying!"  Every character on the bed board was carved with great force, and some places were even stained with blood, as if the carver accidentally cut his hand.  "Were these also left by Lin Sisi? But his description doesn't quite match the one in the Ghost School Diary."  Chen Ge sharply noticed the discrepancy. The diary said that Lin Sisi was very mischievous, liked to tease others, and eventually his classmates couldn't stand it anymore and tricked him into the restroom, played a joke on him together, and scared him to death.  However, the words carved under the bed board told a different story. It seemed that Lin Sisi was not scared to death by his classmates but actually saw something in the restroom.  Thinking deeply was terrifying. Chen Ge's pupils shrank, and he now did not know who to believe.  The owner of bed number four was Lin Sisi, there was no doubt about that, whether it was the east campus or the west campus.  "If this dormitory has restored everything from memory, then the words under the bed board should also be true. But if Lin Sisi has been scared to death, how could he come back and carve words under the bed?"  Thinking of this, Chen Ge suddenly paused and looked at everyone in the dormitory.  In this dormitory, only bed number four was unoccupied, just like the situation back then.  Lin Sisi was scared to death, bed number four was vacated, and there were still five other people living in the dormitory.  Lin Sisi knew that the restroom was really haunted, so after he died, he still came back to inform everyone, leaving various marks, but no one paid attention.  "No wonder he would carve such sentences. As a ghost, of course, the living can't see."  Chen Ge didn't know if the five people in this dormitory were the same five people who lived with Lin Sisi before. If not, then they were really unlucky.  In the east campus, every living person who just entered the school was called Lin Sisi. This name signified ominousness and a curse, targeted by all fierce ghosts.  But from another perspective, for the fierce ghosts who want to graduate, they need a substitute ghost. Thinking from the perspective of fierce ghosts, the name Lin Sisi also represents hope.  "It's getting more and more interesting. The curse in the eyes of the living, the hope in the eyes of fierce ghosts, what exactly did Lin Sisi do in this school?"  Chen Ge was certain that Lin Sisi had a deep connection with this school. Even if he was not the owner of the school, he must be related to the owner of the school.  "If only I could find him or the last 'Lin Sisi.'"  Chen Ge continued to observe. The characters on the bed board became more forceful, and the carver's mentality gradually shifted from anxious to desperate.  "I really saw a ghost, can't you believe me just once?"  "Listen to my voice, I'm here, I'm right here!"  "Fine, I don't hope for you to believe me anymore. I only hope that you never go to the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building! Remember! Never go there!"  "It's over, they still got out..."  The information under the bed board abruptly ended there, and Chen Ge could feel the despair of the person who carved the words.  "The restroom on the top floor of the teaching building? Is that where Lin Sisi was harmed?"  Chen Ge stood silently, his brain working rapidly.  The ghost school scene was the most complex, largest, and most difficult task he had done, with various clues and mysteries intertwined like an endless fog.  It was impossible to clarify everything at once, and Chen Ge could only start from the most fundamental point.  "A door cannot appear out of thin air; there must be someone to push it open. Assuming that the pusher was Lin Sisi, then the most likely place for that door to appear is the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building!" Chapter 807: Black Leather Shoes  Chen Ge's eyes brightened as he found a critical piece of information. "Tongling Ghost School is a four-star scene. I have never dealt with a four-star before, and all my past experiences do not apply here. To know more, I have to check it out myself." Chen Ge did not know to what extent a person's obsession could go to weave such a huge nightmare; even Dr. Gao and Zhang Ya combined could not do it.  "It's possible that there was a door in that toilet to begin with, and that door was inadvertently opened when the students were playing tricks on Lin Sisi." Chen Ge had a door in his own haunted house that he dares not approach to this day, so he guessed that Lin Sisi might have encountered the same situation as himself back then.  It's just that he avoided the door, while Lin Sisi opened it.  "No matter what the truth is, I must go and check out the toilet on the top floor of the teaching building!" The plank on the bed did not specify whether the toilet was in the east campus or the west campus. To be safe, Chen Ge decided to take a look at the toilets in both districts.  "Let's leave here first, follow me to the experimental building." Chen Ge had already gained enough from under the bed plank, and there was no point in staying in dormitory 413 any longer, as it would attract the attention of the students in the building.  "Experimental building? But we just..." Wang Yicheng wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Zhang Ju, who gently tugged at his arm.  "Listen to the teacher, we go wherever he tells us." Chen Ge's suggestion to go to the experimental building was just a casual next move in the game. The attitude of the students in dormitory 413 was very bad; they might report to the dorm manager as soon as they left.  "It's almost lights-out time, let's grab our things and hurry back." Chen Ge restored his bed to its original state and left dormitory 413 with several club members.  They did not attract anyone's attention along the way, and after leaving the male dormitory building, Chen Ge saw many people running towards the experimental building, where something seemed to have happened.  "Zhu Long just knocked over the dissection table, the duty teacher can handle it himself, is there a need to alarm so many people?" Chen Ge was curious about the situation at the experimental building, but it was just curiosity. Going there now would be walking into a trap; the best choice was to avoid them.  "Teacher, are we really going to the experimental building? We just came back from there."  "Go to the number one teaching building, move quickly, we go there to check it out before the school reacts." Chen Ge kept changing locations, so even if the school's people came to investigate, they could only follow behind him eating dust.  The group ran in the direction opposite to the experimental building, and as time passed, fewer and fewer people were in the campus.  "Have you guys ever heard any strange tales related to toilets here?" Chen Ge asked as they walked, "Have you been to the toilet on the top floor of the teaching building?"  "No," several students shook their heads.  "This school looks very normal on the surface, but dangers are hidden everywhere. When we get there, you must follow my command." Chen Ge and the others made a round to the teaching building. The east campus teaching building was very imposing, with three buildings front and back, each four stories high.  "Your school seems to have a fondness for the number 'four'."  By this time, there were no students in the teaching building, the classrooms were pitch black, and only the corridor lights were still on.  "It's my first time coming to the teaching building so late at night. It didn't seem so scary during the day when there were many people, but the teaching building at night is actually so terrifying." Wang Yicheng walked slower; as he approached the teaching building, his expression became very unnatural, seemingly having an inner resistance to this place.  Wang Yicheng's change caught Chen Ge's attention. This lame boy seemed to have encountered some very unpleasant things in the classroom.  "Stick close to me, we will go straight to the top floor, and don't go towards anything you see in the other classrooms." Before entering the teaching building, Chen Ge first checked the surrounding environment. Each teaching building had two staircases on the left and right, and the toilets were near the left staircase.  "Are you sure you want to go?" Zhou Tu could not understand Chen Ge's various actions at all. Every step the other party took seemed to be well thought out, but upon closer examination, they realized there was no relation to each other at all. However, Chen Ge acted as if everything was natural and profound, making people want to lift his skull and see what was actually inside.  "Don't fall behind." Zhang Ju kindly reminded Zhou Tu, then helped Wang Yicheng into the staircase.  "Hurry up, this is a club activity." Zhu Long's eyes were bloodshot, and holding a pink female phone in his hands at over 1.8 meters tall, he looked surprisingly unawkward.  "I must be crazy, following you to the teaching building toilet late at night to look for supernatural phenomena." Zhou Tu reluctantly entered the staircase, and the group did not stop, running up to the top floor.  The teaching building was very quiet at night, completely different from the daytime.  "I and Zhang Ju will go in first. Zhu Long, you will be in the middle to respond. Zhou Tu, Wang Yicheng, you two stay outside." Chen Ge grabbed the toilet door handle, ready to push with force, when his arm was suddenly grabbed.  "Teacher, can we not go in..." Wang Yicheng stood by Chen Ge. His face was pale, cold sweat slid down his cheeks, and his pupils kept twitching, "I remember something very bad, and it happened here!"  "What is it?" This was the first time Chen Ge saw such an expression on Wang Yicheng.  "I only vaguely remember being forced by them to be involved in that incident. I was the only one who didn't enter this toilet, so I survived. Those who went in, they all died."  Wang Yicheng began to speak incoherently, with a crying tone.  "Everyone who entered this toilet died?" Chen Ge gently held Wang Yicheng's hand, "You're just a freshman, how could you have memories about this toilet?"  "I don't know, I didn't mean to! It was them who forced me! Teacher, let's go! Please don't open that door!" Wang Yicheng looked pitiable.  "We've come this far, I won't give up." Chen Ge took Wang Yicheng's hand away and pushed the toilet door open with force.  "Don't open it! Don't push that door!" Amidst Wang Yicheng's screams, Chen Ge opened the toilet door and looked inside.  Rubber ghost masks were thrown on the ground, and the walls were smeared with blood handprints and human features made with oil paint, making it feel as if one was being stared at from all directions upon entering.  "Lin Sisi was bullied here." Chen Ge picked up a rubber ghost mask from the ground and after ensuring it was safe, stuffed it into his backpack.  He moved forward slowly and took out Lin Sisi's phone to snap a few photos as he passed the first stall in the toilet. Everything in the toilet was normal, with no unfamiliar "people" present.  "It seems there's no problem, but I always feel something is off." Chen Ge looked at the tightly closed stall door and subconsciously pushed it, but the door did not budge.  "Is someone inside?" He bent down to look through the gap under the stall, where a pair of black leather shoes could be seen. Chapter 808: Roommates  "There's someone in the stall!"  At the sight of the black leather shoes, Chen Ge remembered Teacher Bai from the East Campus, who wore the same pair of pure black leather shoes.  "Don't come over just yet."  Chen Ge took two steps back and extended Lin Sisi's phone into the gap of the stall, quickly snapping a photo.  Looking down at the phone, Chen Ge's worry did not materialize; there was only a pair of leather shoes in the stall, no hidden "person."  "Lin Sisi's phone can capture ghosts and some special things. There's nothing in the photo, which means there are only shoes in this stall. But if there's no one in the stall, how is the door locked?"  The restroom stall doors can only be locked from the inside, and the position of the black leather shoes was as if someone was standing inside, not like they were shoved in from the outside.  "Teacher, could you have seen it wrong? Who would run to the top floor of the teaching building to use the restroom late at night? It feels creepy just thinking about it."  Zhu Long's memory was starting to loosen in his mind. He recalled some things, vague and unclear, but they indeed had an impact on him, causing some changes that no one else noticed. For example, he began to distance himself from other club members and preferred to stay by Chen Ge's side, as if Chen Ge and he were of the same kind.  "You guys stay here. If anyone else approaches, notify me immediately."  Chen Ge violently shook the stall door, using force to open it.  The narrow stall was painted with many ghost faces in oil paint, and standing inside felt like being stared at by many people.  "Why would there be a pair of shoes?"  Chen Ge didn't find anything unusual in the first stall and moved on to the second one. With the previous experience, this time he directly took out his phone and shot through the gap of the stall.  The photo showed that there was also a pair of shoes in the second stall, but these were not black leather shoes but a pair of worn blue sneakers.  "The placement is the same. Is there some meaning to this?"  Chen Ge checked the first six stalls in succession, and each contained a pair of men's shoes, including sneakers, travel shoes, and flat shoes, all different sizes, likely belonging to different people.  "The black leather shoes in the first stall look a lot like Teacher Bai's and seem to be worn by an adult, whereas the shoes in the other five stalls are all student shoes. Could each pair of shoes represent a person?"  "Lin Sisi was bullied by the whole class at the time. Could the owners of these shoes be the ones who targeted Lin Sisi the most?"  The biggest difference between a menacing ghost and a living person is that they are made of obsessions and negative emotions. Words like 'forgiveness' and 'kindness' are completely unrelated to them.  No matter what kind of person Lin Sisi was in life, at the moment he became a menacing ghost, his body and mind would surely be consumed by resentment. This is one of the obsessions of a menacing ghost, the foundation supporting their existence.  Imprisoning the people who bullied oneself in the stalls to keep oneself company, based on Chen Ge's understanding of menacing ghosts, they are likely to do such a thing.  "Teacher! Someone is coming this way to the teaching building!" Zhou Tu, supporting Wang Yicheng, shouted at the restroom entrance toward Chen Ge: "They seem to be coming from the direction of the laboratory building!"  "They're coming for us?"  Chen Ge hurried to the last stall door, subconsciously taking out his phone to take a photo, but was surprised to find that the seventh stall door had been dismantled.  "Where is the seventh door?"  Based on Chen Ge's previous guess, the door related to Lin Sisi would most likely appear in the restroom of the top floor of the teaching building, but he searched the restroom and did not find it.  "Calm down, don't panic."  Chen Ge bit his tongue lightly, knowing that those people downstairs would take some time to come up: "Each blood door corresponds to a pusher, which means the door is unique..."  Touching the door frame with his fingers, Chen Ge found that the hinge of the seventh stall had been broken: "The door of this stall was violently knocked open from the inside!"  He looked down at the interior of the stall, where there were no shoes placed in the seventh stall, only two blood-red footprints.  These two footprints, one in front of the other, were like someone walking out the door.  "If each pair of shoes represents a person, did the person from the last stall run out?"  Chen Ge suddenly turned his head to look around, and for some reason, whether psychological or something else, the ugly, bizarre faces on the walls seemed to come to life, and their expressions changed from before.  "All the despair and negative emotions in the West Campus have been transported to the East Campus. The real 'blood door' is probably in the restroom on the top floor of the East School's teaching building."  With one problem unresolved and new ones arising, Chen Ge's forehead veins bulged, and he bit his tongue hard to stay alert: "Step by step, I at least know that I am slowly approaching the truth."  "Teacher! They're coming upstairs! Let's find a place to hide first!"  Zhou Tu's voice was anxious, and he inexplicably felt panicked: "The people who entered the teaching building just now don't seem to be teachers and students from the school, and their way of walking is very strange!"  "Their way of walking is very strange?"  Chen Ge instantly realized the danger and called to Zhang Ju and Zhu Long to run out of the restroom: "Which side did they come up from?"  "The corridor near the restroom!"  "Good! Let's go down the other side! Be careful not to let them see you!"  Chen Ge had no intention of confronting the others head-on for the time being and ran to the first corridor, but when he passed by Wang Yicheng, he suddenly stopped.  His pupils shrank, his gaze landing on Wang Yicheng's shoes.  "Blue sneakers?"  The shoes Wang Yicheng was currently wearing on his feet were exactly the same as the ones in the second stall of the restroom!  "The shoes in the restroom stalls are all men's shoes..."  Chen Ge recalled carefully and suddenly found that the shoes in the restroom were exactly the same as those of the students in dorm 413.  "Dorm 413 has six people in total, and the top floor restroom of the teaching building has seven stalls. Six people correspond to six stalls, and one stall contains black leather shoes, representing the teacher, making up exactly seven people."  Chen Ge frowned:  "Why does Lin Sisi hate his roommates so much? Didn't he specifically run back to the dorm to remind his roommates not to get close to the restroom?"  Chen Ge rubbed his temples hard; he had too much to think about:  "The East Campus is chaotic and disorderly, while the West Campus is more like a keepsake in a glass bottle, frozen in the few days of enrollment, repeating over and over. To know the truth, one must compare the same scenes from both the East and West Campuses!"  "The West Campus is too perfect, so perfect that it's not real, like a dream made by a child. In comparison, the East Campus seems much more realistic."  Chen Ge's gaze moved away from Wang Yicheng's shoes, and he had already made up his mind to take everyone to the East Campus.  "I have no other choice now but to look for memories in dreams and seek the truth in reality." Chapter 809: They Forced Me!  The people who had run from the direction of the laboratory building had already entered the corridor and seemed to have noticed something. They headed straight for the restroom on the top floor without any stops in between.  "Let's go!" Chen Ge immediately picked up Wang Yicheng, and they quickly ran through the corridor to the other side of the hallway. They hid in the stairwell, holding their breath.  "Mr. Bai, why did you stop?"  "You guys watch the entrance to the third-floor corridor. I'll stand on this side of the fourth floor. Once they all go up to the fourth floor, then we'll go down," Chen Ge said, his courage quite large. He stood on one side of the corridor, and through the long hallway, he used his dark pupil to watch the restroom.  "But..."  "Do as I say."  Chen Ge stayed alone at the entrance to the fourth-floor corridor on the right, watching the left side. After about ten or so seconds, he clearly heard footsteps coming from the left corridor, and then several people in white clothes appeared on the fourth floor.  "What strange clothing? All white? Even the shoes are white?"  There were three people who came upstairs. Besides all wearing white clothes, there was another abnormal thing about them; these guys all had scars on their faces. It wasn't just one or two scars, but like Zhang Ju, their entire faces were extensively burned, looking a bit terrifying.  "Are they the school's managers?" Chen Ge saw them enter the restroom and then led the other students to run downstairs, perfectly avoiding them.  "Teacher, where do we go next?"  "We'll find a chance to go to the east campus."  Chen Ge's voice was urgent, and those in white clothes had given him a lot of pressure.  "No, why are you guys so nervous? It's like we're doing something shady that can't be seen."  Zhou Tu looked at the tense expressions of Chen Ge and the other club members, somewhat speechless: "We are students of the school, and Mr. Bai is a teacher of the school. Even if we are seen by the school, at worst, they'll scold us, at most compensate for the dissecting table in the laboratory building, it won't cost much money."  "Do you still think that if we get caught, we will only be criticized by the school?" Chen Ge stared into Zhou Tu's eyes, and the kid's gaze dodged, not daring to look at Chen Ge.  "You'll understand once you get to the east campus."  Chen Ge led the students to avoid the teaching building, slowly approaching the sports equipment room next to the teaching building through the secluded path.  "Teacher, aren't we going to the east campus? What are you doing in the sports equipment room?"  "Looking for tools. Wang Yicheng, Zhou Tu, you two stay outside to keep watch, everyone else come in with me to search, take anything like ropes or similar items."  Chen Ge pried open the door of the sports equipment room and found a lot of ropes used for jumping rope.  "Teacher! Those people seem to be coming this way!" Zhou Tu's voice came from outside the door, as he saw several white figures running out from the teaching building and heading towards their location.  "That's impossible? How would they know we're at the sports equipment room? If them going to the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building was an accident, how did they determine I was at the sports equipment room?"  Chen Ge had a bad premonition, he zipped up his backpack, and because it was stuffed with too many things, the backpack looked bulging and could only be carried in his hand.  "The sports equipment room is large enough for them to search for a while, let's retreat first."  Chen Ge carried the backpack in one hand, then waved to Wang Yicheng: "Come on, I'll carry you."  Chen Ge had good intentions, but this time Wang Yicheng refused. He shook his head, his eyes full of horror, like a child who had a nightmare: "Teacher, I'm very scared, I heard someone calling my name, those people behind seem to be looking for me, I heard their voices!"  "You heard someone calling your name? When did it start?" Chen Ge didn't give Wang Yicheng a chance to resist, time was tight and he couldn't afford to delay, forcibly picking up Wang Yicheng: "Let's talk while we walk."  "Teacher! Those people are looking for me! If you take me with you, they will definitely find us!" Wang Yicheng's facial features were slightly twisted, and his body was shaking.  "Stop talking nonsense, you're my student, you just need to answer my questions."  Chen Ge quickened his pace, but he was very curious about what Wang Yicheng had said.  "When you guys took me to the top floor of the teaching building, I suddenly felt very uncomfortable inside, I had an inexplicable urge to cry. That corridor felt very familiar to me, as if something bad had happened there before."  Wang Yicheng's eyes were red and swollen, like a fish thrown ashore, even breathing became difficult.  "You're a freshman, right? How could you feel that corridor was familiar?"  "I don't know, sometimes we go to a strange place and feel like we've been there before, that's how I feel right now."  Wang Yicheng's voice was intermittent, and his face was frighteningly pale.  "What about that voice? Did it appear suddenly? What did it say to you?" Chen Ge asked softly.  "Just when I saw the corridor, I suddenly started feeling uncomfortable. When we got to the door of the restroom, a scene suddenly flashed in my mind."  Wang Yicheng took a deep breath, pausing for a long time before saying: "It seems like a long time ago, I've been to this restroom. I was responsible for leading a very important person into the restroom. His skinny body stood in the restroom, and the restroom was filled with all kinds of demons and ghosts! It's also because these memories came up that I tried to stop you guys when you went in."  "Hold on!" Chen Ge keenly noticed a detail in Wang Yicheng's words: "You were responsible for leading someone important to you into the restroom?"  "Yes, that person seemed to be my best friend. I really understand that feeling because very few people are willing to be my friend, only he was an exception."  Wang Yicheng violently hit his own head, his memory seemed to start loosening as well: "When we got to the door of the restroom, his voice emerged in my mind, he was calling my name, I'm sure it was him! But I just can't remember who he is!"  "Is his name Lin Sisi?" Chen Ge whispered the name Lin Sisi into Wang Yicheng's ear, and as soon as these words came out, Wang Yicheng's body began to shake violently, his arms that were hugging Chen Ge's neck tightened, making it hard for Chen Ge to breathe.  "I didn't mean it, they forced me! I'm sorry! We are still the best friends!" Wang Yicheng closed his eyes and shouted, his voice was miserable, as if he suddenly found a ghost standing next to his bed in the middle of the night.  "Calm down!"  Wang Yicheng suddenly broke down, which was unexpected by everyone. His behavior could attract more trouble, so Chen Ge decisively tossed him off and struck him on the carotid artery of his neck.  "Mr. Bai?" The other few students were startled.  "Shut up! I'm saving him!" Chen Ge tried a few more places and finally made Wang Yicheng faint: "Mental breakdown can cause serious damage to the brain. The best solution I can think of is to let him stop thinking for a while." Chapter 810: The Other Side of the Wall  Looking at the unconscious Wang Yicheng, Chen Ge's mood could not calm down for a long time. He had obtained a very important piece of information from what Wang Yicheng had just said. The person who had lured Lin Sisi into the bathroom was Wang Yicheng!  "I didn't expect the most crucial person to be right by my side." Chen Ge was glad that even after entering the world behind the door, he still maintained his kind nature. When he first came into contact with Wang Yicheng, he didn't think too much; he just saw the other party alone and wanted to help change his situation.  In fact, he did it. Wang Yicheng now had several new friends, and these friends would not bully or discriminate against him.  Through what Wang Yicheng had said in his frenzy, Chen Ge roughly understood the ins and outs of the matter. Wang Yicheng and Lin Sisi both lived in room 413, and for various reasons, both were not very well-liked.  Because of different personalities, the two had different ways of handling the cold violence from classmates. Wang Yicheng chose to endure and silently bear it. Lin Sisi, on the other hand, thought of various schemes to draw everyone's attention.  These two could not really be considered friends; they were just bullied victims banding together.  The classmates really hated Lin Sisi and decided to dress up as ghosts to play a trick on Lin Sisi in the bathroom on the top floor of the teaching building as revenge.  To successfully lure Lin Sisi over, they found Wang Yicheng, who was on relatively good terms with Lin Sisi.  Chen Ge didn't know how those people convinced Wang Yicheng, but he knew the final result was that Wang Yicheng agreed to the students' request.  Wang Yicheng had his own difficulties, but the person who pushed Lin Sisi towards the cliff was him.  "Speed up! We need to get rid of the people behind us before Wang Yicheng wakes up." Chen Ge was very cautious. He went to a few more places and finally breathed a sigh of relief when he found that the person in white had not followed.  The atmosphere in the West Campus slowly began to turn abnormal, and the number of strange people in white clothes gradually increased. Chen Ge did not stay any longer and led the club members to the garbage classification processing center.  "Teacher Bai, are those people in white clothes also school teachers? Why have I never seen them before? And why were they chasing us just now?" Zhu Long had many questions to ask.  "They are not teachers; they are the managers who maintain order in the West Campus. As for why they were chasing us..." Chen Ge placed the unconscious Wang Yicheng on the grass: "Because of him, and because of you."  "Us?"  "Yes, this school is not as simple as you think. If it were compared to the human brain, then the West Campus would be the place responsible for processing all kinds of positive emotions, while negative emotions and garbage would be taken care of by the East Campus."  Chen Ge used a very common analogy to explain: "The West Campus has only good memories, and all garbage must be sent to the East Campus. But how could a person only have good memories?"  "So we forgot a lot of memories?" Zhang Ju was very smart; he understood Chen Ge's meaning before he finished speaking.  "That's right, what you have forgotten is filled with despair. These things are seen as garbage by the West Campus. Once these memories loosen or awaken, they will be sent to the East Campus."  Chen Ge spoke very seriously: "Now that you know the truth, are you still willing to continue searching for your memories?"  "I am willing." Zhu Long agreed without hesitation: "This feeling of not being able to remember something that clearly happened is too uncomfortable. If this continues, I will go crazy. I would rather remember everything."  "I also want to know what memories I have lost. Lacking memories, I always feel incomplete, like a... monster." Zhang Ju lightly touched the scar on his face, his eyes complex, and it was unclear what he was thinking.  "You guys are really crazy! Truly crazy!" Zhou Tu kept muttering as he paced back and forth like a mouse trapped in a cage.  "No refusal means consent." Chen Ge helped Wang Yicheng up from the ground: "Actually, there's another advantage to going to the East Campus now. The people chasing us want to send us to the East Campus, but they would never expect us to have gone there ourselves."  "Is there a difference?"  "If we go by ourselves, we can still maintain our 'human' appearance. If they catch us and transfer us over, you might forget even more things by then."  Chen Ge comforted the club members a few words: "The East Campus is not as scary as you think. Just be a little careful, and nothing will happen."  Carrying Wang Yicheng, Chen Ge opened the door of the West Campus garbage processing center. The room was very clean, completely different from the East Campus.  "Don't mess with anything here, and don't get close to the doors of the garbage classification." Chen Ge didn't know if there were any staff in the garbage processing center of the West Campus, so he distributed some ropes to the students in advance: "There's a small window on the second floor. I'll go out through the window and climb up to the top of the wall first. You watch how I do it and just follow my lead."  "What about Wang Yicheng?"  "Tie him up with a rope. After I climb up the wall, you guys lift him out of the window first, and I'll pull him up to the top of the wall." Wang Yicheng was short and thin, not too heavy, which was good news for Chen Ge.  "Be careful. Once you're up on the second floor, do as I say immediately. You must be quick!" After distributing the ropes, Chen Ge personally tied up Wang Yicheng and connected a rope between himself and Wang Yicheng, then carried him to the second floor.  After confirming there was no one on the second floor, Chen Ge didn't look closely and headed straight for the window.  Opening the small window, Chen Ge climbed up to the wall with practiced ease: "What are you waiting for? Hand Wang Yicheng out."  He was tied with a rope, and the other end of the rope was tied to Wang Yicheng.  "Is Teacher Bai a physical education teacher?" Zhang Ju was the first to react and lifted Wang Yicheng to send him outside the window.  "This is the second floor! Be careful." Zhu Long and Zhou Tu also started to help, and the three of them worked together to hand Wang Yicheng out.  After a lot of effort, Chen Ge finally got Wang Yicheng up on the wall. He was one of the key figures tonight, and Chen Ge would definitely not leave him behind.  Sitting on the wall again, Chen Ge's mood was completely different from before. He untied the rope from his body, moved on the wall to make room for the other students.  "Move quickly!" Chen Ge, supporting Wang Yicheng, found a few gaps between the bricks on the wall and tied the rope around them.  Next time they wanted to go from the East Campus to the West Campus, they wouldn't need to go through the garbage processing center; they could use the rope he left.  It took the group more than ten minutes to jump to the East Campus. For these students from the West Campus, the East Campus was a completely unfamiliar scene. Chapter 811: Zhang Ju's Memory  "The second day of the new student orientation, and I was being chased by a teacher, forced to climb over a wall to escape. This is nothing like the college life I imagined!" Zhou Tu brushed off the dirt on his body and untied the rope that was fastened around his waist.  "There might be even more unexpected things to come," Chen Ge pulled hard on the rope tied to the top of the wall a few times, hiding it behind the ivy. Even if someone walked by, they wouldn't notice without looking closely. "This rope is my backup plan."  When Chen Ge left the East Campus, he was alone, but when he returned, he had become the leader of a club.  "Teacher, have you noticed anything unusual?" Zhang Ju stood up straight, his eyes hidden within scars slowly widened.  "What's wrong?"  "I might be more sensitive, but the air on this side of the wall feels stickier, damp, and there's an odd smell, kind of like blood," said Zhang Ju in the calmest tone, but his words were weird.  He slowly opened his mouth, his tongue licked the scar on his upper lip, his eyes filled with confusion and doubt: "Compared to the West Campus, this place feels more familiar to me."  "Are you joking? Are you familiar with the smell of blood?" Zhou Tu originally just thought Zhang Ju was ugly, but otherwise normal. However, after hearing his recent words, Zhou Tu saw Zhang Ju in a new light.  "I'm not joking, it's true," Zhang Ju looked towards Chen Ge, who stood there with a smile.  "You're not wrong, this is fertile ground for cultivating beautiful dreams. In the world behind the door, only with corpses and blood as fertilizer can flowers that surprise people bloom," Chen Ge picked up Wang Yicheng and gestured for Zhang Ju to follow behind him: "I'll take you to a place first, remember, don't make too much noise."  They moved through the untended bushes, with the night serving as their best camouflage. Without incident, Chen Ge led Zhang Ju to the place where the tree hole ghost was.  "Do you find this place familiar?" Chen Ge pointed to the tree hole that contained the ghost's head, as well as the surrounding trees.  "It seems like we've been here before... Right, isn't this the crime scene of the girl's murder that we saw in the West Campus? Why is there an identical scene in the East Campus?" Zhou Tu's eyes widened; even the position and angle of the tree holes in the two scenes were exactly the same.  "The murder scene in the West Campus is just a shell, the bodies and the souls of the deceased are hidden in the East Campus, what you see now is the real crime scene," Chen Ge said as he spoke, Zhang Ju seemed to be attracted by something, standing alone next to the tree hole, his shoulders trembling slightly.  "Zhang Ju?"  He seemed unable to hear Chen Ge's voice, slowly squatting down, kneeling next to the tree hole, his hands trembling as he reached into the tree hole.  "Hey! What are you freaking out about? I remember the girl's head was found in the tree hole! What are you doing sticking your hand in there?" Zhou Tu wanted to pull Zhang Ju away, but Chen Ge stopped him: "Don't disturb him, the memories he lost are hidden in that tree hole, he needs to dig them out himself."  "Dig them out? You guys are really crazy!" Zhou Tu didn't have the strength of Chen Ge, and couldn't break free, so he could only stand by and watch helplessly.  Kneeling on both legs, Zhang Ju lay next to the tree hole, staring intently at the dark tree hole, his arm slowly disappearing into the hole. His body trembled continuously, sweat mixed with the scars on his face, like tears falling.  "There's nothing? Why is there nothing? There can't be nothing!" Zhang Ju didn't feel anything, his voice was intermittent, as if he was too anxious to breathe: "I saw it with my own eyes! I saw him hide it in the tree hole! How come it's not there?"  His fingers scraped the soil and tree bark, his nails began to bleed, but Zhang Ju did not feel the pain, his expression was fierce, and he frantically dug at the bottom of the tree hole.  "Zhang Ju, are you looking for this?" Chen Ge took out a rusty kitchen knife from his backpack, this knife was the attachment of the tree hole ghost, the shadow swallowed the ghost and found it deep in the tree hole (see Chapter 787), at first Chen Ge wanted to use the knife for self-defense, without thinking too much.  Suddenly everything quieted down, and everyone's eyes focused on the kitchen knife.  "This kitchen knife was found in the tree hole, the soul of the deceased who had gone mad was attached to this knife," Chen Ge placed the kitchen knife in front of Zhang Ju: "If you pick it up, can you remember your past?"  Zhang Ju was about to collapse, his arms trembled more and more, his pupils beating violently.  "Does it feel familiar? Have you seen this knife somewhere else? Whose hand was this knife in at the time, and whose neck did this knife finally chop into?" Chen Ge's words pierced into Zhang Ju's mind like spikes, and as his fingertips touched the handle of the knife, his face suddenly changed dramatically, his pupils contracted, his mouth opened wide, as if he had touched a red-hot iron.  Before Zhang Ju could scream, Chen Ge had already covered his mouth in advance: "It's okay, those things are in the past, it's just your past."  While comforting Zhang Ju with his mouth, Chen Ge's eyes were fixed on Zhang Ju's hand holding the knife, ready to push him down if he made any slashing motion.  Zhang Ju's strength was much greater than Chen Ge had imagined, and as his memories loosened, his strength continued to grow; this child was probably not just an ordinary ghost.  Just as Chen Ge was about to lose control of Zhang Ju, the latter finally calmed down.  Chen Ge let go, and Zhang Ju fell to the ground on his knees, his lips touching the muddy ground, the scars on his face glaring.  "I remembered some things," Zhang Ju stared at his broken nails: "That day was the birthday of a senior, a girl wanted to confess to the senior, but the senior had his own girlfriend, so he asked me to reject her on his behalf.  I arrived at the agreed place and didn't see the girl, so I waited. Later I heard some noise in the woods, I sneaked over, and then I saw someone with this knife..."  "The girl was still struggling, but I didn't dare to go out. I was scared silly, I had never seen so much blood before."  His fingernails dug into the soil, Zhang Ju's facial scars squeezed together: "If I had stood up then, maybe that girl wouldn't have died."  Guilt and self-reproach tormented Zhang Ju all the time, he clenched the kitchen knife: "By the time I went back to call the police, those people had already run away, I don't know if they were caught, but I saw one of the figures was very familiar."  "The next night, we drank a lot of alcohol, then went to sing, and then there was a fire, I was sent to the hospital, and what happened after that..." Zhang Ju suddenly beat his head: "What happened after that? Why don't I have any more memories?"  "Burned and passed out in the hospital, your memories stopped there," Chen Ge already knew Zhang Ju's past. Chapter 812: Portrait of a Doctor  "I could see the fire spreading, burning faster and faster, thick smoke billowing, screams and wails everywhere. I couldn't open my eyes, wanting to run outside, but as soon as I opened the door, flames rushed into the private room." Zhang Ju lay on the ground, veins bulging on his forehead, the scar on his face trembling slightly: "I don't know where the pain started from, I desperately rushed out, couldn't catch my breath, could barely see anything, and finally fainted in the corridor."  "I vaguely felt someone lifting me up, at that time I still retained some consciousness."  With fingers stained with mud and blood, he dug into his hair, using his elbow to prop up his body: "I must have been sent to the hospital, I could faintly hear the conversations between my parents and the doctors. I wanted to open my eyes, but when I did, I saw a completely dark world, as if everything had been charred."  Zhang Ju's voice gradually returned to normal, he collapsed on the ground: "I can remember my parents' faces, the doctors and nurses who took care of me, but I just can't remember how I woke up from the coma, nor how I came to this school."  "Is there a possibility that you have never actually awoken, and this here is the world after you fell into a coma?" Chen Ge's words took Zhang Ju by surprise.  "I haven't woken up? This is the world after the coma?" Zhang Ju muttered Chen Ge's words: "So all this is a dream? Are you all figments of my imagination?"  "Figment of your imagination my ass, the more you talk, the more ridiculous it gets. Can we be a bit more normal?" Zhou Tu snatched the kitchen knife from Zhang Ju's hand: "I'm not sure about others, but I'm definitely not the man of your dreams. I'll keep the knife for you, to prevent you from trying to use it on someone else as an experiment."  Zhou Tu felt like he was the only normal person in this club. It was safer to keep the weapon with him.  "What Zhang Ju said is not entirely without reason, but he got one thing wrong. This world is not his dream alone, but a nightmare formed from the negative emotions and despairing experiences of many people," Chen Ge glanced over the faces of all the club members: "You all are trapped in this world, a world that you have created with your own hands."  After Chen Ge finished speaking, the woods became extremely quiet, everyone looked at him with very vivid expressions on their faces.  "I know you might not be able to accept this for the moment, but it's okay, we still have time." Chen Ge carried Wang Yicheng on his back and glanced at the distant wall: "Wang Yicheng's awakening memory has attracted the manager, now with your memory Zhang Ju starting to unravel, it is very likely that the manager will come over, we must leave as soon as possible."  Chen Ge turned around and walked towards the outside of the woods.  "Wait a minute!" Zhang Ju grabbed the reddened soil on the ground, slowly raised his head, his eyes fixed on Chen Ge: "Who are you really? Why are you telling us this?"  "Who I am is not important, what's important is that I can help you escape from here. Your loved ones in reality have been waiting for too long." Chen Ge said with a smile: "Actually, I am quite similar to you, I too lost a part of my childhood memories, so when I met you, it was as if I saw my former self."  Waving his hand, Chen Ge walked towards the distance: "Meeting me is your fortune, the former me had no guidance, groping alone in the darkness, losing too much..."  Chen Ge led the club members past the laboratory building and the faculty apartment building, and followed the path to the side of the teaching building.  "The top floor bathroom of the teaching building, the answer I want should be here."  The teaching building in the west campus area was just quiet and gloomy, but the east campus area was eerie everywhere, and a chill would climb up one's back and rush to the brain as soon as one approached.  "Keep quiet, if something happens here, the consequences will be very serious," Chen Ge whispered.  "What could happen?" Zhou Tu's forehead was sweating, he held the kitchen knife taken out from the tree hole, hunched his back, and looked around nervously, looking very tense.  "In the east campus area, we store the garbage that the west campus area doesn't want. How do we usually deal with garbage in our lives?" Chen Ge maintained his smile, but his words made several club members take a cold breath: "After being caught, we will be disassembled for useful parts, squeezed dry of all value, then directly discarded. Dying here really is a luxury."  Once the arrow is shot, there's no turning back, Chen Ge was the first to enter the teaching building of the east campus area.  It might have been an illusion, but the night in the east campus area seemed even darker than in the west campus area.  Stepping on the old stairs, the burnt traces on the handrails of the staircase remained, and faint sounds of desks and chairs moving could be heard from the empty classrooms next to them.  "This place is so scary, I can't imagine it's just separated from us by a wall," Zhu Long whispered, walking at the end of the line.  "Shh, don't talk," Zhou Tu gripped the knife and followed closely behind Zhang Ju, afraid that the scarred-faced student would suddenly go mad and hurt himself.  The more you worry about something, sometimes the more likely it is for accidents to happen. Zhou Tu was staring at Zhang Ju when he suddenly stopped.  "What's wrong?"  "It's nothing, I'm just curious why there are so many doctor's photos posted in the corridor of the teaching building?" Zhang Ju looked up at the doctors on the wall: "We're not a medical university, and these doctors don't seem very famous. Many don't even have an introduction, just a photo of them in a white coat. By the way, have you noticed that all these photos of doctors are work photos?"  Zhang Ju's words caught Chen Ge's attention. He had felt that these doctors' photos were strange before, but couldn't figure out why. Now being prompted by Zhang Ju, he suddenly thought of a possibility.  "The world behind the door is woven from the memories of those who push it open. This school is very special, containing the memories of all its students. The doctor photos on the wall could possibly be people the students have encountered in reality."  Chen Ge gently pressed Zhang Ju's shoulder: "Take a look at these photos, see if there are any doctors you recognize."  "The doctors who are posted on the wall are the top people in the field, how could I possibly know them?"  "In this place, doctors might have some special significance, just do as I say."  Chen Ge led the club members to continue walking upstairs. When passing the third floor, he suddenly stopped: "Don't move, there's someone ahead."  The classroom near the corridor on the third floor wasn't locked, and the poor quality wooden door was creaking in the wind.  Chen Ge and the others stood still in the hallway for a while, then a shadow emerged from the classroom.  "That build looks a bit familiar, is it Chang Gu?" Chapter 813: Do You Dare?  The silhouette was similar in build to Chang Gu, but its movements were agile, nothing like those of a person who was nearly blind. Chen Ge didn't dare to go out rashly; he wanted to continue observing, but the figure ran directly to the other side of the corridor, seemingly searching for something.  "Is that Chang Gu? Have his eyes returned to normal?"  It was pitch dark inside the teaching building, and even though Chen Ge possessed Yin Pupils, he was still extremely cautious.  "Teacher, is that your acquaintance? Should we follow?"  "Better to mind our own business; let's head to the top floor first."  Chen Ge's gaze stayed on the shadow, which didn't leave but instead entered another classroom.  There were others in the teaching building late at night. The variables increased, and Chen Ge wasn't sure if it was good or bad.  The group reached the fourth floor; the bathroom was on the other side of the corridor, requiring them to cross a long hallway.  "No matter what sounds you hear, don't respond. No matter what you see, don't leave the group, understand?" Chen Ge instructed the club members a few times before carrying Wang Yicheng into the hallway.  He crouched down, scanning the classrooms on either side with the corner of his eyes.  The windows were pitch black, nothing visible.  The club members followed behind Chen Ge, trying to control their urge to look around, but the more they told themselves not to look, the less control they had over their eyes.  "What's that?"  It seemed like the classrooms hadn't been cleaned in a while. When Zhou Tu passed by a window, he saw strands of what appeared to be hair beneath the window frame, giving the impression that a girl was lying at the window-side position in the classroom.  "Could that really be a person?" Zhou Tu tiptoed, maintaining his forward motion, and tilted his head slightly to look under the classroom window sill.  "The hair... is it moving?"  Before Zhou Tu could see clearly, he bumped into something unexpectedly. He didn't hold onto the kitchen knife firmly, and the rusty blade fell to the ground.  The sound of the rusty knife colliding with the floor tiles was piercingly sharp in the quiet of the night.  Everyone stopped in their tracks, and Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu: "What are you doing?"  "I accidentally bumped into Zhang Ju." Zhou Tu covered his nose and pointed at Zhang Ju, who was standing still in shock, "You were walking fine, why did you suddenly stop?"  Zhang Ju didn't answer but instead looked up at the photo on the wall, his mouth slightly open, pupils shrinking to a point.  "Zhang Ju?"  No matter how others called out to him, Zhang Ju didn't respond; he just stared at the photo on the wall, his gaze calm but tinged with sadness.  When he saw the knife that killed the girl in the woods, he had a mental breakdown, hysterical, but now he had become completely different from before.  There were no crazy screams, no self-harm to relieve the mental pain; he just stood quietly in front of the photo.  "I've seen this doctor before."  His voice was very soft, so low that only people close by could hear.  "The fire scorched one-fifth of my skin; I watched my flesh char, smelled the stench of my body burning until my eyes melted, my eyelids stuck together, and my world plunged into darkness."  "I was taken to the hospital, it was so painful, I couldn't feel the pain anymore."  "My eyes couldn't open, my nose was burned off, one ear was left with two-thirds, the other ear with one-third."  "I turned into a monster; I couldn't see myself, but I knew I was no longer me; I could no longer go back and live like a human."  "Have you ever tried listening to your family's voices with two-thirds of an ear?"  "People were saving me, I could feel my body getting more and more painful, I was getting closer to being alive, but how could I wake up?"  "My eyes were cut open by something cold, cleaned bit by bit, my left eye was removed, and my right eye could vaguely see a gray world."  "I couldn't sense light; the world I saw with my right eye only had shadows. Tell me, should I keep living?"  Zhang Ju's hand pressed on the photo on the wall, his face bleeding, fine streams of blood emerging from beneath his skin as if they were threads used for surgical sutures.  "I recognize this doctor; he accompanied me for a week. The Grim Reaper wanted my life, and he gambled with the Reaper."  His voice became more hoarse, as if his throat had been scorched by a great fire, and his appearance also began to change.  Scars and blood threads spread across his face, his ears wilted like flowers, and the eyelid of his left eye slowly melted.  "I never spoke a word to him, but I was profoundly impressed by him. Among the three people who were with me in my final moments, he was one of them."  The guilt towards the dead unlocked Zhang Ju's memories, and the doctor who had once treated him made the previously vague memories clear, piecing together the fragments in his mind.  Blood threads seeped from under his skin, as if the healed scars were breaking open again.  The blood threads formed droplets, falling onto Zhang Ju's outer clothes, his coat slowly turning red: "If you were in my situation, would you choose to live or die?"  "Half in red clothes? After the restoration of memory, will the ghost regain its original form? Could it be that the ghost in the tree hollow couldn't maintain a normal human shape because the memory wasn't completely erased?" Chen Ge's eyelids twitched slightly, but his reaction was much better compared to the other club members.  Zhou Tu didn't even care to pick up the kitchen knife, grabbing Zhu Long's arm, and the two unconsciously retreated three meters away.  No one replied, and Zhang Ju's gaze slowly shifted from the photo. He looked at Chen Ge: "I remember who I am now, can you tell me who you are?"  The two stood in the dark corridor, looking at each other.  "You've asked me this question, and I've given you an answer."  Chen Ge stood still, not retreating a single step: "We are the same kind, I want to find my forgotten memories, helping you is helping myself."  "You're lying!" Zhang Ju reached out to grab Chen Ge, but stopped just as his fingers were about to touch him.  "Why did you stop?" Chen Ge took a step forward, approaching Zhang Ju's face of despair and horror: "Are you afraid that after killing me, another 'me' will rise from the corpse? Are you afraid of me in red?"  With both hands on Zhang Ju's shoulders, Chen Ge's expression was the epitome of madness, his hands moving across Zhang Ju's shoulders before slowly cradling his face, gently touching his forehead.  "Kill me? Do you dare?"  Not just Zhang Ju, but Zhou Tu and Zhu Long hiding behind were also scared.  The corridor was silent, and after a long while, Chen Ge let go of Zhang Ju, looking at the other club members in the hallway: "I just want to find my lost memories, helping me is helping yourselves, and vice versa." Chapter 814: The Movable "Door"  Zhang Ju had long noticed that Chen Ge was no ordinary person. His eyes remained calm no matter what he saw, as if there was nothing in the world that could surprise him. Frankly speaking, he was quite afraid of such a person, but it was precisely because of this fear that he chose to listen and follow.  Standing in front of the photo, Zhang Ju opened his remaining right eye and silently gazed at Chen Ge's face. Ordinary features that wouldn't stand out in a crowd, yet it was this very person who had inadvertently revealed an expression that even he found frightening.  It was hard to describe; it was like a combination of a deeply resentful ghost and a deranged madman. From that face, one could see madness, morbidity, and cruelty, but there was no fear or terror to be seen.  Zhang Ju knew his own appearance. He always felt like a horrifying monster, but Chen Ge's recent actions made him realize that there were even more terrifying "monsters" in this world.  "Yes, we should be the same kind of people."  He believed Chen Ge's words because such an expression could only be possessed by someone who had experienced hell. Like himself, the other party had also forgotten the past.  "I'm sorry, Teacher Bai, I recalled some very unpleasant memories, so I lost control," Zhang Ju's voice was harsh and grating, but his attitude had improved a lot.  "It's fine, how could a teacher truly blame a student?" Chen Ge’s face wore a smile, appearing very kind and gentle, making it hard to believe that the person speaking to Zhang Ju was the same one: "What did you remember? Don't hesitate, tell me everything."  "It's nothing much, just some painful memories."  Zhang Ju's wounds continued to bleed, his clothes gradually staining red: "I remembered how cowardly and timid I was when I witnessed a murder; the feeling of being burned by a great fire, as if needles were piercing into the flesh until I couldn't feel the pain; I also remembered lying in a sterile ward, struggling in agony, despair taking root and sprouting in my heart. I didn't want to die, but I didn't know how to keep living."  "During the last stage of your life, did anything special happen to you or around you?" Zhang Ju appeared in the world within the "door," yet he had already lost the ability to open it. Chen Ge was curious about how he entered this school; only by knowing the method of entry could there be a chance to speculate an escape route.  In a three-star scenario, the "door" was the only way in and out, but the four-star scenario seemed different.  "The last stage of life..."  Zhang Ju touched his face: "I seemed to have fallen into a coma but could still sense the outside world. I couldn't distinguish between reality and nightmares, but I clearly remember one thing—every deep in the night, a door would appear in the sickroom."  "A door?"  "I stayed in the hospital for seven days, and that door would appear every night, getting closer to me until finally, it moved to my bedside." Zhang Ju looked up, his face covered in fresh blood: "It was a door that could move. The more scared and desperate I became, the closer it got to me. Unable to call for help, on the eighth night, the door was pushed open from the inside, and hands reached out from the crack, pulling me in."  Zhang Ju's situation was the same as what happened to Chang Gushen; they both encountered a self-moving "door." Each midnight, the door would slowly approach a sleeping person, eventually standing by the bedside, and the door would be pushed open from the inside to take away the living person on the bed.  "Is this school behind the door?" Chen Ge was more curious about what happened next. He wanted to know the process of Zhang Ju's memory loss, how this student who was disfigured in a fire gradually became the half-red-clothed figure.  Zhang Ju shook his head: "I had a dream, a very real dream. In the dream, they all called me Lin Sisi. I repeatedly told them my name was Zhang Ju, that they had mistaken me for someone else, but they thought I was joking."  "No one believed me, and I could only live in the dream under the name of Lin Sisi, experiencing everything that Lin Sisi went through. Over time, even I began to doubt myself, wondering whether I was really Lin Sisi?"  "Being bullied, cold violence, being ignored, none of these feelings were pleasant, but on second thought, having become a monster in reality, it was actually quite nice to live in a dream."  His voice was flat as if narrating someone else's story: "I had no friends, the whole world hated me, and the dual torment of spirit and body gradually numbed me until one day, a girl walked into my dream."  "It was a rainy day, and someone had put a frog in my desk mate's bag; she suspected it was me, but why would I do such a boring thing?"  "No one listened to my explanation, my classmates drove me out of the classroom, and everyone in the hallway looked at me strangely. I had no choice but to escape to the rooftop of the teaching building."  "There, I met her."  "Even though I knew it was a dream, I still felt that the girl was special."  Zhang Ju's voice changed slightly: "Her name was Chang Wenyu, the only person who did not ignore me."  "I confided my grievances to her, and she expressed understanding."  "Later I told her about my past, told her I wasn't really Lin Sisi."  "She was very interested in what I said, and I liked being with her too, because only when I was with her could I remember myself, not be assimilated by that dream."  "We met on the rooftop every evening, and I slowly felt I couldn't be without her."  "Just when I felt that life was gradually gaining color, she suddenly asked me a question—do you want to see the view outside the school?"  "I didn't understand the significance of this question at the time; I just thought about being with her, so I nodded."  "That night, after midnight, she took me to the library."  "The school library's door was always locked; we climbed in through a window and found a mirror behind a bookshelf on the third floor."  "That mirror was very large, the girl said it could still be used a few times, and told me never to tell anyone."  "I trusted her, and at the same time, I remembered something—this was the first time I saw a mirror in a dream!"  "I asked the girl what I should do."  "The girl just said to quietly watch the mirror."  "I stood in front of the mirror, and she hid behind me. In the dead of night, I watched myself in the mirror."  "The more I looked, the less the person in the mirror resembled me. Gradually, the mirror image began to bleed, scars appearing on the face."  "His ears withered, his left eye closed, his face a blur of blood and flesh!"  "I didn't dare to continue watching, but when I wanted to leave, the monster in the mirror grabbed me!"  "Blood flowed on the mirror's surface until it stained the entire mirror red!"  "I screamed for help, turning to look at Chang Wenyu, but she was indifferent. I still remember the last thing she said to me—why be afraid? The you in the mirror, that's the real you."  "Her slender fingers gently pressed on my left eye, slowly taking it out!"  "The world lost color in an instant, and I was dragged away by the monster in the mirror, all the wonderful expectations turning into the most malicious curse at that moment." Chapter 815: This Is Just a Speculation  "Chang Wenyu took my left eye, and now I look exactly like the monster in the mirror," he said. "She shattered all my illusions; I am not Lin Sisi but Zhang Ju. The terrifying monster in the mirror, that is myself." Blood seeped from his wounds, and Zhang Ju's coat was mostly stained red, what's more terrifying was the intertwining and entangling bloodstains on his clothes, growing more and more.  At first, Chen Ge thought Zhang Ju was in a half-red coat, but he quickly realized he had underestimated the other party. As memories were awakened, the bloodstains on Zhang Ju's body grew more and more, almost enough to stain his whole body red.  "I was dragged into the mirror, watching Chang Wenyu standing outside the mirror, pinching my left eye, her lips moving, seemingly saying—just one more."  "My left eye slowly changed in her hands, the memories of my life flashing through the pupil. When she took my left eye, she also took away all my beauty and hope."  Drip, drip... The blood on Zhang Ju's body dripped onto the corridor floor, and there were faint footsteps in the teaching building, but no matter which direction he looked, there was no one coming.  "What kind of world is behind the mirror?" Chen Ge asked softly.  "Red, there is only red there, everything is red," Zhang Ju described, which made Chen Ge think of the scene behind the door of the three-star trial mission: "Then how did you come back from there?"  "There was another me in the mirror, all blood red, wanting to devour me. I didn't have time to think too much, I could only flee in panic. After running for a long time, I realized that the school behind the mirror was also empty, at least it seemed that way on the surface."  "What happened after that?"  "I didn't survive the first night, and in the end, the other me from behind the mirror caught me."  A hint of confusion appeared in Zhang Ju's eyes: "In my memory, he killed me, but when I opened my eyes again, I was back in this school and lost most of my memories, becoming one of the members of this school."  "So you mean, your memories were tampered with after you died?"  "That's one way to understand it, I don't know exactly what happened in between. If you want to get to the bottom of it, you probably need to go find the answer in the blood-red world behind the mirror."  Zhang Ju probably wasn't lying; although his appearance was terrifying, his expression was very serious.  "I think I understand," Chen Ge said softly: "Normally, the 'door' is the only passage into the blood-red world, but in this scene, there is a ghost beyond our imagination, possibly an existence above the red-clothed ones. This guy uses the mirror as a medium and has separated another scene in the blood-red world, which is the school we are in now. Do you understand what I'm saying?"  All the club members present shook their heads.  "Let me give you a simple example. We enter the blood-red world through this door. In this blood-red world, we find another mirror, and when we touch the mirror, we enter the world inside the mirror."  "If we compare it to dreaming, it should be easy to understand. Normal people live in reality; when we fall asleep and dream, our thoughts appear in the dream world. But what happens if we dream within the dream world? Our consciousness will appear in a dream within a dream."  "The blood-red world is made up of despair and negative emotions, while the world behind the mirror is more like a 'dream' created by the person who pushed the door."  Chen Ge had a hard time explaining clearly to the students, but he did figure out a key issue. When he woke up, he had lost contact with all staff, and the black phone was not with him, which made his situation very dangerous.  He could not understand how the owner of the school did it. Not to mention the black phone, his shadow was supposed to hide Zhang Ya, but at this moment, his shadow became very normal, Zhang Ya was not inside.  This can explain that he did not really enter this school in his true body.  Just like what Zhang Ju just said, when he looked in the mirror, there was another him inside the mirror. One gentle and kind, and the other cruel and bloody – the combination of the two is the real him.  "I must have encountered the same problem as Zhang Ju, part of my personality inside the mirror, part of it outside."  All this was Chen Ge's speculation and could not be guaranteed to be 100% correct. He was like walking in the fog, and the only light in the world at this moment was himself.  "The mirror used by Chang Wenyu is in the library; after looking at the bathroom, the next step is to go to the library," Chen Ge said his thoughts.  "Why do you want to go there when everyone avoids that place?" Zhang Ju couldn't understand Chen Ge; his memory had just awakened, various memories were surfacing in his mind, and his eyes were somewhat confused.  "Compared to here, I prefer the blood-red world because that place seems more real."  From what Chen Ge said, it was clear that he was not an ordinary person. After thinking about it, Zhang Ju did not object: "Well, I also want to figure out what exactly happened to me; shouldn't I be dead?"  After getting Zhang Ju's affirmative response, Chen Ge looked more relaxed; he now had a very good helper.  "Let's go, let's check out the bathroom first."  Chen Ge and his party had already stayed in the corridor for a long time, and fortunately, nothing abnormal happened in the teaching building.  Zhang Ju's blood dripped onto the ground, accompanied by the drip-drip sound, and faint footsteps could be heard gradually approaching, but strangely, they only heard footsteps without seeing anyone.  "Zhu Long, did you see the change in Zhang Ju? His face... it's too terrifying."  Zhou Tu didn't dare to approach Zhang Ju and Chen Ge, feeling that both of them were crazy.  "At this point, we can only trust Teacher Bai. Doesn't the change in Zhang Ju also prove that he hasn't deceived us? We are finding back our lost memories."  Zhu Long's face wasn't looking too good either; clenching his teeth, the fingers holding the phone had turned white.  "Okay." Zhou Tu turned his head to look behind him, and he was scared out of his wits, not daring to go back alone: "I must be crazy to have joined such a club."  He steeled his heart and looked down to pick up the kitchen knife on the ground, but at the moment he lowered his head, the moment his vision inverted, he saw a row of inverted heads staring at him from the corridor behind him.  No, that's not right! To be precise, those upside-down people were all staring at Wang Yicheng on the backs of Zhang Ju and Chen Ge!  Zhou Tu was so scared that he almost knelt on the ground, but thankfully Zhu Long helped him up.  "What's wrong?"  "There's someone behind us! There are a lot of people following us!" Zhou Tu's voice was trembling.  "Where?" Zhu Long looked back, and the empty corridor was clearly only a few of them: "Are you having a hallucination?" Chapter 816: The Faceless Boy  Zhu Long was dragging Zhou Tu along as they looked back. The surroundings were pitch black, and they could faintly hear footsteps, but they couldn't see any living person.  "Where are the people?"  "I saw them when I bent down to pick up the kitchen knife. They were all standing upside down behind us, as if they were living in a world that is the opposite of ours."  Zhou Tu was still in shock, "Those people have been staring at Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng, should we tell Teacher Bai?"  "That might be a good idea." Zhu Long looked back doubtfully, Zhou Tu didn't seem to be lying.  While they were distracted, Chen Ge and Zhang Ju had already reached the middle of the corridor. The closer they got to the bathroom, the more nervous they became.  "Teacher Bai, Zhou Tu just saw people following us from behind, all of them standing upside down. I don't know how to explain it; you'd better ask Zhou Tu."  Zhu Long pulled Zhou Tu to Chen Ge's side.  "When I bent down to pick up the kitchen knife just now, I saw that there were people behind us, their heads down, floating in the air. No, they're like walking on the ceiling. Those guys must have been attracted by Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. I saw with my own eyes, those upside-down monsters were always staring at Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng."  Zhou Tu didn't want to get close to Zhang Ju, it was an instinctive aversion.  "Upside-down people?" Chen Ge had also seen those guys in the lab building: "Let's go to the bathroom first to see if 'the door' exists. If there's no gain in the bathroom, we'll leave immediately."  This school was too strange, even with the protection of the Red-clothed, it couldn't give Chen Ge a sense of security.  They quickened their pace, and just as Chen Ge was a few steps away from the bathroom, his neck was suddenly choked by a pair of hands. The cold, thin arms locked his neck, and the other party was slowly exerting force, making it difficult for Chen Ge to breathe.  "Wang Yicheng? Are you awake?" Chen Ge turned his head, Wang Yicheng's head was resting on his shoulder, his eyes full of black and red bloodshot, and he seemed to have been fighting something in his mind all along.  "Don't go in, they are inside."  Wang Yicheng's voice was very different from his usual voice, with a strong sense of regret, giving the impression of a scarred stray dog, fiercely protecting a companion's body, then allowing others to beat him.  "They? Who are they?"  "Classmates, seniors, everyone who hates you is inside. Don't go over there. I've secretly told the teacher."  Wang Yicheng tried to squeeze out a smile, but he couldn't.  "Did you get hit in the head by someone? Why are you talking nonsense?" Zhu Long held a pink phone and quietly approached Chen Ge, the atmosphere in this teaching building was too oppressive, only by following Chen Ge could he feel a little sense of security.  "Wang Yicheng, did you remember something?" Wang Yicheng's memory was triggered at the entrance of the West Campus bathroom. At that time, Chen Ge worried about exposure and knocked him unconscious. Now, although he has woken up, he seemed to be a bit mentally confused.  "They told me to deceive you into going in, I didn't agree, they beat me, made me limp and climb the stairs. I did what they said, but they still didn't plan to let you go. Remember, no matter who tells you to go to the bathroom on the top floor of the teaching building, you must not go! Do not go there!"  Wang Yicheng's voice was weak, and he seemed to be extremely feeble.  "Besides you, did they find someone else to lure Lin Sisi?"  "I don't know, but I've told the teacher everything, why hasn't he come yet!"  Wang Yicheng was a little anxious, the only lifeline in his heart was that teacher, but the teacher seemed to not appear, maybe that teacher also hated Lin Sisi very much.  "It's okay, I'm just going to take a look."  "Don't go! Do not go in!"  Wang Yicheng regarded Chen Ge as Lin Sisi, these were his true inner thoughts, and it was obvious that he felt very guilty and wanted to make amends.  Having already reached the door, it was impossible for Chen Ge to give up, and now with the help of Zhang Ju, this half-body Red-clothed who was constantly getting stronger was one of Chen Ge's reliance.  Wang Yibao's arms were exerting more and more force, and his arms showed bulging veins, the boy desperately trying to stop Chen Ge from going in, probably not wanting to see the tragedy happen again before his eyes.  The top-floor bathroom of the teaching building was at the deepest part of the corridor, the air here was filled with a pungent smell of disinfectant, and the wall tiles showed yellow-brown stains, the ground was left with water stains, as well as various shoe prints.  Those shoe prints came from different people, and there were many of them.  The bathroom door was locked, Chen Ge took out tools to forcefully open it.  When Chen Ge pushed open the wooden door of the bathroom, he stepped back, carefully looking inside the bathroom.  The bathroom in the East Campus looked completely different from the one in the West Campus, very dirty and messy, as if this place had been forgotten by the school authorities, never cleaned, and no one had ever come in.  "Has this bathroom been locked up since the incident with Lin Sisi?" Chen Ge turned to ask Wang Yicheng, but the boy could no longer speak, his body shaking violently as if he was having a seizure.  Compared to the West Campus, this bathroom gave Chen Ge a more realistic feeling, he carried Wang Yicheng into it.  As soon as he stepped into the bathroom, Wang Yicheng immediately closed his eyes, he didn't dare to look or to remember.  "This room gives me a different feeling than the others."  Zhang Ju looked around, the walls were covered with bloodshot-like things, crawling all over the bathroom like cracks.  The ghost faces drawn on the walls had become blurred, like memories that are about to be forgotten.  Those dried bloodshots crawled over all the patterns on the walls, wrapping them up, as if they didn't want to see them anymore.  Reaching the first stall, Chen Ge pulled out Lin Sisi's mobile phone and stretched it into the gap of the stall, and the screen showed a few figures moving.  "Who is inside?"  Chen Ge forcefully opened the stall door, and the scene before him was beyond his expectations.  Inside the first stall was a mannequin model, wearing a pair of black leather shoes, aged between thirty and forty years old, looking very much like the Teacher Bai Chen Ge had seen before.  "There were a pair of shoes placed in the West Campus bathroom, but the first stall of the East Campus actually has a mannequin, why is there such a difference?"  The Teacher Bai mannequin in the stall stood with his head down, his hands clasped behind his head, standing upright as if he had done something wrong.  Chen Ge used the Yin Eye but didn't see any problems, in the end, he took out Lin Sisi's phone and took a picture of the first stall.  The image on the screen surprised him.  The mannequin of Teacher Bai stood in the stall, but the picture taken by the phone showed a faceless boy, his hands clasped behind his head, in the same pose as Teacher Bai.  "Could this faceless boy be Lin Sisi? Had Teacher Bai punished him in this way before? So he used the same method to target Teacher Bai?" Chapter 817: Would You Be My Friend?  Chen Ge pushed open the second compartment, and inside was a thin male mannequin with a deformed foot, curled up inside, surrounded by mud and garbage. "Looks a bit like Wang Yicheng."  The mannequin in the second compartment and Wang Yicheng, whom Chen Ge was carrying on his back, were both wearing blue sneakers. This mannequin was supposed to represent Wang Yicheng.  Chen Ge raised his phone to take a picture of the second compartment, and the image on the screen was heartbreaking.  The faceless child was cornered into the toilet compartment by a group of people, who threw all sorts of garbage at him.  The boy in the image didn't resist and let himself be bullied.  The mannequin in the third compartment wore a pair of glasses, his body splashed with red paint, standing dully against the toilet compartment wall.  This mannequin looked somewhat similar to the tall and thin boy Chen Ge had seen in dormitory 413.  With the experience from before, Chen Ge directly aimed his phone at the compartment.  On the screen appeared a faceless boy, standing alone in the toilet compartment, with people continuously splashing paint into the compartment.  His originally clean clothes became dirty, and the paint slid down the hem of his clothes.  The boy bowed his head, silent.  "These bullies have already lost control as a group," Chen Ge pushed open the door of the fourth compartment, where the mannequin had no clothes on, and its clothes were wet and thrown beside the squat toilet.  Chen Ge took out his phone to film the fourth compartment, and in the image, the faceless boy slowly took off his paint-covered outerwear as someone poured bottles of water over him.  The fifth compartment, the sixth compartment...  Each compartment's scene was shocking. When people fall into madness, they do not realize how egregious their behavior is, and they unscrupulously vent all their negative emotions on one person.  When opening the first compartment, Chen Ge just wanted to find the truth, everything here was unrelated, he was just a passerby, a victim wanting to break free.  But after seeing six compartments in a row, his heart had already changed unknowingly, his face darkening. If someone familiar with him saw this, they would be very surprised because this man rarely showed such an expression.  A change in expression is a change in inner emotions, revealed on the face, the thoughts in the heart would be exposed, and weaknesses would be discovered. Therefore, Chen Ge always maintained his calm when executing tasks for the black phone.  "Are these still kids?"  Looking up, Chen Ge turned towards the seventh compartment, the only one without a mannequin placed inside, and also the only one without a door panel.  The door hinge was violently damaged, with splintered wood still visible at the joint. The door of the seventh compartment had been knocked open.  The door had disappeared, and the inside of the compartment was covered with blood-like strands. To be precise, the blood strands in the toilet actually all crawled out from this compartment, making the seventh compartment the source of all the bloodstains.  "Was Lin Sisi originally locked in this compartment?"  Those black and red blood strands looked like withered ivy, climbing all over the walls of the compartment, seemingly covering something.  Chen Ge took out Lin Sisi's phone, turned the screen brightness to the brightest, and then filmed the compartment.  The faceless boy was holding his outerwear and trousers, dirty water and paint flowing down his body, colorful, like a monster with fangs and claws clinging to his body.  The door of the toilet compartment in the screen seemed to be blocked from the outside, the boy with his head down, holding clothes, bumping against the door again and again.  He had no face, his expression couldn't be seen, his voice couldn't be heard, and it was unknown whether he was crying or calling for help.  All Chen Ge could see was the child continuously bumping into the door until it was knocked open.  He stood barefoot at the compartment entrance, covering his clothes that had been splashed with paint and dirty water, his arms hanging down, the arms that had been hitting the door were cut by wood splinters, blood trailing on his arms, but the paint flowed into the wounds.  Oppressed, uncomfortable, gasping for air, his neck twisted, that face without features scanned the empty toilet, the evildoers had left, but their malicious words seemed to still echo in the toilet.  The boy stood at the compartment entrance for a long time, then slowly raised his hand, putting on the wet clothes one by one.  Apart from his arms, there were no other injuries on his body, but his body trembled with pain.  The pants were cut open in the middle, the back of the clothes had a big hole, the boy put on all his clothes, the reflection on the ground water showed a hideous monster.  He wiped his face, attempting to take a step towards the toilet door.  The light from the corridor shone into the toilet, the exit was very bright, bright enough to clearly illuminate the boy's appearance at that moment, bright enough to leave him nowhere to hide.  The step he took out was retracted, wearing the dirtied clothes, he returned to the seventh compartment.  Leaning against the wall of the toilet compartment, the boy's body slowly slid down, he curled up in the corner, that face without features faced the toilet entrance, as if waiting for the lights to go out.  The scene on the phone screen did not end there, the child looked for a long time, then raised his head.  The face without features faced Chen Ge, as if he knew someone was watching him.  "Would you like to be my friend?"  Chen Ge heard such a sentence in his ear, he heard it very clearly, but when he looked in the direction the sound came from, there was nothing there.  "Did it come from the phone? Impossible."  The filming scene froze at the last moment, the faceless boy curled up in the corner of the compartment, that face facing Chen Ge, as if waiting for Chen Ge's reply.  "I'm willing to be your friend, though your words sound very much like a curse."  Chen Ge didn't care about curses, his life changed from a cursed love letter, without that letter, during the first task, he would have been chopped up by Wang Qi.  Chen Ge agreed, but the boy on the phone screen still maintained that gesture.  Moving away the phone, there was nothing in the seventh compartment, but the faceless boy could be clearly seen when filmed with the phone.  "Can you hear my voice?" Chen Ge tried to communicate with the other party, with no effect, he waited for a while, and the image on the phone screen changed again.  The door of the seventh toilet compartment was pushed open, and a blood-red hand reached in.  This hand gently grabbed the faceless boy, seemingly saying something to the boy, and the faceless boy lightly nodded.  Afterward, the faceless boy was led by that hand, walking towards the other side of the "door," disappearing from sight.  "That blood hand came from 'inside the door'? What did he say to the boy?" Chen Ge suddenly thought of the sentence he just heard: "The words spoken by the owner of the blood hand to the faceless boy, could it be that sentence—Would you like to be my friend?"  "The faceless boy agreed, and then he disappeared from sight?" Chen Ge carefully sorted through the details.  The faceless boy was Lin Sisi, he made no movement to push the door, but that blood hand was extended from inside the door, meaning there was originally a door in the toilet compartment.  The owner of the blood hand invited Lin Sisi, and in the end, Lin Sisi agreed to the other party. Thinking this way, that blood hand was the one who pushed the door. Chapter 818: He and I May Not Necessarily Be Enemies  After going around in circles, Chen Ge finally found the real master of the ghost school. Although he only saw the other party's hand, this was a big step forward for Chen Ge. "Just now, I heard someone asking in my ear—do you want to be my friend?" "This sentence did not come from the phone; I heard it very clearly coming from next to my ear." "What he said might not have been meant for Lin Sisi, but for me."  Chen Ge turned his head and saw that the black and red blood strands in the toilet cubicle had begun to fall off in large patches, just like the leaves in autumn, completely devoid of life. "Did you agree to him?" Wang Yicheng, who had been keeping his eyes tightly shut on Chen Ge's back, suddenly spoke. He buried his head in Chen Ge's shoulder; his voice was so low that one could hardly hear it if they didn't listen carefully. "Sort of, he looked quite pitiful."  Chen Ge's neck was tightly choked by Wang Yicheng, their bodies pressed together, and he could feel Wang Yicheng's body temperature continuously dropping. "All his friends are dead, all dead!" The sound of dripping came from behind Chen Ge, and he felt his shoulder getting moist. Turning his head, he saw that his left shoulder had been soaked with blood. The bright red was somewhat glaring to the eyes.  "You..." Chen Ge shook Wang Yicheng off his back. The child flailed his hands helplessly, violently scratching at the air, with blood tears seeping from his tightly closed eyes: "Did you remember something?"  Revisiting the old place, Wang Yicheng's memory was triggered. He had not opened his eyes but realized what had happened just by hearing Chen Ge's words. "There's no escape. You agreed to that person; he will come to find you, no matter where you go, he will find you!" Wang Yicheng's voice changed greatly, he fell into madness, completely different from the cowardice and timidity he showed at the beginning.  "If he doesn't come looking for me, I will go looking for him. I'm the kind of person who likes making friends, in all sorts of ways." Chen Ge had many friends, but they were not with him, so he also wanted to make some new friends.  Blood seeped from Wang Yicheng's eyes and slid down his cheeks. His outer garment was dyed red, the bright blood blossoming like flowers on his skin. This seemingly frail boy actually had the potential to become a 'red-clothed.'  "I'm getting more and more interested in the master of the school, how exactly did he bring all of you into the door one by one." Chen Ge did not expect the few club members he had casually found to be extraordinary. There was an element of luck, but it also showed the terror of the ghost school from another perspective. A half-red-clothed alone was enough to support a normal two-star scene, and in the ghost school, Chen Ge had seen several beings who were red-clothed or suspected to be red-clothed.  "Are you constantly joking to cover up the panic inside?" Hearing Wang Yicheng say this, Chen Ge was even more certain that the other party had regained his memory. The previous Wang Yicheng was timid and weak, never raising objections, only blindly complying.  "I'm not joking. To have the despair to push open 'the door,' one must also once have had hope, even if that hope was long crumbled. I genuinely want to help him, and becoming his friend is just the first step." Chen Ge carried Wang Yicheng and walked out of the toilet: "Have you noticed that most of the kids in this school have a deformed childhood, or congenital physical defects, or their personalities become twisted due to some external factors, each of them has their own unbearable memories."  "What are you trying to say?" "I'm very curious about what the school master has experienced before. As the one who pushed the door, what kind of experience made him push open this 'door'?" "Agreeing to be his friend would mean being left behind forever. The school was not so big before, it became what it is now because of continuous addition of despair and pain."  After Wang Yicheng said this, the bleeding from his eyes stopped, but his body was still trembling continuously. "It seems you know a lot of things." Chen Ge felt that this school was very similar to his own haunted house, except the ghost school was constantly looking for those despairing students, or rather, attracting those children who exuded an aura of despair, while Chen Ge's haunted house was open to all comers: "This school has been around for many years, hasn't it?"  "What I can remember is that when I opened my eyes, I was here. I don't have Zhang Ju's experiences; I died in this school and was reborn here, forgetting many things, only knowing that the scale of this school has been expanding."  "Why are you here? Could it be Lin Sisi's punishment for you?" Chen Ge asked another question he was curious about. Wang Yicheng paused for a while before speaking: "I am the only one that Lin Sisi let go. The reason I came here is that after Lin Sisi disappeared, I became his substitute. The panic and unease of the classmates turned into violence against me, and one night when I was about to collapse, that door found me."  "And then you came in? According to what Zhang Ju said, the door would appear far away from where you sleep the first time, and then it gets closer to you every day..." Chen Ge did not finish speaking, as he was interrupted by Wang Yicheng.  "He was completely passive, but I was active. I wanted to find a corner to hide, and moreover..." Wang Yicheng hesitated for a long time and revealed another secret: "At that time, the hand that reached out of the door was smeared with various paints, it was Lin Sisi's hand. He was inviting me, and I wanted to apologize to him face to face. That day I actually reported to the teacher, but he didn't come."  "What else do you know about Lin Sisi and this door?" "Nothing more, after entering the door, I did not see Lin Sisi, I haven't seen him until today." Wang Yicheng released his hands: "You can put me down."  "Are you sure you're not lying?" Chen Ge put down Wang Yicheng: "At the entrance of the Western Campus toilet, as soon as your memory showed signs of loosening, the school's manager appeared immediately, and in the end, if I hadn't knocked you out, we might have been caught by now, your treatment is completely different from Zhang Ju and Zhu Long."  "Maybe it's because Lin Sisi was his friend, and I was Lin Sisi's friend." The group passed by seven cubicles in turn, recording the events that Lin Sisi had encountered, which the phone only captured a part of.  "I can't imagine what the door-pusher had experienced before." As they were about to leave the toilet, Chen Ge looked at the seventh cubicle: "It can be confirmed that the door is in the seventh cubicle, to understand the school master, just need to investigate all the incidents that happened in the toilets."  Based on the clues already obtained, Chen Ge is preparing to go to three places next—the school archive room, the school library, and the oil painting room in the experimental building that Zhou Tu promised. Chapter 819: They Are Here  There might be information about the school's master in the school's archives room, a mirror that leads to the blood-red world might be hidden in the library, and the oil painting room in the experimental building is where Chen Ge promised to take Zhou Tu.  "Where should we go first?" Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu: "I know the location of the art club, and I've seen the scenes in your dreams. I can take you there anytime now, but are you really prepared to awaken your memories?"  Zhou Tu hadn't communicated much with Chen Ge and was somewhat at a loss when suddenly asked this question.  Before regaining his memory, he had always wanted to know what he had forgotten, but after seeing the fates of Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng, he began to hesitate.  "Are you ready to face the past? Without regaining your memory, you are just an insignificant student in this school, you can live without worries, repeating a peaceful and beautiful day. Once you awaken your memory, you will definitely be pursued by the school's administrators, and there will be no turning back."  Chen Ge kept questioning Zhou Tu, which was also a test. Among all the club members, Zhou Tu was the most decisive.  "I've thought about it, and it's better to regain my memory. Without the past, no matter how comfortable life is, it's just deceiving oneself."  Zhou Tu's gaze moved to Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng: "I don't know if the real me will scare myself to tears."  "Maybe you should consider it a bit longer," Zhang Ju said with a hoarse voice, turning his burned face away. "There's something about you that makes me very uncomfortable. The real you must be a terrifying monster."  Zhou Tu was momentarily speechless and did not know how to respond. His gaze was elusive, and he seemed to waver again in his heart.  "Let's go to the school's archives room first. You still have enough time to think about it."  Chen Ge patted Zhou Tu's shoulder lightly: "Don't feel pressured. I respect whatever choice you make."  "Thank you."  Zhou Tu looked down in contemplation, while Zhang Ju nudged Chen Ge: "His true form must be terrifying. If he can regain his memory, whatever we want to do next will be easier."  "Everyone has their own choices. I won't interfere."  "Aren't you helping us regain our memories just to let us retrieve our pasts and increase our strength, and then help you achieve your own goals?" Zhang Ju was somewhat puzzled, clearly remembering what Chen Ge had said before, that everyone was just in a relationship of mutual assistance and use.  "I once read a phrase in a book, 'A rose does not ask why, nor does it ask for a return. It blooms simply because it blooms.' Although I can't be so selfless, at least I have experienced the pain you all have gone through, and seeing you reminds me of myself."  Chen Ge looked seriously at the other club members: "Also, there's another point I want to reiterate. Our relationship is not one of mutual use, but of mutual benefit. Respect for each other is just the foundation."  Listening to Chen Ge's voice, for a moment, all the ghosts seemed to forget that the man in front of them was just an ordinary person.  Maybe he just hadn't regained his memories yet.  Zhang Ju and Zhu Long nodded and followed Chen Ge's steps.  Wang Yicheng opened his eyes filled with blood and tears, seemingly agreeing more with Chen Ge.  Zhou Tu, walking at the back, seemed to be in deep thought, his gaze gradually becoming firm.  Returning to the corridor, Chen Ge had only taken a few steps when he felt something was not quite right.  There was a strong stench in the air, a smell he had encountered before in the experimental building.  A bad premonition arose in his heart, and the further Chen Ge walked, the more oppressed he felt, as if walking at the bottom of a lake, with coldness surging from all directions.  "Have those inverted monsters appeared again?"  Chen Ge didn't look down. What had happened had happened, and looking down would only disturb his judgment. What he needed was to get as far away from the teaching building as possible.  Standing with Zhang Ju, Chen Ge's pupils shrank, and he lowered his voice: "Do you see the monsters in the corridor?"  "Monsters?" Zhang Ju stared at the corridor, blood flowing down his coat: "It seems there is something, but they don't seem to be able to harm us."  Before he finished speaking, Zhang Ju saw his hair floating upwards, as if an invisible baby in the dark was pulling at his hair.  Small wounds began to appear on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng's bodies, and those monsters were attracted by the two of them.  "I can't see them, how are they causing me harm?" Zhang Ju's scarred face was bleeding, his blood fluttering around him. Although his memory had awakened, he had not yet learned how to use this power.  "As long as we invert our vision, we can see them, but I don't recommend you do that."  "Why?"  "Because after you see them, you will feel even more despair."  Chen Ge signaled everyone to immediately leave through the stairwell. Whether those monsters attacked Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng out of instinct or were directed by someone, if it was the latter, it would be more troublesome.  The stench around them grew stronger, and more wounds appeared on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng's bodies. Notably, with each new wound on their bodies, a very thin black thread would burrow into their flesh, which looked very much like a curse.  Just as they ran to the third-floor corner, Wang Yicheng couldn't hold on any longer, his steps becoming weaker: "I feel like many things are tearing at my body, and my memory is becoming fuzzy again."  "Mr. Bai, the situation is not good, there seems to be more dirty stuff downstairs," Zhou Tu said softly. They had just reached the third floor when they smelled a pungent stench, and what was more eerie was that the smell came from right beside them.  Looking down, Zhou Tu saw the place beside him that emitted the stench, just like when he picked up a kitchen knife earlier, he looked up from below. In the empty space between him and Wang Yicheng, there was an inverted human face, the monster's outer clothing was tightly attached to the flesh, it seemed to have no skin, blood vessels surged under the clothes, blood and clothing stuck together, dyeing the whole garment bright red!  "Wang, Wang Yicheng, that thing is right in front of you!" Zhou Tu screamed. His memory had not yet awakened, and seeing such a scene, he was so frightened that he almost fell down the stairs.  "I told you not to look. Out of sight, out of mind."  Chen Ge picked up Wang Yicheng and stepped on the spot with the strongest stench, then ran downstairs.  Zhou Tu held his chest, the spot where Chen Ge stepped was precisely the head of the monster: "Okay, I understand."  As they descended to the second floor, the foul smell filled the corridor. Zhu Long, whose memory was loosening, also became a target of those monsters.  Zhang Ju could still withstand it, but Zhu Long and Wang Yicheng could not hold on any longer. They could only continue forward with the help of Chen Ge and Zhou Tu. Chapter 820: The Archives  Things were still heading in a worse direction. Zhou Tu also began to be targeted by the monster, and the first wound appeared on his fingers.  "Teacher Bai, what should we do now?" Chen Ge had no better solution. All he could do was clench his teeth. Even if everyone was torn and bitten by the monster and lost the ability to move, he would bring them all out.  A foul smell rushed into their nostrils, almost causing fainting. As Chen Ge, carrying Wang Yicheng, was about to approach the corner of the first floor, a sudden sharp pain erupted in his chest.  Staggering, Chen Ge almost fell to the ground.  He looked down and saw a sharp spike had pierced his chest.  "The curse of dormitory 413?" He immediately realized something and looked at his shadow.  The normally normal shadow was now twisting continuously, as if the "person" hiding inside was enduring great pain.  "Even he is being attacked?"   The club members had all reached their limits, covered in wounds, looking very frightening.  "The exit is right in front of us, don't stop!"  Chen Ge's will was very strong; he had long been accustomed to pain.  Pulling out the nail, Chen Ge desperately ran forward, knowing that even one more step taken meant he would be a little closer to hope.  "Thud!" Zhou Tu, carrying Zhu Long, fell on the stairs. His right hand was full of wounds, looking like it was about to split open.  "My hand that I use to draw and hold a pen..."  It was already very difficult for Chen Ge to bring one person out; bringing out a few more was simply impossible: "Hang on! We're almost at the first floor!"  Their legs felt like they were filled with lead, each step becoming heavy. The stench on the first floor was even stronger than on the second floor; there were more monsters waiting for them there.  Everyone except for Chen Ge had already despaired, but just then, the foul smell in the air suddenly faded a bit, as if someone had led some of the monsters away.  "Opportunity!" Chen Ge pulled up Zhou Tu, carrying Wang Yicheng, and sprinted with all his might. When he reached the first floor, he saw a dark figure standing at the other end of the corridor.  The figure's physique was very similar to Chang Gu, with a hint of scarlet light floating in his left eye, his outer garment soaked with fresh blood, and it seemed like he was holding something in his hand.  "Chang Gu?" Chen Ge called out directly, but the other party did not respond, turned away, and the stench in the corridor faded a bit more.  "Did he lead those monsters away?" The Chang Gu in Chen Ge's memory was timid and weak, which was very different from the figure he had just seen: "He only entered the door a few seconds earlier than me, what happened to him?"  That figure had led away most of the monsters, and Chen Ge hurriedly led the club members out of the teaching building.  "Teacher Bai, what was the deal with those monsters just now? Why could we only see them by reversing our vision? And why did they only attack Wang Yicheng and Zhang Ju, but not you?" Zhou Tu collapsed on the ground, feeling as if the stench had permeated his body.  "Those monsters should be used by the school to punish students; it's even possible that they were once students who had broken school rules."  Chen Ge hadn't expected those monsters to not even be afraid of the red-clothed ones; they had completely lost their reason and were a group of utter madmen.  "The schoolmaster wants to create a beautiful 'paradise' behind 'the door'; you all recalled the past, which goes against his original intention, so naturally, he will target you."  Chen Ge checked Wang Yicheng and Zhang Ju's bodies. The black threads had already drilled into their wounds, and near the wounds, one could faintly smell a faint stench: "Be careful, those monsters might want to turn you into one of them."  Standing outside the teaching building, Chen Ge used his Yin pupils to scan left and right but did not see the dark figure that had saved him in the end.  "If he really is Chang Gu, why doesn't he come to find me? Is it not yet time to meet? Or perhaps he has already been targeted?"  Chen Ge and Chang Gu had little interaction; he needed to guess Chang Gu's thoughts before he could make the right choice.  "It's good to have someone to distract for me."  Chen Ge helped up Wang Yicheng: "Let's go, we'll head to the office building now, the school archives should be there."  ...  The office building in the west campus was very close to the fence, and standing at the highest point of the office building, one could take in the entire east and west campuses.  "I've seen several types of monsters in this school: ordinary fierce ghosts and obsessions, ordinary red-clothed ones, the white-clothed, burnt managers in the west campus, and the monsters in the east campus with their heads down and emitting a stench. Besides them, the most dangerous ones are the teachers and dormitory managers of this school. We're going to the office building, and there's a high chance of encountering them, so everyone must be careful."  Knowing the risks, Chen Ge didn't hesitate to go toward danger, a situation he had encountered before, but it was somewhat uncomfortable for the other club members.  "Teacher Bai, aren't you also a teacher?"  "Do you guys think I'm not dangerous?" Without turning his head, Chen Ge casually said a word and took the lead into the office building.  He had been to the west campus office building before, but what he didn't expect was that the interior architectural styles of the office buildings in the east and west campuses were vastly different.  The office building in the west campus was clean and tidy, but upon entering the east campus office building, it felt very oppressive. The floor had not been cleaned for a long time, with mud footprints remaining, the walls were scratched, the originally white wall plaster had turned light yellow, and there were large patches of mold scars.  "Do the teachers in the east campus usually work in this place?" Zhou Tu couldn't quite believe it.  "In this school, the duty of teachers is not to educate you but to manage you. Most of their time is spent with students, and the office building is just a place with symbolic meaning."  Chen Ge tried to push open the door of an office, and it wasn't locked; it opened with a push.  The various facilities in the room were very old, looking like they were from many years ago.  "I've been here before; I know where the archives are." Zhang Ju said coldly, becoming more and more taciturn since retrieving his memory.  "When did you come here?" Zhou Tu was a bit afraid of the current Zhang Ju and unconsciously lowered his voice when speaking.  "Before I was deceived by Chang Wen Yu, in order to figure out what this school was all about, I had secretly come to the archives."  Zhang Ju walked in front: "Stick close to me. This place makes me very uncomfortable; there might be something very dangerous hidden."  Whether the monsters in the office building had sensed Zhang Ju in advance or for other reasons, they did not encounter danger along the way and smoothly arrived at the third floor of the office building.  "This is the archives room. We'll find what we want and leave immediately, don't stay too long. I always feel like there are other people in the building."  Zhang Ju opened the door to the archives room, which was filled with several rusty metal cabinets and four rows of wooden shelves. Chapter 821: The Fire!  The archive room was filled with a musty smell, and Chen Ge was the first to enter, covering his mouth and nose. The wooden bookshelves looked ancient, and when placed next to the rusty filing cabinets, there was an inexplicable sense of dissonance.  "These bookshelves and metal cabinets seem to be from different schools," Chen Ge commented as he casually took a document from the wooden shelf, but perhaps due to the poor storage conditions, the folder tore with just a little force.  "Bug-eaten, damp, these materials seem to have been completely neglected by the school authorities." Chen Ge carefully opened the damaged folder, and the contents puzzled him, "A donor thank you list? Why does this paper look familiar?"  Chen Ge looked over it again and again, and suddenly a scene flashed in his mind. He looked at the worm-eaten folder in surprise: "I seem to have seen a list like this in the principal's office of Mu Yang High School!"  He observed carefully, tried hard to remember, and was even more surprised when he compared the names of the donors. "It's exactly the same! I've seen this list in the principal's office of Mu Yang High School!"  Originally, he had entered Mu Yang High School several times in search of the old principal. He had turned the two-star horror scene upside down, but unfortunately, not even digging three feet deep revealed the old principal.  "The world behind the door is woven from the memories of the person who pushes it open. This school is special; it seems to be formed by the combined memories of everyone inside the door," Chen Ge pondered with his chin propped up. "Besides the old principal, everyone else from Mu Yang High School is in my haunted house. Does the appearance of Mu Yang High School's donor list here mean that the old principal might also be inside the school?"  Chen Ge's eyes widened as he looked at the musty bookshelf, and the more he looked at it, the more familiar it seemed: "Could these items have been moved from Mu Yang High School? Could a part of that two-star scene be hidden here?"  "It seems I really do have a fate with the old principal." He put the document back in its place, his expression enigmatic: "Before the Psychic Ghost School trial mission is unlocked, there are nine prerequisite tasks. Could all these nine prerequisite tasks have some special connection with the Psychic Ghost School?"  "Mr. Bai, have you discovered something?" came a voice.  "I have made some discoveries, but nothing is certain yet," Chen Ge replied as he pulled out another moldy archive, covered in mildew: "A survey of the school's surrounding environment?"  The place was called an archive room, but it was more like a storeroom for documents, containing all sorts of files and materials, including graduation projects, reimbursement bills, club statistics, cafeteria procurement catalogs, and so on.  "Mr. Bai!" Zhu Long pulled out several crumpled newspapers from a corner and handed one to Chen Ge: "Look at the big picture in that news article in the middle."  "The teaching building caught fire for unknown reasons, several students were trapped in the bathroom, and firefighters bravely entered the blaze to rescue them." This report was prominently placed in the center of the newspaper.  "Judging by the layout and content, the person who wrote this report should be quite young." Chen Ge took the newspaper, which was covered with mildew and stained, making many parts unclear: "This seems to be the school newspaper."  Mu Yang High School was just a private welfare institution; it didn't have the resources to start a school newspaper. After flipping through the papers, Chen Ge came across a familiar place name—West City Private Academy.  This place name appeared multiple times, with many reports revolving around West City Private Academy. "Isn't West City Private Academy the school where Zhang Ya is?" Chen Ge recalled the abandoned school where he had his first date with the girl in red.  It was also in that school that he had entered Zhang Ya's heart. "Was there a fire in the West City Private Academy teaching building?" Now thinking back, he remembered seeing burnt stair railings in the teaching building: "It's strange, not just West City Private Academy, including Mu Yang High School, all the abandoned schools I've visited bear traces of fire."  He looked over the newspaper Zhu Long gave him again. At the time, firefighters rescued six people from the bathroom on the top floor, and the newspaper praised the firefighters as heroes throughout the article.  But he also noticed a small article in the corner of the newspaper calling for everyone to learn summer fire prevention knowledge, which vaguely mentioned that a student had died in the fire.  "The fire started in the bathroom, but how could a fire start there? The fire broke out after the end of the students' evening self-study session, school was over, so why were those kids in the top floor bathroom?" Combining several reports, Chen Ge acutely sensed the issue: "The fire burned on the fourth floor, and at the time, only the bathroom had students. The firefighters saved six, but one student died in the fire, meaning there must have been seven people in the bathroom!"  The cause of the fire was now unclear, and there was no record of it in the documents and archives. The child who died in the fire seemed to have become taboo.  "Did such a thing happen at West City Private Academy? But I didn't feel anything 'abnormal' when I was there," Chen Ge wondered: "If the door of that bathroom was opened by the student who died in the fire, then he should be West City Private Academy's 'Door Pusher', but West City Private Academy became a three-star scene entirely because of Zhang Ya!"  Now that West City Private Academy has become part of the haunted house scene, Chen Ge was certain that Zhang Ya was the most terrifying presence in that school.  "All three-star scenes have a door, but West City Private Academy, although three-star, has no door." Chen Ge looked towards his shadow, silently chanting that name in his mind, repeatedly calling but getting no response.  "West City Private Academy was rated a three-star scene by the black phone entirely because of Zhang Ya. As far as I know, Zhang Ya never pushed open any door, and I didn't see a door when I went to West City Private Academy..."  Chen Ge's hand holding the newspaper slowly lowered, and he envisioned the figure in the red dress: "Zhang Ya, the door that should exist but disappeared, the Door Pusher..." These three terms in Chen Ge's mind connected into a line, and suddenly he thought of a possibility.  With wide-open eyes, Chen Ge took a deep breath: "Could it be that Zhang Ya ate the Door Pusher of West City Private Academy?"  Only this explanation could account for why Zhang Ya was so different, so outrageously powerful.  "What happens to a door after the Door Pusher is eaten?" Chen Ge speculated on various possibilities: "Because of her obsession, Zhang Ya did not become the 'Door Pusher', so the door missing its 'Door Pusher' should become uncontrollable like the door in Liwan Town, but in reality, that hasn't happened. That door only appears beside those desperate children's beds... Wait! Could it be seeking a new 'Door Pusher'?" Chapter 822: Endlessly Searching for Desperate Children  Chen Ge was startled by his own thoughts—a masterless door endlessly searching for desperate children, spending years of time, eventually turning itself into a four-star scene? This sounded too incredible, and Chen Ge forced himself to calm down.  "In the experimental building's painting room, there are thirteen easels set up, with a total of thirteen people painting. They are aware of the school's secret, blood reversed; they are likely the thirteen candidates the door has been searching for."  It's hard for a single person's power to support a four-star scene unless they surpass the 'Red Specter', but if multiple 'Red Specters' join forces, the outcome is unclear, after all, even he himself has never seen so many 'Red Specters' together.  "Thirteen, this number is truly unlucky." Chen Ge glanced at Zhou Tu. He had been looking for the art club and had even dreamed of the scene inside the painting room. This person should be one of those thirteen painters.  "The door must have selection criteria, Zhang Ju obviously does not meet the criteria, but Zhou Tu does."  Initially, Chen Ge didn't have high expectations for the painting room, but after his analysis, he changed his mind: "Zhou Tu's memory is the key."  Among the club members, Zhou Tu was the most special one, and now Chen Ge needed to prepare for two possibilities.  Zhou Tu regains his memory and tells everything to himself, or Zhou Tu regains his memory and becomes his enemy.  "This is a big fish; was I too casual with him before?" Chen Ge's eyes fixed on Zhou Tu, making him shiver.  "Mr. Bai, I'll go have a look over there."  Zhou Tu found an excuse and ran to the deepest part of the archives.  "Why run? The one who should be afraid is me."  Chen Ge continued searching in the room, and the surprises the archives room brought him were far from over.  Soon, Chen Ge found several reports on fire incidents in the archives room. Fire seemed to have a special meaning in this school, symbolizing both destruction and heralding rebirth.  "There was a fire at Muyang High School, and there are burn marks on the stairs. The school's predecessor was even a crematorium. Now I've discovered that a fire occurred at Xicheng Private Academy as well. Are these coincidences, or is there a deeper reason?"  Besides the fire reports, Chen Ge found several well-preserved student records at the bottom of a metal cabinet, two of which were very special.  One of the records bore the name Lin Sisi, along with evaluations from teachers and classmates.  Classmates were unwilling to befriend him, and teachers didn't bother with him. This child had no mother, and his father was a murderer. He had been adopted since he was young, but for some reason, he often ran away from foster homes, which was very troublesome.  In his view, the only person in the world who truly helped him was an intern at a welfare institute.  That just-graduated college student, despite his own life not yet settled, sponsored Lin Sisi to complete elementary school and even attended Lin Sisi's parent-teacher conference.  According to the teacher's comments, it was only when that intern was present that Lin Sisi's "hyperactivity" could improve somewhat.  The record did not have Lin Sisi's photo and specific information but retained a handwritten signature—Gu Youjia.  The entire record was tattered and moldy, full of wormholes, but only the guardian's signature was clean.  "Gu Youjia, Hengjiang Welfare Institute, if I can live to leave, I might go have a look."  Chen Ge murmured to himself, as if speaking intentionally for someone to hear.  He then turned his attention to another record he had picked out. This record's date was earlier than the others, it had no name written on it, nor any records, just one sentence.  "Endure a little longer, just endure a little longer, everything will get better. They can't bully me forever, one day, I too will grow up."  The writing on the record was crooked, not like a teacher's handwriting, but more like a child's own writing while their hand was injured.  "Endless tolerance only makes the abuser more aggressive, and this is true in any situation. Those who derive pleasure from violence will not empathize or reflect."  Chen Ge took a photo with Lin Sisi's phone and then put the record back in its place.  "The earliest record must have been left by the real 'door-pusher'. After opening the door, his temperament likely changed drastically, going to another extreme."  "If the 'door-pusher' eaten by Zhang Ya is him, then after his death, the door he opened is likely still doing certain things according to his will. If I want to increase my chances of surviving behind the door, it's best to follow his mindset."  School violence has never happened to Chen Ge; the closest he got to school violence was when he was in elementary school.  The teacher asked the children to bring toys they no longer played with to school, to be donated to the welfare institute.  Everyone had donated except Chen Ge, who clutched his backpack and remained silent.  Several of the naughtiest children in the class began to snatch little Chen Ge's backpack, and in the scuffle, they broke the zipper. As a result, a bloody intestine and a backpack full of severed fingers were scattered everywhere.  The lifelike severed fingers rolled around the classroom like chalk, and the bloody plastic intestine even twitched a few times on the desk, scaring all the students and the teacher who was walking over.  Later, when the vice principal came over, he specifically asked the homeroom teacher—what is the family background of this child?  That evening, Chen Ge's parents were called to the school and then taken away by the police for questioning for half a day.  To put it, Chen Ge was probably the only student who was bullied at school, resulting in his parents being questioned by the police.  However, there was a good side to the incident; at least after that, no peer dared to bully Chen Ge again.  "Never give in to school violence."  Chen Ge's words had another meaning: in this school, some victims had become new sources of violence.  The spirit-communicating ghost school was expanding continuously. That door, not stained red with blood, would approach all desperate children, turning them into part of the door, recreating their nightmares behind the door, using their souls as bricks to build a large grave to bury reality.  After searching in the archives room for a long time, until a familiar stench wafted to his nose, Chen Ge decisively led the other club members out of the office building.  "Teacher, we're lucky, those stinky monsters only came looking for us at the very end," Zhu Long whispered.  "It's not good luck, someone helped us distract those monsters."  Chen Ge was not sure if it was Chang Gu helping him, but he knew something was happening in this school, and those things were likely related to Chang Gu and his siblings.  "Let's go; next, we're heading to the experimental building."  Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu: "You should have made your decision by now, right?" Chapter 823: The Red Clothes Society  Memory is a difficult thing to describe. It's like snow that will never melt, and like a fleeting light, what you want to grasp cannot be grasped, and what you hope to forget cannot be forgotten. Zhou Tu had been troubled by that dream for a long time. He knew he was different, but he didn't dare to be sure, and he eventually fell into deep self-doubt.  It wasn't until this day that he met Chen Ge. This man was the first to affirm Zhou Tu. The dreams he had were all real. The experiences he had were not fictitious, but rather indelible memories etched deep in his mind.  Zhou Tu got the answer he wanted, but at the same time, he also fell into a dangerous vortex. He didn't know if following Chen Ge would lead to his destruction or his salvation.  "Have you thought it through?" Chen Ge stood in front of Zhou Tu and repeated.  "I..."  "If you really can't make up your mind, you can look at him."  Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng suddenly came over. They stood on either side of Zhou Tu, sandwiching him in the middle: "Zhu Long, come over here."  The last to arrive, Zhu Long, was not in the right state. His gaze was very strange, as if burning with flames, and he was on the verge of collapsing into madness.  "What did you do to him?" Chen Ge looked at Zhu Long's left hand, which was holding a mobile phone, and the veins on that hand were bulging.  "We found a piece of incomplete news report in the archives. A courier who often loitered around the university disappeared at the school. After several days of investigation by the police, a body that was no longer in human form was found in the dissection room's storage area." Zhang Ju handed a few severely damaged newspapers to Chen Ge: "That unrecognizable body is him—Zhu Long."  The fabricated memories were shattered, and Zhu Long remembered a lot of things when he saw the newspaper.  Studying hard and finally getting into university was just his dream. The reality was too harsh to bear.  The girl he liked was both talented and diligent, admitted to the best medical university, while his grades were a mess, and he couldn't even afford the tuition for repeating a year.  His family was impoverished, the only relative he had was seriously ill, with their health deteriorating.  Fate struck him hard, but it did not bring down this young man. He began learning to take care of others, to support his family on his own.  When looking for a job, others thought he looked listless, so he tidied up his messy long hair. Others thought his tattoos would scare off customers, so he scraped off a layer of skin with a small knife. He was not defeated, and eventually found a job that belonged to him—a courier.  He was diligent, friendly, stubborn in his eyes, and always smiling. He lived with all his might, earning respect and material security through his own efforts.  After getting through the most difficult summer, he got used to the job. He worked late every day, and his only pleasure was to pick up some orders to send to Hanjiang Medical College.  Every time he entered the campus, he had a hint of hope in his heart. He knew that girl was in this school. Even if it was just a secret glance from afar, it would make him very satisfied and happy for the whole day.  The school was neither too big nor too small; it was uncertain when they would meet.  In his mind, he had imagined countless scenarios of meeting her, but when the girl really appeared, he realized that all his preparation and rehearsals were of no use. He was so nervous that he couldn't speak, like a child whose secret had been discovered.  After that day, they exchanged contact information. The girl was unexpectedly proactive, liking the feeling of control, while Zhu Long mistook it for admiration.  His compliance led to spiritual torment. The girl liked to torture Zhu Long, constantly reminding him—you are nothing.  The self-respect he worked so hard for was slowly crushed, and Zhu Long became the girl's puppet. What was worse, Zhu Long was completely unaware of it.  This simple-minded fool was no match for the girl who was a master of anatomy and criminal psychology.  He was like a lamb stripped of its wool, bare on the woman's plate, to be slaughtered at will.  In the end, the harm extended from the spiritual level to the physical level, and it wasn't until death approached that Zhu Long realized, but by then it was too late.  Blood flowed from wound after wound. Zhu Long held a pink mobile phone, his eyes fixed on the newspaper in Chen Ge's hand.  The floodgates of his memory were finally burst open under repeated stimulation.  "Do you know which part of the human body is pink?" Blood threads, like stitches, sewed up the skin. Zhu Long took one step at a time towards Chen Ge: "The flesh that is about to heal is the most tender and pink. She likes pink."  Zhu Long's body began to misalign. His body had many marks of needle and thread sewing, it was hard to imagine what he had gone through after death.  "Another half-red robe."  Chen Ge's gaze was unusually calm. When Zhu Long was only two steps away from him, he raised his hands and gently embraced Zhu Long: "I want you to understand something. No matter when, no matter for what reason, anything that harms you should not be allowed, even if it is named love."  Looking at the boy close at hand, Chen Ge felt a bit of heartache. He patted Zhu Long's shoulder: "I don't know what you're thinking right now, but I can assure you, if we can leave this school, I will let you see that girl again."  The blood threads moving through Zhu Long's flesh suddenly paused. Zhu Long looked directly at Chen Ge, then slowly lowered his head: "It's a promise."  Clutching the pink mobile phone, Zhu Long silently retreated behind Chen Ge.  Zhu Long and Zhang Ju's outer clothes were still becoming redder. Even if they were not red robes, they were top-tier half-red robes. Adding Wang Yicheng to the mix, Chen Ge wasn't too afraid to face an ordinary red robe at this moment.  "We can go to the laboratory building now." Chen Ge no longer asked Zhou Tu. He had already gotten the answer from the other's eyes.  After seeing Zhu Long's state, the boy dug his nails into his flesh. He must also have unfulfilled wishes, only that he had forgotten what those wishes were.  Passing through the shrubs, Chen Ge led the club members to the laboratory building, his second visit of the night.  "That red robe should still be in the duty room. If we encounter him, we can return his clothes to him." Chen Ge spoke with much more confidence. He led the students to stop outside the building.  "This building is the nest of those upside-down body monsters. The art club we want to visit is on the fourth floor. After we check that room, regardless of whether Zhou Tu's memory has awakened, we must immediately evacuate."  Chen Ge took the lead to a window of a room on the first floor: "Now, follow me up."  The students looked at each other, then saw Chen Ge easily climb up to the second floor.  "I told you he must be a PE teacher."  Zhang Ju, Zhu Long, and Wang Yicheng had all awakened their memories. Climbing a building was nothing for a ghost, only Zhou Tu looked troubled. 
Chapter 834: Return to the Holy Land (Part Two)  "Vermilion Bird."  Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan was watching Bai Xiaochen and Xiaolong play and frolic. Suddenly, she heard a commotion outside and her eyebrows knitted in slight annoyance: "What's happening outside? Why is there a commotion? You go take a look."  "Yes." Vermilion Bird bowed her fists in acknowledgement, accepted the command, and stepped back. After a while, she pushed open the door of the bamboo house and walked in, hesitating as she spoke: "Queen, there are two people outside, they are here to see you..."  "Looking for me?" Bai Yan raised her eyebrows, "Then I'll go out and take a look, to see who has come to find me."  With that said, she slowly rose from her chair and headed towards the door.  Outside the house, under the blood-red sky, two people were tremblingly crawling over from the front. Perhaps because they had crawled so far, a trail of blood had formed under them, which was particularly glaring in Bai Yan's eyes.  "What are you doing?" Bai Yan frowned and asked in a cold voice.  The second elder's face was pale, and his trembling body was prostrated on the ground, stammering: "Queen, I have come to plead guilty to you. That day, I was too trusting of that imposter, which led the Queen to misunderstand the King. It was all my fault, I am willing to take any punishment or scolding, please punish me."  "No, Queen, it's my fault. I failed to convey the King's orders to you. In fact, that day the King left the palace to lift the seal on the demon realm, and he asked me to come back and inform the Queen. I failed to do so, which gave the villain an opportunity."  Huoyu knelt on the ground, his face covered in tears: "It's all my fault. If the Queen wishes to hit or scold me, I will not utter a word of complaint."  He took the bamboo strip from behind him into his hands, held it with both palms, and presented it in front of Bai Yan, deeply bowing his head, his face resigned to his fate.  Bai Yan's hand slowly grasped the bamboo strip that Huoyu had dragged in front of her. Her expression was indifferent, and her eyes shone with an inscrutable light.  Feeling the bamboo strip leaving his hands, Huoyu's body stiffened. He clenched his teeth tightly, waiting for that powerful strike.  But...  For a long time, there was no pain.  Huoyu looked up in astonishment, only to see the bamboo strip in Bai Yan's hand burst into flames and quickly turned to ash.  "You two have suffered a lot on your way here?"  "Queen... Queen?" Huoyu looked at Bai Yan, puzzled by the meaning of her words.  "If that's the case, then you have already repaid your sins. Get up."  Bai Yan has always been a person of clear principles.  She only targets those who fantasize about harming her.  That day, even she was deceived, so how could she blame the Great Elder and Huoyu? Therefore, she has never resented them...  Huoyu's body was as stiff as iron, unable to believe that Bai Yan would let them off so easily. Before coming here, they had prepared themselves for severe injuries! Now, she hadn't even whipped them once, and had already absolved them of their sins.  Seeing the two still dumbly kneeling on the ground and not moving, Bai Yan's face sank slightly: "What? Are you waiting for me to help you up?"  The woman's sharp voice entered Huoyu's ears, startling him into immediately climbing up from the ground. His trousers were covered in blood, and he could barely stand steady.  Even so, he still stood on the ground, his legs continuously trembling, and he did not kneel down again.  Bai Yan glanced at the two who could hardly support themselves and pointed to the stone seats on the ground: "Sit down and rest for a while, then you can leave the mountain." Chapter 835: Return to the Holy Land (Part Three)  Huoyu was moved to tears, he touched the corner of his eyes where tears had emerged, his pale face was full of gratitude. "Your Highness, the great kindness you have shown to Huoyu, I will never forget it in this lifetime." If the Queen had not forgiven him, the King would not have possibly kept him in the Demon Realm. So, it was her magnanimity that had helped him.  "It is not your fault to begin with, I myself was deceived, how could I blame you?" Bai Yan gave a bitter smile, "Moreover, I know your sincerity towards the Demon Realm, as long as you remain loyal to Emperor Cang, that is enough."  The Second Elder slowly walked to the stone seat and sat down, his gaze full of remorse: "The Queen is not willing to blame us, that is her magnanimity, but I will not forgive my own actions. From now on, I will dedicate all my loyalty to the King and Queen."  Bai Yan sighed softly, "Here are two healing pills for your injuries, your wounds will heal after taking them. Suzaku does not like to be disturbed, you should leave the mountain early."  After giving them the pills, she turned and walked into the bamboo house. Suzaku did not enter the house with her; after seeing the Second Elder taking the pills, she lifted her leg and kicked him fiercely.  The kick flipped the Second Elder to the ground, fortunately, he had already taken the medicine, so he did not suffer much harm.  "Suzaku my lord."  The Second Elder was at a loss, looking pitifully at Suzaku with a hopeful expression.  "Why didn't you come to ask me when that incident happened?" Suzaku gritted her teeth and reprimanded angrily.  The Second Elder shuddered and timidly replied, "It was the King... Oh, no, it was that imposter who did not allow me to tell anyone, including the First Elder and Suzaku my lord, he was afraid the Queen would hear about it."  "Idiot!" Suzaku glared at the Second Elder with rage, "If it wasn't for the Queen who has already forgiven you, I would not want to go against the Queen's wishes, just now, it would not have been just that simple kick! Now that your injuries have mostly healed, get out of here!"  Upon hearing this, the two of them ran swiftly towards the base of the Holy Mountain, disappearing without a trace in an instant.  After they disappeared, Suzaku finally pushed the door and entered, she looked towards Bai Yan, who was smiling, her fiery red eyes showed a touch of grievance: "Your Highness, I just couldn't stand his foolish behavior, you... are you not blaming me?"  Bai Yan shook her head helplessly with a light laugh, "You were just angry, now that you've let out your anger, do you feel better?"  Suzaku immediately nodded, and her gaze became cautious, "Your Highness, since you've returned to the Demon Realm this time, will you... not leave again?"  Upon hearing this, Bai Yan paused and her lips curved into a smile: "Unfortunately, I need to leave the Demon Realm for a while, but I will come back soon."  Suzaku, who was originally disappointed, suddenly beamed with joy upon hearing Bai Yan's words. Her eyebrows and eyes were very beautiful, and her clothing formed from flames was dazzlingly gorgeous.  "Your Highness, I can't leave the Holy Mountain right now, but after you find Xuanwu, remember to bring them all back to me, then, I will be able to leave this place..."  Just like a thousand years ago, to accompany you on the battlefield!  It seemed that recalling the scenes of the past, Suzaku's eyes showed a hint of yearning, as if through the blood-red sky, she saw the glory and passion of those days... Chapter 836: Return to the Holy Land (Part Four) She believed that one day, she would be able to reunite with her brothers, and... the former queen would make a strong return!  "Chen'er, Xiao Long'er, let's go." Bai Yan smiled gently, leading Bai Xiao Chen with one hand and holding Xiao Long'er's little hand with the other, her eyes brimming with laughter.  "Mother, where are we going?" Bai Xiao Chen blinked his bright, innocent eyes curiously, tilting his little head to look at Bai Yan.  "We're going to find your father..." Bai Yan paused for a moment, "Now that the crisis in the Demon Realm has been resolved, I want to make a trip back to the Holy Land."  "Back to the Holy Land?" Bai Xiao Chen's eyes twinkled, "Does that mean we can see Godfather? Chen'er really misses Godfather and Sister Chu."  Bai Yan tapped Bai Xiao Chen's forehead with her finger, her tone filled with indulgence, "How many times have I told you, she is your godfather's sister, if you call her 'sister', wouldn't that make her younger than us by a generation?"  Bai Xiao Chen touched his head with his little hand, his little face looking pitiful, "But... Sister Chu doesn't let Chen'er call her 'auntie', otherwise, she won't take Chen'er to set fires..."  After saying this, Bai Xiao Chen suddenly realized what he had said, his eyes filled with panic as he explained, "Mother, you heard wrong just now, Chen'er didn't want to set fires... Chen'er was just..."  "No need to explain!" Bai Yan scoffed, "I always thought it was Chu Yi Yi who led you astray, but it turns out you have a natural love for setting fires! Very well, I will tell this to your grandmaster. The day his treasure pavilion was burned, you were also partly responsible!"  "Mother..." Bai Xiao Chen called out pitifully, pulling at Bai Yan's sleeve, "Chen'er knows his mistake, can you not tell grandmaster?"  "Hmm..." Bai Yan stroked her chin, "It depends on my mood."  With that said, she led the two adorable children by the hand, laughing lightly as she walked out of the bamboo house.  Although the seals had been lifted, the sky of the Demon Realm still displayed a blood-red hue, as if submerged in a sea of blood, with the color of blood enveloping the entire world...  ...  Inside the main hall, Emperor Cang held his head in his palm, looking down at the person reporting below with a domineering aura that enveloped the entire hall, causing the reporter to sweat profusely and tremble lightly.  Suddenly, a figure in red entered Emperor Cang's vision, and his domineering and cold eyes softened, his robe fluttering as he quickly reached the woman's side and pulled her into his embrace.  "Why are you here? Didn't I tell you to rest well on the Holy Mountain?"  His voice was unprecedentedly gentle, as if the entire world was less important than the woman in his arms.  "I came because there is something I need to tell you, I need to return to the Holy Land for a bit."  "Alright, I will accompany you back later."  Emperor Cang frowned and pondered for a while before finally relaxing, his lips curving into a shallow smile.  "No need." Bai Yan shook her head, "I'll go and come back quickly, you probably still have a lot of things to deal with, you don't need to go out of your way to accompany me back."  At that moment, Bai Yan recalled the words the Saint Lord had previously told her. Now... the difference in strength between her and Emperor Cang was too great, and she must quickly improve her strength in order to fight side by side with him.  And for her, the only way to improve her strength was to return to the Holy Land!  "Are you afraid that I will fight with Chu Yifeng?" Emperor Cang's voice was sour.  Chu Yifeng also held an extraordinary position in Bai Yan's heart. He was the one who appeared by her side the most when she needed help the most, and just that was enough to make him jealous. Chapter 837: Let Her Be the Referee (Part 1)  As soon as Emperor Cang finished speaking, the woman in front of him had already tiptoed up and brought her red lips to his, her arms hooking around his neck. Her kiss was lingering and tender, as if filled with endless affection. After a while, Bai Yan released her arms and gently stroked his head with her slender hand: "Be good, wait for me here, I will be back soon..."  Her tone was like comforting a small animal, yet this feeling irritatingly made his heart go soft. Therefore, he couldn't bear to refuse any longer and softly replied, "Okay, after I deal with the matters of the Demon Realm, I will come to find you."  Bai Yan nodded slightly: "Chen'er, Xiao Long'er, let's return to the Holy Land."  "Daddy," Bai Xiao Chen looked at Bai Yan, then turned his gaze to Emperor Cang. His big eyes were twinkling and bright as stars, "Don't forget what you promised Chen'er. After Chen'er goes back to visit godfather and grandmaster, I will return to the Demon Realm. Then, you must let Chen'er go to that secret realm to cultivate."  Emperor Cang couldn't help but chuckle: "When have I ever broken a promise? When you come back, I will personally take you to the secret realm to cultivate."  "Okay." Bai Xiao Chen smiled cutely, his innocent smile making the sunshine seem even more romantic. "Chen'er will work hard to improve his strength, to be the wings for mother, to shelter her from wind and rain."  His little face was full of determination, and his big eyes were filled with resolve. As long as he could protect his mother, he was not afraid of any dangers in the secret realm!  Bai Yan was about to say something to stop Bai Xiao Chen, but seeing the little guy's excited face, she somehow couldn't bring herself to say it.  Emperor Cang might have sensed Bai Yan's worries, he raised his hand to wrap around her shoulders: "You don't need to worry, I won't let Chen'er be in danger, and besides, he is the crown prince of the Demon Realm, his duty is to protect his mother and sister! It is inevitable."  Bai Yan glared at Emperor Cang: "Where is his sister?"  Emperor Cang smiled faintly, his lips nearing Bai Yan's ear, his voice suggestive: "If you want, we can always have one..."  The most beautiful love words in the world are when I mention our children, and you say, if you want, we can always have them. In that instant, Bai Yan's ears grew a bit hot, she coughed lightly, turned her head away, refusing to look directly into Emperor Cang's desire-filled phoenix eyes.  "It's getting late, I should go." She suddenly remembered something, looked up at Emperor Cang: "Also, I have already forgiven the Second Elder and Huo Yu, you don't have to trouble them anymore."  Emperor Cang's brows furrowed slightly, to be honest, if it wasn't for those two fools, Yan'er would not have run away from home. But... since Yan'er has decided to forgive these two people, then he respects her decision!  "Naughty daddy, goodbye." Bai Xiao Chen waved goodbye to Emperor Cang, following Bai Yan out the door.  "Wait." Suddenly, a voice came from behind, Bai Yan paused, turning her head to look at the silver-haired man who was catching up, and asked, "Emperor Cang, is there anything else?"  "I'll walk you out." Emperor Cang's commanding brows and eyes carried a smile as he walked to Bai Yan's side, firmly holding her hand.  "Okay." This time, Bai Yan did not refuse Emperor Cang, she smiled lightly: "I'm not going to be gone forever, why are you so nervous?"  "The king just wants to cherish every moment I spend with you." She didn't want him to follow her, he respected her choice, but... he just wanted to spend a little more time by her side. Chapter 838: Let Her Be the Judge (Part 2)  Bai Xiaochen walked silently behind the two, pouting discontentedly, her delicate face filled with dejection.  "Why do I feel that ever since mother accepted that bad dad, I've become superfluous?"   Xiaolong'er blinked her big eyes, curiously turning to look at the delicate little figure beside her, "Why?"  "Because usually, mother would hug me, but ever since there was bad dad, if mother hugs me, dad would throw me out..." Bai Xiaochen pursed her small lips, "So, I feel like I'm not bad dad's biological child..."  Mother is dad's true love, while he...  Could it be that he was picked up?  ...  The sanctuary was shrouded in mist, like a fairyland.  The sanctuary was now noisy. Bai Yan had just reached the outskirts of the sanctuary when she saw the crowd surrounding the gates. Her eyes flashed with confusion, and she mumbled to herself in a daze.  "What happened to the sanctuary?"  She had only been away for a short while, so why were there so many people at the sanctuary?  "Miss, aren't you here for the sanctuary's disciple selection? How do you not know what has happened?" A young man, seeing Bai Yan's dazed expression, kindly explained.  "The sanctuary is selecting disciples again?"  Bai Yan's stunning face showed a hint of astonishment. The sanctuary had just sent people out to select disciples, why are they starting again?  Could it be... that something really happened to the sanctuary?  "Mother," Bai Xiaochen yawned, "Xiaochen wants to see godfather and master, shall we go in first?"  "Okay."  Bai Yan, holding Bai Xiaochen with one hand and Xiaolong'er with the other, walked lightly towards the gate of the sanctuary.  However, there were too many people ahead, so she needed to pass through the crowd to reach the sanctuary.  "Make way!"  Suddenly, a hand reached out from the side, intending to push towards Bai Yan.  Bai Yan's gaze narrowed, and she pulled Bai Xiaochen to one side, avoiding the hand.  The owner of the hand, upon seeing this, did not forget to look back and glare at Bai Yan, and scolded coldly: "Didn't you see the young miss of the Fireflame Sect arriving? All of you unrelated people, quickly clear off!"  The Fireflame Sect was a second-tier sect, only second to the Beast Tamer Sect. On this continent, it also held a significant position.  Hence, upon hearing that the young miss of the Fireflame Sect had arrived, the people who were originally crowded in front quickly dispersed, opening up a path.  Under everyone's gaze, a woman in a bright red dress came from behind. A silver snake was coiled around her wrist, and her lips curled into a charming smile as she walked slowly forward.  "The young miss of the Fireflame Sect, Huo Yun, is said to be a beast tamer. Did you see the silver snake on her hand? She tamed it herself."  "Wow, with her talent, even the Beast Tamer Sect would surely take her in as a disciple. It's just a shame Huo Yun is the precious daughter of the Fireflame Sect, she wouldn't become a disciple at the Beast Tamer Sect."  The crowd sighed, with the young miss of the Fireflame Sect attending the sanctuary's recruitment, they probably didn't stand much of a chance.  "Mother, that aunty is so ugly, yet she dares to wear red. Only mother can really pull off such a beautiful color."  In the midst of the silent crowd, a childish voice suddenly rang out, instantly attracting everyone's attention. Chapter 839: Let Her Be the Referee (Part Three)  Bai Xiaochen's chubby little face was full of displeasure, and his eyes were firmly fixed on the silver snake on Huoyun's wrist. At such a young age, his fox-like eyes already displayed a domineering presence. No wonder he had no fondness for Huoyun; first, the guards of the Fire Flame Gate were too arrogant, and moreover, this Huoyun was actually in cahoots with the Snake Tribe!  Because of the relationship between Qingluan and the Qingxue sisters, Bai Xiaochen had no good feelings for anyone from the Snake Tribe! If it weren't for the damned Snake Tribe, his mother wouldn't have suffered so much...  The silver snake felt the pressure Bai Xiaochen was putting on it, its body shrank back, and it dared not stick out its tongue anymore, fear showing in its small eyes.  "How dare you!" The guard of the Fire Flame Gate was suddenly furious; on this continent, there weren't many who dared to be so brazen with his young lady!  However, just as the guard of the Fire Flame Gate was about to lose his temper, Huoyun frowned and stopped him.  "This is a sacred place! Without my orders, no one is allowed to cause trouble!"  Huoyun was not confused; even if she was arrogant outside, she would not dare to cause trouble at the entrance of the sacred place.  As for the child's mother...  She must also be here to attend the enrollment conference. At that time, she would look for her in the venue to settle the account!  "Let's go, my cousin should be here to pick us up."  Huoyun slowly turned her head, at this moment, she did not notice that Bai Yan had already retracted the murderous aura from her body. If it weren't for her stopping the guard, that guard might have already been splattered with blood on the spot...  "Mother." Bai Xiaochen blinked his eyes and turned his head to look at Bai Yan, "Can Chen'er go trouble her?"  Bai Yan's lips lightly lifted, "If others do not offend me, I do not offend others; if others offend you, there's no need to be polite!"  The implication was that if these people offended Bai Xiaochen, however he wanted to handle it, she would not interfere!  At this moment, Huoyun had already walked to the doorway, and soon everyone saw a man coming out to meet her, joyfully walking towards Huoyun.  "Cousin, you're finally here."  Huoyun changed her previous arrogance and shyly lowered her eyes, "Cousin, my father should have told you, I'm here to participate in this disciple selection conference, I hope Cousin Yahan can help me out."  "Haha," Lin Yahan laughed heartily twice, "Don't worry, with my cousin's status, you will surely be able to enter the sacred place successfully. Then, we will be fellow disciples."  Everyone saw Huoyun enter the sacred place with Lin Yahan, their eyes filled with envy.  "So, this Lady Huoyun's cousin is in the sacred place."  "And I also heard that Lin Yahan's master will be one of the referees for this disciple selection."  "That lady's son just offended her, I'm afraid they won't be able to pass this disciple selection smoothly..."  Bai Yan did not speak, silently listening to these people's conversations, but her brows couldn't help but knit together.  Previously, due to cheating incidents, she had asked her master to clean up the sacred place. She didn't expect... that cheating would still occur?  "Chen'er, it seems we have come back at just the right time."  Bai Yan lightly hooked the corner of her lips.  No matter what, she had to inform her master about what happened here, to have him pay more attention to the competition.  She didn't want to see the occurrence of such favoritism and cheating in the sacred place like before!  After saying this, Bai Yan held Bai Xiaochen's and Xiao Long'er's hands and walked through the crowd to the entrance of the sacred place. Chapter 840: Let Her Be the Judge (Part 4)  Before she returned, she had sent a message to her master, so the master had already instructed the gatekeepers and given them her portrait. When the two gatekeepers saw Bai Yan coming, they didn't check her invitation and directly allowed her to enter the holy land.  "This... How come this lady doesn't have an invitation?" "Could it be that she has a backer in the holy land?" "I think it must be so, otherwise, where would she get the courage to confront Lady Huoyun?"  The voices of the crowd discussing did not reach Huoyun, who had walked far away. After moving away from the crowd, Huoyun stopped and bit her lip, saying, "Cousin, did you see the woman with two children just now?"  Lin Yahan was surprised for a moment and asked, "What about her?"  "That woman's son offended me with his cheeky mouth. When it comes to the selection of disciples' competition, I hope... she can be directly eliminated!" Huoyun gritted her teeth, a cold flash in her eyes.  This small matter, for a cousin with an elder as a master, wasn't very difficult...  "Cousin, you can relax. I won't give the chance to advance to someone who has offended you," said Lin Yahan with a smile.  He thought it was a serious matter, but such a small thing was easy for him.  ...  Bai Yan, who had just entered the holy gate, hadn't heard the conversation between Huoyun and Lin Yahan, and the direction she went was different from theirs, heading straight to the holy island. Since she left the holy land, she had entrusted the holy island entirely to several masters to manage, so at this time, the masters must be waiting for her on the holy island...  From a distance, Bai Yan saw three old men drinking tea and chatting. Her expression warmed, and a smile formed on her lips. After coming to this continent, these three masters had given her a lot of warmth and extended a helping hand to her when she was in the most difficult times...  "Disciple?" Ren Yi was the first to see Bai Yan, his eyes lit up, and he immediately stood up, "You're back?"  His words made the grandmaster Zheng Qi and the third master Qiu Shurong come back to their senses, looking at her, a large figure with two small ones approaching them with surprise and delight.  "Right, is this young lady the one you were looking for before?" Qiu Shurong pursed his lips, "However, why didn't you tell us when you left the illusionary mansion? We were still waiting for you... If it weren't for your grandfather telling us, we wouldn't have known you left."  Bai Yan smiled lightly: "Three masters, how are your alchemy skills coming along? Did you remember what I taught you last time?"  "Cough cough!" Zheng Qi coughed twice, feeling guilty as he glanced at Qiu Shurong, then outright sold him out, "We have already succeeded in concocting, only your third master... still can't do it."  "Not bad, your third master is too stupid, he can't even handle such a simple matter, disciple, you should teach him a harsh lesson!"   Qiu Shurong's face turned red with anger, glaring at the two old friends: "You two old things, will you die if you don't sell me out?"  Seeing the third master getting angry and about to fight with the other two old men, Bai Yan said with a smile: "Alright, I'm not here this time to check on your alchemy skills. I have something I want to discuss with you."  "What's the matter?"  For a moment, all three old men turned their attention to Bai Yan.  "The holy realm that the Holy Master mentioned to me before... I want to visit."  The holy realm, it is said that those who enter it have a slim chance of survival! But if one comes out from the holy realm, not only will their level greatly increase, but even their state of mind will undergo a qualitative improvement.  This time, for Emperor Cang and for the demon realm, she was willing to take the risk! Chapter 841: Let Her Be the Judge (Part Five)  "Are you going to the Holy Realm?" Zheng Qi looked at Bai Yan in surprise. After pondering for a while, he said, "I need to discuss this matter with the Holy Master. After all, if something happens to you, not only will the three of us old fellows not be able to live on, but the Holy Land will also suffer a great loss."  "Okay," Bai Yan nodded slightly. "I haven't seen him for a long time. I'll go with you to see him. Besides, there is one more thing I want to know."  Bai Yan paused, then asked, "Why does the Holy Land want to recruit disciples?"  "That's because..." Qiu Shurong sighed helplessly, "Recently, the continent has been somewhat unstable. The three great forces all feel a crisis coming and plan to select individuals with strong talents from the populace to send into the Minor Holy Realm for cultivation."  The Holy Realm is divided into two parts. One is the Minor Holy Realm, which Bai Yan had visited once before. The other is the true Holy Realm, commonly known as the 'Mirror of Nine Deaths and One Life.'  Whether it is the Minor Holy Realm or the true Holy Realm, one can only enter once in their lifetime. Unless absolutely necessary, the Holy Land would not continue to recruit disciples.  "Since the intention is to send him to cultivate in the Minor Holy Realm, then this competition must be fair. There can be no more favoritism or fraud!" Bai Yan said seriously, stroking her chin.  "Speaking of which, I really have to tell you that it's good you came back this time. The Holy Master just said to let you be the judge of this competition."  "Me?" Bai Yan narrowed her eyes. "I don't have time. I need to enter the Holy Realm to cultivate."  "My disciple, it will also take time to open the Holy Realm. You can serve as the judge in the remaining time. Moreover, you will be the only judge for this competition!"  Bai Yan glanced at the few old men: "Why don't you serve as the judge?"  Serve as the judge? That's an annoying affair. They'd be crazy to take on such a thing.  "My disciple, we still have some areas in alchemy that are not yet proficient and need to be reflected upon thoroughly, so we don't have the time."  Ren Yi secretly twitched his mouth corner, his eyes shifted, and he had already thought of an excuse.  "What about Chu Yifeng?"  "Having the young master serve as the judge, do you think those girls would still have the mind to compete? They would probably wish they could devour the young master."  "What about Chu Yiyi? If Chu Yifeng isn't suitable, surely this girl can't be unsuitable?"  "Her? Of course not! With her crazy temperament, she would turn the entire competition into chaos. Maybe if she's in a bad mood, she'd set the arena on fire."  In short, these few old men had one thing to say: this time, Bai Yan must serve as the judge!  Bai Yan held her forehead, suddenly feeling that she had chosen the wrong time to return...  "Can I refuse?" Her tone weakened a bit as she asked.  "No! You cannot refuse. It's decided. You must be the judge for this competition, with the little princess as your assistant! In this Holy Land, probably only you can manage her."  Ren Yi had an expression that said the matter was settled, not allowing Bai Yan to continue to refuse.  "Mother," Bai Xiaochen tugged at Bai Yan's sleeve, his big eyes shining, "Chen'er also wants to be an assistant."  Xiao Long'er looked at Bai Yan and then at Bai Xiaochen, her eyes filled with hopeful light.  She also wanted to help the queen...  "Let's talk about this matter later. I'm going to see the Holy Master and Chu Yiyi first. By the way, is Chu Yifeng in the Holy Land?"  Bai Yan pondered for a while before asking.  The faces of the few old men all stiffened, and they sighed lightly. Chapter 842: Let Her Be the Judge (Part 6)  The young master has always been deeply infatuated with Bai Yan, but Bai Yan has already chosen Emperor Cang. Therefore, not long ago, he had already left the holy land to heal his wounds...  Seeing the expressions of the three elders, Bai Yan already knew the answer. She felt somewhat guilty in her heart. She owed Chu Yifeng too much, too much that she could never repay in her lifetime!  "Let's go," Zheng Qi patted Bai Yan on the shoulder, smiling bitterly, "Although we have always been eagerly hoping that you would accept the young master, we also understand that matters of the heart cannot be forced. The young master has been with you for many years, and you have never accepted him. Emperor Cang appeared for just a short time, and you have already entrusted your heart to him. This proves that the young master is not the one destined for you. No matter what decision you make, we will support you."  "Master..." A warm current flowed through Bai Yan's heart, and a smile appeared on her lips, "You will always be my master, lifetime after lifetime."  "Hahaha!" Zheng Qi laughed heartily, "With your words, what regrets do I have in my old age? Come on, the holy master hasn't seen you for a long time. He was still mentioning earlier that you should come back. I'll take you to see him first!"  ...  Inside the room.  The table was a mess, with Chu Yiyi gnawing on a chicken leg, her mouth greasy, while the man beside her was holding a jar of wine, his handsome face flushed with drunkenness.  "Dad, did you get Bai Yan to come back?" Chu Yiyi casually threw the chicken bone on the ground, her eyes eagerly looking at the wine jar in Chu Ran's hands.  Without any courtesy, Chu Ran slapped Chu Yiyi on the forehead.  "This is a fine wine that Zheng Qi went to great lengths to get. I've already given you a sip; stop thinking about it," Chu Ran glared at her, "As for that girl Bai Yan... Zheng Qi told me that she would be back these days."  "Oh." Chu Yiyi's eyes lit up, and a smile appeared on her cute face, "That's great, I have to write a letter to my brother and ask him to come back too."  Although Bai Yan has already accepted Emperor Cang, Chu Yiyi understood her brother well; he would be satisfied just by looking at her.  As her sister, she had to fulfill her brother's wish.  Just as Chu Ran was about to speak, an elder rushed in from outside, bowed with his fists and said, "Holy Master, Young Princess, Zheng Qi has arrived, and... Miss Bai Yan is also here."  This elder, being close to the holy master, naturally knew of Bai Yan's existence. However, since Bai Changfeng's birthday celebration, everyone knew that Zheng Qi and the other two elders had taken in a disciple, but although they knew, they had never seen Bai Yan. Even if Bai Yan stood in front of them, they wouldn't recognize her as the owner of the holy island, the disciple of the three elders.  "What? She's back? So soon?" Chu Ran stood up in a panic, he looked at the messy table, quickly waved his hand, and put all the dishes and wine into his storage bag, then immediately put on a clean robe.  He also didn't forget to take a pill to remove the smell of alcohol from his breath.  Chu Yiyi watched, dumbfounded, with her face still dirty, the food in her mouth not yet swallowed, and her dress grimy.  "She has a cleanliness issue!" Seeing Chu Yiyi's dazed look, Chu Ran quietly reminded her, implying that she should hurry up and change her clothes.  But it was too late...  Just as Chu Yiyi stood up from the table, Zheng Qi had already led Bai Yan inside at a leisurely pace.  At first glance, what caught Bai Yan's eyes was the dirty little face of Chu Yiyi.  Immediately, her brows furrowed.  "Yiyi, your room is a mess, and now you come to defile the holy master's room?" Bai Yan glanced at Chu Yiyi, and after smelling the alcohol on her breath, she asked with a stern face, "Have you been drinking? Have you forgotten about the time when you got drunk and almost set fire to my holy island?"  "It's not like that, it was dad..." Chu Yiyi was on the verge of tears.  But before she could finish, Chu Ran at the side quickly coughed twice, interrupting what she was about to blurt out. Chapter 843: The Father Who Tricks His Daughter  "Yiyi, I have warned you before that as a girl, you should be dignified. Not only do you eat meat with big bites, but you also drink heavily! What kind of behavior is this?" Chu Ran spoke righteously and sternly, his face serious as he scolded.  Chu Yiyi was dumbfounded and weakly said, "I just drank a..."  "What? You actually drank a whole pot?" Chu Ran pointed at Chu Yiyi angrily, his voice harsh, "You drank a whole pot of alcohol and you still dare to speak up? You have been so presumptuous while I was not paying attention! Especially coming to my room to drink, filling it with the smell of alcohol! How can I sleep tonight?"  Chu Yiyi's eyes widened, she couldn't believe what she was seeing as she looked at the stern-faced Chu Ran, suddenly feeling an urge to cry. She had only taken one sip, why was her father framing her?  "Baiyan, what business do you have looking for me?"  Chu Ran's gaze shifted to Baiyan, his previously stern expression softened somewhat. That girl, ever since he had planned to arrange a marriage for his son, had been avoiding him. She must have something important to discuss if she came to find him; she wouldn't come without a significant reason.  "Lord, you once said that with my achievements in the minor holy realm, I would be able to enter the true holy realm. I was in a hurry to leave the holy land at the time, so I didn't choose to step into the holy realm. May I know if I can still go now?" Baiyan's brow was slightly furrowed.  In fact, she had spent two of the four years in the holy land within the minor holy realm, and her performance there had surpassed the limits, earning her the qualification to go to the true holy realm. However, she had been unable to let go of her concerns for Bai Xiao, which was why she left the holy land to go to the Bai family...  Now, if she still had the opportunity, she would definitely go to the holy realm to improve her strength.  Chu Ran was surprised for a moment, frowning, "You want to enter the holy realm?"  "That's right." Baiyan's tone was firm and unchanging.  Chu Ran sighed softly, "Bai girl, I did say that you could go to the true holy realm, but you have experienced the dangers of the minor holy realm. In the true holy realm, the dangers you will face are hundreds of times greater!"  "However, precisely because the holy realm is dangerous, it is the best way for you to improve your strength," Chu Ran looked up at Baiyan, speaking earnestly, "Moreover, time within the holy realm passes extremely slowly, which means, if you spend one year in the holy realm, only one month passes on the outside!"  Baiyan was silent for a moment, continuing to listen to Chu Ran's explanation.  "I want to know if you really want to go to the holy realm, are you not afraid of the dangers?" Chu Ran relaxed his frown, speaking to Baiyan with a very gentle tone and demeanor.  "Confirmed!" Baiyan's eyes shone with unwavering determination.  "Good, I respect your choice, but opening the holy realm takes a lot of time, I have to make preparations," Chu Ran chuckled softly, walked up to Baiyan, and gently patted her shoulder, his tone one of regret, "It's a pity, I always saw you as my daughter-in-law, and now, you have married someone else... However, if you cannot be my daughter-in-law, you are still my daughter!"  "Lord..." Baiyan looked up, gazing at the man standing in front of her.  Chu Ran laughed lightly, "There's no need for sentimental words. If my daughter could give me as much peace of mind as you do, I would be completely satisfied."  Chu Yiyi felt like crying without tears. Was she really that disdained? Indeed, the children of others are always better, while she is merely an existence to be belittled... Chapter 844: Framing (Part 1)  "Cough cough!" Zheng Qi coughed dryly twice and smiled indifferently, "Your Holiness, I have another matter I would like to report to you."  "What is it?"  "For this competition, I would like to recommend Yan'er to serve as the referee. What do you think of this proposal, Your Holiness?"  Zheng Qi's words made Chu Ran ponder for a moment. He turned his head to look at Bai Yan and asked, "Little Bai, what do you think of your master's suggestion? Can you accept it?"  "How long does it take to open the Holy Realm? And how many days will the competition last?"  Bai Yan gently stroked her chin, a deep thought passing through her eyes.  "It takes just over a month to open the Holy Realm, and the competition will surely end within this month."  "Alright," Bai Yan's eyes flashed lightly a few times, and she lifted her lips into a smile, "then I accept the task of being the referee."  "Haha."  Chu Ran laughed heartily, he patted Bai Yan's shoulder again: "With you serving as the referee, I feel relieved. Yi Yi, follow Little Bai and gain some experience, listen to her advice on everything, do you understand?"  Chu Yiyi felt wronged; she seemed to still be preoccupied with the matter of being framed by her own father just now. She wanted to say a few words, but Chu Ran's warning gaze had already swept over.  The implication was that if she dared to betray his trust, she would be finished!  Perhaps Chu Ran's gaze was too terrifying, Chu Yiyi shuddered and dared not speak out about what had just happened.  "Cough cough!" Zheng Qi coughed dryly twice more and cleared his throat, continuing, "Since we have said what needed to be said, I have something to discuss with Yan'er. Your Holiness, we take our leave."  He cupped his fists and then pulled Bai Yan towards the door.  After a while, they had already disappeared from the room.  Watching the two leave, Chu Ran quietly heaved a sigh of relief, his hand slowly stroking his chest, his expression becoming more relaxed.  Then, he waved his hand, and the feast that had been withdrawn earlier reappeared on the table.  "Yiyi, let's continue."  He laughed loudly and waved his sleeve to take his seat.  Chu Yiyi pouted her lips: "Forget it, I'm not going to take the blame for you, I'm going to find Bai Yan."  "Wait," seeing that Chu Yiyi was about to leave, Chu Ran frowned, "Regarding the matter just now, if you dare to speak out, I will marry you off in the next few days!"  Chu Yiyi shuddered and dashed out of the room without looking back; of course, she naturally didn't have the courage to betray her own father...  ...  These days, the Holy Land was somewhat noisy due to the presence of candidates, but to prevent these candidates from affecting the disciples of the Holy Land, they could only stay in a small courtyard outside the gate, not allowed to step out without orders from the Holy Land.  At this moment, in a small house within the courtyard, a woman in a red dress paced back and forth anxiously, her palms gently rubbing together, her beautiful face showing a hint of anxiety.  Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and as she turned her head, she saw a handsome man enter from outside. Her eyes lit up, and she quickly went to greet him.  "Cousin, what did your master say? Did he agree to help us?"  Lin Yah Han sighed helplessly with a wry smile, "Cousin, I'm afraid my master won't be able to help you this time..."  The joy on Huo Yun's face stiffened, and she looked blankly at the handsome face of the man in front of her, "Why? Your master has high authority in the Holy Land, why can't he help us? Is it that he doesn't want to help me?" Chapter 845: Framing (Part 2)  "Cousin, you've misunderstood. It's not that my master won't help you, it's just that this incident happened suddenly, and the Holy Land has chosen another referee. This referee is quite mysterious, and I've spent half a day trying but still haven't been able to find out who she is." Lin Yahan's face showed a trace of bitterness, thinking that what was believed to be a sure thing turned out to have such an unexpected change.  Hearing this, Huoyun lowered her head, her complexion slightly pale. In fact, only she knew that her talent had been exaggerated by the Huoyan Sect and couldn't compare with the genius disciples of other sects! Even her silver snake pet wasn't subdued by her but was tamed by an elder in the sect and given to her, and it was publicized that she personally subdued it. Also, because she wore accessories that concealed her strength and rarely showed her face in public, those people didn't know her true strength...  If nobody helped her, her chances of getting through this competition were slim! More importantly, she wanted to use the elder's hand to get rid of that woman! Thinking of Bai Xiaochen's defiance against her, Huoyun gritted her teeth in hatred, so she absolutely couldn't give that kid's mother a chance!  "Cousin, can you help me find out who the referee is? As long as I know who she is, I'm confident that I can get her to help me." Huoyun clenched her fists tightly, raised her head, and looked at Lin Yahan with pleading eyes.  Seeing his cousin's pitiful look, Lin Yahan's heart softened, but ultimately he could only shake his head helplessly. "The Holy Land is extremely secretive about that referee, and even my master doesn't know who is coming. All I know... is that the Holy Land's little princess will also attend the competition, serving as the deputy to that referee."  Huoyun stiffened. Even the princess of the Holy Land only qualified as a deputy, so who on earth was that referee?  "However, cousin, you don't have to worry. In addition to the referee and the little princess, some disciples from the Holy Land will come to assist them. It just so happens that one of those disciples has some connections with me, and I can use her to ensure your selection." Lin Yahan lifted the corner of his mouth, revealing a smile of certainty: "After all, with such a grand competition, the referee cannot oversee everything. At that time, I will have someone secretly meddle, which will allow you to win successfully."  Huoyun finally let out a sigh of relief. She raised her fist and playfully punched Lin Yahan's chest: "Cousin, you have considered everything for me, why didn't you tell me earlier? You made me worry so much. By the way, have you found out the identity of that woman?"  The girl's soft fist landed on his chest, and as he saw her snow-white neck, his eyes gradually moved down, noticing the surging waves, an unusual restlessness surged in Lin Yahan's heart.  He swallowed with difficulty, his mouth dry, and said, "I've already sent people to investigate. Cousin, you just wait for the news peacefully, I won't let you down."  "As for my cousin, I am naturally at ease," Huoyun shyly lowered her head, her neckline hanging very low, the red making her neck seem even whiter, her face showing shyness, "but at that time, I still hope cousin can help them to be eliminated. I don't want to see those people at the venue anymore."  "Hahaha!" Lin Yahan laughed twice and raised his hand to pinch Huoyun's palm: "Cousin, since the people coming to compete this time are all invited by the Holy Land, I can't directly eliminate that woman, but..." Chapter 846: Framing (Three)  He narrowed his eyes slightly, a cold gleam flashing through them, and silently smiled, "I have a way to make her fall from grace. Once she falls from grace, she will definitely stay away from the holy land and will no longer be able to compete with you for it!"  It was just a woman. As a disciple of the holy land, wouldn't it be easy to deal with her? As long as it would make his cousin happy, what did it matter if he abused his power? Anyway, no one above would care about these trivial matters...  ...  Three days flashed by, and those who came to participate in the competition arrived from various powers. Now, they gathered within the venue.  Huoyun stood out as the most splendid among a group of guards. She no longer displayed the shyness she had in front of Lin Yahhan, instead exuding a cold and noble aura. With a frosty face, she looked coldly at the noisy crowd in front of her, gradually revealing a trace of impatience in her brows.  However, as her gaze swept around, she still had not seen Bai Yan's figure, and her brows involuntarily knitted together.  "Miss!" Suddenly, a maid cautiously said, "That woman has arrived."  Huoyun's eyes swept across, following the maid's gaze, and immediately saw three figures, one big and two small, slowly walking from behind the crowd.  Under the noon sunlight, the woman in a red dress seemed to be gliding on the breeze with her graceful steps. Her beauty was stunning, and even the phrase "surpassing all in splendor" was very fitting to describe her.  On the left hand of the woman was a little boy, carved in pink jade, wearing a purple brocade robe, which brought out his domineering presence and nobility. It was hard to imagine that this little boy with a tender face already possessed such a powerful aura.  On her right hand was a cute and tender little girl, with a delicate and laughing figure, her little face bearing a sweet and naive smile, her eyes curved like crescents. Anyone who saw such a sweet and lovely little girl couldn't help but feel a softness in their heart.  "This woman has finally come!" Huoyun's eyes darkened a few times, "Do you still remember what I instructed you before?"  The maid hurriedly nodded, "I clearly remember the instructions of the miss."  "Good!" Huoyun sneered, "Cousin was right, we should make this woman... fall from grace!"  Just as Bai Yan was leading the two children towards the high platform, an abrupt, mocking voice came through, causing her steps to suddenly stop.  "Nowadays, people are truly shameless to the extreme. Without any real talent or learning, they dare to participate in the competition! They even think of bribing the judges' subordinates. Do you think that by bribing others, you can be safely selected?"  Bai Yan's brows slightly furrowed. She let go of Bai Xiaochen and Xiaolong'er's hands, turned her head slightly, and her gaze swept across Huoyun's face, landing on the maid who had just spoken mockingly.  "Did you just... say that about me?"  The maid sneered repeatedly, "I haven't wronged you. I personally witnessed those things. I saw you trying to bribe a disciple of the holy land. What do you think the holy land is? As a disciple of the holy land, could they be tempted by you?"  "Xiaoling!" Before Bai Yan could speak, Huoyun had already furrowed her brows and asked indifferently, "What do you mean by what you just said?"  The maid known as Xiaoling turned her head back and respectfully saluted Huoyun, "Miss, previously I inadvertently saw this lady... she... she met with a disciple of the holy land and attempted to use her body to seduce him, with the purpose of being selected. I truly did not wish for the miss to compete with such a person, so I took the liberty to expose her." Chapter 847: Framed (Part 4)  These words had been rehearsed by Huo Yun and Xiao Ling several times, and they naturally remembered everything that was supposed to be said. Moreover, with her disdainful expression, she managed to make everyone believe her words.  "What?" Huo Yun's eyes widened in shock as she incredulously covered her red lips. Her body trembled slightly, and she looked at Bai Yan with undisguised disgust in her eyes. "You... you actually did such a thing, the sect you belong to must be shamed by you!"  The crowd was in an uproar, and everyone looked at Bai Yan with disdain. Even more, the people who were standing next to her a moment ago quickly pushed her away, fearing that they would be tainted by this woman.  Xiao Long'er was so angry that her little face turned red. She wanted to step forward and tear this woman's hateful mouth, but a hand stretched out beside her and tightly held her back.  "Your Majesty..." She turned her head, looking at Bai Yan with a wronged expression, not forgetting to glare fiercely at Huo Yun and her servant.  This time, Bai Xiao Chen did not have the same impulse as Xiao Long'er. His little mouth curved into a sly arc, his big eyes twinkling: "Xiao Long'er, just wait and watch the good show."  These people wanted to frame his mother? But before they did this, did they even inquire about his mother's identity?  "You just said that I bribed a disciple of the holy land? I wonder where that disciple is, can you call him out?" Bai Yan's lips curled slightly, a smile playing on her lips, her gaze half-mocking as she looked at Huo Yun.  Huo Yun gave her servant girl a look, and the servant girl immediately stepped forward, cleared her throat, and said, "Young Master Liu, could you please come out and testify? Such a woman, if she enters the holy land, would surely tarnish such a sacred place."  The moment the words fell, not far from the high platform, a man in a green robe slowly walked out. He had one hand behind his back and smiled as he walked towards the crowd.  "Originally, I, Liu Han, did not want to talk too much about this matter, as it is too disgraceful," said Liu Han with a smile on his face, speaking righteously, "but... since Miss Huo Yun's servant girl has spoken, then I, Liu Han, must come out to testify!"  Liu Han's gaze slowly turned to Bai Yan, he frowned lightly, and said with deep significance, "Miss, I know that you are not very talented and are anxious, and for the sake of being selected, you resorted to this. However, I, Liu Han, have always acted uprightly and sat straight, and it's impossible for me to sell out my own conscience! Please leave on your own accord to avoid me having to take action to expel you!"  The smile on his face had disappeared just now, and he was very serious, even his expression was extremely solemn.  "Uncle." Suddenly, a milky voice came, causing Liu Han's frown to deepen, and he looked down at the little bun who walked up to him.  "Uncle, did your mother never teach you that children who lie will end up in a terrible situation?" Liu Han's face changed, and he said coldly, "No wonder the mother has such a character, this child is also so rude. Indeed, like mother, like child."  Bai Xiao Chen smiled with his eyes narrowed, but his large fox-like eyes shone with a trace of cold light.  "Uncle, Chen'er is just telling you that children who lie will end up in a terrible situation. If uncle didn't lie, then Chen'er's words are not aimed at you. Are you afraid, uncle?" Bai Xiao Chen's little face shone brilliantly, "Also, you slander Chen'er's mother, and Chen'er still politely calls you uncle. In the end, who is the one lacking manners?" Chapter 848: Framed (Part 5)  At this moment, the crowd was extremely quiet, so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. These people would never doubt the disciples of the Holy Land, but this child had always been very polite, yet he claimed he had no manners! This point made some people, overflowing with maternal love, take Bai Xiaochen's side.  After Bai Xiaochen dropped these words, he turned and walked over to Bai Yan's side. He raised his tender little face, his big eyes shining with bright light.  "Mother, Chen'er has already warned him, but it seems like he doesn't listen to Chen'er's words, so Mother doesn't need to be polite to him..."  Bai Yan touched Bai Xiaochen's head, then turned her gaze to Liu Han: "I'll give you one more chance, are you sure everything you just said is true?"  Liu Han's face changed slightly. What does this woman mean?  However, thinking of the recent unrest in the Holy Land, Liu Han gritted his teeth: "I, Liu Han, never lie!"  Over the years, Liu Han had not received a small amount of bribes. He had been lucky to escape the purges before, and now that the Holy Land had started purging again, he had to plan for himself.  The reason why he agreed to Lin Yahao was not because he had taken bribes from Lin Yahao, but rather, he foolishly thought that this incident could prove his innocence.  Look, such a beautiful woman was sent before him, and he was able to refuse without a change in expression. How could he, a person of such integrity, possibly take other bribes?  He believed that the other elders, once they saw this, would all praise him, and perhaps at that time, it might even make him...  "Good, very good. I've already given you a chance, and you still persist, so..." Bai Yan narrowed her eyes, a cold smile playing on her lips, "Whatever the consequences, they are what you've brought upon yourself!"  Seeing Bai Yan's cold and stern demeanor, Liu Han's face paused, and for some reason, he felt an inexplicable unease rising within him.  This feeling made his heart uncontrollably start to beat faster.  "Liu Han, under the core disciple Qinghong, in charge of managing the weapons needed for this competition..." Bai Yan smiled faintly, "So when I wanted to bribe you before, was it to let you allocate the best weapon to me?"  Liu Han nodded blankly: "Yes, you not only asked me to allocate excellent weapons to you, but also to tamper with other weapons. I couldn't possibly do such a thing that would betray the Holy Land!"  Everyone who entered the Holy Land was not allowed to carry weapons. Even the weapons needed for the competition were issued by the Holy Land to ensure fairness.  However...  Bai Yan abruptly chuckled: "You just said that my strength is poor, but have you forgotten a saying? In the face of absolute strength, even divine weapons don't count for much."  Divine weapons are indeed very powerful, but for example, if a person who has just become a martial artist fights against a high-ranking strong person, even if she has a divine weapon, how could it unleash the power of a divine weapon?  So, while weapons are important, true strength is even more important!  Liu Han was dumbfounded, and he even forgot to ask Bai Yan how she knew he was in charge of managing the weapons. After all, only the core members of the Holy Land knew about this; others only knew that he was also involved in this competition.  "Qinghong hasn't arrived yet? Go get him to see me right now!" Bai Yan's mouth curved into a cold smile as she spoke in a cold voice.  This competition, besides Chu Yiyi, Zheng Qi also asked two core disciples to come and assist, and this Liu Han was one of Qinghong's subordinates!  And what she did not expect was that Liu Han would treat her as a competing disciple and... even frame her. Chapter 849: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part 1)  At that moment... Outside the crowd, a delicate voice came from behind, causing the originally noisy people to suddenly fall silent.  "What are you all gathered here for?"  Behind the crowd, a girl in a yellow dress frowned, her tone quite impatient.  As soon as she appeared, the people who had been surrounding the area dispersed to both sides.  The disciples of the Holy Land had not seen Bai Yan before, but there was no one who did not know about the little princess called the witch. So, seeing her appear, Liu Han no longer confronted Bai Yan, and his handsome face lifted into a smile.  "Little princess, Brother Qinghong, Brother Changling, have you all arrived? When does the competition start?"  "Now."  Chu Yiyi playfully raised her eyebrows, her smiling eyes turning towards Bai Yan.  She was about to walk towards Bai Yan when Liu Han's voice rang out again from the side.  "Little princess, are we not waiting for the referee?"  Chu Yiyi paused in her steps, her head turning in confusion, her frown deepening: "Hasn't she already arrived? Who else do you want to wait for?"  These people are really strange; Bai Yan was clearly already here, who else were they waiting for?  "..."  Liu Han's eyes widened. The referee had already arrived, so why hadn't he received the message?  Chu Yiyi seemed not to notice Liu Han's shocked gaze, she turned around again and walked cheerfully towards Bai Yan, with a brilliant smile on her lovely face.  "Bai Yan, I'm late, can the competition start now?"  Liu Han was still searching the crowd for the mysterious referee when he suddenly saw Chu Yiyi approaching Bai Yan, and hearing her words, he instantly thought of a possibility.  This possibility made his body stiffen, his face turned pale in an instant, and his tightly clenched fist trembled slightly, his eyes wide open in disbelief.  "Brother Qinghong, this woman... this woman is..."  The young man who came with Chu Yiyi glanced at Liu Han, clearly not understanding why he was so agitated, but still nodded slightly: "She is the referee, what, you didn't know?"  His voice was neither light nor heavy, but it stood out so strikingly in the quiet venue, like a heavy bomb, smashing hard into everyone's hearts.  Huoyun's body swayed a few times, and she needed the support of her maid to avoid falling to the ground.  But...  Her fingertips, pale as death, pinched tightly into the palm of her hand, using pain to numb herself.  This woman was not a disciple participating in the competition, but... the mysterious referee brought in by the Holy Land this time?  Hadn't her cousin said that he had seen all the high-ranking disciples of the Holy Land, so why had he not seen this woman?  "Wait."  As Chu Yiyi was about to pull Bai Yan into the referee's seat, she raised her hand, stopping her action, her eyes faintly sweeping towards Liu Han, a cold smile rippling on her lips.  "You just said, my talent is low?"  These words made Chu Yiyi, who was clueless, freeze, her bright and wide eyes in shock, her gaze slowly turning to Liu Han.  Bai Yan's talent is low? Then in this world, could there still be a genius?  Bai Yan continued to approach Liu Han two steps closer: "You said, in order to succeed in being selected in this competition, I did not hesitate to bribe you, is that correct?"  Chu Yiyi's eyes were already wide as copper bells, she had only been late for a moment, how did such a big event occur? Chapter 850: She is the Mysterious Judge (Part Two)  "I..." Liu Han was forced to retreat two steps, with cold sweat breaking out on his forehead, and his legs were trembling, nearly kneeling down in fright.  Before Liu Han could find a suitable excuse, Chu Yiyi's voice, furious and thunderous, rang out. This time, it directly caused Liu Han to kneel on the ground, the smell of urine spreading throughout the entire venue.  "Liu Han, you have a lot of nerve. Bai Yan only agreed with difficulty to serve as the judge this time, and you dare to slander him! Besides, with Bai Yan's talent, all of you together are no match for her! And you still dare to criticize her talent as low? Who gave you the courage?"  Bai... Bai Yan? Liu Han hadn't thought it through earlier, but now, hearing Chu Yiyi's words, he suddenly realized that this name was very familiar, as if he had heard it somewhere.  Immediately, his gaze slowly fell on the little bun beside Bai Yan, his eyes suddenly widened, filled with fear and panic.  Not long ago, he had heard rumors that the owner of the Holy Island was none other than the granddaughter of Bai Changfeng, the head of the Medicine Sect, Bai Yan, and that she always had an extremely cute son by her side!  However, he had only heard of her existence and had never really seen her, so for a moment, he did not associate this woman with Bai Yan...  If she really was Bai Yan, then the comments he made earlier were so ridiculous!  Liu Han was trembling all over, burying his head tightly on the ground, not daring to say a single word.  The crowd was also silent, but instead of looking at Bai Yan as before, their eyes, filled with contempt and ridicule, were now all focused on Liu Han.  This girl's status in the Holy Land was obviously very high, otherwise, the little princess wouldn't be willing to be her assistant. And Liu Han, just an inner disciple, not even core, dared to claim that she bribed him with her beauty to be selected for the Holy Land?  Ridiculous, too ridiculous!  "Little princess, I know I was wrong, I really know I was wrong," Liu Han said, kowtowing fiercely, tears streaming down his face, "It was Lin Yah Han who made me do this. I am just an assistant, the real culprit is him."  "Lin Yah Han?" Chu Yiyi frowned, her fingers lightly touching her chin, "And who is this Lin Yah Han?"  "He... He is also an inner disciple of the Holy Land, from the same master as me."  "Oh, then have him expelled from the Holy Land along with you, our Holy Land does not need such people."  Chu Yiyi waved her hand, deciding the fate of these two men.  After dropping these words, she turned towards Bai Yan with a smile, and gently blinked: "Bai Yan, what do you think of how I dealt with it?"  "Do as you see fit."  "No, that won't do," Chu Yiyi pouted, "My dad told me to follow you and learn well, and also to listen to you in everything. If my dad finds out I made a decision on my own, he will definitely beat me."  In fact, the meaning of Chu Yiyi's words was very clear. She, the little princess of the Holy Land, had to listen to Bai Yan, so how could these mere disciples dare to trouble her? Believe it or not, she would tell her father, and then it wouldn't be as simple as just being expelled from the Holy Land for losing strength.  In the crowd, Lin Yah Han, who had always been watching the situation, saw that things were not going well and turned to run away. Before he could escape, he was blocked by a group of people, and one of them struck his chest with a palm, sending him flying in front of Bai Yan and Chu Yiyi. Chapter 851: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part Three)  Chu Yiyi stood with her hands on her hips, looking down disdainfully at Lin Yah Han who was lying on the ground, smiling sinisterly: "Previously, Bai Yan had Elder Zheng Qi cleanse the holy land once, but I didn't expect such vermin to still exist. Our holy land's competitions are extremely fair, and I will not allow any favoritism or cheating!"  "Sister Chu," Bai Xiaochen stepped forward, his eyes twinkling with a bright smile, "this Lin Yah Han, he is that bad auntie's cousin, and... before, that bad auntie and Chen'er had caused a dispute outside the gates of the holy land, Chen'er suspects that everything was instigated by her."  He lifted his little chin, pointing towards Huoyun, his delicate and youthful face showing a hint of dominance.  Huoyun's face turned deathly pale as she took two steps back, terror in her eyes. She quickly sought help with a pleading look towards Lin Yah Han, her eyes brimming with tears.  "No, this has nothing to do with my cousin," Lin Yah Han gritted his teeth and said, "My cousin is innocent, it was all my own doing, I conspired with her maidservant! I just wanted to stand up for my cousin, I didn't expect... I hope the little princess can give me another chance."  Being exposed, the greatest punishment for him would be to leave the holy land. However, if his cousin's actions were revealed, even if the holy land did nothing to her, her father in the Huoyan Sect would not let her off easily!  Offending the holy land would mean the end of the Huoyan Sect for good!  Thump! The maidservant also knelt down, knocking her forehead hard, her forehead bruised and blood seeping out, trickling down to the ground.  "All of these matters were indeed communicated between the young master and me, it has nothing to do with the young lady, please let her go, she is innocent..."  Her eyes were filled with tears, her face pale, yet she made a resolute choice as if she was ready to face death.  If she took all the blame upon herself, at most she would die, but if the young lady got into trouble as well, then her brother in the Huoyan Sect would not escape death either...  Therefore, she could not let the young lady be implicated.  Seeing these two people taking all the blame onto themselves, Huoyun quietly breathed a sigh of relief. She bit her lip, stepped forward, and knelt toward Bai Yan, bowing her head with tears in her eyes.  "Lady, I know you have a deep misunderstanding of me, indeed this time I failed to discipline my maidservant properly, and my cousin... acted out of deep love for me and committed such an act, but I, Huoyun, have always acted uprightly and will never admit to things I haven't done! I hope Lady Bai won't let your son frame me..."  Her words were earnest, her eyes full of pleading, as if she truly were wronged.  Chu Yiyi turned her head to look at Bai Yan, to tell the truth, she trusted Bai Xiaochen more than this woman.  "Do you want to stay and continue the competition?" Bai Yan's lips curved into a smile, looking at the girl kneeling before her, "Is that so?"  Huoyun's face turned white, her cousin had been caught, and continuing to stay, the outcome of this competition was predictable.  But now that things had come to this, she could not back down.  "Yes."  "Hmm," Bai Yan nodded lightly, "Take off the jade pendant from your neck, and I'll allow you to continue competing."  What? Huoyun's eyes widened, her face turning as white as snow, panic flashing in her eyes.  How... how could she know?  "Lady Bai, this is something my mother left for me before she passed away," Huoyun lowered her head, concealing the panic in her eyes, and bit her lip, "She once told me not to take off the jade pendant, otherwise it would be disrespectful to her, surely Lady Bai wouldn't... want to force me?" Chapter 852: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part Four)  Even if the disciples of the Holy Land cheat in secret, they dare not take any action in public. Moreover, now that they are in front of a crowd, this woman could not possibly force her to take off the jade pendant. Therefore, this is why Huo Yun dared to ignore it.  Unfortunately, she forgot that the person in front of her, one is the little princess of the Holy Land, and the other... is someone even the little princess has to obey.  As a result, when Huo Yun's words fell, Chu Yiyi stepped forward, raised her hand, and viciously tore off the jade pendant from her neck, and slammed it onto the ground with a bang.  "Bai Yan told you to take off the jade pendant, so just take it off. Why the nonsense?" she glared at Huo Yun fiercely and said unhappily.  Everyone was shocked by Chu Yiyi's actions and looked at Huo Yun with sympathy.  But due to Chu Yiyi's identity, no one dared to express their dissatisfaction.  However...  Huo Yun had already said that the jade pendant was a keepsake left to her by her mother, and for her, it was a remembrance. Yet, the little princess of the Holy Land was so domineering, directly smashing her jade pendant.  Looking at Huo Yun's face, it turned pale, clearly heartbroken.  In fact, the paleness of Huo Yun's face was not because of heartbreak, but because she was frightened. She stared blankly at the jade pendant on the ground, a hint of panic emerging in her gaze.  It's over, this time, everything is over for her...  "Eh, that's not right. I heard that the young miss of the Huo Yan Sect, Huo Yun, has already reached the King stage. Besides the three major powers, she is the most talented person in the world. Why does her current strength show that she is only at the intermediate Earth stage?"  The Earth stage talent is not considered high, but it's not low either. In the past, the Crown Prince of Liu Huo Country, Nangong Yi, broke through to the Earth stage and was already considered a genius.  But...  After all, Nangong Yi is just the Crown Prince of Liu Huo Country, a royal child, and his cultivation resources cannot be compared to those of a second-tier sect. Therefore, Huo Yun's talent is no longer considered a genius.  Moreover, the Huo Yan Sect went to great lengths to promote Huo Yun's talent, even calling her a supreme genius.  A young genius who breaks through to the King stage is indeed a genius, but what a pity...  This genius is fake!  "Yiyi," Bai Yan slightly lifted her lips, "As far as I know, those who enter the Holy Land to participate in the competition must at least have the strength of the high-level Earth stage! She hasn't even reached this threshold, I wonder how she entered the Holy Land?"  It's true that Zheng Qi sent invitations to various sects, but to successfully enter the Holy Land, one must pass a selection. Only those whose strength reaches the minimum target are qualified to hold an invitation to enter the Holy Land.  How did someone who hasn't reached the minimum target enter the Holy Land? This question is worth pondering for everyone.  "Qinghong, what's going on here?"  Seeing Bai Yan questioning her, Chu Yiyi threw the question to the two people following her, her eyes widened, hands on her hips, and she asked in a commanding tone.  Qinghong touched the cold sweat on his forehead: "The one who went to various powers for selection was Elder Lin You."  "Lin You? Who is he?" Chu Yiyi asked angrily.  "He is..." Qinghong glanced at Lin Yahan kneeling on the ground, "He is this Lin Yahan's master."  The crowd was in an uproar, and the eyes that had been gathered on Huo Yun now fell on Lin Yahan...  Lin Yahan trembled all over, he understood, this time, both he and his master could not escape their fate! Chapter 853: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part 5)  "Let him roll over to see me!" Chu Yiyi frowned, her expression showing a hint of displeasure. Just as the person beside her was about to carry out the order, she quickly spoke up, "Wait, don't let him come to see me. I don't want to see him. Just send him directly to Elder Zheng Qi and let them deal with him."  "Yes, Young Princess." The guard took the order and left, and her words had essentially sealed the fate of Lin Yahan and his disciple...  "You," Chu Yiyi pointed to another guard standing by and lifted her snow-white chin, "Take Liu Han and Lin Yahan down together to wait for punishment! A few of you dared to engage in favoritism and fraud, and even plotted against Bai Yan, thinking you could get away with it? Dream on."  Lin Yahan's body weakened, and he collapsed to the ground. He closed his eyes slightly, then slowly opened them again, his gaze falling on the pale face of Huoyun, and he let out a helpless wry smile.  It seemed that this time, he couldn't help his cousin anymore.  "Young Princess, Miss Bai Yan."  Liu Han approached in panic, thumping down on his knees again in front of them, knocking his head hard on the ground.  He was so forceful that he didn't even realize his head was bleeding.  "I know I was wrong, I truly know I was wrong, please spare me this once, I will never dare again."  "Spare you?" Bai Yan chuckled coldly, her indifferent eyes staring at the young man kneeling on the ground, her face expressionless, "If I were not the referee of this competition, would your schemes have succeeded?"  Liu Han was stunned; indeed, if Bai Yan were not the referee but just an ordinary disciple, perhaps she would have been driven out of the holy land and her reputation would have been ruined...  "So, if it were someone else, you know what the outcome would be without me saying so," Bai Yan's foot harshly stepped on Liu Han's head, pinning it to the ground, her voice cold, "And precisely because of people like you who engage in favoritism and fraud, who knows how many excellent disciples the holy land may have lost without our knowledge. How can people like you be spared?"  Whether it's the Illusionary Mansion, Medicine Sect, or this Holy Land, they are all her home.  She would not allow anyone to bully others on her turf, nor would she tolerate the loss of talent in the Holy Land due to these people's actions.  Today, she intended to make an example of him, to restore peace to the Holy Land from now on!  Bang!  Bai Yan kicked Liu Han's head, and in an instant, Liu Han's body flew out and hit a pillar. He spat out fresh blood, his face deathly pale, completely drained of color.  His eyes widened in terror, watching as the red robe fluttered into his view, yet he was powerless to resist.  Pfft!  Bai Yan's fingers hooked Liu Han's arm, twisted it forcefully, and everyone heard the crisp sound of bones cracking. He spat out another mouthful of bright red blood, and immediately, a heart-wrenching scream echoed through the sky, chilling to the bone.  "In our Holy Land, we have always been fair and just, and we will not tolerate any favoritism or fraud!" Bai Yan's indifferent gaze swept over the people present, her voice calm, "If I ever hear of such things again, the outcome will be the same as his."  Bai Yan retracted her stance, and from within her sleeve, a sword light shot out, heading straight for Liu Han's dantian. In an instant, his dantian burst, and his body collapsed to the ground in an embarrassing manner.  Previously, even though the three masters had cleansed the Holy Land, unfortunately, the threat was not enough, merely expelling the violators. Therefore, there were still people willing to take the risk! For some wealth and treasures, they did not hesitate to commit acts of favoritism and fraud again. 
Chapter 1064: Cross-Border Bombing  Even on the frozen soil of the north, within their own country, a violent uprising occurred, and the Finnish officials could not possibly be unaware of it. However, the Finnish authorities kept a tacit silence about the matter. The trouble was brought by the people of Arrow Corporation, and it happened on their "private territory." Since no Finns died and Arrow Corporation did not ask for help, why should they bother?  The local police of Paltak town sent out several mounted officers to patrol around the refugee camp, but these officers ultimately did not muster the courage to charge in. They showed their faces and then withdrew. Judging by the equipment in the hands of the rioters, this was not something they could handle.  The chief of Paltak made a decision to mobilize local militia to set up defenses within the town and to ensure the safety of the townspeople to the best of their ability. His choice proved to be correct. In less than half an hour, a document was issued urging the local police to protect the safety of Paltak town at all costs, while a special forces unit was sent to support them.  As for the refugee camp, it would be taken over by the Finnish Defence Forces hundreds of kilometers away – in name.  Through the intelligence of the Russian Security Bureau, Jiang Chen learned of these messages. The silence of the Finnish officials was unexpected to him; he originally thought Finland would at least send a rapid response force to maintain stability, but he didn't expect their reaction to be so indifferent. It seems that Carmen probably had some shady dealings within this military base.  Regardless of Carmen's reaction, Jiang Chen's plans were proceeding step by step. Most of the refugees were from the Middle East, and many had participated in militia organizations or had been conscripted as reservists and received basic military training. They couldn't be expected to operate tanks, but they were more than capable of using mortars without dropping shells on their own heads.  As the second batch of equipment crossed the Russo-Finnish border into the Paltak region, Sami, relying on his rapidly accumulated prestige, pulled together a guerrilla force of ten thousand from the refugee camp. With the rationale that "only by completely annihilating the army of infidels can the oppressive rule be ended," he mobilized the entire refugee camp to fight a decisive battle with Arrow Corporation.  Boxes of ammunition were loaded onto dilapidated vans and trucks, and workers took out welding torches from factories to weld heavy machine guns onto pickups. There was no doubt that this ragtag force had no combat effectiveness, and they stood almost no chance against mercenaries who had received formal training under equal conditions, but Jiang Chen was full of confidence in the outcome of the war. The reason was simple. If they couldn't outshoot them with marksmanship, they would outgun them with firepower!  At two o'clock in the morning, six hours after the uprising started and leaving only two thousand people to defend, the fully armed Sami army hit the road again, advancing towards Arrow Corporation to "rescue" those brethren who had gone astray.  The mighty army reached the tundra two kilometers outside of Arrow Corporation and spread out to surround the military base. Under the command of several veterans who had seen battle, the armed militants took shovels and hoes and dug out simple artillery pits. Hundreds of mortars were set up in dozens of artillery positions. With a signal flare launched into the sky, the "whoosh" sound of hundreds of mortars firing filled the entire tundra, and bursts of explosive flames covered the entire military area, bombing the waiting mercenaries into disorientation.  Of course, the mercenaries stationed in the military base were not to be trifled with. As soon as they encountered the bombardment, all mercenaries rushed to the shelters. At the same time, the base's howitzers began counter-bombardment on the rioters' mortar positions according to coordinates provided by scouts...  However, these mortar positions were simply too scattered, and the barrage of shells coming from all directions left the base's artillerymen running ragged. Although they were experts in artillery, the number on the other side was more than ten times theirs. A mortar shell landed on the roof of the command post, blowing a corner off the concrete fortifications. Covered in dust shaken from the ceiling, Colonel Yano steadied himself on the table, cursed as he looked out the window, "Shit! Where did these bugs get so many mortars?!"  The sudden bombardment caught everyone off guard; they had originally thought these ragtag forces would charge their machine gun bunkers with rifles in hand, howling, but they did not expect them to start with support weapons.  "Undoubtedly, it was Star Ring Trade that supplied them," Saldes braced himself on the table and returned to the tactical map, glancing around at those present, "Guys, we can't keep defending. No one knows how much ammunition they really have because the man supplying them is an absolute bastard. Yano, take your men out there and finish them off, tell them that modern warfare can't just be won by numbers."  "Yes!" Yano stood at attention, saluted, took the walkie-talkie from the arrow, and began to issue orders to the various units of the force.  After the order was given, the gates of the military ground opened, and a dozen Humvees roared out, with four "Cougar" armored vehicles following closely behind, charging towards the rioters' positions.  Under Jiang Chen's direction, Sami decisively ordered his men with a two-thousand-strong guerrilla force carrying boxes of anti-armor weapons to block the way. The front line of the battle was located at the edge of the pine forest, where the pine trees were thick.  When they encountered the rioters' guerrilla force, Arrow Corporation's Humvees and armored vehicles immediately slowed down, brandishing the heavy machine guns welded to the roofs and firing bullets the size of bowls at the crowd. The mercenaries in the vehicles also jumped out, seeking cover to exchange fire with the rioters.  However, they clearly underestimated the anti-armor capability of the mob. As the mercenaries fired their machine guns, various high-explosive and armor-piercing RPG warheads flew wildly through the pine forest. Although terribly inaccurate, the overwhelming number meant that the reactive armor on the four armored vehicles was simultaneously knocked out, with only one vehicle retreating intact to the rear.  Of course, this was still not enough to make up for the inexperience of these rioters in warfare. Although the sudden RPGs caught Arrow Corporation's armored units off guard, even without armored vehicles, this mob was no match for regular forces...  Less than ten minutes into the exchange of fire, Sami's forces had already suffered more than two hundred casualties, while Arrow Corporation had less than fifty.  Seeing that they were losing, Sami panicked and immediately called Jiang Chen for help. "Our forces on the front line are starting to collapse; their marksmanship is just too accurate! Many people are holding a gun for the first time; we simply can't beat them..."  "Don't worry, it will be fine soon," Jiang Chen's words stunned Sami.  It will be fine soon? What does that mean?  As he was puzzled, the ground trembled with an earthquake, followed by a loud explosion from afar. The shock wave spread through the pine forest, swept over the tundra, and even brushed over his forehead.  Sami hadn't realized what had happened before he saw thick smoke rising from the direction of the military base, his mouth agape in surprise.  Standing on the other side of the battlefield on a small hill, Jiang Chen observed the splendid fireworks through his binoculars, a smile curling at the corner of his mouth. It seemed that the Alpha Special Forces had succeeded.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1065: The Doomsday of Arrow Company  Under the suppression of the mortars, the base was in extreme chaos, and no one noticed that a special forces team had infiltrated the camp. Without much effort, Kutebov placed the beacon on the predetermined target, then led the team to withdraw from the base. After safely reaching the evacuation point, he called for an airstrike.  Soon, a Russian stealth bomber soared over from above the clouds, and the four missiles it dropped accurately hit two ammunition depots and two fuel depots within the base.  The shockwave from the explosions swept across the entire camp, directly collapsing a ring of concrete buildings around it. Exploding ammunition and blazing fireballs flew across the camp, causing a series of chain reactions. Everywhere was flame, everywhere was blood and corpses.  The guard brigade stationed in the camp lost nearly half of its forces instantly, and most of the remaining were wounded, with hardly a whole person to be found. Medics carried stretchers through the base, searching for the injured who had lost their ability to move.  Sappers wearing heavy bomb suits braved the fire, rushing into the flames to drag out unexploded ammunition from the ruins.  All the able-bodied soldiers got moving, looking for their units to regroup.  Saldes stared at the fire outside the window, his pupils gradually filled with a layer of despair.  The thick smoke obscured the entire base, and the fire colored the entire night sky red, as if it were the end of the world.  "Shit..." he muttered to himself, moving his leaden legs away from the window slowly.  Turning around, he met the eyes of the staff officer from the command center.  "Commander, what should we do?" he asked.  The aftermath of the explosions finally subsided, and there were no more sounds of ammunition exploding in the base. However, everyone's mood could not be calmed. The mercenaries who had escaped from the explosions were very clear that their nightmare was just beginning.  The previous explosions seemed to have ignited a signal, blowing the horn for Sami's troops to attack. Under Jiang Chen's instruction, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity, standing in front of everyone, calling out loud and leading the remaining mob to charge the front lines.  More than six thousand people ran across the tundra, rushing towards the pine forest where the lights flickered. From a distance, the scene was quite spectacular.  Meanwhile, as the mercenaries on the front lines saw the thick smoke rising from behind their base, they all fell into panic. Their morale, originally high, plummeted in an instant.  When faced with the mob that surged forward like a tidal wave, even though they had the strength to hold the line, they had no desire to continue fighting.  Without any suspense, Arrow Company's defensive line was broken, and the resisting mercenaries collapsed in the face of Sami's army's human wave tactics.  Some fled back to the burning base, but most became deserters, escaping deep into the forest.  Without needing Jiang Chen to remind them, even a pig would know what to do at this time.  Watching Sami leading the mob to attack the military base, Jiang Chen put away his binoculars, summoned the off-road motorcycle he had prepared in advance from his storage space, and gently patted Aisha's back.  "It's about time; let's get going."  "Okay!" Aisha nodded, and after Jiang Chen sat on the motorcycle, she quickly straddled behind him.  The engine roared, and the tires kicked up a layer of crushed snow.  Jiang Chen rode the off-road motorcycle down the hillside, taking Aisha to the side of the base, stopping the motorcycle by the roadside. He pulled out a laser sword from his storage space, held it casually in his hand, and effortlessly cut through the protective wall made of steel wire.  The entire base was immersed in fire and chaos. Occasionally, the sound of mortars could still be heard. All the mercenaries capable of carrying a gun were pushed to the front line, fighting with the mob for control of the main gate of the base.  Aside from a guard squad stationed in front of the command center, there were hardly any people in the entire rear area. For Jiang Chen and Aisha, this was no different from being undefended.  Ten guards in total, two stationed in the watchtower, the remaining eight at the entrances of the first and second floors.  Aisha took out a ghost sniper rifle, silently took out the two guards in the watchtower, then using the blind spots of their vision, she killed the eight people upstairs and downstairs one by one.  After Aisha dealt with the guards outside the command post, Jiang Chen took out a rifle, stepped towards the main gate, but when he passed by the Humvee at the entrance, he coincidentally ran into Saldes, who was frantically escaping from the command center, and the staff officer.  Their eyes met, and both sides were obviously stunned.  The staff officer was the first to react, immediately reaching into his chest to draw a gun. However, before his hand reached his chest, Aisha, who was quicker to act, shot him in the head.  Saldes was about to resist but was easily controlled by Jiang Chen, who twisted his hands behind his back and pressed him against the Humvee.  "Saldes, male, 43 years old. Serves as the general manager of Arrow Company and also as the supreme commander, am I right?" Although it was their first meeting, Jiang Chen's holographic helmet linked to the Ghost Agent database stored his photo and personal information. Just one encounter, and the information about him was projected onto the holographic screen.  With his face pressed against the car hood, Saldes was quite tough and refused to surrender. He gritted his teeth and said, "I won't say anything, just kill me..."  "Kill you? I haven't asked you anything yet." Jiang Chen grinned, not caring about his uncooperative attitude at all, and took out a syringe, unceremoniously injecting it into his shoulder.  "Ugh!" Saldes made a defiant growl from his throat, his eyes bulging with blood, but soon the brilliance in his pupils dimmed.  Jiang Chen simply let go of his grip, as it was unprecedented for an ordinary person injected with truth serum to resist.  Flipping Saldes over, Jiang Chen asked word by word, "Where is Carmen?"  "In the underground bunker... in the research institute."  "Where is the underground bunker?"  "The entrance is in the center of the base; you can only enter through the elevator. Next to the entrance, there are two helipads; you'll see it if you walk over."  After a question and answer, Jiang Chen quickly got the information he wanted.  "Very well, now you can get your wish." Jiang Chen pulled out a pistol and shot him in the head, then tossed his body aside.  It was a quick death, but for the widely reputed general manager of Arrow Company, Mr. Saldes, dying in such an obscure manner might be more painful than death itself... if the dead could feel pain.  "Underground bunker, huh." Looking towards the center of the base, Jiang Chen's mouth curled into a cold smile.  No matter what Carmen was still plotting, his luck was about to run out. The fate of the Rothschild family would be like how they started, rising to fame because of a war and dying obscurely because of a war...  But just then, a piercing scream came from a distance.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1066: Iblis! A shrill scream pierced through the entire battlefield, even drowning out the sound of bullets being fired. In the center of the battlefield, where mercenaries were fiercely exchanging fire with rioters, a dark shadow suddenly burst in. Illuminated by the flare, everyone saw the appearance of the monster clearly. Its legs were curved like a bow, its arms were two black scythes, and its spindle-shaped long mouth was embedded with rows of teeth the size of rice grains. It also had two pairs of short wings on its back, resembling a humanoid praying mantis.  The gunfire ceased for a brief two seconds. Everyone was bewildered by the scene before them. However, in the instant the gunfire stopped, the "mantis" moved. Its bow-shaped legs forcefully catapulted its seven-foot tall frame forward like a cannonball, defying science. The rioter closest to it didn't even have time to react before the crossing blades decapitated him, and his arterial blood gushed out as he fell backward.  After knocking its prey to the ground, the monster's spindle-shaped mouth fiercely stabbed into the neck's severed end. With a series of crisp crunching sounds, it gnawed away the prey's bone marrow and flesh as if it were drinking a beverage. Its manner of consuming flesh and blood was as brutal as a wild beast.  Even the devotees who had been in a killing frenzy couldn't help but feel their stomachs churn and their legs tremble as they started to retreat. "Iblis..." That was the name of a devil, just like Satan in the Bible. "It's Iblis!" Someone shouted this, followed by screams that rose and fell in succession.  The rioters raised their G36 rifles, desperately pulling the triggers and spraying bullets at the monster. However, the mantis simply raised its double blades, allowing the bullets to ping harmlessly off its chitinous armor, utterly disregarding the incoming 5.56mm rounds.  The most deadly fact was that there wasn't just one mantis-like creature! Dozens of dark shadows had already sprung out one after another from the underground bunker entrances, wielding double blades as they charged into the ranks of the rioters. Once they closed in, the only fate awaiting the rioters was slaughter.  In addition to the mantises, there was also a type of bloated, maggot-like creature spewing highly corrosive saliva. Even steel and concrete, much less human flesh, fell prey to its powerful corrosive effect. Facing these devils of legend, the devotees finally began to feel fear.  Just as they had arrived, the disorderly mob of rioters uncontrollably collapsed in defeat. On the other hand, the mercenaries cheered joyfully. It was one of their own! Though it looked a bit disgusting.  However, their cheers didn't last long before a similar nightmare descended upon them. Dense clusters of spores drifted out from the underground bunkers and began to spread slowly across the entire camp, virtually undetectable in the dark night.  The first people to encounter the spores began to have difficulty breathing, followed by tearing pain spreading from their chest cavities. They screamed in agony, scratching at their own skin as blood flowed freely. Soon, they lost sensation in their entire bodies, becoming akin to walking corpses.  Only those encased in mechanical exoskeletons were spared. Everyone on the battlefield, friend and foe alike, was engulfed by the spores.  To survive, the mercenaries and rioters turned their guns away from each other and began to face their common enemy. However, from the very beginning, they had no chance of victory.  ...  "Damn it, what the hell is that?!" A creature resembling a deathclaw and somewhat similar to the one before it lunged over. Jiang Chen, sweating profusely, kicked it in the chest, discarded his empty rifle, and drew his laser sword, brandishing it twice to sever one of its arms. Green blood sprayed out, vaporized by the heat of the lightsaber.  Taking advantage of the creature's retreat as it screeched backward, Jiang Chen didn't pursue. With a flick of his right hand holding the sword handle, a spinning blade of light separated from the hilt and cleaved into the creature's face, slicing off half of it. It was fortunate that his sword skills weren't rusty; otherwise, he would have been caught off guard.  Elsewhere, Aisha set up her Ghost sniper rifle and calmly blew off the heads of two mutant creatures. "There are too many of them; we can't stay here any longer," Jiang Chen picked up a PK2000 from the ground, reloaded it with a magazine, "Prepare to retreat."  Aisha nodded but did not move. "I'll cover the rear—"  "You go first, hurry up!" Jiang Chen slapped Aisha's shoulder, pushing her to the back, and raised his rifle to fire at several staggering zombies coming his way.  Yes, they were zombies. But they seemed a bit different from the zombies he had encountered in Cagayan City; these zombies seemed not to be due to viral infection but rather similar to the zombies from the wasteland.  [Warning: Unidentified bacteria detected in the air, filtration device has been automatically activated. To disable, please...]  When Jiang Chen saw the two lines of text projected on his helmet screen, he immediately understood what these things were. It was too similar to the creature he had once encountered in Wanghai City.  He could not afford to think too much at this point. Without any hesitation, using his highest command authority within the Star Ring Trade, bypassing all decision-making layers, he directly connected to the Electroray C-1 deployed in geostationary orbit, designated the underground bunker entrance in the center of the base as the strike target, and called for an orbital bombardment.  As for diplomatic issues, those could be set aside in the face of human concerns. At worst, they would just have to pay some compensation.  "This is Electroray C-1, airstrike target confirmed. Tungsten core bomb separated, leaving geostationary orbit. Airstrike expected to arrive in ten minutes, please evacuate from the target area..."  After turning off the communication in his ear, Jiang Chen emptied the magazine in his rifle and immediately ran towards the protective net.  Aisha, who had already reached the outside of the protective net, set up her sniper rifle and began to cover Jiang Chen's retreat. For some reason, these creatures seemed to be consciously chasing them, as if controlled by some kind of consciousness.  Before being surrounded by the army of zombies and mutant creatures, Jiang Chen successfully crawled out of the protective net, threw a nuclear grenade behind him, and ran without looking back, pulling Aisha with him.  The blast wave from the explosion knocked down a swath of mutant creatures. Once assured that the zombies and aliens had not pursued, Jiang Chen took out an off-road motorcycle from his storage space and with Aisha, sped towards a nearby mountain. Not in the direction of the refugee camp, but towards the Russian-Finnish border.  After reaching the hilltop, Jiang Chen stopped the motorcycle and glanced at the time on his watch before looking back in the direction of the military base. With the help of sporadic flames, he could barely make out with the naked eye that there were no more living people in the entire military base.  At that moment, specks of white light emerged in the night sky. Carrying long trails of fire, a dozen tungsten core bombs sequentially hit the center of the military base, with dust from the explosions rising tens of meters high.  "That should be dead, right?" Jiang Chen muttered, taking out a telescope from his pocket. When the dust settled, only a deep crater several dozen meters in diameter was left in the center of the base, like an abyss leading to hell. Mutant creatures, shaking their heads and bodies, were crawling out of the deep crater...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1067: Finland Caught in the Crossfire  The sky was already faintly turning light; it was six o'clock in the morning. An orange-red civilian helicopter circled high in the sky, its side emblazoned with the logo of Yle. When the ammunition depot exploded and black smoke rose, the Finnish Broadcasting Company dispatched their helicopter to the scene immediately.  They originally thought it was a forest fire, but when they arrived, they discovered it was not a forest fire at all. What was ablaze was the military base of Arrow Company, which had been widely criticized within Finland. It seemed as if a war had broken out, and in the center of the incident site, there was a deep, bottomless crater.  "This is the Finnish Broadcasting Company, live broadcasting the situation of the forest fire in the Paltak suburbs... Although it turned out this wasn't a fire at all, but an explosion caused by humans. We have witnessed a huge pit at the scene... Wait, what is that!"  The camera shook violently, the cameraman adjusted the focus, zooming in towards the direction of the military base. In the flaming base, corpses walked aimlessly, and from time to time, bizarre creatures climbed out of the pit.  "...It seems we have discovered something unbelievable. The rumors about Arrow Company conducting unsavory experiments at the military base seem to be true. What are these things? Aliens? Zombies? Extraterrestrials? God..."  While the helicopter was sending first-hand information to the Finnish people and the world, Jiang Chen, standing on the mountain, was also worried about the situation at the base.  It was clear that a lot of effort was put into building this underground shelter. The tungsten core bombs that fell from the sky did not completely destroy the underground shelter, but only collapsed the elevator leading to and from it.  Spores continued to spurt from the underground laboratory, and now they had spread outside the base.  Jiang Chen noticed that the terrifying bacteria could not only cause the animals that stumbled into it to mutate but could also infect the plants rooted there.  "Aisha."  "Hmm?"  Aisha tilted her head to look at Jiang Chen, her beautiful chestnut hair swaying in the wind.  "I think... we might have stirred up trouble," Jiang Chen said with a wry smile, putting down his binoculars.  "Stirred up trouble?" Aisha frowned slightly in confusion, not understanding the meaning behind Jiang Chen's words.  Trouble? What is trouble?  Jiang Chen shook his head and didn't explain further.  At that moment, a sudden premonition surged in his heart. Jiang Chen and Aisha almost simultaneously turned around, drawing their pistols and aiming towards the direction of the road.  "Come out, I'll count to three."  His finger flicked off the safety, and Jiang Chen said calmly.  With both hands raised above his head, a Russian in arctic camouflage stood out, speaking in rather unstandard Chinese.  "Don't be nervous, one of us."  Looking at the face covered with as many scars as wrinkles, Jiang Chen put away his pistol and breathed a sigh of relief, gesturing for Aisha to do the same and looked at him with a crooked smile.  "I was just about to shoot."  "Thank you for not doing that," Kutepov lowered his raised hands and walked up to Jiang Chen, lifting his chin towards the direction of the military base down the hill, "What's the situation there?"  "Special situation, it's complicated to explain right now, we'll talk about it when we get back," Jiang Chen shook his head.  "Alright, shall we go together?" Kutepov pointed towards the direction of the mountain, "If you're not planning to go back to the refugee camp, you can come with us to the evacuation point. There's a helicopter waiting for us there."  Jiang Chen, of course, had no intention of returning to the refugee camp.  Not only had he instigated chaos within the borders of another country, but he had also poked a hole in their map and left behind such a mess.  As long as the Finnish government wasn't foolish, they should be unable to sit still by now.  Without any hesitation, Jiang Chen took Aisha with him on Alpha Special Forces' "convenient flight" and returned to Russian territory.  As if to confirm Jiang Chen's guess, just as he crossed the Russian-Finnish border, the Finnish Defense Forces had already arrived in Paltak.  When national security faced a serious challenge, the Finnish authorities couldn't care less about any humanitarian crisis. Tanks and armored vehicles forcefully entered the refugee camp, and fully armed soldiers quickly took control of the ammunition factory and warehouse, confiscating the weapons of these defeated soldiers.  During the disarmament process, the Finnish Defense Forces did not encounter any resistance.  Or rather, Sami unhesitatingly led the way in throwing away his weapons, obediently got on the prison van, and sat in the corner, spiritlessly muttering the name of the old Ibris, begging for the true God's embrace.  And the expressions of those rioters who had luckily survived were mostly the same as his.  When asked what had happened the night before, the repeated words in their fragmented language were—"Ibris," "demons," "monsters," "slaughter"...  What made the commanders laugh and cry was that these disarmed and surrendered rioters seemed to have been truly terrified. They were desperate to get on the prison van and leave this damned place as soon as possible, with over a thousand people claiming that they had participated in the execution of prisoners.  However, in fact, there were only ten mercenaries executed that night...  "It's really like seeing a ghost! Ibris? What the hell is that!"  Throwing the briefing on the table, Duweo frowned and looked at the map, "How's the situation at the military base?"  "Our helicopters have flown over there, but they couldn't see anything. The entire military base is surrounded by a shit-yellow gas cloud. Concerned about the possibility of toxic substances, our pilots didn't dare fly too close," Duweo's assistant replied.  "Send scouts to have a look, and tell them to wear protective gear."  As soon as Duweo finished speaking, a sergeant walked into the temporary command tent, saluted, and handed a letter to Duweo.  "Sir, an order from the Ministry of Defense."  Raising his eyebrows, Duweo opened the sealed letter. His brows furrowed, and after reading the letter, he rubbed his sore forehead and threw the letter aside.  "The mission is canceled, no need to send scouts."  The assistant looked at his superior in surprise, not understanding what had made him change his mind.  Out of duty, he still reminded his superior, "If we don't confirm the situation inside the base, we can't make any operational plans for rescue."  "No need for plans, no need for rescue. Thanks to those bureaucrats, the reporters got there before us, they have already confirmed that there are no survivors there," Duweo shook his head, tapping the envelope, "This is an order from the Ministry of Defense, no one is to approach within one kilometer of the incident site. Our only task now is to hold this position, cooperate with the police to evacuate the townspeople of Paltak, and then move these refugees to two refugee camps at the Norwegian border."  Pausing for a moment, Duweo frowned and looked outside the tent, muttering, "Let those bureaucrats go to Russia and quibble. If they think that quibbling can solve all problems."  As he complained, a special plane had already taken off from Helsinki's international airport, carrying the Finnish Minister of Defense and the Vice President to Russia's largest city along the Arctic Ocean—Murmansk.  Meanwhile, the Russian Minister of Defense and the Head of the Security Agency also rushed to the location, ready to seek a solution with Finland...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1068: Only Xinghuan Trade Can Save You  The trouble with the Harmony civilization lies in their understanding of biology, which has far surpassed the imaginations of human civilization, which is still in its infancy. While the world's countries are busy exporting ideologies, they have started to spread something more dangerous—their evil genes. Their DNA code is to biology what computer viruses are to computers.  Whether Carmen is dead or alive, Jiang Chen isn't too worried about it now. Even if he's still alive, he's probably only hanging on by a thread. The greatest benefit Harmony civilization can promise him is nothing more than a reservation, similar to what America once promised the Native Americans—a few square kilometers of land for him to survive with a dozen or so natives as a "sample" of human civilization.  Jiang Chen's only relief now is that the power of the Communion is beginning to decline. If Carmen had made contact with the Harmony civilization at the height of his power, half of Europe might have become a breeding ground for the alien species by now. But then again, if he had not been driven to a dead end by the Future People's Group, if the golden apple he once zealously pursued had not become worthless, why would Carmen have gone mad down this path? Jiang Chen doesn't believe Carmen can't see the danger of the Harmony civilization, a civilization that almost has the gene of invasion written in its cell nucleus.  Murmansk, as the largest strategic stronghold on the coast of the Arctic Ocean in Russia, is less than ninety kilometers from the Russian-Finnish border. Realizing the seriousness of the problem, the Finnish Minister of Defense immediately dispatched the defense forces to seal off the scene and went to Russia with the Vice President. The Finnish President had planned to go in person, but diplomatic procedures were not timely, and he had to stabilize the domestic situation. Because the incident occurred very close to the Russian border, it could even cause a citywide evacuation in Murmansk. Russia also paid high attention to this accident, with Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu and the Head of the Security Bureau, Barlt, taking a special plane from Moscow to Murmansk to meet with senior Finnish officials.  In addition to the high-ranking officials from both countries, a foreigner with a special identity also participated in this meeting... or rather, a war council. Facing the high officials of the two countries, Jiang Chen briefly outlined the content of the secret experiments conducted by the Rothschild family collected by Xinghuan Trade and repeatedly emphasized that the unauthorized military operation against northern Finland was for the security of Finland and the whole world. This rhetoric easily won applause from Russian officials, as all these had been arranged by Jiang Chen and Barlt before the meeting.  However, the Finnish officials were not so easily fooled, and the Vice President and the Minister of Defense scoffed at it. Seeing that he had not achieved the expected effect, Jiang Chen stopped and began to talk about the first key point of the meeting—the danger of the X2 bacterium.  "In the center of the military base, the source of infection we call the 'Mother Nest' can produce a special kind of bacterium with spore-like characteristics," Jiang Chen explained.  "Our scientists have named it the X2 bacterium. This bacterium is highly aggressive and can easily infect organisms that lack antibodies to turn them into breeding grounds for themselves. Infected organisms will exhibit stronger aggression and invasive behaviors than before, and their original DNA will be modified to show distinctive enhancements. It's somewhat similar to the principle of Spider-Man and the Hulk."  "So you're saying, in no time, all citizens of Finland will become Spider-Men?" the Finnish Vice President asked sarcastically.  "Er... That's not a concern for now," Jiang Chen said, drawing a circle on the satellite map and pointing with a marker at the circled pine forest. "See those withered pines? Those mutated organisms... let's call them alien species, cannot leave the spore coverage area. Of course, it doesn't exclude them from going out to hunt, or the active range of spores continuing to spread."  Jiang Chen didn't say what he was most worried about—the X2 developing mutations or even an unheard-of X3 bacterium. After all, evolution is what biology does best. The X2 bacterium was defeated by his incendiary grenades, and it's been almost four years since then. It's possible that the Harmony civilization, having learned its lesson, could evolve a new biological weapon.  "Right now, only Xinghuan Trade can save you," Barlt, the Head of the Russian Security Bureau, emphasized.  "It's all because of your situation!" the Finnish Minister of Defense burst out in anger upon hearing this, slamming his fist on the table. "Now you tell us only you can solve it, what do we have to believe you?"  The Russian Security Bureau Head gave a wry smile, pinching his brow and awkwardly shifting his gaze. Jiang Chen also touched his nose awkwardly and coughed lightly, "To correct, I am definitely not the cause of today's situation, it's Carmen. If you hadn't brought in Arrow Company and rented your northern wasteland to them to build refugee camps, would today's situation have happened? You didn't even know they were conducting research on your land, don't you bear some responsibility?"  "What do you plan to do if we leave it to you?" the Finnish Vice President asked Jiang Chen seriously.  "Send out the orbital airborne brigade," Jiang Chen said without hesitation.  "Aren't your only two orbital airborne brigades in Ukraine?" the Finnish Minister of Defense asked, puzzled.  "In fact, we have a secret force that has been training for a long time," Jiang Chen coughed lightly. "I didn't plan to reveal this so early, but the situation is urgent, and we can't care about that much now."  As he said this, Jiang Chen acted as if he was making a great concession. The Finnish Vice President and Minister of Defense exchanged glances, then looked towards Jiang Chen and the Russian officials, finally resting their gaze on Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu's face.  "Sorry, but your sincerity is in doubt. We think NATO can better solve the current problems, at least they won't send bombers flying into our airspace without notice. You were the first to break the rules of the game, so don't blame us for making this tough choice."  The issue of Finland joining NATO has been discussed since the Cold War but has been unresolved. The parliamentary elections have basically set the agenda for joining NATO, but the biggest obstacle is in the final referendum stage, where Finnish citizens are not willing to give up their neutral status. But if NATO solves Finland's troubles, even the most difficult referendum stage will likely not encounter too much resistance.  Once Finland joins NATO, it will mean that Russia suddenly has thousands of kilometers of armed defense lines, not to mention the strategic significance of cities like St. Petersburg and Murmansk behind this line. This situation is what Russia fears the most and is unwilling to see by any means.  "Russia cannot accept NATO troops entering Finland; you have better choices," Sergei Shoigu immediately stood up, saying anxiously, "If you insist on the wrong decision, the situation will only get worse."  "Is this a threat?" the Finnish Vice President asked coldly.  "This is a suggestion," Barlt said in a conciliatory tone. "The Finnish people are facing a threat to their lives; what situation could be worse than now? On behalf of the President, thank you for your suggestion. In fact, two hours ago, our President had already met with the NATO Secretary-General in Helsinki. Goodbye!"  With that, the Finnish senior officials got up and left, while Shoigu wanted to retain them but ultimately froze with an expression on his face.  "Remember to use incendiary grenades. To deal with those bugs, incendiary grenades might be more effective than bullets and insecticides combined," Jiang Chen reminded as a goodwill gesture, "Also, if you must ask NATO to help you with this trouble, make sure they don't use 5.56mm ammunition; chitinous armor has natural resistance to small-caliber bullets, sending more soldiers is just feeding them."  "And if you can't solve it, remember to call me."  The Finnish Vice President waved his hand, whether he heard or not, and left the meeting with the Minister of Defense and other officials without looking back.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1069: Bugs Can Evolve  The conference room was silent. The scheduled agenda had only been half completed when the officials from Finland left early. Sergei Shoigu, who had stood up, could neither sit nor stand comfortably and gave a signal to his secretary, who immediately came forward to help his boss pack up the things on the table. The sounds of chairs moving and papers being organized filled the room. Seeing the minister beginning to pack up to leave, the Russian officials also started to pack up their things and left the long table. The meeting had ended without even reaching half of the expected results.  Standing in front of the satellite map, Jiang Chen tossed the marker pen aside and walked towards the door. He had only brought one person with him when he arrived, so he had nothing to pack. When leaving, he casually called Aisha to help reserve dinner at the front desk. He now just wanted to eat a hot dinner; the last time he had a proper meal was twenty-four hours ago. After spending all of last night outside, following Kutepov on a helicopter to Murmansk, the first thing he did was call the Hilton Hotel to reserve a room. After taking a limo back to the hotel, he went to sleep without even taking off his clothes and slept until the afternoon when the director of the Russian Security Service, Bart, called him to attend a meeting.  It was already seven in the evening. Before the meeting, he had only drunk a tube of fruit-flavored nutritional supplement, and now his stomach was starting to protest. Right as he left the government building, Bart waved at him. However, before Jiang Chen could walk over, Bart quickly approached him, patted his shoulder, and said with a grin, "How about having dinner together? There's a nice restaurant nearby, my treat."  "I've already reserved dinner at the Hilton Hotel. Let me treat you," Jiang Chen said, and then called Aisha again to tell her that the reserved dinner no longer needed to be delivered to the room. They would eat directly in the private room of the restaurant, and to add one more person.  "Alright then," seeing that Jiang Chen had already made reservations, Bart did not decline and took out car keys from his pocket. "Shall we take my car?"  "Then I'll trouble you," Jiang Chen replied with a smile.  Unlike the Defense Minister Sergei, perhaps due to work requirements, Bart did not have a driver and drove himself. Jiang Chen could not recognize the brand of the car Bart was driving, but it seemed to be a Russian-made car. Jiang Chen sat in the passenger seat and buckled his seatbelt. As soon as the car started, Bart's face turned bitter.  "Buddy, you've gotten us into big trouble," Jiang Chen glanced at him, defensively saying, "Why are you like those Finns? When something goes wrong, you throw the problem on my head. If your Alpha Squad had taken out Carmen, there wouldn't be so much trouble! I heard it was only five hundred meters away; you could have taken him out, but instead, you thought about bombing an ammunition depot?"  Bart was stunned for a moment, then frowned and asked, "Can one person really make such a big difference?"  Jiang Chen scoffed and leaned back in his seat to rest with his eyes closed, "You might want to give him a ten-year development opportunity; he might be able to turn all of Russia into that kind of situation."  "What do we do now?" Bart asked.  "Wait," Jiang Chen replied.  "Wait?"  "Wait until NATO stumbles there; they'll naturally think of us," Jiang Chen chuckled.  "Do you think NATO can't handle this trouble? It's just a few bugs," Bart frowned.  In his view, not only NATO, but even if the Russian border guards were sent over, they could easily crush those little bugs. Hearing such naïve statements, Jiang Chen laughed.  "Just bugs?" Holding the steering wheel, Bart was silent for a while.  Just as Jiang Chen was almost falling asleep, Bart spoke, "If I may ask, why are you so sure? Don't get me wrong, I mean no offense... I'm just very curious, you seem to be very familiar with this situation? The same with the T-virus, and now this X2 bacteria."  Years of working in intelligence told Bart that there seemed to be a deep connection between these two seemingly unrelated incidents. Jiang Chen's left eye, which was squinting, opened a crack, and he looked at Bart with surprise. He was just about to make up an excuse and laugh it off when he suddenly remembered the golden apples that flowed out of the factories controlled by Rothschild.  It was also those golden apples that forced him to change his mind on the spot. Maybe now was the time? After pondering for a moment, Jiang Chen suddenly laughed and said, "Yes, I'm indeed very familiar with these things, and I also know how Carmen got them. Do you want to know why?"  "If it's convenient," although Bart did not seem to care much on the surface, Jiang Chen could clearly feel that he was very interested.  "Let's talk about it during dinner; we can discuss this matter slowly." Jiang Chen did not answer but closed his eyes again and returned to a state of rest.  There was still a half-hour drive to the Hilton Hotel. Before being open and honest, he needed to think carefully about how he should phrase his words later.  The revolution was breaking out in Germany, and they were too busy to send troops to support their allies. The American aircraft carriers were too far away, and it seemed unrealistic to move them from the Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea. Moreover, it would provoke the fragile nerves of the Russians. The last to offer help was the United Kingdom, which had already left the EU but had not left NATO. However, the British apparently underestimated the danger of the "Hive" and only sent a mechanized brigade that was quickly deployed to the north of Finland through heavy transport aircraft.  I don't know if they took Jiang Chen's advice, but the Finnish government sent engineers to chop down trees along the "infected area" to create a fifty-meter-wide isolation belt. Then the British Army launched a total of twenty white phosphorus bombs at the "Hive" to sterilize the area physically before entering the infected zone. However, the results were unexpected. The white phosphorus bombs exploded and did indeed produce brilliant sparks, but the flames soon seemed to "freeze" in the air and were extinguished. The spores that had been burned to a crisp floated out of the ground after a while and filled the gap that was lost.  Realizing something was wrong, they extracted some spore suspensions from the infected area for testing and found that these single-celled organisms would rapidly consume themselves in high-temperature environments, secreting a special high-temperature resistant liquid that extinguished the fire by enveloping the burning substance!  Cells with their fire extinguishers! This incredible discovery made the biologists who were invited to test the spores from the infected area exclaim in disbelief. Even with their decades of experience, they couldn't understand what was going on.  This did not surprise Jiang Chen. Bugs can evolve. If they can do something as incredible as interstellar travel, what's a little fire extinguishing?  (To be continued.) Chapter 1070: Let the Professionals Handle It!  White phosphorus bombs, gasoline bombs, these things have all been tried, to no avail, even flamethrowers are ineffective. In addition to incendiary bombs, the British also tried other things. For example, pesticides, insecticides, and even strong acids and alkalis in chemical weapons. These chemical weapons would be absolutely inhumane in normal times, but there's no need to be so particular with a swarm of bugs.  However, regrettably, those bugs were not at all affected by their chemical weapons; there was no reaction when they were thrown in. Besides these, the British also considered deploying larger-scale incendiary bombs, theoretically capable of burning off all the air in the infection zone at once, but the Finnish government was not happy about that. Incendiary bombs on a larger scale would certainly render the more than fifty-meter-wide isolation zone useless, and if a forest fire were to occur as a result, the losses would be severe! This is the Arctic Circle, with its primitive pine forests of the tundra! Every tree is a living fossil!  The Finns were already heartbroken enough by the trees cut down to deploy the incendiary bombs. Moreover, the British could not guarantee that the larger incendiary bombs would not be "frozen" by those strange spores. That weird stuff could even wrap around vaporized gasoline!  If they don't allow it, then so be it. It's a good opportunity to flex our muscles to our future little brothers and make them feel at ease about joining the NATO family. The British Ministry of Defence made a decision, the commander they sent didn't take it seriously, deploying two mechanized platoons, totaling forty "Ajax" armored fighting vehicles leading the way, followed closely by over three hundred infantrymen in protective chemical suits.  The battle plan was simple: it was expected that within ten minutes, all alien species in the infection zone would be cleared, and within twenty minutes, the entrance would be suppressed. Then special forces would be deployed to rappel into the underground bunker to eliminate the source of infection.  The soldiers in protective suits were not at all aware of the danger of their mission; instead, they joked in front of the interviewing media reporters that if the hive had appeared in London, they wouldn't need to lift a finger, as the firefighters could probably have handled it.  The appearance of the hive had attracted attention worldwide, and of course, this interview was also broadcast globally. In the same conference room as yesterday, the satellite map on the big screen had been replaced by a live interview with British soldiers about to carry out their mission in the Paltak region by a Russian TV station reporter.  Originally, Jiang Chen didn't want to watch the news with these old Russians because he had already roughly guessed what the outcome would be. However, since the Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu had personally invited him, he couldn't refuse and made the trip.  Honestly, sitting there quietly watching the news with a group of big shots felt a bit odd.  "Are you sure they can't handle it?" Sergei looked to Jiang Chen, asking incredulously, "I don't mean to take pleasure in other people's misfortune, but this is very important for Russia's national defense strategy. If the British succeed, we will gain a defense line of thousands of kilometers."  "Just wait and see." Leaning back in his chair, Jiang Chen glanced at the screen at the British soldier full of confidence, and smirked.  London firefighters? Even if you send over the urban management officers from the Celestial Empire, Japanese high school students, and American homeless people, it would be useless!  As the military set off, the TV picture moved; the reporter gave a side shot of the forty armored vehicles hitting the road, and then quickly switched the scene from the ground to the air.  The helicopter followed the mechanized force from a distance, watching as they charged into the infection zone obscured by the murky spore clouds.  Confident in their "pest control" plan, the British military commander, with permission from the Ministry of Defence, exceptionally opened up part of the non-sensitive combat communications to the reporters to demonstrate NATO's combat capability. However, as for the combat footage, it would not be made public due to military secrecy.  "This is 12th Platoon, we have reached the target area, no abnormal situation detected so far." "Alien species sighted. Safety off, free to fire."  Intense gunfire and the roar of alien species lasted for a full two minutes. Sitting in front of the screen, the Russian officials, especially the Russian Minister of Defence, gradually showed more interesting expressions on their faces. They were all high-ranking military officials, and just by listening to the sound, they knew the situation of the British was probably not optimistic.  "...... We are engaging with the aliens! There are too many of them, but our firepower is superior—"  "Shit! They move so fast! Fuck! Infantry, fall back! I repeat, infantry, fall back! Charlie, are you crazy, get your people back——zzzz——"  The communication was abruptly cut off. Clearly, the British commander had realized that the content that followed was no longer suitable for media broadcast.  The only thing left to depict the severity of the war for the people sitting in the conference room was the flashing lights within the murky clouds on the screen.  Silence fell upon the conference room, the Russian military hierarchy looked at each other. No one expected such a result; no one thought that a mechanized force would be defeated by a group of mutant creatures... except for one person.  That was Jiang Chen.  If they overlooked their anti-armor capabilities just because they were bugs, he was not surprised at all that the British would suffer at their hands.  Now, he was merely curious about how many of these armored vehicles could retreat intact.  As for the infantry, there was no need to even think about it; at this point, their bones had probably been gnawed over.  "There has been a slight accident in the hive cleaning work. Now, we will broadcast a brief message...... " On the screen, the reporter said with a slightly awkward expression.  Even the picture was gone.  At this moment, Jiang Chen's wristwatch vibrated.  "I'll step outside to take a call." Saying this quietly to Sergei sitting next to him, Jiang Chen got up and walked out of the conference room.  The call was from the Finnish Presidential Palace. Don't ask how he knew; there was no need to guess.  Stepping outside the conference room, Jiang Chen went to the window in the hallway, opened the holographic screen, and pressed the answer button.  The call connected, but there was no immediate speech from the other side. After a two-second silence and a somewhat awkward atmosphere, the other side finally opened their mouth with a bit of embarrassment.  "...... Uh, the British are giving up."  As expected, regular armies are not mercenaries; in peacetime, every life is precious. Having lost a battalion inexplicably in the infection zone without even reaching the entrance to the underground bunker, the British public is probably already in an uproar.  "Oh."  "The Americans have indicated that they want to observe for a while, but the coverage area of the spores is spreading, and now even the fifty-meter-wide isolation zone has been covered."  Hearing the Finnish President's words, Jiang Chen revealed an expression of "as expected." The corpses of the killed British soldiers provided an easy-to-absorb organic matter for the hive, including human bodies, which are easier to use as a breeding ground for spores than wood and insects.  Just by swallowing up an estimated battalion's worth of troops, the hive couldn't wait to expand the coverage area of the spores. Judging from this point alone, the hive truly had the style of Carmen.  His guess was confirmed, and Jiang Chen's confidence in resolving this trouble increased a bit. But at this moment, he was not in a hurry to speak. Clearly, the other side was using a tone of asking for help. If he gave in so quickly, it would be too cheap for them!  "Uh-huh."  Adjusting his tone, Jiang Chen said indifferently, "Just speak directly about what you want to say."  "That... how about you guys take over?" inquired the Finnish President in a conciliatory tone.  Pretending to hesitate, Jiang Chen pondered for a moment before speaking slowly.  "The area of the infection zone has expanded quite a bit, and even the British mechanized brigade can't do anything about it; it might be a bit difficult. Why don't you try carpet bombing? Although those spores can block combustion, it doesn't make sense that they could also withstand high-explosive bombs, right?"  "We've tried that already, it's useless. The spores we cleared couldn't keep up with the rate they were secreted, and it blew the spores even further away," said the Finnish President with a wry smile. "Let's not beat around the bush, you're a businessman, so name your price."  A smile crept up on the corner of Jiang Chen's mouth as he spoke in a pleasant tone.  "300 million New Dollars."  Hearing this figure, the Finnish President's eyebrows twitched violently.  "......Can it be cheaper?"  The exchange rate for New Dollars is not low right now, and the Euro has recently depreciated. Unless he throws the entire Finnish military's annual procurement budget into it, which is obviously impossible.  "If you can't afford the payment, we can consider another payment method. For example, selling the assets of Arrow Company in Finland as a package to us. Of course, after an incident like this, we can only value their assets at 300 million New Dollars. Believe me, this is already a very conscientious price, much higher than what the banks would estimate."  At this point, Jiang Chen smiled wickedly in his heart. Although Arrow Company was an old adversary, the mercenaries who worked for money had no grudge with him. After this incident, Arrow Company would surely go bankrupt due to the heavy fines imposed by the Finnish government.  If the Arrow Company registered in Finland was acquired, more than twenty thousand experienced veterans would be a considerable asset for Star Ring Trade. Just pull them into a training camp for some integration, slightly improve the benefits and treatment, and these people would soon start working for their new boss.  The management could be completely dissolved if there were concerns about trust, filter the rank-and-file soldiers for reassignment, and sell the weapons and equipment in a package to Africa.  As for the remaining two refugee camps, these could be temporarily kept. As long as they are used properly, they can completely serve as a bargaining chip for negotiations with the European Union.  As for the two military bases that come with the refugee camps, he also had great use for them.  The Finnish President reluctantly nodded.  "Deal."  Jiang Chen smiled and nodded.  "Then, a pleasant cooperation."  "When can your people arrive? If it's ten days or half a month, we probably can't wait that long..."  "It won't take that long," Jiang Chen looked at the time on the holographic screen, "Just give me five hours. Also, inform the British military, tell them they can pack up and go home, let the professionals handle it." Chapter 1071: The Nest  The break with a diameter of tens of meters looked like a giant pit, located in the center of the military base. Below this pit, at a depth of about five hundred meters, was an underground shelter designed by the Rothschild Group for experimental purposes. At this moment, this underground shelter was devoid of any signs of living humans, completely covered by a suspicious blood-red fleshy blister, emitting an inexplicably foul stench.  If one could suppress the nausea and take a closer look, one would find that the surface of the fleshy blister was covered with densely packed pustules the size of sesame seeds. Whenever a pustule burst, spore gas would be released. With the efforts of these thousands of fleshy blisters, countless spores were born every moment and drifted up to the surface through the entrance, contributing to the expansion of the nest's domain.  In the center of the underground research facility, there was a mountain of flesh that resembled the roots of a giant tree, pulsating with fat fleshy blisters. As the heart of the nest, it was both the heart of the nest and its "central processor." The tendrils that spread from its base and crown were like data cables connecting the mainframe to the sub-machines.  In its belly, there was a coffin carved out of resin material, or rather, a "cultivation chamber." Unlike the flesh-red nest, this black cultivation chamber appeared to have a hard texture. Through the palm-sized translucent membrane, one could vaguely see a person lying inside. His eyes were open, fixated on the row of numbers on the translucent membrane.  【14731】  Four thousand of those were refugees and new soldiers that he had brought underground. More than three thousand were from his personal guard brigade and the underground research facility's researchers. The bulk of the seven thousand came from mercenaries and rioters who contributed in the chaos within the base, and the British had also contributed about six to seven hundred people just now.  Each person could contribute two units of organic matter, and he had already spent half of the organic matter on strengthening the nest and hatching alien species.  "Still not enough."  Lying in the cultivation tank, Carmen shook his head, beginning to reflect on whether his recent show-off had been a bit too much. If he had not wiped them out so decisively in one go, perhaps he could have given the British the illusion of "just about to win," tempting them to send more people into this pit, providing him with more organic matter to strengthen his power.  However, now, the British seemed to be much more cautious. Apart from continuously bombarding the area, they no longer sent people in.  Upgrading to a level two nest required five hundred thousand units of organic matter. There were two sources of organic matter: one was the most primitive photosynthesis, which would slowly increase just with time. The other was the fastest and most straightforward method, which was to keep eating.  By devouring living creatures and digesting their flesh, he could grow stronger. Carmen naturally preferred the latter method. If he relied only on photosynthesis to obtain organic matter from the soil and air, it would take centuries for the nest's domain to expand across the whole world.  But by relying on constant devouring, he could complete in just a few days what would take centuries to evolve. Thinking this, a hint of resentment flashed across Carmen's face. He had chosen this place as the nest because of the refugee camp next to the military base with a population close to five hundred thousand. If he devoured the population of the refugee camp and then ate the nearby Partak town, he would have already completed the first stage of evolution!  A level two nest would possess more terrifying energy. Not only would the hunting range of the alien species be extended to a hundred kilometers, but he would also unlock new "troop types." For example, a monster called the Flesh Mountain, which was said to be able to withstand tank shell fire with its fat alone.  However, his plan was completely ruined by the sudden appearance of Jiang Chen. Thinking of this, his teeth clenched tightly together, making a grinding noise.  Spores were his eyes and ears; he could clearly sense everything that happened within the spore-covered domain. He was sure that he had "seen" Jiang Chen in the military base that night, but unfortunately, he had not been able to keep him.  【Prompt, host, you are still far from the organic matter storage capacity of five hundred thousand. It is recommended to upgrade your troop types to transition through the early stages.】  An idea directly appeared in his mind, a suggestion from the nest. There was no need to use cumbersome vocal cords to speak, and there were no barriers in language and expression abilities; direct mind connection communication was incredibly convenient for Carmen.  This was also one of the reasons why, after seeing the greatness of biological civilization through the Golden Apple, he admired it so much.  【Upgrade troop types? You have a point.】Carmen replied with his thoughts, simultaneously closing his eyes to connect his consciousness with the nest's control center.  A simplified upgrade list appeared in front of him, and after careful selection, he allocated five thousand units of organic matter to strengthen the wings of the "Blade Warrior." The Blade Warrior, a name he had given to the mantis-like alien species, would have longer and more powerful wings after the enhancement, no longer serving merely as an aid to enhance jumping ability but as wings capable of short-distance flight.  As Carmen finished allocating the organic matter, indescribable fluids surged through the pipes towards the pile of eggs in front of the nest. With the input of organic matter, the eggs began to mutate, and so did the new "Blade Warriors" about to emerge from the eggs. These eggs were the incubators for hatching alien species, which to him were like "barracks."  At that moment, a violent tremor came from the ceiling. Carmen slightly lifted his eyelids, revealing a cold smirk. The soil above the shelter had been reinforced by the nest; fiber-like roots had woven a "bulletproof vest" in the soil, five hundred meters thick, with blast and earthquake resistance comparable to reinforced concrete.  The British army had dropped at least a hundred shells on his head, only scraping off a layer of cement surface. The reason the space-based weapons could blast open the entrance was merely because the nest was newly formed, and he had not yet had time to reinforce the entrance... Suddenly, his expression changed drastically, and at the same time, the consciousness of the nest also timely appeared in his mind.  【Warning, the protective layer has been impacted by external forces, part of the organizational structure has fractured, please host use organic matter for timely repairs.】  "Damn! It's the space-based weapons of Star Ring Trade!" Carmen cursed silently, realizing he had underestimated the power of Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons.  He had originally thought that a few tungsten core projectiles would at most scrape off a layer of the protective layer of the nest, but now it seemed to be more than just a layer. The damage to the protective layer required him to use organic matter for repairs, which, considering his already limited supply of organic matter, was a severe blow!  The amount of organic matter was being consumed visibly fast, and as Carmen frantically allocated organic matter to fill the gaps, a series of devastating breaking sounds came from above him.  Realizing what had happened, Carmen's face changed dramatically, and his facial muscles twisted violently.  "Fuck!"  (To be continued.) Chapter 1072: Force Breakthrough  Over forty armored vehicles entered the infection zone with impressive might. Just when everyone thought this would be a one-sided military show by the UK, the situation took a dramatic turn within a minute. No one knew how intense the firefight inside the infection zone was, but almost the entire world saw the outcome. Of the forty armored vehicles, only five returned, and all the infantry were left behind.  The long guns and cannons were at a disadvantage against a swarm of bugs, and Colonel Moston could hardly accept such an outcome. Not only could he not accept it, but the onlookers watching the disaster unfold on their cellphones were equally unable to accept this reality.  From Cagayan City to Tokyo, the term "biohazard" hammered away at the fragile nerves of people worldwide. A concept thought to exist only in literature and film was now brought into reality, easily garnering global attention and panic.  On social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Weibo, discussions about the X2 bacterium were incredibly heated.  "Last time it was the T-virus, this time it's the X2 bacterium? God, have those capitalists gone mad? How could researching such things benefit them? There should be laws to ban these dangerous studies!"  "Unbelievable, were those really British forces that went in? Are British armored vehicles made of paper? They're just mutants; why not just crush them with tank tracks? Can their teeth even bite through armor?"  "Survival manual for the apocalypse, learn from a ten-year doomsday enthusiast how to survive in the apocalypse, limited quantities, buy now while supplies last."  "Send in peacekeeping forces. This isn't a problem for just one country; it's a worldwide problem..."  "Now I'm really curious, does every Arrowhead Company military base have such a research facility?"  "..."  Colonel Moston couldn't see the situation on social media platforms for the moment. He was currently fretting over how to explain this disastrous defeat to the Ministry of Defence and Parliament.  An entire mechanized battalion had fallen without a fight! God, the Prime Minister was counting on him to settle this matter gracefully and bring Finland into NATO's family. But now, his face was ashen, and he lacked the courage to even devise a battle plan, let alone send more troops in.  Not to mention a brigade's mechanized force, even a division wouldn't be enough!  The Finnish government was desperate and half-threateningly stated that if they couldn't handle the nest's trouble, they would contact Star Ring Trade for a solution.  Moston scoffed at the Finnish government's statement because this was not a matter of combat power. Even armored vehicles could have holes melted in them by acid; could Star Ring Trade's mechanical exoskeletons be tougher than armored vehicles?  It was better to wait for scientists to thoroughly research what exactly the X2 bacterium was. Moston had a premonition that as long as they could develop something that could kill those spore clusters, the mutants would die off on their own.  "I admit that we underestimated the strength of the nest, and it was a mistake to rashly send troops into the infection zone," Moston explained to the media with a forced face. "The research team from London is studying the DNA structure of these spores, and I believe it won't be long before we can design a method to deactivate the X2 bacterium."  A reporter asked, "Colonel Moston, does this mean the UK will abandon military aid to Finland?"  "NATO will definitely not give up on any friendly partner, but this is no longer a problem that the UK can solve alone."  "..."  "God... Look! What is that!"  While Colonel Moston was busy explaining to the media, a cry of surprise suddenly came from the crowd around him. A female reporter looked up at the sky with a shocked expression, pointing in the direction of the infection zone.  "Fireballs" were falling from the sky. Even though several kilometers away, the sound of breaking the sound barrier was still clearly audible.  The cameras that had been pointed at Colonel Moston all turned toward that patch of sky. Almost simultaneously, an earth-shattering tremor spread from the feet of everyone present, shaking their eyes and hearts alike.  Unsurprisingly, this was the first time Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons appeared before the media's cameras.  Moston was relieved the cameras had shifted away. He was well aware that his facial expression at the moment must have been quite a sight.  ...  A hundred kilometers away in the presidential suite of the Hilton Hotel in Murmansk, Jiang Chen sat on the sofa with his leg crossed, looking down through the holographic screen, remotely commanding the battle between Star Ring Trade and the mutants.  The space-based weapons temporarily dispersed the spore clusters that shrouded the military base's exterior. After a round of bombardment, taking advantage of the brief gap, Jiang Chen saw the shattered ground through the satellite map on the holographic screen.  "Eh? It didn't collapse?"  Staring at the holographic screen, Jiang Chen exclaimed in surprise. Logically, even if the underground bunker was over five hundred meters deep, it should not have withstood the impact of the tungsten core projectiles. These tungsten spheres had fallen from geosynchronous orbit, and even if those five hundred meters were made of reinforced concrete, it should have turned into cement dust by now.  There was indeed something strange about this nest.  Jiang Chen's eyes flickered slightly as he gave Ivan the order.  "Keep bombing! If the first round doesn't work, launch the second round! Bomb until its true form is revealed!"  The mutants had strong regenerative abilities. Minor injuries only required a few breaths of spore-filled air to heal at a visible rate. Although the British military had bombed the military base multiple times, they hadn't truly killed many mutants. For humans, losing limbs might be fatal, but for these organized mutants, it was just a matter of lying in the nest for a while to recover. Even if they were blown up on the spot, dragging the bodies back for recycling into organic matter would allow new mutants to be hatched soon after. Moreover, most mutants were hiding underground.  Jiang Chen's battle plan was simple and brutal: fatigue tactics using space-based weapons to relentlessly bomb! As long as they could breach the defense, if one punch didn't kill, another punch would follow until the nest revealed its true form! The tungsten core projectiles weren't aimed at the mutants but at destroying the underground bunker. All the attacks were concentrated within a ten-meter diameter circle. No matter how strong the nest's recovery ability was, Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons were not to be underestimated. In terms of vertical penetration power, no country on this planet could catch up with them!  Jiang Chen didn't know that his straightforward and brutal plan was causing Carmen, hiding underground, to complain endlessly.  The first round, the second round... Rounds of tungsten core projectiles fell from geosynchronous orbit. Jiang Chen was burning money, while Carmen was burning organic matter. Both sides were bleeding internally, but clearly, Carmen, with limited resources, was more distressed.  Soon, the nest couldn't hold on any longer. How did Jiang Chen know? It was evident from the satellite imagery. As the dust settled, the soil layer was completely stripped away, revealing the tangled and intricate roots below. Undoubtedly, these sturdy roots were the reason for the underground bunker's solidity; the soil had the defensive power of concrete due to their reinforcement.  The nest released spore gas in vain, trying to cover its weakness, but Jiang Chen didn't miss this opportunity, ordering Ivan to pursue the victory. The strikes from geosynchronous orbit continued to fall, and when the electric ray C-1 in geosynchronous orbit dropped the last tungsten core projectile, the covering tentacles above the underground bunker also broke in response. The nest, with its defenses completely collapsed, revealed the flesh bubbles hiding in the underground bunker.  Seeing this, Jiang Chen knew the opportunity had arrived, immediately instructing Ivan.  "The nest has exposed its body; cease orbital weapon attacks. Transmit my orders, the Third Powered Armored Brigade, begin airborne operations!"  "Yes!" Ivan responded resoundingly.  The waterfall-like orbital strike ended—it had been a full fifteen minutes since it started. The journalists, soldiers, and townspeople standing near the town of Partak were still frozen in their stunned postures, looking up at the clear sky at a forty-five-degree angle.  Colonel Moston opened and closed his mouth without being able to utter a word. The Finnish Minister of Defense standing beside him had a dark face, full of regret for not asking Star Ring Trade to handle the situation from the start.  As for the journalists, they were already contemplating how to narrate this devastating "aerial bombardment" with eloquent words.  Everyone had not yet recovered from their astonishment. Just when everyone thought everything was over, rows of lights began to fall from the clear sky to the ground...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1073: Steel and Blood  For the onlookers standing in front of the Paltak town, it was only a blink of an eye before the roar of steel colliding with the earth came from several kilometers away. The executives of the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation quickly gave a cue to the reporters, and not long after, the broadcast helicopter took off again, heading towards the direction of the military base.  Not only were the media reporters interested in the orbital airborne brigade of Star Ring Trade, but even the British and Finnish military also dispatched two helicopters. Officially, it was to provide support to Star Ring Trade when necessary, but the real reason was understood by everyone without needing to be said.  Through satellite imagery, Jiang Chen saw all the little actions of Finland and the United Kingdom, but he did not take it to heart. Since he had brought out the powered armor, he did not intend to keep it a secret anymore. This "micro brigade" with only two hundred people had been in the works for two years. The reason for keeping it under wraps until now was partly because the surrounding small fry lacked combat strength, and it was not worth showing off the powered armor to flex muscles. It was better to keep it hidden as a trump card.  On the other hand, there was concern about sparking an arms race in the region, which would affect his grand plan for economic development. Now that he had brought it out, it was because the two concerns mentioned earlier no longer existed. As for why, that would be discussed after the end of the war.  Fifty drop pods fell one after another, and before the dust from the explosions had dispersed, two hundred fully armed T3 type powered armors, carrying tactical rifles, rushed out from the opened drop pods and stepped onto the battlefield covered in spores, gathering around the breach blasted by the space-based weapons.  Feeling the intrusion of uninvited guests, a piercing scream floated out from the deep pit. One after another, the "Blade Warriors" trembled their wings behind them, leaping out of the abyss. When the bombardment came, these aliens hid underground, but now, sensing the breath of living beings, they could no longer contain their bloodthirsty desire, eager to use their sharp claws to tear open the chests of their prey.  However, their plans were doomed to fail, as the opponents they faced this time were simply not on the same level as the previous weaklings.  With a roar, a Blade Warrior moved. Its bow-shaped legs sprang open, and the strengthened wings on its back powered up in an instant, with two serrated scimitars crossing like scissors, aiming to cut the nearest powered armor. If this blow landed, even steel would be torn open!  But at that moment, a transparent shield unfolded from the left arm of the powered armor. The Blade Warrior collided with the shield and failed to budge the powered armor, instead shattering its own double-edged blades made of keratin material. Its spindle-shaped beak opened and closed sharply, emitting a piercing scream.  The Blade Warrior protected its head with its arms and backed away, but before it could retreat two steps, the powered armor struck its defense with the shield and then grasped a tactical dagger with its right hand, stabbing it fiercely through the Blade Warrior's chest, and then tore downwards, splitting its intestines in two.  The clash happened in an instant. Carmen, lying in the hibernation pod, was dumbfounded. He had never seen such an incredible piece of iron, which reminded him of rumors about the Iron Man of Koro Island long ago. In fact, ever since the Los Angeles attack incident, there were rumors that Star Ring Trade had created a "steel suit of armor." There were even more unreliable rumors that Jiang Chen himself was the "Iron Man" who had appeared in Koro City, and his image greatly resembled the heir of Stark Industries.  Thinking of this, cold sweat involuntarily broke out on Carmen's forehead. Although he did not completely dismiss the rumors, he never imagined that Jiang Chen would not only create such a "steel suit of armor" for himself but also equip a whole army with such expensive gear.  Shocked as he was, he no longer had any other options to hesitate. The size of this force was not large, presumably, it was Star Ring Trade's ace, and an ace would surely be limited in number! As long as he could survive the initial development phase, the entire forest would be integrated into his hive mind.  To hurt Star Ring Trade, he would fill the gap with a sea of insects, and he had to keep this ace here at all costs—even if it meant paying a hefty price.  With determination, Carmen gritted his teeth and connected his consciousness with the hive mind. At almost the same time, the red blood vessels in the hive writhed like drilling mice, the meat blisters hiding in the shadows swelled violently, and pus blisters the size of sesame seeds swelled to the size of mung beans, then burst open, releasing spores containing a raging factor.  All the dark green eyes turned blood red in an instant.  With a roar tinged with brutality, all the Blade Warriors fell into a frenzy and threw themselves at the two hundred powered armors in a swarm. However, before they could get close, they ran into an oncoming barrage of fire.  In Jiang Chen's hands, the T3 type powered armors transported to the modern world had undergone functional differentiation to adapt to the modern battlefield. The most obvious difference was that the right arm was no longer uniformly equipped with a revolving machine gun but designed with various mountable accessories such as grenade launchers, foldable shields, and plasma cutters, based on battlefield needs.  The front row of powered armors knelt on one knee, placing a man-high shield in front, with the right arm emitting a faint blue arc of light. The powered armors in the back stepped forward, mounting the triangular-shaped gun barrels on their right arms, unleashing a barrage of fierce fire. There were also powered armors anchored to the ground with 72mm anti-vehicle cannons, tearing apart the alien formation with high-explosive shells.  In terms of firepower alone, this brigade of two hundred powered armors was already more than twice as strong as the nearly thousand-strong mechanized forces of the British army. Considering mobility, protection, and other comprehensive combat capabilities, Jiang Chen could say without exaggeration that, without using aerial strikes or other external support fire, these two hundred people could easily defeat a NATO infantry division.  The Blade Warriors at the front were shredded by the barrage, and those who got close were cut in two by the plasma cutters protruding from behind the shields. The keratin armor was invincible against bullets, but against the high-temperature plasma stream, it was as fragile as tofu.  Green blood splattered on the battlefield, mixed with the acid from the spitters. Carmen was determined to fight Star Ring Trade to the death and would not back down here. At this critical moment of life and death, he could no longer care about frugality; all organic matter was taken out, transformed into Blade Warriors and spitters, then pushed to the front lines.  The only advantage of the swarm was its fearlessness in the face of death. Under the interference of the hive will, even if it fought to the last alien, it would rush towards the muzzle without hesitation.  As the battle intensified, the distance between the two sides was quickly shortened to the extreme, turning from one-sided firepower suppression to close-range melee combat.  The powered armors were strong but not invincible, and casualties began to appear in the melee. Seeing this, a trace of joy appeared on Carmen's face. Following this trend, it would be Star Ring Trade that could not hold on first.  With this thought, he eagerly pressed all the organic matter forward. However, just at this moment, Carmen's mood plummeted from the peak to the valley, and his eager face gradually took on a layer of despair.  Through the eyes of a Blade Warrior, he saw a series of flashes in the sky. Star Ring Trade's second round of airdrops had begun. This time the drop was not people, but unmanned drone hives.  Before the airdrop began, the powered armors engaged with the aliens maintained their firing stance and retreated in an orderly manner, leaving enough battlefield space for the aliens crawling out of the deep pits. When they had almost retreated to the corner of the military base, several unmanned drone hives smashed into the rear of the alien army.  Thousands of drones swarmed out, rushing towards the wounds in the hive caused by the space-based weapons. When Carmen realized what was happening, it was already too late. The aliens underground had been mostly sent to the surface, leaving only those just emerging from the eggs in the underground shelters.  Although the number was still considerable, it was no longer enough to intercept the drones rushing in like a tide. Without engaging the aliens, these drones, without even firing a shot, ignored the aliens' attacks and pounced towards the bursting insect eggs.  Carmen's face turned green.  "Fuck!" Far away, a hundred kilometers from there, Jiang Chen suddenly sat up straight from the sofa, his fist slamming down hard on the coffee table.  "Blow it up!"  (To be continued.) Chapter 1074: A Swift End  The unmanned drone rushing toward the bug eggs suddenly exploded, covering row after row of wriggling eggs in a blaze, instantly blasting them into smithereens. The crimson and dark green blood plasma mixed together, splattering from the ruptured flesh bubbles, and along with chunks of flesh, were roasted into char under the high temperature.  Some of this blood belonged to the hive, and some to the yet unformed alien embryos.  Carmen, lying in the incubator, felt a chill from his head to his feet... if he could still feel the cold now. A sense of utter defeat surged in his heart. It felt as if you were on a high from a winning streak in an explosive battle, only to have your barracks destroyed by the enemy.  [Warning, large-scale damage to the hatching area, please repair immediately.]  The consciousness of the hive echoed in his mind, and Carmen quickly looked at the reserves of organic matter. However, this glance was startling; the glaring three-digit number caused his face to lose its last trace of color. Just now, he had allocated all the resources to the eggs for the incubation of Blade Warriors.  However, with the suicide attack by this group of drones taking advantage of a gap, he had lost a significant portion of his organic matter. It was possible to digest the remains on the ground, but to convert them into organic matter would take time, depending on the form of carbon present and the efficiency of the spores' photosynthesis.  Carmen was not clear on how long it would take, but several hours were certain. But would Star Ring Trade give him this time?  The speed of the exploding soldiers stopped, and the alien attack lost its momentum. The power armor brigade that had stabilized its position in the corner of the base began to counterattack under the command of the headquarters, striking at the faltering aliens!  On one side, the spitters were shredded by the barrage of fire, and on the other, Blade Warriors were sliced open by plasma cutting daggers, their corrosive dark green blood flying wildly, even washing away the paint on the power armors.  Thousands of aliens might look numerous, but without reinforcements, their annihilation was only a matter of time.  The clash of flesh and steel, the first confrontation between the harmonic civilization and the pure civilization, settled as the smoke and dust dispersed.  As the dust settled, no more aliens crawled out of the pit.  At the front of the troops, a power armor knelt on one knee, retracted its shield, supported itself on the ground with one hand, and slowly stood up.  "Shit, is it over?"  "It's finally over..." another soldier, shaking off the slime from his arm, answered in a muffled voice.  The battle was over, but no one took off their masks to breathe. High-density spore clusters still floated outside, which were quite dangerous even for those who had been injected with gene drugs.  Some stood waiting for orders, while others simply sat on the ground, not caring about the disgusting corpses of the aliens.  There was no cheering, only the relief of surviving disaster.  A total of forty T3 power armors were scrapped on the battlefield, and more than thirty people were killed in action. For the newly formed power armor brigade, this was a heavy loss, but relative to the results achieved, it was undoubtedly epic.  Nearly ten thousand aliens died under their barrage of fire. It's no exaggeration to say that even if a division from NATO was thrown into the fight, they probably couldn't have achieved such a bountiful result; the enemy numbers might even have increased the more they fought.  Walking to the front of the troops, the brigade commander glanced at his brothers. "Alright, guys, the mission isn't over yet. Let's go down and finish off this bug for good. Let me see..."  Saying this, he tapped a few times on the touchpad on his arm, controlling a reconnaissance drone to fly down into the deep pit. Before the drone was destroyed by the aliens, he saw the situation below and then said, "About thirty left. Who still has the strength to accompany me down there?"  A soldier stood up from the ground, supporting his rifle, and raised his hand. "I'll go, I can still move."  "Count me in."  The commander picked eleven people from the troops, leading this small team to the edge of the deep pit and jumped down with the vortex engine on their backs.  The twelve power armors landed, and the lurking Blade Warriors immediately pounced, ready for a desperate struggle.  The commander, with an unchanged expression, lifted his arm and casually caught the neck of one of the aliens, pulled out a pistol with his other hand, pressed it against its forehead, pulled the trigger, and then tossed the limp body aside.  The remaining dozen or so aliens, still at a distance, were shot into sieves by the rifles of the soldiers behind before they could even pounce.  Stepping over the bodies of the aliens, the soldiers clad in power armors reached the core of the hive. Here they saw the bug eggs blasted into a mess, along with the dark green and crimson fluids all over the ground.  "Shit, this thing is really disgusting."  "Finish it quickly, and we can get out of here."  Sappers took out blasting tools from behind and distributed thermite to the soldiers' hands, "The red end goes inside, drill it in deep."  Spores could extinguish fire, but the hive itself didn't have this feature. As long as the burning part was all stuffed into the core of the hive, it could effectively prevent the burning from being affected by the spore gas.  Watching everything that the Star Ring Trade soldiers were doing, panic emerged on Carmen's face.  When thermite was nailed onto the body of the hive, with eyes bloodshot, he roared, "No——!"  The soldier closest to him glanced at Carmen, smiled behind his mask, shook the thermite in his hand at Carmen, and then fiercely stabbed it into the core of the hive.  Brilliant flames leaked from the cracks, but most were sprayed inside. Under the scorching high temperatures, the core of the hive disintegrated at a visible rate.  Watching this scene, Carmen's heart bled. For this hive, he had sacrificed the researchers of the entire institute, his loyal guards, even his confidants.  Now, however, the people of Star Ring Trade were destroying it all right before his eyes.  Hatred, rage, fear... A mix of negative emotions blended together, his face twisted beyond recognition.  At that moment, the commander walked up to him, tapped on the resin material of the incubator with his finger, signaling Carmen to look this way.  Then, he took out a future phone from his waist, flattened it, and pasted it on the membrane of the incubator.  "We meet again."  Sitting in the presidential suite of the Hilton Hotel, Jiang Chen looked at Carmen lying in the incubator and smiled, "I didn't expect to meet in this way; it's really ironic."  Staring at Jiang Chen on the phone screen with bloodshot eyes, Carmen asked, "Are you here to laugh at me?"  "Yes and no."  Jiang Chen shook his head, looking at the fierce-faced Carmen in the incubator. He could no longer see any of the elegance and composure of an old noble, his tone carrying a bit of pity, "I'm just curious what made my opponent become like this."  Carmen didn't respond; his mind was already dominated by hatred.  At this moment, Jiang Chen noticed the black sphere above his head.  "The Golden Apple?"  His brows slightly furrowed, he vaguely recalled something from his encounters with the Rothschild family history. Members of their family seemed to be innately susceptible to the influence of Crey particles, able to sense external connections vaguely without the aid of objects, a capacity perhaps even Tanaka did not possess.  The universe is filled with chaotic Crey particle waves, just like electromagnetic waves. Carmen not only belonged to the type naturally sensitive to Crey particles but was also obsessed with the Golden Apple, even keeping this "Crey particle wave amplifier" by his bedside when he slept.  It was like placing a magnet on top of a TV set; it wouldn't take long for the TV to start showing distorted colors. To put it bluntly, he had gone mad.  Having analyzed this, Jiang Chen suddenly lost interest. The words he had intended to say to Carmen now seemed pointless. He sighed, turned off the communication window with Carmen, and ordered the commander.  "Give him a swift end."  "Yes."  The dark muzzle of the gun was pressed against the membrane of the incubator, and Carmen, stunned, looked at the gun pointed at his head.  Bang——!  The gunshot sounded, and without even a chance to cry out, his consciousness plunged into the abyss.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1075: The Pentagon's Concerns  The battle was not only watched by the British and Finns on the scene but also closely monitored by the United States from across the Atlantic. When the Star Ring Trade played the card of space-based weapons, everyone's face turned ashen. As the power armored brigade and unmanned aerial vehicle airdrop tactics emerged, the atmosphere in the Pentagon's meeting room dropped to an all-time low.  Though the footage captured by the British was not clear, those watching through the screens could still feel the terror of the surging alien species and how formidable the power armor was in holding off the alien onslaught. If the K1 exoskeleton could be compared to a bicycle, then the power armor was undoubtedly akin to a motorcycle. It not only provided soldiers with highly mobile armor but also served as a firepower support point, pushing individual combat capabilities to the limit.  Despite standing on the side of humanity, the last thing the U.S. Secretary of Defense wished to see was Star Ring Trade ultimately defeating the alien species. It would be preferable, as in a Hollywood script, for both the British and the citizens of the new country to fall before the aliens, with the U.S. Marine Corps stepping in as the savior to fight a war to save all of humanity.  The Secretary of Defense, Ashton Carter, kept praying that the swarm of insects would overwhelm the two hundred "humanoid armored vehicles," but reality did not comply with his wishes. The moment the drone swarm entered the alien nest, the fate of the alien species was sealed.  When the last Blade Warrior had its head severed by a plasma-cutting dagger, the meeting room fell silent. "These hypocrites, they go back on their word! They said there were only two orbital airborne brigades, and now how come there's another one?" a senior Pentagon official broke the silence and cursed.  Secretary Carter glanced at the officer and shook his head. Did you really believe them when they said there were only two orbital airborne brigades? The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has much more equipment that hasn't been disclosed. Blaming the intelligence work for not getting the news beforehand is inevitable. However, the Ghost Agent's domestic counterintelligence capability is simply too strong.  Long ago, the CIA tried to infiltrate Star Ring Trade to steal technology related to the space elevator, but every agent sent to the new country failed miserably, with some even vanishing off the face of the earth for going too far.  At this moment, Comrade Hillary, sitting at the conference table, suddenly spoke up. "More than the orbital airborne brigade and the power armor, I'm more concerned about their space-based weapons. If they can deliver tungsten core projectiles weighing dozens of tons over our heads at any time, it would pose a serious threat to the national security of the United States."  Everyone in attendance nodded. The 1966 Outer Space Treaty mentioned the prohibition of weapon development and "militarization" in outer space. However, in reality, vigorously developing military aerospace technology and space power to seize absolute air supremacy and strategic high ground for national security has long been a common strategic goal of major countries.  If the treaty were strictly adhered to, all high-orbit missiles should not exist, but is that possible?  After surveying the room, the CIA director cleared his throat and said, "Regarding their space-based weapons, we managed to get our hands on some tungsten core projectiles from Ukraine. According to technicians at the CIA, the technology for these space-based weapons is not complex, simply a tungsten alloy sphere the size of a watermelon, with a gyroscopic guidance component installed at its core."  "Imitating their weapons is easy," he said, pausing with a hint of helplessness on his face, "The key is how to get these tungsten spheres into geosynchronous orbit."  If they can't send these tungsten spheres to geosynchronous orbit at a reasonable cost, developing space-based weapons is utterly meaningless. "Exactly," said the military advisor from the White House with a wry smile, "If we use rockets to transport these things to geosynchronous orbit and then drop them, it's entirely redundant. Moreover, the dangerous thing about Star Ring Trade is that there is currently no international convention with enough binding force to limit the scale of private armaments. If they continue to expand their scale, we have no way to interfere."  Hearing this, Hillary tapped her fingers on the armrest of the sofa, pondering, "What if we now promote a relevant international convention?"  "We would likely become the biggest sacrifice," Secretary Carter said with difficulty, "You know, a significant portion of our annual defense budget is spent on military contractors. It's no exaggeration to say that they have become a part of the U.S. Army."  Including Hillary, the senior officials from the Pentagon and the White House fell into silence. If the White House clamps down on private military contractors, Wall Street would be the first to oppose. Messing with the military-industrial complex is like touching the wallets of all American consortia.  Notorious private military contractors like Blackwater, Triple Canopy, and DynCorp International all have intricate connections with Wall Street capital. Next year is the 20-year election, and whether one can sit here relies on winning the public's favor without offending the American consortiums too severely.  Now that Goldman Sachs has just fallen, other WASP consortia like Morgan Stanley and First Boston have already dominated the entire North American financial circle. No one wants to provoke those capital magnates at this time.  What should they do? Hillary frowned deeply in thought.  ...  The war was over, and after the destruction of the mother nest, the power armored brigade, under Jiang Chen's instruction, took control of the military base. Seeing the outcome decided, the commander of the British mechanized brigade arrived at the gate of the military base in a vehicle, applying to enter the military base to Star Ring Trade.  His reasons were well-prepared, such as "collecting the bodies of fallen soldiers" and "dragging out the wreckage of scrapped armored vehicles," but they were still rejected by Star Ring Trade.  The reason for the refusal was simple. There were no bodies to speak of; any creatures captured by the aliens would be devoured for flesh and blood at the first opportunity and brought into the mother nest as a high-quality supplement and a breeding ground for spores.  Star Ring Trade only promised to send over any dog tags with English letters they might find. This reason obviously did not satisfy the British. Collecting bodies was secondary; everyone knew that the bones of the dead were likely gnawed away. They were more interested in closely observing Star Ring Trade's power armor and collecting as much intelligence about this new type of equipment as possible.  Of course, apart from this factor, what they were most worried about was the X2 bacteria being appropriated by Star Ring Trade. The ferocious aliens had left such a deep impression that if someone were to use them for military purposes, the consequences would be unimaginable. The best way to overcome fear is to procure a portion for oneself, just like with nuclear weapons.  Determined, Brigade Commander Moston had no intention of withdrawing from the military base once they entered; he estimated that Star Ring Trade probably did not have the guts to directly confront Britain. Once the research team from London arrived, they would do whatever it took to figure out the formation mechanism of the mother nest, even if not for military purposes, at least to have a backup in their own country's sample repository, just in case.  However, Star Ring Trade unceremoniously refused them, declaring the entire military base as private property. Even Finnish officials coming forward to mediate were of no use; the president of Finland had already sold the nationalized Arrow Corporation assets to Star Ring Trade at a discounted price of 300 million new yuan when pleading for their military support.  Legally speaking, the agreement signed between the Arrow Corporation and the Finnish government naturally transitioned to Jiang Chen. For example, this military base now belonged to Star Ring Trade's private assets, protected by Finnish law.  The commander of the power armored brigade had no plans to negotiate with Moston, and the two soldiers guarding the gate sent him back. Even though Moston was extremely reluctant, he could only return to the military camp near the town of Paltak and report the news first to his superiors, waiting for the Ministry of Defense to decide.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1076: Right Beside Us  The night of battle had passed, and the sky at dawn the next day began to flutter with light snow. It was the end of May, nearing summer for the Northern Hemisphere, but this had nothing to do with the permafrost of northern Finland. Located within the Arctic Circle, if the Arctic Ocean monsoon occurred, locals could see traces of snow until the middle of June.  At this moment, above the military base next to Paltak, the flag of Star Ring Trade had already been hoisted. Due to multiple rounds of bombing, not a single intact building could be seen on the entire military base. After negotiations with the Finnish side, Star Ring Trade transported supplies to the base through Russia.  Logistics personnel and scientific research teams who arrived by plane at Murmansk followed up, setting up marching tents outside the military base. Unlike what Jiang Chen had seen in the apocalypse, these improved X2 bacteria had very strong survival abilities, and they could survive for quite a long time even without the queen nest.  Because of this, it was too risky to let them die out on their own. Without an injection of the gene drug, inhaling a certain amount of spore gas would lead to a "zombification" response in any organism. Especially in primates, it seemed that the more developed the brain of the organism, the more susceptible it was to these toxic bacteria.  After a logistics team of a thousand people arrived, Jiang Chen gave them their first order: to kill the spores floating in the air and eradicate all sources of infection. Although no drug had been developed to kill these spores, not everything had to be solved with technology.  These spores could put out fires, but conversely, since they sacrificed themselves to extinguish fires and now there was no queen nest to produce more spores, their fire-seeking properties would actually hasten their demise. There was no need for any special sterilization equipment; a flamethrower could produce unexpected, miraculous effects.  The entire military base was still shrouded in spores, with only soldiers in powered armor and logistics personnel in orange hazmat suits remaining inside.  The corpses of alien species were piled up a kilometer outside the military base and doused with gasoline for incineration. The dark column of smoke had been drifting from yesterday until the morning and had not yet dissipated. Even from the town of Paltak several kilometers away, it could be clearly seen.  Inside the command tent next to the military base, Colonel Klayman had already taken off his powered armor and was now wearing a heavy cold-proof uniform, standing in front of the command table, listening to the reports from his subordinates.  "...... The American Columbia Television station hopes to enter the military base to film the underground bunkers and the remnants of the queen nest."  "Tell them to seek permission from Star Ring Trade. We are soldiers; we don't have the authority to let them through," Klayman said impatiently.  This was already the fifth media outlet that had come to the gates of the camp. Now, the whole world's attention was focused on this military base, and almost everyone was concerned with the same issue: how Star Ring Trade planned to handle the aftermath.  "Additionally, this morning officials from the Finnish Presidential Office contacted us. The President hopes to have a dialogue with us regarding the disposal of the alien corpses. They hope we can come up with a more environmentally friendly solution, rather than burning them en masse."  Upon hearing his subordinate's report, Klayman raised his eyebrows. "Then go tell them to either accept our method or figure out their own way of handling these infection sources. If they need it, we can deliver it to the warehouse in the nearby town for free."  "Yes, sir." The officer saluted sharply and then turned to leave the command tent.  Klayman sat back down in his chair, planning to rest with his eyes closed. However, before his chair could get warm, an officer rushed into the command tent, pulling him from his half-asleep state.  The report was only six words short, and it didn't anger Klayman, who had been disturbed from his peaceful sleep.  The officer saluted sharply and said, "Report! The boss is coming."  ......  At noon, a helicopter flew over from the mountains and landed steadily on the helipad inside the military base. Jiang Chen, wearing a hazmat suit and a gas mask, jumped down from the helicopter.  Although he didn't need to wear these things and would be fine without them, the spore concentration outside was not low, so it was better not to be too shocking.  Following behind him was the director of the Russian Security Bureau, Balth, who was also tightly wrapped in a hazmat suit, looking around the messy base. Originally, Aisha was also supposed to come along, but considering that she wouldn't stay in Finland for two days, Jiang Chen asked her to return to Kolo Island first.  Wearing powered armor and stepping forward, Colonel Klayman saluted Jiang Chen.  Jiang Chen nodded at him approvingly. "Hard work."  "Not at all, not hard!" Klayman said with a grin.  Jiang Chen asked, "What's the situation underground?"  Klayman replied, "The queen nest has been confirmed dead, no live alien remnants. The logistics troops are still clearing the X2 bacteria, and the scientific research team from Kolo Island is investigating and sampling the queen nest's remains."  "Take us down to take a look."  "Yes, sir!" Klayman saluted sharply.  Following behind Klayman, Jiang Chen and Balth came to the edge of the huge pit in the center of the base. This used to be the entrance to the underground bunker, which was collapsed by Star Ring Trade's tungsten core bomb a few days ago. To facilitate cleaning personnel and the scientific research team's entry, the supporting logistics troops built a simple elevator here.  After stepping on it, the three of them reached the entrance to the underground bunker, which was 500 meters below.  "Is this the interior of the queen nest? The flesh bubbles on the wall are really disgusting." Balth glanced at the remnants on the wall and showed a look of disgust.  "You can think of it that way. Before the core was destroyed, the queen nest had already constructed the entire underground bunker into its own nest," explained Jiang Chen.  Not far away, researchers were taking samples from the remnants of the insect eggs. The unheard DNA codes and forms of existence of these organisms were completely overturning these scholars' understanding of biology.  Everyone gave their utmost effort, pouring their passion for science into these precious samples. For the entire human civilization, these were valuable data.  Regarding the Harmonious Civilization, Jiang Chen only glimpsed a shadow of it from afar, saying he knew nothing about it was not an exaggeration. He didn't expect to find out any weaknesses of the Harmonious Civilization from the remains of the queen nest, but for now, this was the only means for Earth's civilization to understand them.  Because they were wearing hazmat suits, no one recognized Jiang Chen's identity along the way. After saluting Klayman, the standing soldiers let them pass. In this way, accompanied by Klayman, the two unassumingly arrived next to the remnants of the queen nest's core and stood still.  Gazing at the pitiful remains, Balth glanced at the resin-like "coffin" and saw a familiar face through the broken membrane.  "Carmen Rothschild?"  "That's right."  "You really killed him."  Balth smacked his lips, "If you ask me, the International Court of Justice would have been his best destination."  "Keeping him would be a trouble," Jiang Chen said indifferently.  He was unsure what the Harmonious Civilization had revealed to him, but if those insects informed him about his ability to traverse, it would ultimately be a problem. Now the Rothschild family had produced at least tens of thousands of golden apples, which were a threat to him and human civilization.  And now, his presence here was to eliminate this threat!  Jiang Chen gestured to Klayman standing beside him, then pointed to the head of the resin coffin. Klayman understood, pulled out his tactical knife, cut open the resin surface, reached in with his steel hand, and pulled out a black sphere.  Seeing that black sphere, Balth's expression became somewhat subtle.  "Golden apple," taking the black ball from Klayman, Jiang Chen weighed it in his hand, "We have always thought it was a tool for communicating with the future, but in fact, it's not like that."  "Communication is only their basic ability; their true ability is brainwashing. They subtly infect their owners and turn them into their minions. Whether it was the previous Tanaka or the current Carmen, essentially, they are the same type of people."  Saying that, Jiang Chen pretended to disdainfully toss the golden apple back to Klayman, signaling him to stuff that thing back in.  Through the hazmat suit, he couldn't see Balth's expression, but years of experience in deceiving people told him that he had probably achieved his goal.  The German revolution was about to succeed, and Russia certainly obtained these golden apples from the rebels; if they referred to some intelligence and repeatedly experimented with these things, they might actually figure something out.  Jiang Chen had to administer a vaccine to them before they understood how to use the golden apples. To make them fear these things.  "The most fatal thing is that the biological civilization that the golden apples communicate with is not from the future."  After a pause, Jiang Chen looked meaningfully at Balth. "But right beside us."  (To be continued.) Chapter 1077: The Highly Effective Recruitment Advertisement  Long before the Munich incident, Carmen had seized control of the entire Rothschild family's power through a series of means. After using Xinghuan Trade's hand to deal with his own brother James in the Pearson Church massacre, the family was basically at his sole command. Therefore, with his death, it could be said that the Rothschild family was finished.  Jiang Chen could foresee that once the revolution in Germany succeeded, the first thing the Christian Democratic Union would do after ousting the New Choice Party would be to settle scores with the Freemasons for the "crimes" committed during the New Choice Party's governance. Without any surprises, the assets of the Rothschilds and several other families in Germany would be auctioned by banks to pay off the hefty fines issued by the courts.  It was foreseeable that in the coming period, even if Jiang Chen did nothing, the Rothschild family would inevitably decline in the frenzy of asset division. They were just too rich. And also too weak.  Jiang Chen wasn't worried at all about them dying out too slowly. The only thing that concerned him was the golden apples that were originally controlled by the Rothschilds. If they were only in Carmen's hands, it would still be fine, but now that Carmen was dead, these golden apples would inevitably fall into others' hands.  Not just Russia, Jiang Chen believed that the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and even Huaguo on the other side of the Earth, would certainly be interested in these things, and various forces would try their best to get one or two back for research.  The Harmonious Civilization had already mastered the communication channel of the golden apples. If the higher-ups of various countries failed to realize the danger within, it was hard to say where the next Hive would be born.  Sitting on the plane back to Moscow, Baltar was continuously pondering the conversation he had with Jiang Chen in the underground shelter that day, as well as what he had witnessed inside the Hive...  "...Are you saying that this is the product of an extraterrestrial civilization?" Baltar still couldn't believe the facts that Jiang Chen had explained to him. His eyebrows were tightly furrowed, looking at Carmen lying in the resin coffin, "And the golden apple is just a brainwashing tool?"  "That's right," Jiang Chen nodded.  "Unbelievable."  "I know, it sounds like an April Fool's joke, but that's the fact. On June 15, we will hold an Outer Space Security Summit in Ke Luo City, where we will reveal all the evidence we have collected about extraterrestrial civilizations in our space activities. I have told you openly what I already know; whether you take it seriously or not, the choice is yours."  Overwhelmed by the large amount of information, Baltar was stunned on the spot. Extraterrestrial civilization? What a joke! Baltar still couldn't believe it, even though Jiang Chen had alluded to it in Murmansk last time.  The golden apple that the Russian Security Bureau had finally obtained was actually part of an alien conspiracy to invade Earth? He really couldn't believe that such a plot, which would only appear on the big Hollywood screen, was happening right before his eyes.  However, when he recalled the serious expression on Jiang Chen's face, doubts started to creep into his heart again. If the golden apple was truly a brainwashing tool that could turn its holder into a lackey of an extraterrestrial civilization without anyone noticing, then it was indeed a dangerous thing.  After all, no one could tell who had been brainwashed, and those who had been brainwashed would not voluntarily come forward to admit it. If a brainwashed person unwittingly built a Hive within Russian territory...  Thinking of this, a drop of cold sweat slid down his forehead. Thinking carefully, the golden apple had changed hands several times from the resistance to the Russian Security Bureau.  Realizing the severity of the issue, Baltar made up his mind. At least wait until June 15 to see what evidence Xinghuan Trade can present. Before that, the golden apples should be sealed and kept away from anyone's reach. If they were as dangerous as he said, it wouldn't be too late to destroy them then.  ...  Through the lens of the Finnish National Broadcasting Corporation, Xinghuan Trade's orbital weapons and the cool power armors were broadcast to every corner of the world. Those who had been pessimistic about the alien species due to the British army's tragic defeat were also reignited with hope by the victorious battle of two hundred against ten thousand.  The demon-like ugly aliens fell one after another in front of the steel armors, their dark green blood dismembered under clusters of orange-yellow trajectories, especially during the final close combat, which was incredibly exhilarating to watch.  "That's awesome, are those two hundred Gundams? Or two hundred Iron Men? I just want to ask if joining Xinghuan Trade means I have the chance to wear that thing? If so, I'll go sign up for the foreign legion on the official website right now."  "@Robert Downey Jr., what do you think?"  "That model with the laser blade on the right arm is simply too much to my liking! Look at that move slicing the alien in half, it's just too cool. It's a pity the footage is too blurry; it would've been better if the Finnish TV station's camera was clearer."  Aside from those non-nutritious comments on social media, a discussion about the practicality of such weaponry also erupted on some military forums.  The military enthusiasts were divided into two camps, one believed that this so-called power armor could change the modern warfare landscape, and the other thought there was no need to make such a fuss.  "This individual armor reminds me of the bulletproof armor from World War I, just with a machine gun attached to the arm? I think there's nothing surprising, it's just a mechanical exoskeleton with a layer of steel. Instead of developing a piece of iron that wraps the whole person up, it's better to produce more tanks or armored vehicles."  "The person above is thinking too simply. How did the British mechanized brigade go in and how did it come out? Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth! Infantry with protection, mobility, support capabilities, and even anti-armor capabilities will become omnipotent Rambos on the battlefield! And it's the kind that can be mass-produced! As for welding steel plates on the outside of a mechanical exoskeleton equals power armor, are you talking about Krupp's 'Lightning' series? Don't compare it with the products of future military industries, they are not on the same level!"  Of course, not all public opinion was developing in a direction favorable to Xinghuan Trade. With the threat of the second "Biohazard" removed, people couldn't help but start to reflect on another issue after breathing a sigh of relief. If Xinghuan Trade could deploy a power armor brigade with combat power comparable to a division anywhere in the world within hours, then what was the meaning of borders?  Instigated by those with ulterior motives, numerous pacifists in major cities like New York and Los Angeles spontaneously held protests and rallies, protesting against Xinghuan Trade's repeated military use of outer space.  However, these protests did not gain much momentum. Even though the mainstream media in Western countries, representing the interests of the elite class, mostly agreed with these protestors, the public opinion on the internet was clearly biased towards Xinghuan Trade.  Since he had been busy discussing "compensation" with the Finnish government these days, Jiang Chen had not been paying attention to the internet. It was only when he was transferring flights at Moscow airport that he realized the power armor brigade of Xinghuan Trade had unexpectedly become popular.  This result was somewhat unexpected for Jiang Chen. He had anticipated that the power armor would attract widespread attention from governments around the world, but he did not expect it to cause such a sensation among the public.  Jiang Chen was still unclear about what kind of impact it would have, but one thing was certain. The high-definition video from the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation was like a free recruitment advertisement for Xinghuan Trade, and a highly effective one at that...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1078: Drive Carefully  Several days have passed since the military operation to clear out the Star Ring Trade's nest, and the White House and the Pentagon have held numerous meetings, both large and small, regarding the Star Ring Trade.  "...I don't care how you do it, but within three days, I want to see DARPA initiate a project on developing powered armor, separating it from the exoskeleton project. Don't worry about the budget; I will discuss it with Congress. According to the Secretary of Defense's opinion, the positioning of this powered armor is tentatively set as an infantry squad's fire support point. Besides having at least a fifty-kilogram ammunition load and NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) protection capabilities, it must also provide absolute protection against ammunition calibers below 12.7mm..."  At this moment, inside a small conference room in the White House, Hillary was having a one-on-one meeting with the director of DARPA. DARPA is an abbreviation for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as the real-life version of S.H.I.E.L.D. In many defense and aerospace projects, DARPA's influence can be seen, including the Faraday spray that restricts EMP weapons, which was co-designed by DARPA and Lockheed Martin.  Star Ring Trade had already surpassed the United States in defense technology, and Hillary had no choice but to pin her hopes on DARPA.  After carefully noting Hillary's requirements, the DARPA director twirled his ballpoint pen twice and lightly tapped it on his notebook.  "We will expedite the project initiation. Lockheed Martin has already made good progress in the research of exoskeletons, and we have existing technological resources that we can utilize. Additionally, I suggest negotiating with Germany to see if we can obtain information about the 'Lightning' exoskeleton improvement model from the Krupp Group, as they have clearly already developed a prototype of powered armor, though it is still somewhat lacking in design."  "I will have Kerry talk to them," Hillary said.  After exchanging some details with the First Lady, the DARPA director closed his notebook and stood up to leave. There were still several meetings waiting for him, and he had to prepare the proposal within two days to catch the Congressional budget committee's hearing on the third day. Such a research and development project involving hundreds of millions of dollars could not be decided by his signature alone.  As he was about to open the door to leave, the conference room door was pushed open, and a White House assistant entered with a document.  "First Lady."  Hillary looked at her assistant and asked seriously, "What is it?"  "The new head of state has sent us an invitation."  The assistant walked to Hillary's side and placed the document on the table, "It's an invitation to attend the Outer Space Security Summit on June 15th."  "Outer Space Security Summit?" Hillary scoffed, her crow's feet wrinkling. How dare Star Ring Trade hold an Outer Space Security Summit? Who exactly is using space resources for weapon development?  "Write a polite letter of refusal for me. Say that the American side regrets Star Ring Trade's violation of the 'Outer Space Treaty.' Until Star Ring Trade and the new state provide an explanation, we will not initiate high-level bilateral talks with the new state."  "Yes." The assistant nodded and left.  Leaning back in her chair, Hillary rubbed her tired eyes. There was another meeting in ten minutes. Just as she was about to sneak in a nap, she caught a glimpse of the invitation out of the corner of her eye. After hesitating for a moment, she reached into the document bag and took out the invitation, following diplomatic etiquette.  As her gaze quickly passed over a couple of lines, Hillary suddenly froze upon catching a keyword. "Extraterrestrial civilization?"  Reading down the invitation, Hillary's expression changed continuously. When she reached the last line, she threw the invitation onto the table, stood up, and hurried out the door.  ...  On the morning of June 1st, a Gulfstream jet landed at the airport in Korolo City. Surrounded by a group of bodyguards, Jiang Chen yawned as he passed through the special passage and arrived at his Rurka sedan. After the bodyguard opened the car door, he sat in the passenger seat.  Aisha started the car skillfully from the driver's seat, pressed the button to activate the magnetic levitation system after reaching the initial speed, and the car steadily took off. The main traffic arteries in downtown Korolo City have already been converted to magnetic levitation, and almost half of the private cars are floating in mid-air.  The endless stream of traffic complemented the neon lights on both sides of the street. Against the backdrop of skyscrapers and the lights of thousands of homes, the entire city looked like a dazzling gem, dreamy and beautiful. It was hard to imagine what it looked like four years ago.  On the car ride, Jiang Chen unexpectedly received a call from Warner Bros. Christopher Nolan, who had previously worked with him, contacted him proactively, stating that Warner Bros. was very interested in bringing the battle between humans and aliens to a "bigger" screen. He wanted to gauge Jiang Chen's opinion to see if Star Ring Trade could offer some assistance during filming.  Considering the positive publicity for Star Ring Trade, Jiang Chen happily accepted Warner Bros.' proposal, stating that as long as Star Ring Trade played a positive role in the film, they could provide help with the filming for free.  After hanging up the phone, Jiang Chen put away the holographic screen and stretched. After taking two flights in a row, he hadn't fully adjusted to the timezone, and he felt groggy.  Aisha glanced at Jiang Chen with some concern and whispered, "How was it in Finland?"  "Not bad, just busy with work."  "Did you meet Natasha?"  "I saw her before boarding the plane; she invited me to dinner."  Jiang Chen turned to look at Aisha, who was focused on driving, and smiled. His hand, which had been resting above his head, naturally wrapped around her slender and toned waist.  "Don't always ask about me. Did you miss me these past few days?"  Her cheeks blushing, Aisha whispered, "I thought about you every day."  Feeling the restless movements of that hand, Aisha fidgeted uncomfortably but did not resist. Jiang Chen was not worried about a traffic accident at all; magnetic levitation driving was at least ten times safer than driving on the road. The altitude-restricted lanes were controlled by intelligent programs that maintained a specific speed. Once entering the highest cruising lane, one could completely let go of the steering wheel and leave the driving entirely to the intelligent program.  Initially, Jiang Chen was just wrapping his arm around her waist, but he soon became more audacious. However, the little lamb was too compliant, allowing his hand to continue moving upward...  Biting her lower lip, unable to contain her feelings any longer, Aisha turned the car onto the cruising lane and handed over the driving completely to the intelligent system. Her hands left the steering wheel, and she agilely turned around to straddle Jiang Chen's legs.  Wrapping her arms around Jiang Chen's neck, Aisha blinked her clear, large eyes, her sapphire-like pupils staring straight into his.  Being so intently gazed at, it was Jiang Chen, who had been restless earlier, who became somewhat embarrassed.  "Uh, drive carefully—"  Before he could finish, his lips were sealed by hot and delicate ones, a silky and tender little snake breached his teeth and invaded, and a pair of cool, gentle hands wandered down his toned arms...  Through the dark-tinted glass, the colorful street scenery whizzed past the two of them. In this moment and setting, everything seemed to happen as naturally as water flows into a channel.  Jiang Chen felt that the fatigue accumulated over the past few days was dissipating with the warmth of their skin contact. In the dazzling night, a scene of speed and passion was unfolding...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1079: The End of the War  Looking up at the wall clock for the third time, Xia Shiyu let out a deep sigh and muttered softly, "Why hasn't he come back yet?" Half an hour ago, Aisha drove to the airport to pick up Jiang Chen and bring him home, so she took a shower in the bathroom.  It was summer, and the weather was quite hot. After taking a shower, Xia Shiyu didn't immediately put on clothes. Instead, she wrapped her wet hair in a white towel and sat on the living room sofa wearing a bath towel.  Imagining Jiang Chen looking at her with a flushed face and breathing rapidly, the corners of Xia Shiyu's mouth couldn't help but curve into a faint smile.  Suddenly realizing she was thinking about something quite embarrassing, Xia Shiyu's face turned red, she coughed lightly while clenching her fists, took a few deep breaths to calm herself, and regained her composed, pure, and elegant demeanor.  However, her gaze that couldn't help but look outside the window, along with the love and anticipation twinkling in her eyes, revealed her excited state of mind.  Time passed by minute by minute, and it was already past one o'clock. Looking at the wall clock again, Xia Shiyu's calm expression gradually faded, and she began to worry.  "Could it be a traffic jam... Impossible, how could a maglev car get stuck in traffic. Could something have happened on the road?"  Thinking this, Xia Shiyu couldn't sit still anymore. She quickly picked up her mobile phone from the coffee table and called Jiang Chen. The phone rang for a long time, but no one answered.  Then she called Aisha, but the phone was turned off.  Xia Shiyu became anxious.  Just as she stood up to change clothes and go out to check, the sound of the door opening finally came from outside the villa. The car lights flickered slightly, and the familiar Rurka car drove into the garage, and soon two people pushed the door and walked into the living room.  Seeing the two of them return safely, Xia Shiyu breathed a sigh of relief, walked up to them, and looked at Jiang Chen with some reproach. "Why did you come back so late?"  Jiang Chen smiled embarrassingly, "We were delayed on the road for a while, why haven't you gone to sleep?"  Xia Shiyu looked at Jiang Chen suspiciously.  It wasn't right. Normally, when he saw her wrapped in a bath towel, he would definitely have an unnatural reaction, but his current demeanor was too calm.  Little did she know that Jiang Chen, who had just completed a "four-shot burst," was now in sage mode. Even if they were to bathe together, he wouldn't have any strange reactions.  Unaware of what Xia Shiyu was wondering about, and feeling a bit uneasy under that suspicious gaze, Jiang Chen touched his face and whispered, "Is there something on my face?"  Xia Shiyu shook her head, then turned her gaze to Aisha.  Aisha's face was flushed, and she shyly shifted her gaze away.  Realizing the situation, Jiang Chen thought to himself, 'Damn it!'  Sure enough, Xia Shiyu immediately understood something. She walked smilingly to Jiang Chen's side and "gently" took hold of his arm.  "There is indeed something. Let me take a look for you."  The fragrance of lilacs entered Jiang Chen's nose, and the moist hair still covered in mist, as his gaze followed along her beautiful face down to a patch of deep and fair skin.  Feeling the beauty clinging so closely, Jiang Chen painfully and happily reacted.  "There is indeed quite a bit," Xia Shiyu said, seriously examining Jiang Chen's side profile and nodding as if it were a big deal. With a jealous gaze at Aisha and a "murderous" smile on her face, she said, "Let's go upstairs, I'll help you clean up thoroughly~"  After that, Xia Shiyu pulled at the bath towel in front of her chest with one hand and pulled Jiang Chen's arm with the other, quickly walking upstairs.  Jiang Chen, not sure whether to cry or laugh, gave Aisha a look of distress. However, the young girl just mourned for him silently in her heart for a second and then hummed a light tune as she ran to the upstairs bathroom.  It was already very hot in Kolo City during summer, and now she was sticky all over. She couldn't wait to take a shower and then go back to her bedroom to sleep beautifully.  ...  It wasn't until noon that Jiang Chen rubbed his sleepy eyes and sat up from the bed. The beauty who had slept in his arms last night had already gotten up and left.  As the old saying goes, there is only a dead ox, not a plowed field. Last night, he had used all his skills to play with Xia Shiyu until she begged for mercy with an exhausted body, but he didn't expect this dedicated female CEO to still be able to get up on time to go to work the next day.  Thinking of this, Jiang Chen shook his head and smiled, pulled off the air conditioner blanket, and got out of bed.  Hearing the movement in the bedroom, the well-behaved Aisha came in with clothes, gently helped Jiang Chen get dressed, and softly asked in his ear, "Do you have any plans for today?"  "Yes," Jiang Chen stroked Aisha's hair, "I'll spend the whole day with you two."  Enjoying the warm hand, Aisha smiled gently and softly said, "Spend more time with Sister Shiyu. She's always waiting for you at home alone, and I occasionally have the chance to go out with you. Although she rarely says it, I can feel that her love for you is no less than mine."  Looking into those clear eyes, Jiang Chen suddenly felt a bit sorry for her. He was about to say something, but a soft finger gently pressed against his lips.  "Say nothing."  After whispering softly, Aisha tiptoed and gave him a light kiss on the lips. With loving eyes, she reached out to straighten his collar.  "Let's get ready for lunch."  Looking at the lovely face close at hand, Jiang Chen's heart rippled slightly and couldn't help but wrap his arms around her waist, whispering in her ear, "Can I eat you first?"  "No, you still have to go to the company in the afternoon."  Lowering her head and gently touching Jiang Chen's chest with her forehead, Aisha softly said, "Don't delay the important matters, or Sister Shiyu will get jealous again."  Although Jiang Chen was sure that if he insisted, Aisha would not resist, considering Xia Shiyu's jealousy and the "harmony of the harem," he decided to follow the young girl's advice.  After having lunch together, Jiang Chen rested on the sofa for a while and then drove to the company.  Taking the elevator to the top floor, Jiang Chen greeted Xia Shiyu as he passed by her door.  Although she didn't show any response, Jiang Chen could clearly feel that seeing him appear here in the afternoon made Xia Shiyu very happy.  What she cared about wasn't whether Jiang Chen was dedicated to his work—she was already used to handling those heavy tasks for Jiang Chen—but whether he was willing to spend more time with her.  She didn't ask for the affection Jiang Chen poured on her to be more than that for Aisha, who had accompanied him through life and death. She just hoped that in terms of feelings, she wouldn't be too far behind...  Sitting down in his own office, Jiang Chen had his beautiful secretary make him a cup of coffee and casually asked to call CEO David Smith of Future People Bank from downstairs.  Soon, Mr. Smith appeared in front of his desk.  Since it was working hours, Jiang Chen didn't bother with small talk and gave his orders straight to the point.  "Within three days, I want to see 150 billion new yuan of funds that can be freely used on the books of Future People Bank. Also, upload the research reports of Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen Group to my mailbox. Oh, and make a list of German companies that are at the top in the electrical industry and send it to my mailbox as well."  After hearing Jiang Chen's words, the word "surprised" was clearly written on Smith's face.  As a senior financial professional, he was aware of any slight movement related to capital on the international stage.  Without Jiang Chen mentioning it, Future People Bank was already preparing to buy at the bottom of the European economy, with liquid funds ready. Now his team was only researching where to start for higher returns and where to start for higher success rates.  Companies like Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen, which have the technology and market prospects, are naturally the first choice for investment.  The only thing is that it's not something you can buy if you want to. Even if you can offer twice the premium, it still depends on whether the German government is willing to sell to you.  However, Smith never expected that his boss was so capable that he could even swallow up pillars of the German automobile industry like Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen. Would the German government just watch as their pillar industries get taken away by foreign capital?  "No problem." Despite the surprise, Smith had no choice but to nod and agree without another word.  "Then hurry up."  "Yes."  After Smith left, Jiang Chen took the mocha coffee from his beautiful secretary's hand, leaned back in his chair, and savored it contentedly.  The war was over, the money was spent, and the blood was almost drained.  The German revolution was on the eve of victory, Carmen died in Finland, and the Freemasonry led by the Rothschild family was powerless to return to heaven.  Now comes the climax of the entire war.  It's time to divide the spoils!  (To be continued.) Chapter 1080: Crazy Acquisition  In the city of Bremen in northwestern Germany, inside a budget hotel, a man of Germanic descent was hurriedly packing his luggage. Perhaps because he was too flustered, he accidentally knocked his mobile phone off the table onto the floor. Seeing this, he quickly bent down to pick up the phone, cursing as he stuffed it into his pocket.  "That damned Carmen, always causing more problems than solving! How did I ever get on his ship... Damn it!"  While cursing, he closed his packed suitcase and quickly headed towards the door.  Karl-Friedrich Krupp, this was once a resounding name in Germany's high society.  However, now he was living like a rat crossing the street, wearing clothes worth a hundred euros, staying in a cheap budget hotel, and even having to wear sunglasses and a baseball cap when going out, afraid that someone would recognize him.  For some reason, he suddenly missed his brother, Glauner Krupp, the man who strongly opposed joining forces with the Rothschild family, once the backbone of the entire Krupp family.  If he hadn't been blinded by power and had reminded his brother to be wary of Carmen that night, perhaps the Krupp family would have had a different outcome today.  Stepping onto the elevator, he shook his head vigorously, dismissing those unrealistic thoughts. Pondering such issues, other than causing himself distress, was of no benefit.  After adjusting his emotions and watching the descending floor numbers at the elevator door, a glimmer of hope slowly kindled in Karl-Friedrich's heart.  As long as he could successfully escape to South America, hide there for a while, wait until the storm passed, and then quietly move the money he had in the Cayman Islands through offshore companies, he could still continue to be a wealthy man in South America.  One hundred million dollars, if used sparingly, would be enough for the rest of his life.  As for the mess left by the Krupp family, he had two younger brothers and a sister who could deal with it as they wished!  When the elevator reached the first floor, Karl-Friedrich breathed a sigh of relief and walked out with his carry-on luggage. However, at that moment, four men dressed in black suits also noticed him, rising from their seats and converging towards him from four different directions in the hotel lobby.  Realizing he had been targeted, Karl-Friedrich's face was instantly stricken with panic.  Just as he thought about turning to run, he found that his retreat was already cut off, and there was no escape.  In a matter of seconds, he was surrounded by the four men in black.  The man standing directly in front of him took out a document from his chest pocket and said expressionlessly, "Hello, may I ask if you are Mr. Karl-Friedrich?"  "You must be mistaken..." Karl-Friedrich said nervously, "I am Francis Oder, a food processing entrepreneur from South America. I'm just here in Germany for an inspection..."  However, the man paid no attention to his excuses and continued, "We are agents from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Mr. Karl-Friedrich, you are currently facing at least twenty charges, including treason. Please come with us."  Karl-Friedrich panicked and suddenly lunged at the man beside him, trying to escape. However, his slight frame was no match for the battle-hardened agent; the man beside him didn't even move and casually restrained his hands.  "No! I'm not going anywhere! I have a plane to catch! Help! Someone here..."  While struggling desperately, Karl-Friedrich screamed shrilly, his face covered in snot and saliva, looking as miserable as could be.  Seeing that Karl-Friedrich had no intention of cooperating, the agent from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution stopped wasting words, signaled to his assistant with a hand gesture, and said cleanly, "Take him away."  "Yes!"  ...  On June 3, the German People's Liberation Front nonviolently marched into Berlin, and the citizens of Berlin welcomed them along the streets. This revolution, which had lasted for months, came to a victorious end after a month of armed struggle.  On June 5, the exiled government led by Evelyn returned from Russia to the Prime Minister's Office in Berlin, ending years of exile. As the leader of the Christian Democratic Union, he stood before all the German people and was sworn in as Chancellor.  On the same afternoon, 27 members of the New Choice Party were charged with multiple crimes, including war crimes and anti-federal constitutional crimes, and faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole.  At the same time, several European enterprises including the Rothschild Bank and the Krupp Group, suspected of providing substantial political donations to the New Choice Party, were prosecuted by the German government. The Supreme Court immediately froze their assets in Germany and initiated the trial process expeditiously.  If convicted, the Rothschild Bank might be fined a staggering one trillion euros. There was no doubt that the Rothschild family could not come up with that much money, and Evelyn had no intention of taking their money.  Once the sentence was delivered, shares of various companies held by the Rothschild Bank would be nationalized by Germany and auctioned off through several banks. The auction proceeds would be collected by the treasury to rejuvenate Germany's economy, which had been stalled by the revolution.  As per the agreement, Jiang Chen acquired a 20% premium from the German government to purchase shares of Daimler, Volkswagen, and BMW, replacing the Rothschild and other European financial groups to become the largest shareholder of these three top automotive groups.  The euro continued to fall as expectations for EU integration collapsed. The euro even dropped to a low of 1:3 against the new yuan, with 150 billion new yuan converted into euros, ultimately trading at 400 billion euros on the foreign exchange market.  Of this, 200 billion euros was a loan from the Future People's Bank to the German Central Bank, 100 billion euros was used to acquire 37% of Volkswagen, 41% of Daimler, and 39% of BMW, and another 100 billion euros was an impromptu investment by Jiang Chen in five electrical industrial companies including Siemens and Bosch.  In this feast of division targeting European financial groups, Jiang Chen's Future People's Group emerged as the biggest winner.  Germany's two mainstay industries were now branded with the label of the Future People's Group.  Originally, Jiang Chen had also planned to acquire the Krupp Group, but this time Evelyn was not as amenable as before. Exaggeration aside, Krupp was the heart of German industry; even though they sided with the wrong team in the New Choice Party, the German Supreme Court did not impose excessive punishment on them.  Moreover, the Krupp Group was a traditional Prussian nobility, not Jewish, and had never entered the core of the Freemasons. After the new family head took over, the Krupp Group firmly stood on the side of the victors, clearly severing ties with the Rothschild family and the Freemasons.  Evelyn decided not to pursue further, and thus, this chapter was turned over.  The EU integration process did not even last a hundred days before this farce ended abruptly with Carmen's death...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1081: Another Possibility  As the heart of the European Union, the victory of the revolution in Germany inspired the European people who were living in dire straits. The collapse of the Rothschild Empire accelerated the pace of "de-rightization" in various European countries, and people began to reflect on whether the choices they made two years ago were correct, and whether the rise of extreme right-wing parties had really led their countries in a better direction.  In contrast to the turbulent situation in Europe, the economy in Asia on the other side of the Earth was steadily rising. Especially in that country located in the Western Pacific with vast maritime territory, its GDP was soaring as if it had taken a space elevator.  On June 10th, a delegation from the Japanese government took the initiative to come to Koro City, leading the Central Electric Power Company and Tokyo Electric Power Company to facilitate an agreement to increase the total amount of electricity imports for the second half of the year by 31%, to replace the two domestic nuclear power plants that had been shut down.  At present, the mining speed of helium-3 in Guanghan City far exceeded the consumption rate, and the newly built second nuclear fusion power station was about to be completed, with a considerable surplus in production capacity.  For such an agreement, Jiang Chen naturally welcomed it with open arms.  Not only Japan, but the Chinese market, which Jiang Chen coveted, also relaxed its policies and sent many representatives of electric power companies to the new country for inspection.  As the world's number one electricity-consuming country, China's electricity market is larger than the second-place United States and third-place India combined. Even if China eliminated half of its coal power, it would make Xinghuan Trade earn a fortune.  As of early June, the Global Grid Plan had completed the most critical first step. With the efforts of many parties, the submarine cables of Xinghuan Trade have successfully covered the whole of Australia and 80% of the countries and regions in Asia, with the output electricity amounting to 88% of the domestic total electricity value.  Benefiting from the dividend of cheap electricity, according to the proportion of imported electricity in the total national electricity consumption, the maximum reduction in industrial costs for the member countries of the Global Grid Plan reached 1.7%, with the lowest also decreasing by 0.3%.  Don't underestimate this one or two percentage points of reduction. Reflected on a GDP measured in trillions, the energy produced is unimaginable!  Not to mention a series of benefits such as the ecological environment, investment environment, competitiveness of export products, promotion of the electrification process, and reducing the dependency of domestic industry on the energy market.  In short, the governments of various countries that have tasted the sweetness have also released positive signals one after another, sending their own entrepreneurs to the new country for negotiations to see if they can increase the import quota.  The New York Times even claimed that the new country has become a nation on a utility pole.  The Washington Post was accompanied by a cartoon full of irony, with the chains extending from the Western Pacific tying up the surrounding countries, large and small.  No matter how the media reported it, the countries that bought tickets to board the train had already sat on the high-speed electrification train, and naturally, there was no reason for them to jump out of the train.  Through a network of submarine cables, Jiang Chen's harvest was not just a continuous flow of cash, but also tangible diplomatic capital.  Why has the dollar been able to dominate the global market for half a century? One of the main reasons is that any country that wants to develop light and heavy industry cannot do without oil, and the dollar just happens to be linked to oil.  If the domestic crude oil production of your own country cannot meet domestic demand, then you can only reserve more foreign exchange to hedge against risks.  Now it's the same, Asian countries are increasing their holdings of the new yuan.  When the rise and fall of the new yuan can already affect the industrial and living electricity costs of many countries, even if Koro City is not the world financial center, the new Federal Reserve already has the potential to leverage the dominant position of the dollar currency.  This is unrelated to finance; it's about hard power.  ...  There are still five days until the Outer Space Security Summit, and Jiang Chen has already sent out invitations to ten major countries around the world. In the invitation, he subtly mentioned that the topics of discussion at the meeting will be related to extraterrestrial civilizations.  So far, all ten countries that received the invitations have indicated that they will send high-level foreign ministers to visit.  The holding of the conference is no longer in doubt; what evidence Jiang Chen will present at the conference has become the key issue.  At present, the space telescope he transported from the apocalypse has been installed on the space elevator and sent to geostationary orbit.  Jiang Chen is not very clear about the exact coordinates of that colony ship, but he knows where they will come from and what their destination is, and that is enough.  The Gliese 581 star system, about 2 degrees north of Beta Librae, 20.5 light-years away from Earth.  A week before the invitation was sent out, the astronomical observation team of the Xinghuan Trade Aerospace Department conducted a long-term observation and analysis of the star system and finally came to an astonishing ... conclusion that was expected by Jiang Chen.  The possibility of life existing on the planet Gliese 581g has reached 90%.  "Incredible..." Holding a stack of documents full of astronomical data, Kelvin walked into Jiang Chen's office and said with an incredulous face, "Your guess was correct, there is indeed the potential for life to be nurtured there. But I can be sure that even if there is life there, it is absolutely impossible for a civilization beyond the Stone Age to be developed."  Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows and asked with a smile, "Oh? Why is that?"  "Firstly, there is tidal locking; the entire planet's habitable zone is only around the twilight zone, which determines their living space." Kelvin continued, taking out a spectrogram from the documents and placing it in front of Jiang Chen, "Next is the most critical part, this planet's elemental composition contains a lot of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, but it severely lacks mineral elements such as iron and aluminum. Referring to the gravitational data we observed, the most likely scenario is that a group of arthropod insects exist along the twilight zone, and there may not even be any mammals!"  Hearing this, Jiang Chen nodded approvingly. Although the analysis was done with the help of 22nd-century observation equipment, to be able to analyze so much valuable information from limited data was already quite impressive.  "Have you considered another possibility?" Jiang Chen asked.  "Another possibility?" Kelvin frowned.  "We have always believed that the development of civilization is linear, from the Stone Age to the Iron Age, then from feudal times to the Industrial Revolution, and finally stepping through the door of the Information Age to the future."  "Is there something wrong with that?" Kelvin said, unconvinced.  "Conclusions drawn from only one reference frame cannot be universally applied. We cannot deny the possibility of other forms of civilization just because human civilization developed linearly," Jiang Chen said.  "You're saying a group of insects might give rise to a civilization? Don't joke around, they..." Kelvin shook his head, about to say they didn't even have hands, but then he suddenly froze.  He suddenly remembered the military operations of Xinghuan Trade in the tundra of northern Finland some time ago. There, the pride of Xinghuan Trade's powered armor brigade seemed to have encountered a horde of alien species that crawled out of insect eggs.  Why would Jiang Chen have the Xinghuan Trade Aerospace Department observe the Gliese star system? Why did Jiang Chen suddenly go to Finland before the X2 bacterium incident broke out? Why was Jiang Chen so certain of the dangers of the nest from the beginning...?  All the clues connected in Kelvin's mind.  He stared at Jiang Chen in shock, barely squeezing a few words out of his throat.  "You're saying..."  "That's right," Jiang Chen nodded, seriously saying, "The beginning and end of the X2 bacterium is not just a research accident as propagated by the outside world. From the beginning, this was a conspiracy of extraterrestrial civilizations."  (To be continued.) Chapter 1082: Developmental Disorder?   After leaving Jiang Chen's office, Kelvin's mind kept repeating the words his boss had said to him. The Outer Space Security Summit would take place in five days, where Xinghuan Trade would present evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations to the heads of various countries and argue their aggressive intentions... but actually, the latter didn't need proving. Two civilizations with completely different values had no option of trade from the start. Since both parties were seen as bugs in each other's eyes, there seemed to be only one method to prove who could continue to stand at the top of the food chain. And that was war.  With a complex look, Kelvin glanced at the document in his hand, recalling the task his boss had given him a minute ago, and for the first time in his life, he felt the weight of his job on his shoulders.  ...  After work in the evening, Jiang Chen didn't go straight home but took a boat alone to Coconut Island. This island had been completely transformed by him into a modern and post-apocalyptic material transit station, where a ship would come every month, unloading unsold food, daily necessities, and occasionally transporting tightly sealed containers away. These containers were filled with advanced industrial machine tools, T3-type power armor produced by the Sixth District, and other high-tech products.  Although the entire island didn't have soldiers stationed to guard it, it was home to a full drone attack squadron. There had been foreign agents who had their sights set on this "mysterious little island," but none had ever succeeded.  Upon reaching the island, Jiang Chen moored the boat at the dock, confirmed his identity with a reconnaissance drone, and walked toward the central warehouse. In the corner of the warehouse sat a machine named by Jiang Chen as "Hamster Killer No. 1," alone and unmoving.  Last time, it was through this machine that Lin Ling had transported a fat hamster from the modern world to the post-apocalyptic world and then back again, witnessing the breakthrough of life transdimensional transport from 0.1 to 1. Although there was still a distance to go before transporting living people, it was undoubtedly a good start.  However, Jiang Chen hadn't expected this device to come into use so quickly.  He sat down next to the machine, took out several test tubes filled with dark green liquid from his pocket, placed them in the center of two discs, then put on a strapped hand device connected to various tubes, and turned on the power. Watching the jumping sparks, he steeled himself and pressed the switch.  After some effort, he transported the test tubes to the post-apocalyptic world, quickly unstrapped his hand, turned off the power, and followed through the transportation.  ...  One of the test tubes contained a substance extracted from the remnants of a hive, while the other test tubes contained spores and insect egg extracts. The cells in the test tubes had not been inactivated, and through the dark green culture fluid, one could even see the wriggling of unidentified substances.  After taking these test tubes from Jiang Chen, Lin Ling immediately dove into the laboratory. Not waiting long, the laboratory door opened again, and Lin Ling reappeared, gesturing to Jiang Chen, then took him to a special microscope.  On the test tube rack, Jiang Chen saw not only the test tubes he had brought but also two familiar test tubes. From the labels on them, he quickly understood where these two test tubes came from.  "The sample you brought is obviously not the same kind as the one from Shelter No. 005 and the hive we encountered in the city center, but the DNA codes do have quite a few similarities. The hive you encountered is clearly an upgraded version, but due to developmental disorder, many functions have not differentiated," Lin Ling explained.  Hearing Lin Ling's introduction, Jiang Chen's eyebrows twitched involuntarily.  "Developmental disorder?"  It took hundreds of tungsten core bullets and a whole brigade of power armor to take down this tough nut, and you're telling me it was still developmentally disordered? What if it was fully developed, would we even stand a chance!  Lin Ling nodded seriously. "Yes, if it's provided with enough organic matter and given sufficient time for photosynthesis to digest and absorb those organics, this hive will gradually develop into a complete form. According to its DNA sequence simulation, the complete form will become a terrifying existence that is impossible to eliminate."  Pausing, Lin Ling's expression turned solemn as she continued, "At least with current technology, I can't think of a way to completely eradicate it. Every single spore cell has the ability to develop into a mature hive, and their division is no longer limited. Unless we can manage to kill every single spore, there will always be the day when it will pop up from some corner."  After hearing Lin Ling's account, the evolution speed of the hive sent a shiver down Jiang Chen's spine. For them, who had completely abandoned tradition, Earth was a completely unfamiliar planet. Whether it was gravity, air composition, or the magnetic field environment, even understanding them did not necessarily mean full adaptation.  In the war against them, humans had the home field advantage from the start. However, on this unfamiliar soil, after each encounter with humans, their abilities evolved at an incredible speed. If there are a few more hive incidents, it's hard to say what stance the Harmonious Civilization will take when the colonization ships land on the day of their invasion plan.  Realizing the deeper severity of the problem, Jiang Chen pondered for a moment and immediately ordered, "Compile the data of this hive, focusing on analyzing the similar genetic components of X2 bacteria and T-series viruses. Also, give me a paper file and an electronic file, preferably made into an easy-to-understand holographic image."  "Hey, do you think I'm your secretary? It's tiring, you know!" Lin Ling pouted, protesting.  "Ten boxes of mango pudding."  "Uh..." Lin Ling struggled for a moment, as if making a big concession, "Fifteen boxes of strawberry flavor."  Hearing Lin Ling's words, Jiang Chen smiled and shook his head. Was this a big deal for him?  "I'll bring it for you next time. But speaking of which, didn't you like mango flavor?"  Lin Ling stuck out her little tongue and looked away sheepishly, "I've had too much of the mango flavor, I haven't even finished what you gave me last time."  Compiling all the data on the hive was no small task, but for Lin Ling, who was an electronic person, it was not difficult. With the promise of pudding, Lin Ling assured Jiang Chen with a pat on her chest that she could finish it in no more than three days.  Leaving the chirping research institute, Jiang Chen went straight through the back yard door and returned to the villa. Before coming to the post-apocalyptic world, he had already notified Aisha, and if nothing unexpected happened, he would stay here for the next three days until Lin Ling had completely compiled the hive data.  This information would be of great use at the upcoming Outer Space Security Summit. Whether it could attract sufficient international attention depended entirely on it.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1083: Watching Intently  In the Morgan Stanley Tower on Wall Street, New York, USA, an informal Federal Reserve shareholders' meeting is taking place. The man seated near the door is the current head of the Morgan family, Daniel Morgan. Alongside him at the meeting table are representatives of the Rockefeller family, representing the Boston consortium, the Rocky family... Even the Giannini family, owners of the California consortium in the distant "countryside" of the West, have sent their own representatives.  It's no exaggeration to say that those qualified to sit at this meeting table mean as much to Americans as Franklin printed on the hundred-dollar bill, and they are the kind that can breathe. A casual fart from these individuals could cause a third or fourth-degree earthquake in the financial world. To put it dramatically, at least one-third of the world's capital is housed within this few dozen square meters of space.  "First, let us toast to our collective victory," Daniel Morgan picked up a champagne glass from the meeting table, raised it high, and looked around, "Victory belongs to 'The Wasps', Wall Street belongs to 'The Wasps'!"  The word for 'wasp' in English coincides with the acronym for the WASP consortium, and typically, members of the WASP consortium also refer to themselves by this name. Old Rockefeller smiled knowingly and also raised his glass.  Without any superfluous lengthy rituals, twelve champagne glasses were raised high in celebration of the WASP consortium's shared victory, led by Daniel, and drained in one gulp.  Twelve attendants stepped forward, respectfully offering towels, and after the big shots had used them, they collected the towels along with the glasses and exited the meeting room. Daniel confidently glanced over the guests around the meeting table, having thrown his towel onto the attendant's tray early on.  Among all the capital magnates present, the forty-year-old Daniel was undoubtedly the youngest and the most successful. After all the attendants had left the room, Daniel lightly clapped his hands to draw everyone's attention to him.  "Just yesterday, Morgan Bank completed the acquisition of assets related to Citibank shares from the Rothschild Bank. With this, I am honored to announce to you all that we have completely kicked those annoying Jews out from under our feet on this street."  Polite applause rose from the meeting table, and even old Rockefeller gently clapped, his muddy eyes flickering with an intriguing glint. Daniel nodded slightly, humbly accepting the praise from the core members of WASP for himself and the surname he carries.  When referring to the Rothschild family's control over America, one cannot help but mention the Federal Reserve. As is well known, the Federal Reserve acts as the central bank of the United States, holding the macro-control power of the "world currency." A simple move to raise interest rates could cause some weak economies to have their factories run for nothing for a month or two, with national finances piling up in debt, comparable to nuclear weapons in the financial field.  The most critical thing is that this nuclear weapon is in private hands. Although Federal Reserve committee members are nominated by the President and appointed by the Senate, strictly speaking, they are part of the government apparatus.  However, according to the Owen-Glass Act, the Federal Reserve has divided the country into 12 reserve districts, each establishing a regional reserve bank with independent legal entity status. The equity of each regional reserve bank is then subscribed by member banks in the region based on their asset proportions.  Taking the New York reserve district as an example, according to the latest public data, the major shareholders are Citibank with 15%, Chase Manhattan 14%, Morgan Trust 9%, Hanhua 8%, and Hanover 7%. Behind these banks often stand the shadows of financial families such as Rockefeller, Morgan, and Rothschild.  Goldman Sachs fell early last year, and now the Rothschild family has been kicked out of the game, with their shares in banks like Citibank and Hanover being divided between the two giants, Rockefeller and Morgan.  If Wall Street in '18 was a place where Jews and Anglo-Saxons competed, with the nuclear button in the hands of two people, then Wall Street in '19 can be called the world of the WASP consortium faction.  Old Rockefeller coughed lightly, pulling Daniel out of his intoxication with victory. "Celebrating victory can wait until the banquet tonight, gentlemen, we still have more important matters to discuss now."  "You're right," Daniel smiled, his face showing no sign of dissatisfaction.  Without saying anything else, old Rockefeller lifted his hand over his shoulder and wiggled his fingers slightly. His secretary, understanding the cue, stepped forward two paces and placed a document respectfully on the meeting table.  Sitting up straight, old Rockefeller put on gold-rimmed glasses and flipped open the document. "Just yesterday, on June 11th, Japan Central Electric Power Company, Tokyo Electric Power Company, and Xinghuan Trade reached an agreement to expand the import of electricity. According to Japan's electricity usage data for the last year, Xinghuan Trade has successfully monopolized 20% of our 'little friend' Japan's national electricity."  When these words were spoken, those present exchanged glances, and even a hint of surprise flashed in Daniel's eyes. "These two pieces of news have not yet entered the disclosure cycle; you may not have received the information yet. I owe my information to a certain cabinet official."  Here, old Rockefeller glanced meaningfully at all present, "I believe I don't need to say much; you may already have felt it."  "We are losing control over the situation in Asia."  As soon as these words were uttered, the room was in an uproar. Everyone present was a representative of major consortia, the financial tycoons of Wall Street, and with their intelligence and instincts, it was obvious that they could see this point. It's just that recently everyone's energy had been drawn to Europe, all wracking their brains to bite off a bigger piece from Rothschild, so much so that no one paid attention to the other side of the Earth.  "The hegemonic position of the dollar is being shaken; perhaps letting the Freemasons fall so quickly was a mistake."  "What else can we do? Are we to pull them out of their graves?"  "Perhaps we can support the Krupp consortium; as long as there's a new rival to contain the Future Group—"  "That's even more unrealistic."  Interrupting the discussion, Daniel shook his head, crossing his fingers in front of his chin. Previously still immersed in the joy of victory, he had now become aware of the looming crisis facing the WASP consortium, "We must check the continued expansion of Xinghuan Trade's influence. The bad signs have already appeared; if we allow their global electric grid plan to proceed, we will become increasingly passive."  "Exactly." Rockefeller nodded, glancing around at those present, "I know that many of you have cooperated with the Future Group in various fields, but if they shake the foundation of the dollar, I think you all very well understand what that means."  Wall Street's financial empire is built on the dollar. With the two levers of exchange rate and market, Wall Street's giants have plundered the world for nearly a century. Once the dollar loses its "world currency" aura, central banks around the world will open the floodgates to reduce their dollar holdings, and every bill issued by the Federal Reserve will become worthless paper, and Wall Street's financial empire built on paper will become worthless overnight.  In the two hours following the meeting, including Daniel, everyone had completely sobered up from the joy of victory. The Jewish financial consortium had fallen, yet the wolves that bit them to death were not yet sated, and at this moment, they were already eyeing the other side of the Pacific.  When everyone's interests were threatened, the WASP consortium united like never before and spent these two hours formulating a plan to encircle and blockade Xinghuan Trade's "global electric grid plan."  After the meeting, representatives of the major consortia got up and left their seats, hurrying towards the door. However, Daniel Morgan, the host of the meeting, did not get up but leaned back in his chair, lost in thought.  At that moment, he suddenly remembered the phone call he had with Carmen a month ago. At that time, the former financial overlord, the Rothschild family, humbly sought his help, but he almost immediately refused Carmen without hesitation.  "...On the contrary, I am absolutely certain that one day in the future I will be glad of the choice I made today... right?" His fingers tapped lightly on the table surface as Daniel murmured the line he had once said, his tone now carrying a hint of hesitation, no longer as decisive as before.  (To be continued.) 
Chapter 1303: As Long As You (1)  "What are you doing?!" The elder of the Donggong family tapped his cane, his voice filled with anger.  "Our ancestor is about to arrive, please be patient, Elder Donggong. You'll know what we're doing in a moment," the leading man replied.  Elder Donggong naturally knew who the 'ancestor' referred to in his mouth was. He was somewhat at a loss, not knowing why Pei Yi would come. Having a feud with DK was not a good thing. Although everyone in the country R wanted to drive DK out, it was simply not possible. It was just wishful thinking.  A few minutes later, Pei Yi's car arrived. He got out of the car and looked towards another car not far away. An Xiao Ning saw him and got out of her car without taking off her mask and wig. Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind.  "You're here," An Xiao Ning spoke up.  Pei Yi looked her up and down, rarely smiling, walked up to her, leaned in a few inches, and said in a low voice, "Hey, with this look, these people would hardly guess it's you, right?"  "Of course, I don't want them to know my identity, that's why I asked you to come. It's not the right time yet."  Pei Yi subconsciously glanced at Wu Lianzhi, "Why are you with him?"  "I have something to do."  He stood up straight, turned around, and with a faint smile on his face, said to the Donggong family's people, "I don't know where my sister has offended the Donggong family clan to the point of wanting to kill her? Have you grown so bold?"  Upon hearing this, the faces of the Donggong family's people changed instantly. Pei Yi's sister? Where did Pei Yi get a sister?  Elder Donggong spoke up, "Mr. Pei's sister... we really don't know anything about that."  "Now that you don't know, I'm telling you," Pei Yi said coldly, "Do you hear me clearly?"  "Since Mr. Pei said this is your cousin, please take your cousin away. As for Donggong Lianzhi, his name is still in our family genealogy; we have not yet disowned this rebellious grandson, he is still a person of our Donggong family. How we deal with him is our family's internal affair."  Before Pei Yi could answer, An Xiao Ning took the opportunity to call out to him, "Brother, he is my boyfriend, and I have his child in my belly, you can't leave him behind."  Pei Yi originally wanted to take her away only, but now it seemed a little tricky. However, being overbearing was his style, and if he wanted to do something, such a small matter was not a problem at all.  "Old lady, you heard it too. This one... is also considered my brother-in-law now. They even have a child. Giving him to you would make the child fatherless in the future. Do you think I would agree?"  Elder Donggong was very clear that letting Pei Yi take the person away meant that they would no longer be able to deal with their grandson openly in the future. So, despite some fear of DK's power, her attitude could not be weakened.  "Mr. Pei, I'm afraid this won't do. Our family has our own family laws. When it comes to dealing with our own people, outsiders are not allowed to interfere."  "I've said it, he's the father of my sister's child in her belly. Are you getting old and deaf?" Pei Yi turned his gaze to Wu Lianzhi, "You say, are you a person of the Donggong family?"  "This morning, when my mother sent me poisoned food, I broke off the mother-son relationship with her on the spot. Before that, when the Donggong family tried to design me, Miss An, and her subordinates into accidental deaths, I was already clear. Although the name Donggong Lianzhi is still in the family genealogy and the household register of the Donggong family, I no longer bear the surname Donggong. My name is now Wu Lianzhi, and I am no longer a person of the Donggong family!"  His words were powerful and cold. Declaring such a statement in front of so many people showed his determination.  "This is not for you to decide!" Elder Donggong said, "Once you enter our Donggong door, alive you are our people, dead you are our ghost!"  "Then, Elder Donggong, I want to ask you, you know that your plot to murder Miss An is already known to her, and you still have the mood to want to punish and deal with me here, aren't you worried about the serious representations from country S?" This was said by Wu Lianzhi with a strange tone, without any fear.  "I have dealt with An Xiao Ning before," said Pei Yi with a slight smile. "She is the type to hold a grudge. You want her life; can she let it go easily? Alright, let's not waste words, my time is quite precious, I'll take both of them away."  Seeing that the Donggong family's people wanted to speak again, he added another sentence, "Unless you want to see blood here."  And so, the Donggong family's people watched as the duck that was already cooked flew away completely. Elder Donggong and the patriarch were really not okay.  In the end, Elder Donggong gave the order directly, "Forget it, remove his name from the register, and also destroy his household registration!"  ---  "We need to return to country S."  Pei Yi glanced at her, "Use and then leave? Didn't you say you'd agree to one of my requests? I haven't even mentioned it yet, and you’re talking about going back to the country?"  "I am in a hurry to return to the country for something, but I do promise you one request, so speak, what is it?"  "Well, my request might be a bit difficult for you..."  "Then don't mention it, propose one that you think won't be difficult for me."  Pei Yi turned to face her, staring intently, "You really haven't changed at all, accompany me for half a month."  "What kind of companionship?"  "Just like before."  An Xiao Ning looked at him, "No, first, I can't be chained, my freedom cannot be restricted, and second, half a month is too long, two days are possible."  "..." Pei Yi's smile slightly faded, "You're cutting the price too much, five days, not less. You said others could make a request, and when they do, you can't go back on your word. I will definitely give you freedom."  "Then can I go back to the country first?"  "No."  "..."  Wu Lianzhi, who was inside the car, listening to the two's conversation, really felt that these two people might be having an affair. Could these two have an unclear relationship? It sounded like it. But if that was the case, the two of them were too unguarded in front of him.  "Then let him go back to country S first, I'll be at your place alone, okay?"  "I won't do anything to you guys, let's go together."  His tone left no room for doubt.  An Xiao Ning didn't say anything more. Since it wasn't far from Qingping Mountain, they arrived quickly. Coming to this place again, there were indeed many mixed feelings. When Qin Guo saw her that instant, she was really unhappy. As they entered, she immediately rolled her eyes, thinking how her ancestor brought this calamity back again. Chapter 1304: As Long as You're Here (2)  After sending in the snacks and tea, Qin Guo couldn't help but ask, "Ancestor, who is this..."   "What's your name?" Pei Yi asked.  "Wu Lianzhi, I remember I told you already."  "I didn't pay attention." Pei Yi spoke indifferently, then told Qin Guo, "Arrange a room for him."  "Okay, but do we need to arrange one for Miss An?"  "No need."  Wu Lianzhi confirmed the guess in his heart; it seemed he was going to live with An Xiaoning.   An Xiaoning noticed that Wu Lianzhi was looking at her and Pei Yi in a strange way and immediately realized that he must have misunderstood something. For some reason, she didn't want anyone to misunderstand her relationship with another man.  Except for Jin Qingyan.  Thinking of her own man, she really had no solution.  "Lianzhi, come out with me for a bit, I have something to tell you."  "Okay."  Once they were outside, she asked in a low voice, "Did you misunderstand my relationship with Pei Yi?"  "Are you not..."  "Of course not. I usually sleep on the sofa where I was sitting just now. In the past, when he locked my hands and feet, I also slept on the sofa every day."  "Does he like you?"  "Don't talk nonsense." An Xiaoning patted his shoulder, "We'll stay here for five days, then go back."  "Okay."  ---  These past few days, Fang Erlan was extremely busy, having to make up for missed scenes and do promotions. Every day, from the moment she opened her eyes, she was busy until she went to sleep, and it was exhausting.  Despite Xiao Chenyang trying to nourish her every day, she still lost several pounds.  "These next few days, I'm afraid I won't be able to accompany you," Xiao Chenyang said after reading the message sent by An Xiaoning.  "What are you going to do?"  Xiao Chenyang had not told her about Jin Qingyan's dual personalities. He didn't want to keep it from her, but he knew that the fewer people who knew about it, the better. "There's something very important to do. I'll be back as soon as possible."  "I'll come with you."  "Aren't you still filming and doing promotions?"  "I can continue when I come back."  Xiao Chenyang reached out and touched her head. The more she worried about him, the more she depended on him, the happier he became. "I really wish you could come with me because it's the safest when you're with me. But not this time."  "What exactly are you going to do?" Fang Erlan pressed, "If you don't tell me, I won't let you go."  Seeing her worried, Xiao Chenyang said, "Then you must keep it a secret, absolutely must not tell anyone."  "Of course, I won't tell anyone."  Xiao Chenyang said gravely, "Qingyan has run away."  "Run away... what do you mean?"  "He has a dual personality. His second personality has run off, and we don't know where he is. We can't find him in the country, he might have gone abroad, we don't know which country. So, I need to get people to search for him. And An Xiaoning is in DK now, I need to go to Country R, because there's someone like me there, a person from the Wu family."  "Who is the person from the Wu family?"  Xiao Chenyang explained, "Our country's former witchcraft family, they had once cursed An Xiaoning and Qingyan. Then for some reason, they disappeared. Now that we've found them, their descendants haven't inherited their family's witchcraft. Instead, we found someone like me, this person must understand witchcraft. It would be better if we could capture him, if not, at least we can't let him live."  Fang Erlan felt like she was listening to a tale of wonders, "Sister Xiaoning won't be in trouble, right?"  "Hmm, they said it's fine, she'll return to the country after a few days."  "Then you go, I won't come with you, lest you get distracted by having to look after me. I'll ask Sister Yangyang to send over a few more bodyguards."  Xiao Chenyang ran his hand through her hair, "I just don't know when Qingyan will get better."  "Isn't he your senior brother? Why do you call him by his name instead of 'senior brother'?"  "I like it. I rarely called him 'senior brother' before. I usually did so when Master was present, but not much in private. I always called him by his name, since we grew up together and are close."  "I can't say anything to you."  Xiao Chenyang gave her a kiss, "I'll leave when the bodyguards arrive. Now call Sister Yangyang, and I'll explain to her."  "Okay."  Fang Erlan took out her phone and called Mei Yangyang.  "Sister, Chenyang has something to say to you."  Mei Yangyang responded, "Okay."  Fang Erlan handed the phone to Xiao Chenyang, who then put it to his ear, "I have important things to do and won't be by Erlan's side these few days. Send over eight bodyguards."  Fang Erlan immediately said, "That's too many, four will do."  "Not enough," he didn't listen, "Just have them come over now."  "Okay, I'll send people over now."  "Okay."  Xiao Chenyang hung up and specifically instructed her, "While I'm not at home these next few days, eat well, rest well, get to sleep as soon as you finish work, and don't play with your phone at night. It's bad for your eyes."  "I know."  ---  Knowing that Xiao Chenyang had come to Country R, An Xiaoning felt somewhat relieved, hoping to quickly find Jin Qingyan.  Two days at Qingping Mountain, she didn't spend her time folding paper cranes as she used to, but instead sat on the cashmere carpet on the ground practicing yoga.  While Pei Yi was working, he saw her performing various yoga poses, occasionally glancing up at her. Even without much interaction, having someone in the room made him feel a lot better.  "Now that DK has lost Xi Hou Jiaping, who's in charge?"  "Since DK was founded by him, although he's gone, there's no one capable of filling that position."  He looked at his computer while speaking, "Will you remarry Jin Qingyan?"  An Xiaoning twisted her body around, sat cross-legged, and faced him, "Actually, it's the same whether we remarry or not."  She wanted to affirm that they would remarry, but thinking of the curse, she truly didn't know what to say.  "How can it be the same?" He disagreed, "A marriage contract is the best proof of the relationship between two people. When others address you, they will refer to you more as Mrs. Jin rather than Miss An."  "Anyway, we will be together."  Pei Yi asked, "Do you know why I kept you here?"  "Your life is too dull and boring; you need me as a mood enhancer."  "An Xiaoning, can you not be so smart?"  "I can't help it, I was born this way."  "......" He pursed his lips and smiled, "That's not the only reason."  "Is there another reason?"  "If your heart wasn't already taken, I would have liked to make you my woman."  "Don't you have a fear of germs? How could you be interested in someone like me?"  "A truly charming woman, when she attracts a man's attention, what he sees is not those things, but her essence. Just like when I look at you, I automatically ignore those things and only see you for who you are." Chapter 1305: As Long As You (3)  Pei Yi looked up at her, "An Xiaoning, I greatly admire you and want to become friends with you, the kind that can meet often. Are you willing?"  An Xiaoning stood up from the blanket and sat down on the chair opposite his desk, wearing socks. She casually propped her chin with her hand, "Your identity is the head of the DK division, while my other identity is the daughter of the President's wife of Country S. Such two people becoming friends, in the eyes of others, would become a colluding group with interests, right?"  "So you... are unwilling?"  An Xiaoning looked at him, "Pei Yi, I also admire you very much, you really are charming, and I'm being honest, not just because you said the things I like to hear. You're very capable, but I have a principle, do you know what it is?"  "What principle?"  "Not to be friends with anyone from a terrorist organization, even if they have saved me. It's not prejudice, because many so-called decent people are also wantonly killing, for example, the Donggong family. Pei Yi, my wish is for world peace, although I know this day may never come, although I know it might take a very, very long time, but I don’t want this world to have wars that sacrifice the civilians anymore. Plus, I can't bear the rumors of colluding with DK. My parents are the President and the First Lady, I can't bring pressure to them. Because of my identity, if some people with ulterior motives make a big deal out of it, it will be hard to settle later."  Pei Yi nodded, "I know all that you've said."  "If, I mean if, one day you leave DK, I think, we can be very good friends. For now, it's better to keep the relationship as it is."  She thought he would say he would never leave DK, but he answered, "In the future, who knows."  After lunch, Pei Yi had to go out for something, leaving only her and Wu Lianzhi in the house. There were surveillance cameras everywhere, and although this was Pei Yi's office, the two of them wouldn't easily touch his things.  Qin Guo saw the two leisurely playing cards, and she had to personally serve tea and water, feeling very indignant in her heart.  "What are you dazing for? Go get me some cake, I want to eat cake."  Qin Guo said displeased, "May I ask, Miss An, do you think this is your own home?"  "If you won't get it, then?"  Qin Guo turned and left, muttering under her breath, "Eat cake and get fat to death."  After bringing the cake, she couldn't help but say, "I don't know what our ancestor brought you back for, just to eat, drink, and have fun."  "You should ask your ancestor that, how would I know?" An Xiaoning looked at her with a smile, "Miss Qin, if you're free, why don't you join us for cards?"  Qin Guo didn't speak.  "What's the matter, unwilling?"  "If our ancestor finds out..."  "It's fine, I will talk to him, you're free anyway."  Hearing her say this, Qin Guo said arrogantly, "All right, since Miss An has invited me so kindly, I will join you for a few rounds."  An Xiaoning really wanted to throw back at her, 'like to play or not, I'm giving you face...' but considering it was someone else's territory, she decided to let it go.  During the game, Qin Guo asked out of curiosity, "Miss An, do you like our ancestor?"  "Do you hope I like him or hope I don't?"  "I'm asking you, do you like him?"  "Why should I tell you my true feelings?"  Her statement successfully choked Qin Guo, who pursed her lips, "If you don't like our ancestor, please don't lure him in. He may seem cold and casual, but in fact, he takes things very seriously in his heart."  "Lure him? Child, you're overthinking. I have no romantic relationship with him."  Hearing this directly from her, Qin Guo immediately followed up, "Really? Is that really true?"  "Are you in love with him?"  Qin Guo denied, "Not at all, we are not qualified to covet our ancestor."  "That's right, he doesn't seem to be your type."  Qin Guo: "......"  "He should like two types of women."  "Which two types?"  "The first type, a simple girl without any craftiness or schemes. The second type, a strong, capable woman with her own thoughts, a woman who can catch his attention. Are you one of them?"  Qin Guo shook her head, "No."  "Then that settles it."  "Miss Qin, why did you join DK?"  "There's no reason, my whole family joined, why should I be an outsider?"  "You really have no opinion of your own. Just because your whole family joined, does it mean it's right? When your mother gave birth to you, did she forget your brain in her stomach?"  "......"  "What are you looking at? Am I wrong?"  "Miss An, your mouth is really poisonous."  "......"  ---  During the five days at Pei Yi's place, An Xiaoning was very calm and relaxed.  Although she was a bit tense in her thoughts, what mattered most was her own feelings.  Five days seemed not short, but it passed in the blink of an eye. For Pei Yi, five days was too short.  Even though it was too short, he would keep his promise and let An Xiaoning go back.  An Xiaoning was thinking of going back, but she received a call from Xiao Chenyang, telling her that Henry's whereabouts were discovered in Country R.  So, the two went to meet with Xiao Chenyang.  Xiao Chenyang opened the door and was surprised to see Wu Lianzhi, "So it's really you."  "Do we know each other?"  "Pfft." Xiao Chenyang suddenly laughed.  Wu Lianzhi looked at An Xiaoning, "What's wrong with him?"  "I've never seen him like this before, probably having a fit?" An Xiaoning said as she walked inside.  Wu Lianzhi followed inside, and after Xiao Chenyang had closed the door and laughed enough, he twisted open a bottle of mineral water and took a few sips before saying, "I had guessed it was him long ago, but seeing him in person today really feels like a long-awaited sight."  "It looks like you know who he is, which saves me from having to introduce in detail."  "An Xiaoning, you really have no impression of him at all?"  "None."  Xiao Chenyang sat back on the sofa, his long legs naturally crossed on the coffee table, and said with a smile, "The Wu family has produced such a talent, of course, I have some memory of him."  "Don't beat around the bush, just tell me."  "I heard he's a friend with whom you have a good relationship."  An Xiaoning thought it was something, "I already knew that early on, did you laugh for so long just because of this? I don't see why it's funny."  "Ah... I laughed because I thought of Long Tianze, it was thinking about Long Tianze's desperate expression that made me laugh."  "What does it have to do with Young Master Long..."  "It seems that when you recalled your past life, you only remembered things about you and your man. You didn't really consider others."  (Note: Some parts of the text may be incoherent or out of context as it's an excerpt from a larger narrative, and without the full context, it may be challenging to provide a translation that fully captures the original meaning or intent.) Chapter 1306: As Long As You (4)  An Xiaoning nodded, "It seems to be the case, go on and tell me."  "He and the person from the Long Tianze family's previous life were lovers, it was Yu Jiao."  An Xiaoning widened her eyes, "Are you lying to me?"  "Would I lie to you for a meal? Because our Western Marquis has been jealous of him a few times, occasionally bringing it up, saying that the one he liked was not you, but the maid by your side."  "..."  Wu Lianzhi probably understood the meaning of his words, "Who is Yu Jiao?"  An Xiaoning chuckled dryly, "In the previous life, she was the maid by my side."  "What about this life?"  "In this life, she is already married with children. Her husband is called Long Tianze, and he is the owner of an advertising company, entertainment company, and film production company on our side."  Wu Lianzhi nodded, "Mr. Xiao, did Yu Jiao and I get together in the previous life?"  "They were lovers, but you definitely didn't end up together because I know about your death. You were dealt with by your own Wu family."  "So that's how it is, but that's already a matter of the past. Xiaoning, is Yu Jiao living well now?"  "Mhm, very well. Her husband adores her, and they have a pair of children, living very happily."  "That's good."  Wu Lianzhi was very open-minded, "The matters of the past, since we didn't meet early in this life, it means our fate has already ended in the last life. It's enough that she is happy in this life. But, do you have a photo?"  "Yes."  An Xiaoning opened the photo album on her phone and found a beaming photo to show him, "This is her, in this life she is called Mei Yangyang."  Wu Lianzhi looked and smiled knowingly, "She's quite pretty."  "Right? Her daughter looks super like her, both with little bun faces."  "Xiaoning."  "Hm?"  "Don't tell her about our relationship in the past life, and don't tell her husband either. It's good this way. I don't want to disturb their peaceful life because of me."  An Xiaoning didn't expect him to be so considerate of Mei Yangyang, "Since you've said so, let's not mention it then. Just like you said, you have no fate in this life, might as well each live well on your own."  After finishing this topic, it was time to talk business.  "Have you found him?"  "I've already sent people to catch him. We've found him, and soon we'll be able to bring him back for questioning."  Xiao Chenyang returned to his usual manner, "But did he specifically come here to look for you?"  "I don't think so? I'm not sure. But have you been to the Donggong family's mansion?"  "I have. I confronted that so-called elder once. I thought he would be really powerful, but he was laid out after a few moves. I've already brought him back to country S."  "..."  An Xiaoning gave a thumbs up, "Awesome, really cool."  "Thanks for the praise."  Xiao Chenyang took the opportunity to talk about Er Lan, "Your studio should cultivate new talent, Er Lan won't act after this drama."  "We're already preparing. Yangyang and I have already guessed you would do this. But when do you plan to get married?"  "I haven't thought about it yet. This can't be rushed. A wedding is a serious matter and must be well-prepared. Originally, I thought life was a matter between the two of us, and we didn't need to share too much with others, just inviting some close friends and relatives would be enough. But now I've changed my mind. On the wedding day, I want the whole world to know that she is my woman."  "Yo yo yo," An Xiaoning praised, "So it's going to be that grand. Are you planning to spend all your fortune that day?"  "Do you know how much fortune I have?"  "Five hundred billion?"  Xiao Chenyang opened the bottle on the table and poured three cups, "You really underestimate me. I'll drink to this, you do as you please."  Saying that, he slowly brought it to his lips.  An Xiaoning handed a cup to Wu Lianzhi and then picked up another cup and began to drink slowly, "Where did you get so much money?"  "Stolen."  "Psht... who are you fooling?"  "Then where else would my money come from?"  An Xiaoning stared at him for a few seconds, then quickly pulled out her phone, "I believe Er Lan doesn't know about this either. I have to report this to her. I don't know what her reaction will be."  Xiao Chenyang grabbed her wrist, "I was wrong."  "Less tricks, more sincerity, okay?"  "In the past, besides hibernating, in order to fulfill my heart, I was doing business while looking for Er Lan. I was involved in various businesses, like a long time ago, our Xiao family was originally a big business family. Moreover, with three older sisters, I am the youngest and the only son in the family, all the family assets would be mine anyway. I was involved in many types of businesses, and then it grew bigger and bigger, and in the past few decades, I have also focused on investing in jewelry, gold, real estate, and made a lot. Then I timely stopped. I'll go back and explain this to Er Lan, she indeed doesn't know for now."  "When did you stop with real estate?"  "The year before last."  "Capitalist, oh capitalist," An Xiaoning lamented, "I really did underestimate you. But it's good that you stopped in time. Some businessmen never stop for their whole life."  "How much money is enough to earn? I've started to register a household in country S recently. It's really troublesome not to have a household registration here."  "Where is your current household registration?"  "Country Y. Every few decades, I have to cancel and re-register the household registration. I can just transfer it from abroad."  An Xiaoning turned to look at Wu Lianzhi, "Do you have any plans for your future?"  "Not yet."  "You can start thinking now. Didn't you hear him? The elder of the Donggong family, Wu Haigang, has already been taken back to country S. I believe your family will soon come to look for me in person in the country. They will definitely think it was my doing. I will mention your matter by the way, so you can plan for your future now."  "I think... I want to find a woman who likes me and whom I also like, to live a peaceful life together."  "You will find one."  ...  The three of them were waiting for the news from Xiao Chenyang's subordinates. After two hours, they finally received specific news about the whereabouts. Initially, they were going to capture him and bring him back, but since they couldn't subdue him, he ran away. At this time, they could only rush over from the hotel.  Upon seeing his figure, An Xiaoning immediately tore off her mask, "Henry!"  Henry, who was far away, was startled and turned around, seeing her.  An Xiaoning ran towards him, and he stood still.  "Didn't I tell you not to cause trouble? Why don't you listen?"  "I just felt it was too boring at home and wanted to go out for a bit."  "If you wanted to go out, couldn't you bring someone with you? You could go anywhere you wanted."  An Xiaoning tried to reach out to hold his arm but was subtly avoided by him.  "They are all over trying to catch me, making me feel like a criminal suspect." Chapter 1307: Just You (5)  An Xiao Ning forcibly clung to his arm, fearing that he would become restless and try to run away again, “I was just afraid that you would cause trouble, which is why I wanted to find you quickly.”  “Why did he come too?”  “It’s all because of you.”  Henry didn't say anything else, and went with her towards Xiao Chen Yang.  ---  Fan Shi Xin finally breathed a sigh of relief when he knew Henry had been found. He rubbed his temples; from the moment he ran away until now, his nerves hadn't had a moment of rest. After taking a short break, he then called Xiao Huang over.  “Captain, you were looking for me.”  “Take He Yi to the duty room, I’ll be right there.”  “Okay.”  Fan Shi Xin took a shower and changed into a new set of clothes before heading out.  He Yi had been locked up in the basement until now when he finally saw the light of day again. He appeared very disheveled, nothing like the state and appearance he had when he was locked up.  Fan Shi Xin looked at him, “Not just anyone can scheme against our family's young madam. You were even our young master's high school classmate. This time, our young madam said she would spare you this once; there will be no next time, and definitely no repetition. You can go now.”  The people detaining He Yi immediately let go of their grip.  He Yi straightened himself up, knowing it wasn't the time to show off his abilities, and left without saying anything.  Xiao Huang asked, “Captain, why did you let him go? Weren’t those people at the police station all sentenced to death? Shouldn’t he be sentenced to a few years too?”  “The young madam ordered it, but his case is different from those who are sentenced to death,” Fan Shi Xin calmly explained. “At most, he’s a coerced first-time offender who didn’t succeed in his plans, and a lesson has been taught. The other seven or eight people are agents of the Donggong family placed in S country to collect intelligence. Our country takes serious actions against such people. If He Yi was also sent from abroad, I believe our young madam would not let him off either.”  “Captain, you haven’t dried your hair yet, did you take a shower?”  “Yes, what about it?”  “You took a shower and changed clothes.” Xiao Huang asked with delight, touching his chin, “Captain, are you going on a date?”  “What, are you jealous?” He laughed, “I understand. For a perennial bachelor like you, seeing someone else going on a date is a lethal psychological blow.”  “Captain, can you not rub salt in the wound?!” Xiao Huang wailed.  “Alright, I’m leaving.” Fan Shi Xin glanced at the time and went out directly.  From the trip to R country to the discovery that Henry was missing, and until now, there were several times when Wu Pingyang asked to meet him, but he had always declined, saying he was busy and didn’t have time to go out on a date with her. So now that he suddenly had some free time, he naturally wanted to make it up to her. He was planning to go find her. Because he wanted to buy a gift for her, he didn’t call her directly.  The hospital where Wu Pingyang worked was A City's No.1 People's Hospital. Fan Shi Xin held a box of red roses in his hand. Thinking that all girls like flowers, he bought this as a gift for his girlfriend.  After reaching the second floor, he saw the sign for the dental department and went over with the gift box.  At the moment, Wu Pingyang was fitting a teenage boy with braces and didn’t notice his arrival. The other doctors saw him first and greeted him with a smile, “It's Captain Fan, isn't it?”  “Hello.”  Hearing his voice, Wu Pingyang finally looked up and saw him. She was overjoyed and said hurriedly, “I’ll be done soon, take a seat first.”  “Okay.” Fan Shi Xin sat down, noticing the surrounding doctors and assistants staring at him, making him quite uncomfortable.  This was the first time Fan Shi Xin watched his girlfriend at work. She was wearing a white coat and a blue mask, busily working with precision, which added a certain charm to her.  After she finished her work, basking in the envy of her female colleagues, she felt particularly proud and elated. She quickly removed her mask and coat, “Why are you here?”  “I’ve been quite busy these past days, so now I have some time to come see you, this is for you.”  Wu Pingyang hurriedly took the gift box, opened it, and saw it was full of red roses, joy lit up her face, “So pretty, are you free this afternoon?”  “Yes, I should be.”  “Great, I actually had a half-day off just for you, my family wants to meet you.”  Wu Pingyang covered the gift box, then gently took his hand, “Let’s go outside to talk.”  “Okay.”  The two of them went out together, and Fan Shi Xin asked, “Your family asked to meet me?”  “Yes, they asked when you are free, and they want to have a meal with you at home. I told them you were busy the past few days.”  “Then let’s go to your house this afternoon, and have dinner there in the evening.”  Seeing him agree, Wu Pingyang was thrilled. She was actually afraid he would refuse, because she had confidently assured her grandfather that he would definitely come.  “Okay, I’ll call my family right now to let them know.”  “Alright.”  Wu Pingyang immediately called her family to share the news. After hanging up, she excitedly told Fan Shi Xin, “We’re going to my grandfather's house. Have you thought about what gifts to bring?”  “Not yet.”  “My grandfather loves that famous liquor from B city, I forget the English name, but it's that very fragrant blue liquid.”  “Right, that's the one. My grandfather always talks about it. If you bring that when you go, he will be extremely happy.”  “That..." Fan Shi Xin couldn't help but remind her, “One bottle of that liquor is two hundred thousand, and it seems to be out of production now, basically a collector's item. I’m afraid it might not even be available for twenty thousand. The factory is not producing it anymore, should we consider something else?”  It was his first time meeting the girl's family, and naturally, he should bring a gift, which he understood. But to bring something so expensive, he felt it might give the wrong impression, making it seem like he was a wealthy young master who throws around money carelessly. In fact, he was not a rich young master, although he had a car and a house and earned two hundred thousand a month, but his background was not like that of Long Tianze, Ling Ci Ye, or Jin Qing Yan. His parents both worked at the Jin family's old house, working hard every day.  Hearing his words, Wu Pingyang became somewhat unhappy, “What's wrong with a bottle of wine costing two hundred thousand? My grandfather can drink it for a long time, what’s wrong with honoring him? Besides, we’re only buying it this once. After we get married, the money spent will be returned through the wedding gifts, won’t it?”  “There are many ways to honor elders, and it doesn't have to be with money.”  Fan Shi Xin directly refused, “I will take care of the gift, you don’t need to worry about it.”  Wu Pingyang was at a loss for words and after a pause asked, “Then what are you going to buy?”  “I’ll see this afternoon.” Chapter 1308: As Long As You (6)  Wu Pingyang also did not dare to easily anger him, so he did not bring up the matter again, "This time the main members of our family will probably all be present, don't be restrained when you come."  "I won't." He had seen all sorts of situations, so seeing a few people was nothing, "But why not go directly to your parents' house?"  "Mainly because my grandfather wants to meet you. My mom said to arrange for the meeting at my grandfather's house."  Wu Pingyang gave him a heads-up, "If my family brings up the topic of marriage... how do you plan to respond to them?"  "After we've dated longer and understand each other better, it's not too late to talk about marriage. I'm courting with the intention of marrying, but it can't be too hasty; after all, marriage is a lifelong matter."  Wu Pingyang nodded, "Then where shall we go now?"  "Where do you want to go?"  "Let's go to the Winnie District."  "Okay."  He took her back to the Winnie District. Just as they got out of the car, she glanced at the main villa, "Shixin, can you take me to have a look? I really want to know what Mr. Jin's house looks like."  Fan Shixin hesitated a bit, "Generally, our young master doesn't allow outsiders to go to his house, unless it's with his permission or if they are friends or something. But since you are my girlfriend, we can only have a look at the living room, upstairs is off-limits."  Not wanting to make things difficult for him, she obediently nodded, "Okay."  Fan Shixin held her hand as they walked over. Just as they reached the entrance, Wu Pingyang exclaimed as she saw the inside of the house, "Wow, it really is magnificent!"  "Come in." He stepped in first.  Wu Pingyang followed him in, looking around. The last time she came here, she only visited his residence and never dared to come here to look around.  Not knowing until she saw it, her heart was pounding; it was so luxurious. If she could be fortunate enough to live in such a house in this life, she would die without regrets!  After looking around, she still wanted to go upstairs but resisted, as she had already promised him.  After leaving, Wu Pingyang asked in a low voice, "Shixin, who was the aunt we saw just now?"  "She's Aunt Chen, she's in charge of the kitchen, responsible for cooking. Her culinary skills are top-notch."  "I see."  Seeing that it was almost noon, Fan Shixin asked her, "Do you want to have lunch here or shall I take you to a restaurant outside?"  "Let's eat here, no need to trouble going out."  "What would you like to eat?" he asked again.  "Do I have a choice of anything I want?" Wu Pingyang looked up, "I want to eat something delicious."  "Let's hear it, if possible, I will try to satisfy your wish."  "I would like to have red wine and steak."  Fan Shixin nodded, "Okay, I'll go tell the kitchen. You go wait for me in the duty room."  "Okay."  She obediently walked towards the duty room while Fan Shixin went to inform the kitchen and also called An Xiaoning.  At this time, the R country was in the middle of the night, and An Xiaoning had not yet gone to sleep.  "Madam, have you slept yet?"  "Not yet, what's up, Shixin?"  Fan Shixin thought for a moment and said, "Today my girlfriend asked me to have dinner at her house, what kind of gifts should I bring when I go?"  "You should prepare two sets, for her parents."  "It's not just her parents..." Fan Shixin coughed dryly, "She asked me to go to her grandfather's house, the Mu family."  "Isn't the first time usually to meet the parents? If you're going to her grandfather's house, then the gifts you prepare shouldn't be too simple, after all, her parents, her uncles and aunts, her grandfather and the like. I think it's best not to meet these relatives of hers until you have discussed marriage. If you have to meet them every now and then, won't you go bankrupt?"  "Today, she said her grandfather likes to drink Blueocean and asked me to buy a bottle for him, saying the old master would definitely be very happy."  "This girl, how impractical," An Xiaoning said with a laugh in her voice, "You've only just become boyfriend and girlfriend for a short while, not even married yet, there's no need for this. How about this, go to our cellar and bring a bottle of wine worth twenty or thirty thousand for her grandfather. See how many uncles she has, and bring some good cigarettes as well, and also take some for her father. One pack of cigarettes per person, fair and equal. You don't need to buy them specially, just take them from our house, that's already quite a lot. Usually, in ordinary households, the man only buys things worth a few hundred or a thousand, you're already spending tens of thousands, that should be enough."  Fan Shixin felt she made sense, "Okay, thanks madam."  "Remember to wear formal attire when you go."  "Got it."  After hanging up the phone, Fan Shixin immediately went to prepare.  He carefully packaged it with a gift bag.  Then, carrying it, he went to the duty room.  Seeing him holding a gift bag, Wu Pingyang quickly asked, "What's that?"  "Wine and cigarettes, prepared for your grandfather and your uncles."  "What about my mom and my aunts?"  Fan Shixin replied, "There's no need to buy something for everyone, it's not an engagement or a wedding, just bringing the general gifts is fine."  "How can you buy for men and not for women? What will my aunts and my mom think? Moreover, this is your first time visiting, how can you be so casual?"  "How is it casual? These are worth fifty or sixty thousand. Am I being casual if I bring gifts worth fifty or sixty thousand the first time I visit? They're quite valuable."  Fan Shixin asked, "Do you expect me to bring gifts worth over a hundred thousand the first time I visit?"  Wu Pingyang bit her lip and looked at him, "You just don't care about me. I didn't ask you to bring gifts worth tens of thousands for my mom and my aunts, but at the very least, you should buy something to show some gesture, right?"  Suppressing the different emotions in his heart, Fan Shixin said, "Fine, I'll buy some gifts on the way there."  Under normal circumstances, Wu Pingyang would have left already, but she knew she couldn't mess this up, otherwise her family would not let her off easily.  Holding back her temper, she said, "Okay, I'm hungry."  "I'll take you to eat."  "Okay."  This was Fan Shixin's first visit to the Mu family, and somehow, he did not have a good feeling about any of them: Wu Pingyang's grandfather, parents, uncles, and aunts. Their gazes seemed too revealing, as if they wanted to say something, and he could clearly see what they were expecting.  He was reserved in character and not good at speaking in front of strangers. He originally thought that he had seen all sorts of situations and meeting her family would be nothing, but when he was actually there, he realized that spending an afternoon and even an evening with a group of people who asked all sorts of questions was simply torture.  They even inquired about topics that should not be touched, from business matters to Jin Qingyan and An Xiaoning's affairs, all of which he avoided discussing. It was clear they were disappointed, not having heard particularly useful information from him. Chapter 1309: All I Want Is You (7)  Wu Pingyang looked at her grandfather with a bit of disappointment, feeling as if her face instantly lost its luster. She whispered to Fan Shixin beside her, "When grandfather asks you something, can't you just go along with his wishes? You don't say anything, which is quite boring."  Fan Shixin looked at her, sticking to his principles, "They always ask about things I cannot discuss. What can I do? There are matters that cannot be disclosed; these are my rules."  "That's no fun," Wu Pingyang muttered softly, feeling that he was completely different from the kind of man she had imagined.  "What did you say?" Fan Shixin frowned, catching a glimpse of impatience on her face in that moment.  "Nothing."  Fan Shixin wanted to leave immediately, but since he had come, he endured and stayed until the evening.  During the meal, people at the table kept toasting him. Even though he could hold his liquor well, drinking a lot inevitably led to some drunkenness. He repeatedly waved his hands saying he could not drink anymore, as he had driven there, but Wu Pingyang's uncle insisted that a servant could drive him back, and under their enthusiastic toasting, he drank glass after glass.  Eventually, feeling really uncomfortable in his stomach, he firmly refused to drink any more. As Jin Qingyan's right-hand man, he always adhered to one principle: in such environments, he absolutely could not become unconscious.  His concerns were legitimate; when Wu Pingyang's mother suggested he stay at the Mu family's place, he immediately sobered up a bit and persistently declined.  No matter what the Mu family said, he firmly refused. Seeing that he really wouldn't consent, the Mu family had no choice but to have someone drive his car to take him back, and they instructed Wu Pingyang to take care of him.  Wu Pingyang followed him into the car, and the car returned to the Vinci community. Fan Shixin leaned back in his seat, keeping his eyes closed, his consciousness somewhat hazy. But he was not completely unconscious.  By the time they reached home, Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai helped him out of the car. He squinted at Wu Pingyang and said, "You should go back..."  "You've had too much to drink; I'll stay with you to take care of you."  "Sister-in-law, we are here, we'll take care of him; sister-in-law, you go back," Xiao Bai said with a grin. As soon as he spoke, Xiao Huang slapped him, "What are you saying?"  Wu Pingyang, thinking of maintaining her pure and innocent image in front of Fan Shixin, nodded, got back into the car, and instructed through the window, "Give him some sobering soup."  "Okay, sister-in-law, take care."  Seeing the car leave, Xiao Huang said, "Why did you let sister-in-law go when she wanted to stay? You idiot."  "Didn't you see our captain telling her to go? It means our captain doesn't want her to stay here."  Xiao Huang asked Fan Shixin, "Captain, why did you drink so much?"  "They kept pouring drinks... my stomach feels awful... ugh..." He couldn't hold it in, and vomited on the spot. The vomiting made him feel much better, and his rationality also recovered a bit.  Xiao Bai called someone to clean up, and with Xiao Huang, they took him back to his room. After asking the kitchen to prepare sobering soup and having him drink it, the two left.  Fan Shixin slept for two or three hours, and when he woke up, apart from a severe headache, the drunkenness had largely subsided, and he didn't feel like sleeping anymore.  He got up, washed up, changed into clean clothes, and left the house. It was already eleven o'clock at night.  It was Xiao Bai's turn to be on the night shift. Seeing that he had gotten up, Xiao Bai yawned, "Captain, why are you up?"  "My head hurts, I can't sleep," his voice was very hoarse.  "If I had known, I wouldn't have suggested that sister-in-law go back. If she had stayed to accompany you, you definitely wouldn't have been unable to sleep, and you would have slept soundly," Xiao Bai winked at him, "Right, Captain?"  "Cut it out, don't casually call her sister-in-law, we're not married yet."  "What does that matter? Our young madam isn't remarried to our young master yet, and we still call her young madam directly. Captain, are you shy? Stop being pretentious, sister-in-law didn't say anything."  Fan Shixin instructed him, "Weren't you sleeping during the day? How come you look so listless now? Perk up."  "Yes, Captain!" Xiao Bai shook himself, opening his eyes wide, trying to muster his energy.  Fan Shixin stretched out his hand to grab the mouse and scanned the surveillance of the community. While checking, he unexpectedly found that the lights in his own house were still on.  At this hour, why hasn't she slept yet?  "How has Miss Mu been these past few days when you guys delivered her meals?"  "Quite good, but Miss Mu doesn't let us deliver meals to her anymore."  "Hm?" Fan Shixin asked, "Why?"  "Miss Mu said it was quite a hassle for us to deliver three meals to her every day. She hopes we could deliver her groceries so she could cook for herself and pass the time. So today, we have already filled her refrigerator, which should be enough for Miss Mu to eat for two or three days."  Fan Shixin hummed in response and turned to leave the duty room. It started to drizzle outside.  He left the main door and went to his own house. After entering the password, Fan Shixin slowly walked in, even the sound of closing the door seemed somewhat soft.  Arriving at the door of the guest bedroom, he politely knocked. Inside, her voice came through, "Who is it?"  "It's me."  "Come in."  Fan Shixin pushed open the door and saw her sitting on the bed, embroidering a cross-stitch, "Why haven't you rested yet?"  "I can't sleep."  Mu Wansheng smelled a faint scent of alcohol on him, "You've been drinking?"  "I took a shower, brushed my teeth, can you still smell it?"  "It's faint, but I can still smell it. It looks like you drank quite a bit."  "I went to your house this afternoon, and had dinner there. Your family almost got me drunk."  Mu Wansheng put the cross-stitch on the table, "Is it about an engagement?"  "No, Pingyang said your grandfather wanted to see me, so I went."  "It must have cost a lot of money, right?" Mu Wansheng looked at him with certainty in her tone.  "The young madam asked me to bring a bottle of wine and some expensive cigarettes from the warehouse, each worth twenty to thirty thousand."  Mu Wansheng took a deep breath, "Captain Fan, do you like Pingyang?"  Fan Shixin stared into her eyes, "I suppose I do."  The words Mu Wansheng wanted to say got stuck in her throat. She didn't want to be nosy, yet she didn't want someone who was kind to her to get hurt, "Pingyang marrying you is what all the Mu family elders want to see, except for my mother. To be precise, it's something my grandfather is very much looking forward to. Pingyang is not entirely sincere with you; she has an ulterior motive towards you."  As she spoke, her hands were continuously fidgeting with her blanket, yet her tone was very gentle.  "Things like seeking a marriage alliance are all about conditions." Fan Shixin was already well aware of this, "That's why I don't have any plans to get married right now. I'll make a decision after getting to know and spending more time with her." Chapter 1310: As Long As It's You (8)  Mu Wansheng smiled gently, "Captain Fan is so nice, Pingyang will see your good side."  "Do you really think I'm good?"  "Of course, you are the best person to me in the world."  Fan Shixin didn't expect her to use the words 'the world,' and his lips curled into a smile, "What if I don't want Pingyang, but want you instead?"  Mu Wansheng looked at him in astonishment, "Captain..."  Seeing her like this, Fan Shixin suddenly laughed out loud, "Scared? I was just teasing you."  Mu Wansheng lowered her eyes, "It's getting late, Captain. You should go back and rest early, I'm sleepy."  Fan Shixin put away his smile, "Mm, good night."  "Good night." Mu Wansheng slowly lay down, stretched out her hand, and turned off the light.  He then closed the door behind him.  She reached out to touch her face, which was burning hot. Just now, she had actually taken his joke seriously, feeling somewhat embarrassed and ashamed. How could she not distinguish a joke? Was she too foolish?  He is Pingyang's boyfriend, and in the future, he will be her cousin's husband.  Thinking of the words 'cousin's husband,' Mu Wansheng's eyes dimmed. After she recovered from her injury, she would ultimately have to return to the Mu family. After all, she couldn't hide in a room forever without going out; she would need to earn money and pay off debts. Sooner or later, the Mu family would discover her.   Just thinking about those things made her realize how precious it was to be able to live here at the moment, without worrying about food or anything else.  What she always longed for was a warm home. So it didn't matter if her boyfriend had no money; as long as he was good to her, she was willing to work hard with him for their future.  Now, she had nothing.  All her hopes were extinguished.  Mu Wansheng closed her eyes, and a tear slowly trickled down the corner of her eye.  ---  When An Xiaoning, Henry, Wu Lianzhi, and Xiao Chenyang returned, it was already dawn. Stepping back onto the land of the Vini community, they all felt a strong sense of security. Indeed, An Xiaoning had come to regard this place as her home, no, it was her home.  After arranging guest rooms for Wu Lianzhi and Xiao Chenyang, An Xiaoning went upstairs with Henry. As soon as she entered the bedroom, she kicked off her slippers and pounced onto the big, soft bed, "Ah, this is so comfortable."  "You've already slept for so long, do you still want to sleep?"  "No, I want to remove my makeup, apply a face mask, and have a good lie down to calm my mind and think about how to solve the things that come next."  Henry went to shower, and by the time he came out in his bathrobe, she was already lying on the bed, legs up, leisurely applying a face mask.  He walked over, toweling his hair, and started using her skincare products at her vanity.  "Your skin is better than mine without any care, why are you applying that?"  "Do I have to wait until I'm old to apply it?"  An Xiaoning reminded him, "You won't get old, you will live a very, very long time, so you don't need to worry about that."  He took it as a joke, "If I don't get old, then you're the one who'll suffer. I'll stay young while you become a wrinkly old woman in your seventies or eighties."  Her eyes shot him a sharp look, hearing his disdain, "Then you'll be disappointed because I won't grow old or die either."  "That's such a wonderful wish."  "I'm telling the truth, okay?"  "Oh, truly."  "It is true!"  He patted his face and walked over, nodding at her with insincere agreement, "I said it's true."  Seeing him wanting to sit down, An Xiaoning stretched out her leg and placed it right on the edge of the bed.  Seeing this, he actually sat right on her leg.  "Ah!!!" An Xiaoning turned to the side and kicked his neck with her other foot, "The bed is mine, go sleep on your sofa."  "Is your name written on it?"  "If you lie down here, I’ll touch you, kiss you, and do that to you."  "Go ahead, as long as you don't want to be thrown against the wall again by me." He flipped her leg to one side and lay down smoothly.  "Henry, you're showing some spirit, some spirit indeed."  "Even a cornered rabbit will jump over a wall."  An Xiaoning got out of bed, opened a drawer, took out a very thin needle, and then grabbed his hand, pricking him with it before he could react.  He wanted to retract his hand, but the next moment, she took his hand and put it in her mouth.  Henry stared at her in shock, "What are you doing, pricking me?!"  "Drinking your blood."  "...... Crazy."  An Xiaoning took his hand out of her mouth, didn't care, and just lay back down on the bed.  Henry looked at his hand, shiny with saliva, and showed a disgusted expression. He got up and went to the washroom to wash his hand before coming back out.  "That's disgusting."  "How come it didn't disgust you to death."  "That's called being disgusted?" An Xiaoning smiled mischievously, leaning close to him, "I'll tell you something even more disgusting, and I guarantee you'll be silent for a minute."  "I don't want to hear it."  "Just listen, it's something you did."  "I said I don't want to hear it." He felt it wasn't anything good, so he firmly refused, but his refusal was useless, as the person who wanted to speak would still say what they wanted to say.  An Xiaoning's lips moved lightly, and then she said something.  This remark made Henry want to explode; his face nearly turned into a tomato, "You're talking nonsense; I don't believe that."  An Xiaoning got out of bed and left the room.  Ten minutes later, she came back.  She took her phone, got into bed, and said, "You don't believe it, I'll show you the surveillance footage."  Henry's heart was torn with conflict and curiosity.  So he took the phone from her hand and ran off to the bathroom by himself.  An Xiaoning watched his actions with amusement, murmuring to herself, "Shouldn't have disbelieved me, the evidence is solid."  Henry never imagined his body would do such a thing; it was hard for him to believe and yet he felt almost completely exposed to An Xiaoning in an instant.  He knew his body must have had many encounters with An Xiaoning, as the child was the best proof.  But he didn't expect that he would personally serve her. And even allow her to record it!  His head felt like it would explode in that moment.  He quickly deleted the video, then came out glaring.  An Xiaoning reached out her hand, he put the phone in her hand, and didn't want to say another word.  Seeing that he had deleted the video, she calmly said, "The video was originally on my computer; this was a copy."  "Do you plan to let a computer expert take it and then let the whole world see it?" He glanced at her sideways, somewhat worried.   Chapter 1311: All You Need (9)  "Of course not, this video was taken on a whim when we were in high spirits. It was later saved in a hidden file on the computer. However, I already deleted it when I copied it just now. Look how nervous I made you." Hearing her say this, Henry finally calmed down. Even though he clearly saw his own body having an indescribable relationship with her, he had no memory of it whatsoever, and even less of an idea of what it felt like.  "Such a player."  "Isn't that normal?" An Xiao Ning propped her head with one hand as she looked at him, "Do you want to continue sleeping, or do you want to get up?"  "What about you?"  "I can't sleep anymore; I'll be getting up soon."  "Then you get up, I want to sleep."  "......"  ---  Ideals are plump, reality is boney; Henry wanted to sleep but didn't get his wish.   At breakfast, when everyone was in their places, Wu Lianzhi, because he was at someone else's home, didn't appear as relaxed as the others, showing a bit of restraint.  Everyone was enjoying their meal when Long Tianze came over humming a tune.  "Hello, my dear friends, I'm here."  Xiao Chen Yang saw him and subconsciously glanced at An Xiao Ning. An Xiao Ning received his signal and the two shared a tacit smile.  "What's so special about you coming?" The one who spoke was Henry.  "Of course, I missed you!"  "Scram."  Long Tianze was not surprised and just shrugged, "I haven't eaten yet, let me join the meal. Aunt Chen, get me a pair of chopsticks."  "Alright."  This was Long Tianze, always like this in front of friends.  Long Tianze took the chopsticks from Aunt Chen and happily sat down to eat together.  "Who is this?" He looked up at Wu Lianzhi.  "Hello, I am Wu Lianzhi."  "Long Tianze." As soon as he said his name, Wu Lianzhi was stunned.  He remembered the name Long Tianze very well and couldn't help but give him a few more glances.  Noticing his frequent glances, Long Tianze jokingly asked, "Why keep looking at me? Do you fancy me?"  Wu Lianzhi dryly laughed, "No, you just look like a good man."  Pleased with the compliment, Long Tianze's smile almost split his face, "Of course, I'm the number one good man in S country, right, Qing Yan?"  Henry bluntly said, "You've blown all the bulls away, you're so narcissistic you've almost forgotten your own last name."  "Do I need to brag? This is a fact. Sister-in-law, tell me, have I not been good to our Yangyang? Whatever she says, I don't object. If she says go west, I definitely won't say go east."  "Mm, I admit, Long Shao is really beyond reproach to Yangyang."  An Xiao Ning agreed with him, "Whether or not you're the number one good man in S country, at the very least, you are a good man in front of Yangyang."  "Did you hear that, Xiao Jinzi?"  Henry didn't argue and quietly ate his meal.  After breakfast, Xiao Chen Yang had Wu Hai Gang, the elder of the Wu family, brought over. Then he asked An Xiao Ning, "He's supposed to be quite powerful in witchcraft, but he doesn't actually have any real skills. However, I think if handled correctly, he should be able to lift the curse on you and Qing Yan. Do you have any good methods to make him willing to do it?"  "People only care about their own life after all. But it depends on whether he still wants to live or not. He probably knows that even if he helps us lift the curse, he won't survive. After all, to lift the curse, he would need to know our birth dates and time, and if he knows that, how could we let him live? Therefore, this method is destined not to work. Thus, it might be more appropriate to exchange with another method."  Xiao Chen Yang listened attentively, "What?"  "His family. We both clearly understand the fundamental reason why his family changed their names and moved to R country. For a family, changing their original surname is already extremely difficult, so the descendants are much more important than anything else."  Xiao Chen Yang agreed with her, "What you said makes sense, let's execute it this way. Anyway, his so-called family is just that. If what they were originally good at no longer exists, what's the difference from ordinary people? But, aren't you going to check the other side?"  An Xiao Ning nodded, "I was just about to go, you wait here."  "Alright."  When An Xiao Ning went to the other side, Long Tianze and Wu Lianzhi were chatting in the living room, and Mei Yangyang was not in sight.  "Long Shao, where's Yangyang?"  "She went to the studio early in the morning; she said she wanted to talk to the two boys and a girl selected from the school."  She nodded, "So that's how it is. What are you two big men chatting about?"  "Nothing much, just some topics between men."  Long Tianze said with a grin, "I found that Brother Wu here is quite humorous."  "Humorous?" Her eyes rolled, she didn't see how Wu Lianzhi was humorous.  "Yeah, sister-in-law, he's quite humorous."  "When will Yangyang be back?"  "Should be soon, she didn't even have breakfast before she left, said she would eat when she comes back."  An Xiao Ning glanced at the time and sat down directly, "Lianzhi, do you know? Tianze and Yangyang's daughter and my son are betrothed."  Wu Lianzhi nodded, "He just told me, but it's quite traditional to arrange a marriage for such young children."  "I really like our little meat bun, Xiao Xi, chubby and cute just like Yangyang, so lovable."  Long Tianze expressed his pride, his eyes brimming with joy, "That's right, that's my little sweetheart, you can't not like her."  "Tsk tsk tsk, just mentioning his little padded jacket, look how happy he is."  Wu Lianzhi smiled and nodded, "I can see that, Brother Long, your family is truly very happy."  "Of course."  An Xiao Ning was a bit disdainful, "I say, you two, can you not call each other by those names?"  "Is there a problem?"  "Of course, there is a problem. Long Shao, when you call him Brother Wu, those who don't know might think you're saying 'no chest', and Lianzhi, when you call him Brother Long, others might also mistakenly think you're saying 'breast augmentation'. You two are really a perfect match, it’s only the first time you've met today... is it because both of you have no chest that you're going together for augmentation?"  After her analysis, both men couldn't help but laugh, a point that neither of them had thought about.  Half an hour later, Mei Yangyang returned.  She was wearing jeans and an off-white sweater, carrying a bag as she came in.  "Husband, I'm back."  "Yeah, wife, we have a guest at home."  "Who is it?" Mei Yangyang asked as she changed her shoes and looked towards the so-called guest on the sofa.  After a glance, she hesitated, "This is..."  "He's my friend, Wu Lianzhi. Your Tianze hit it off with him on their first meeting today."  Mei Yangyang came in with a smile, "He's the sociable type."   Chapter 1312: As Long As You (10)  Wu Lianzhi looked at her, and although he really couldn't recall any memories associated with her, he always felt a special affection when he saw her. "Hello," he said.  Mei Yangyang replied, "Hello."  ...  On the way back from that place, An Xiaoning observed that Wu Lianzhi remained very composed and asked, "How do you feel?"  "I feel pretty good. Seeing her so happy truly makes me happy," he said.  An Xiaoning patted his shoulder, "It's okay. You will also be happy. It's just that there was a connection in the previous life but not in this one. Plan well for your future. Tell me what job you want to do, and if I can help arrange it for you, I will."  Wu Lianzhi entered the main gate with her, "I can feel it. Her husband is really a good person. Living with such an optimistic man, it's hard to have a bad life. I'm very relieved and comforted. As for my future, I want to live a stable life and find a girl who can bring me happiness to share life with. But to meet a nice girl, first I need to go to places where there are many girls, right?"  An Xiaoning agreed, "That's the idea, yes."  Not long after returning, Wu Haigang was brought before them.  An Xiaoning looked at the man before her. He seemed to be in his thirties or forties and didn't look old at all. "Hello, Mr. Wu, I believe you are very familiar with this person. He used to be one of the Wu family just like you."  He raised his eyes, his gaze cold, "He doesn't deserve to be a member of my Wu family."  "Ah... and you do?" An Xiaoning stared at him, "Let me tell you, today, you're in our hands, and you have no choice. Your life has already been worthless. The key is whether you want your entire Wu family and their descendants to be buried with you?"  "Including him?" he pointed at Wu Lianzhi.  "No, although he has changed his surname back to Wu, he's no longer a member of your family. So, no, he's not included. Mr. Wu, you should be very clear about my identity by now. A wealthy clan in Country R really isn't much. One bomb thrown over, and probably many will die, right? The state of Country R is currently unstable, with the situation turbulent. So now, it's up to you whether you want to lift our curse or to protect your clan members. It's your call."  "You..." he asked, "How can I trust you? Trust that you won't go back on your word?"  "You don't have a choice," An Xiaoning clearly told him. "Do you think I've forgotten about your clan's scheme to kill me? A wealthy clan trying to assassinate a person from another country, and especially me - do you think my country would not negotiate with Country R? If I want to, I have many ways to make your family pay back double and wipe them out. You'd like to see that with your own eyes, right?"  Wu Haigang closed his eyes, with nothing else to say.  Indeed, if he died, that was one thing, but if the entire clan was wiped out, he would be the sinner of the Wu family, unable to face his ancestors after death.  This time, he had truly fallen.  ---  "Er Lan sister, I heard that Jing Shui has finished his scenes and is leaving today."  "Whether he finishes his scenes or not, what difference does it make?" Fang Erlan applied lipstick lightly to her lips, "Other than being more diligent when he first joined the crew, he hardly ever came to the set later on. I heard from the director that a lot of his scenes were completed by a stand-in. Using a stand-in so frequently for a supporting role number five, if it were his brother's crew, I don't think it would fly."  "Of course, Director Jing Tian has high demands, he wouldn't allow such frequent use of a stand-in."  Xiao Yue said so, "By the way, Er Lan sister, when is cousin coming back?"  "Should be soon."  "Ah, I'm craving. When cousin is here, he thinks of ways to buy you all kinds of delicious food every day, and I get to enjoy it too, to please my taste buds."  "Little foodie." Fang Erlan stood up from the chair, "Let's go."  "Ah." Xiao Yue picked up her bag and followed her out, with numerous bodyguards watching her leave and following suit.  Her entrance was quite queen-like.  You should know that Yu Caivei only brought three or four bodyguards, whereas she forcefully brought eight bodyguards.  Walking like this, they formed a long queue.  The event they were attending was a promotional activity for a TV drama, a fan meeting.  Most of the attendees were female fans of Yan Ge, and her fans were obviously few.  Although she had some popularity, it was mainly due to the announcement of her relationship with Yan Ge. With two dramas not yet aired, where would she have fans from?  But what she didn't know was that her fans did come, indeed around ten or twenty people.  A few hundred people, and only ten or twenty fans, that's really...  The event lasted for about half an hour, and just when it was about to end, an accident happened.  When Fang Erlan was about to go down, when she was closest to those present, a man in his fifties suddenly lunged at her. He didn't lunge normally, because the bodyguards were blocking, he dived under the bodyguard's arm and grabbed Fang Erlan.  In that instant, there was chaos at the scene.  Fang Erlan fell onto the bodyguard on the inside.  The bodyguard on the outside almost instinctively pulled her away, as fast as lightning, and threw the man to the ground, causing the crowd to step back. The man in his fifties fell hard.  Fang Erlan stood up, still somewhat shaken, but she quickly and composedly left the area.  Xiao Yue was furious, and once they got back to the nanny car, she started swearing, "Damn it, that old man is tired of living, isn't he? If cousin were here, he would have dislocated his arm."  Fang Erlan calmed down and said nothing.  Seeing her silent, Xiao Yue thought she was in a bad mood and hurriedly comforted her, "Er Lan sister, it's okay. Didn't you see our bodyguard brother throw that old man out?"  "Xiao Yue, what do you want to do in the future?"  Xiao Yue was taken aback by her question, "Huh? What do I want to do in the future?"  "I still want to continue working with you."  "What if I leave the entertainment industry?"  Xiao Yue looked at her, "Then I still want to follow Er Lan sister."  "If I leave the entertainment industry, Xiao Yue, you won't be able to follow me. Isn't your family's situation quite ordinary too? You once said your biggest wish is to have your own house in A City, right?"  "Yeah, but with the housing prices so high, I can't afford it with a few thousand a month."  "How much do you have in savings?" Fang Erlan asked.  "Over thirty thousand."  "How about I buy you a one-bedroom apartment?"   Xiao Yue was stunned, "Sister, that's not right. Even the cheapest one-bedroom apartment costs at least one to two million. I haven't been with sister for long, you shouldn't be so good to me." Chapter 1313: As Long As You (11)  "Really don't want it?" "Don't want it," Xiao Yue answered, "It's not easy for you to earn money either, Er Lan sister. You work hard every day. Keep it for yourself, I believe that one day I will manage to save enough money for a down payment."  Fang Er Lan didn't say anything more. When she returned to the hotel to rest, she sat on the bed alone browsing online real estate listings.  Xiao Yue had not been with her for a very long time, but it had also been about a year.  They were almost together every day, but that would no longer be the case once she retired from the entertainment industry.  She wanted to do something for Xiao Yue.  After all, Xiao Yue had always been particularly good to her, caring for her, looking after her.  When the doorbell rang, she had already scouted several neighborhoods.  There was a bodyguard on duty at the door, so she didn't need to check the peephole and just opened the door directly. Seeing the man at the door, Fang Er Lan's eyebrows were tinged with a smile, "You're back?"  "Mm." He entered, closing the door behind him.  He picked her up horizontally and walked inside, "What are you doing?"  "Looking at houses."  "Looking at houses?" Xiao Chen Yang put her down on the bed, his eyes glancing over to the notebook on the small table.  "One bedroom, one living room?" He was puzzled, "Our house needs to be a bit bigger to be good."  "It's not for us, it's for Xiao Yue."  Xiao Chen Yang took off his shoes, "Does she have the money to buy a house?"  "Of course, I want to buy it for her."  "That's fine."  He sat next to her, stretching out his hand to wrap around her shoulder, "But which one have you taken a liking to?"  "Look, this one, this one, and this one," she said, pointing them out with the mouse.  "I think the one in Sanqiao is not bad, the ventilation and lighting are pretty good. By the way, isn't An Xiao Ning's house there? Let's choose this one."  Seeing that he said it was good, Fang Er Lan decided on this one and wrote down the homeowner's contact information. Then she asked, "Should we also settle our own house? It will take a while for renovation, and after the house is renovated, we can't move in immediately, we need to let it air out for a few months."  "There's no need to go through the trouble of redecorating, just buy one that's already been nicely renovated. I asked Captain Fan, and there's a fully furnished villa for sale in the Vini neighborhood, the price is also quite fair, let's buy it."  "Villa?" Fang Er Lan inquired, "Is it similar to the one Yang Yang sister's family has?"  "Pretty much."  "Then let's buy it."  "Alright."  "Today, during the event, an old man took advantage of me and knocked me down."  Seeing the fire in his eyes suddenly ignited, she added, "Luckily our bodyguard is top-notch, he threw him out the next second."  Fang Er Lan put away the computer and the small table, then sat back down next to him, facing him seriously, "To be honest, have you missed me these past few days?"  "I haven't missed you, I missed Fang Xiaogou."  She feigned anger, "You're the puppy."  He hugged her and lay down, "Alright alright, I'm the puppy, you're the woman who sleeps with the puppy."  "......" Fang Er Lan reached out and pinched him, "Can't you speak properly?"  "I can... Mrs. Xiao."  Fang Er Lan was finally satisfied and asked, "Is everything taken care of?"  "Almost, but it's quite amusing."  He turned his body, "Allow me to recount the details to you."  "Alright, I'm all ears."  ——  Hospital.  An Xiao Ning and Henry came to the hospital together to see Mr. Jin.  Hearing from Fan Shi Xin that Mr. Jin had woken up and was no longer in any danger, only needing to rest well in the hospital, Henry didn't really want to come, but An Xiao Ning insisted on bringing him.  When the two entered the hospital room, Mr. Jin was reading the newspaper. Seeing them, he couldn't help but hum, "It's been so many days and you, as his son, are only coming to see me now, is that acceptable?"  Henry didn't mince words in his reply, "It's already not easy for me to come see you, what more do you want?"  "What do you mean 'not easy'? I'm your dad!"  "You know you're my dad?" Henry's attitude was cold and he didn't want to engage further, "When will you learn to be well-behaved?"  Mr. Jin was choked with anger and stopped talking, putting the newspaper aside on the bedside.  "Uncle, are you feeling better?" An Xiao Ning put down the fruit, and asked.  "Mm, much better."  "Qing Yan has been unwell these few days and hasn't come to see you, but he's been thinking of you. It's just, uncle, can you refrain from going to the casino from now on? I remember you never used to frequent the casino. If you find life boring now, you can join some peers for travel or participate in recreational activities, that would be more substantial."  Mr. Jin let out a heavy sniff, "What's the point of mingling with those strangers I don't know. It's meaningless."  "Yes, losing money is meaningful," Henry retorted, "Lying in the hospital, you can't gamble now, can you?"  "You're not happy unless you're arguing with me, are you?" Mr. Jin was indignant, "If you have nothing else to say, then go, everyone go."  Henry didn't hesitate, grabbed An Xiao Ning's arm, and walked away.  Outside the room, he let go of her arm and said, "I told you there was no need to see him, but you insisted."  "You have to come and see when your dad is in the hospital, so as to avoid harsh words from others, it's better to come and see."  He was impatient, "Seeing him, I'd rather go see the family's Wang Cai and Fu Gui."  "......" An Xiao Ning was speechless, "Alright, we've seen him, let's go back."  In any case, they had seen Mr. Jin at the hospital.  But there was one more place to go.  When he noticed that she wasn't driving in the direction back to the Vini neighborhood, he asked, "Where are you going?"  "To the Devil's Training Camp."  He didn't say anything else, letting the car drive into the courtyard of the Devil's Training Camp.  On the way, An Xiao Ning bought gifts for the children, including two for Long Tian Ze's children, one for each.  The kids were all delighted.  Returning from there, it was already an hour later.  Wu Hai Gang had already promised to lift their curse, but it would have to wait until Jin Qing Yan's birthday, October 16th.  It was coming soon, so there was no rush for these few days.  Therefore, Wu Hai Gang was temporarily detained.  She also made a special request for someone to check on Wu Lian Zhi's information abroad. Initially, she had thought about transferring her household registration to Country S, but unexpectedly, it was directly canceled there, saving some trouble.  He specifically went to the Public Security Bureau to apply for his household registration.  Since An Xiao Ning had already made a call, his application was processed there.  When he returned, he found An Xiao Ning waiting for him, drinking coffee.  "I nearly forgot something."  "What?"  "You still haven't answered my question about why, initially, you instructed your people here to get my hair."  Upon this question, he was somewhat embarrassed. Chapter 1314: As Long As You (12)  "Actually, I didn't want to tell you at first, mainly because after I saw that mural, I had a very bold idea in my mind."  "What idea?"  "I want to get a DNA test on your hair to see if there's any blood relation between us."  "Pfft." An Xiaoning never expected this reason.  "That's why I didn't tell you, I was afraid you would be disgusted."  "There's nothing to be disgusted about."  As she finished speaking, Xiao Lv's voice came from outside the door, "Young Madam, people from the Donggong family abroad have arrived, they are at the main gate."  She had anticipated their arrival but didn't expect them to come so quickly.  "Let them in."  "Okay."  "Should I... avoid them for a bit?" he asked.  "No need, why avoid anything, still afraid of them?"  "That's not it."  An Xiaoning waved to the servant, "Make me another cup of coffee."  "Okay, Young Madam."  The people from the Donggong family were several sons of the old patriarch and a few grandsons.  Without exception, those who came were fairly prominent men of the Donggong family, and all were male.  "Please take a seat."  Six or seven people sat down, one after another, and the first to speak was the eldest son of the old patriarch, "Miss An, the purpose of our visit this time is, first, to formally apologize to you, and second, to hope that you can release our family elder."  "I accept the apology, but releasing your family elder? Where does that come from? I don't even know your family elder. Who is he? What does he look like? What's his name?"  Wu Lianzhi didn't expect her to deny it outright, and seemed to guess why she did it, so he didn't say anything and just quietly sat there.  However, the men from the Donggong family were a bit stunned, not expecting her to deny it outright.  "Miss An, let's not beat around the bush. We have come to understand that the elder is with you."  "Do you have evidence?"  "This..." The men exchanged looks, "But we are certain that he is with you."  "Sorry, baseless claims don't count. Without evidence, what are you so sure about?" She wouldn't give them any chance to grasp anything on her, "You can't just throw dirt on someone."  "Miss An." The second eldest of the Donggong spoke up, "Make a condition, as long as you release the person, no matter what condition you set, we will agree to it."  "Do I need to repeat myself?" Her expression remained calm, "I really didn't take away your so-called family elder."  However, they didn't believe her words; they knew she was just not admitting it.  Seeing that she was neither soft nor hard, the men didn't know what to do next.  Of course, they didn't know that An Xiaoning was planning to make them take a fruitless trip because she would never let Wu Haigang live in the future.  "Miss An..." After nearly a minute of silence, the eldest of the Donggong finally spoke, "If you are willing to release our elder, our Donggong family is willing to pledge loyalty to you, these are my father's original words."  Wu Lianzhi froze completely.  "Why would your father..." She didn't finish her sentence, leaving it half-said.  "Our Donggong family has long lost the art of witchcraft; the elder is the only clan member who knows it. If he's not around, there's no hope of revival."  "Revival?" An Xiaoning asked with a smile, "To let you carry forward the witchcraft and continue to harm people?"  "That's not what I meant."  An Xiaoning was not moved by his words at all, "Really sorry, but I really didn't take away your elder, and I don't know who he is. I apologize, but if there's nothing else, please leave; we won't keep you."  She directly issued an eviction order.  The Donggong family's delegation was suddenly out of options, even after having played their trump card, seeing that she remained unmoved, they were truly at a loss.  Just like that.  The eldest of the Donggong reluctantly knelt down.  "What are you doing? I really haven't seen your family elder, are you expecting me to perform magic and make him appear?"  "..."  In the end, they left. Empty-handed.  Without a single solution.  The living room quieted down, and An Xiaoning looked at Wu Lianzhi, who was expressionless, and asked, "Do you think I'm also heartless?"  "Not at all." Wu Lianzhi sincerely said to her, "I understand your considerations, and you did the right thing from your standpoint. I have already left the Donggong family, so this is someone else's business, and I have no comment."  "When the curse is lifted, this matter can be considered completely over. To be honest, after it's resolved, the person I should thank the most is you. If it wasn't for you taking the initiative to contact me, I wouldn't have known about your existence, or even if I did, it might have taken a long time. If it wasn't for you, I couldn't have learned about these things so quickly. Do you know, Xiao Chenyang once looked for the descendants of the Wu family but couldn't find any trace. After so many years, it's not so easy to find. We originally thought it was very likely that they had become extinct due to backlash."  "I'm also very happy to have been able to help you solve this matter so coincidentally. Fate is really wonderful, bringing us together in such a way."  When Henry came down from upstairs, he happened to see An Xiaoning and Wu Lianzhi smiling at each other. Standing at the stairway, he casually called to An Xiaoning, "Come up here, I have something to tell you."  "What is it?"  "Come up and you'll know." Saying that, he turned and went up first. An Xiaoning really thought he had something to tell her, but after following him up, she learned he didn't have anything at all.  "You said you had something, are you fooling me?"  "So what if I'm fooling you?"  An Xiaoning was speechless, glancing at him, "Alright, if you're happy, I'll go back down."  "Hold on."  "What now?"  "When are you going to let that guy leave?"  "He'll stay here for now, we'll talk about it after some time." An Xiaoning thought they should at least wait until the curse was lifted and Wu Lianzhi's household registration was approved before making arrangements for him.  "After some time?" Henry was unhappy, "I think having an unfamiliar man in the house makes me very uncomfortable."  "Then just be uncomfortable, you'll get over it."  "An Xiaoning, this is my territory!"  "So you admit you are Qing Yan?" she approached him.  "Who says we're not the same person? Isn't that the way it's always been?"  "That's convenient." She sat down on the bed, her hands lightly supporting herself behind her, "I have a special need right now, and I hope you can satisfy me."  Henry's mouth twitched, "Here you go again..."  "What do you mean again? Isn't this very normal? Henry, I think it's necessary for us to communicate well physically. I hope you can sincerely feel my suggestion." Chapter 1315: As Long As You (13)  "No need." An Xiaoning directly turned and walked away, his voice calling out from behind, "Where are you going?"  "To die a death."  "......"  An Xiaoning came downstairs to find that Wu Lianzhi was no longer below. She sat on the sofa and turned on the TV, which was broadcasting an archaeological documentary. It happened to feature an interview with Wang Jinsheng. Staring at the TV screen, An Xiaoning relaxed and watched for a few minutes before making a phone call to Pan Zhenghui.  "Chief Pan, it's me."  "Ah... Xiaoning."  "Is the archaeological team still led by Captain Wang Jinsheng?"  "Yes, but I was just about to contact you about him in these two days. Ever since you mentioned his connection with tomb raiding, I've been secretly investigating him, and now we have results."  This was somewhat unexpected for An Xiaoning. "You're quite efficient at your job."  "What are you talking about? How could I not take seriously what you've said?" said Pan Zhenghui. "It's too much to explain in a few words. Xiaoning, why don't you stop by the station?"  "Okay, I'll come over now."  "Alright, good."  As she spoke, she turned off the TV.  Pan Zhenghui had organized the materials well by the time An Xiaoning arrived, and he had even brewed tea, "Come, Xiaoning, try this new tea I bought. Sit down, let's talk slowly."  An Xiaoning took it and sat opposite him. "What's the situation?"  "According to the investigation, this Captain Wang, ah, it's really disappointing. You can't tell normally, but a check reveals his true colors. Captain Wang hasn't been in contact with He Yi for very long, but he has dealings with those traffickers who sell national artifacts. We found that he privately sold items that should have been turned over to the state, making quite a bit of money secretly."  An Xiaoning didn't know what to say. "Then continue the thorough investigation, and deal with the punishment fairly and justly."  "Yes, of course."  "Also, keep an eye on He Yi, he's an old hand at tomb raiding. Monitor him. If he dares to continue tomb raiding domestically, you'll handle it."  "Okay, I got it."  An Xiaoning then asked, "Has there been no one found to replace Officer Yuan Mingzhu in the special team?"  Speaking of this, Pan Zhenghui couldn't help but sigh, "If I had found someone, I would have told you. It's not that easy. We haven't found anyone suitable. Just the other day, we found one, but he was a charlatan who really thought he was a sage. Xiaoning, come back, even if it's just to help investigate a case from time to time, okay? There are cases from ten or twenty years ago that are still unsolved. There are no outsiders here, I'll only tell you, some cases, if you don't take them on, will remain unsolved for life, no one else can solve them. It's not that there's insufficient evidence, it's just that our rank is too low to take action."  "What do you mean?"  "Do you really not understand what I mean?" Pan Zhenghui lowered his voice to the lowest, "The backgrounds of some perpetrators are too strong, and cases can only be left unresolved."  "Let's do this," An Xiaoning said, "I will still serve as the head of the special team, but I can't come to the station every day, I have a lot of personal matters, so I can only come when I'm free, maybe only a few days a month, maybe only one day, it depends."  Seeing her agreement, Pan Zhenghui was so excited he almost jumped up, "That's great! Even if it's just one day a month, as long as you come, that's good!"  "Really? Then when you finish the cases you're working on, we'll start a new one. I'm just here to give you a heads-up. Alright, I won't disturb your thinking any longer, carry on, I'm leaving."  "The chair hasn't even warmed up yet, and you're leaving?"  "I'm afraid of disturbing you. Work well, see you another day."  She got up and left.  On the way back, she stopped her car in front of a supermarket to buy water because she was thirsty.  Unexpectedly, she ran into Shi Shaochuan and... Bu Xianxian.  She had heard that Shi Shaochuan and Bu Xianxian had broken up long ago, so why... this world... why is it so strange?  "Wow, Bu Xianxian, you're really something."  An Xiaoning picked up a bottle of mineral water and took the initiative to speak up. Chapter 1316: As Long As You (14)  "What do you mean?" Bu Qianqian looked straight at her. "What do you mean by 'I'm really capable'?"  "Weren't you two broken up? How come you're back together?"  "That's our business, none of your concern." Bu Qianqian was somewhat nervous. "So, don't meddle in other people's affairs, off you go."  An Xiaoning shrugged her shoulders and hummed, "Oh, good luck."  After watching her walk away, Bu Qianqian, holding Shi Shaochuan's arm, said, "Isn't she annoying?"  "Hasn't she always been annoying?" Shi Shaochuan replied indifferently. "Don't bother with her. Have you finished buying?"  "Yeah, almost."  "Let's go then." Shi Shaochuan went with her to pay, and when they exited the supermarket, they saw An Xiaoning standing by the car door drinking water, looking towards them.  "Shi Shaochuan."  Shi Shaochuan couldn't be bothered with her. "What is it?"  "I have a piece of advice for you, interested in hearing it?"  "Keep your nonsense to yourself."  An Xiaoning spread her hands, "You said it, then I won't say anything. But don't you feel uncomfortable?"  She walked around the front of the car, said nothing else, opened the door, and was about to get in, but at this moment, Shi Shaochuan stopped her, "Wait."  She rolled down the window, "What?"  "Did you figure something out?"  Bu Qianqian quickly interjected, "An Xiaoning, don't play tricks in front of us, we won't fall for it."  "Bu Qianqian, you're really something." An Xiaoning leaned back in her seat lazily, her eyes looking out at the two people from the car. "If it were any other woman, Shi Shaochuan, I definitely wouldn't be so conscientious in telling you this. You're not a good person to begin with, but it happens to be Bu Qianqian, the woman I hate the most. Ah, after much deliberation, I really don't want to see Bu Qianqian living so comfortably. Shi Shaochuan, you have someone on your back."  "Someone on my back? What do you mean?"  She smiled at him, "What do you think? Figure it out yourself."  Without saying more, she closed the car window and drove off.  Shi Shaochuan stood there, then looked at Bu Qianqian, "Does what she just said mean you're up to something?"  "Shaochuan, please don't believe her nonsense, of course it wasn't me, I don't have that ability, don't wrong me."  Bu Qianqian explained eagerly, "It's me who has a grudge with her. Didn't you hear her say she doesn't want to see me living comfortably? That damn An Xiaoning is just spouting nonsense, don't believe her. Her aim is to make us both unhappy."  "Then why does she know I'm not feeling well?"  "You look so pale, anyone who's not blind can see it."  Bu Qianqian continued, "Shaochuan, don't believe her words."  Shi Shaochuan's head was aching, he didn't say anything more and just got into the car with Bu Qianqian sitting in the passenger seat.  The car headed in the direction of the Shi family's home.  The two of them didn't talk much along the way. Shi Shaochuan barely managed to drive the car home and went straight to bed as soon as they arrived. Bu Qianqian sat on the edge of the bed, her lips curling up slightly.  But thinking of An Xiaoning, that troublemaker, she wished she could just bash her with a mallet.  Fortunately, it seemed that Shi Shaochuan hadn't suspected anything.  On her way, An Xiaoning thought about the scene she had just witnessed. Shi Shaochuan had a little ghost on his back, and without thinking, she knew who was behind it. She hadn't expected Bu Qianqian to start playing dirty.  However, using a little ghost to do one's bidding, if not well looked after, would backfire.  Did she really understand the rules involved? Such a foolish woman.  It was like putting one's life in the hands of a little ghost, letting it do work for them.  Equivalent exchange.  She really didn't know what Bu Qianqian was up to.  It looked like she wanted to continue taking advantage of Shi Shaochuan, nothing else seemed apparent.  Never mind, it has nothing to do with her.  Everyone has their own fate.  In the afternoon, the heavily pregnant Jin Qingyue came.  She was close to her due date and had already prepared the baby room, but she hadn't prepared clothes for the child. She planned to ask An Xiaoning to accompany her to pick them out, and since An Xiaoning had nothing else to do, she agreed.  Wu Lianzhi also went along. He mainly drove and carried things. Originally, they wanted to call Henry, but An Xiaoning thought it over and knew that Henry definitely wouldn't want to be a porter, his temper was well known, so they didn't call him.  Little did they know, because she didn't call him, he stood by the window sulking alone.  Jin Qingyue's hair was tidied up, draped over the sides of her face, covering much of her rounded cheeks. Because of her pregnancy, she had freckles on her face, and throughout her pregnancy, she had avoided makeup to protect the baby, leaving her previously beautiful skin looking somewhat dull without the cover of cosmetics.  But her stunning beauty could not be hidden.  She walked down the stairs slowly and carefully, afraid of falling, as she couldn't see the path under her feet due to her big belly. An Xiaoning followed behind her, cautioning her to be careful, fearing any accidents.  Wu Lianzhi drove the car, and the two women sat side by side in the back seat.  The car smoothly stopped in front of the department store. This department store was one of the properties owned by the Jin Corporation.  An Xiaoning and Jin Qingyue didn't visit often. When they got out of the car, they put on hats and masks. Considering Jin Qingyue's lack of makeup, if anyone took photos of her, it could create unnecessary news. Plus, Jin Qingyue came to pick out items intending to pay, not wanting to just charge it to her family's property. So a simple disguise was more efficient.  The three of them walked through the automatic doors of the department store and entered the maternity and baby section after checking the signs.  Because Wu Lianzhi didn't wear a mask, the salesperson couldn't help but look at him a few more times.  "Bring over all your best baby boy products and clothes, let us take a look," he said.  The salesperson was stunned for a moment, "All of them?"  "All of them, and the best ones, let us choose."  The salesperson quickly called the manager, and together they brought over many baby clothes and products.  "These are all of them, please take a look."  "Put them here." Wu Lianzhi turned to the two women beside him and said, "You pick."  Jin Qingyue picked up a little outfit, her lips curving into a smile, and An Xiaoning felt the same, seeing these things made her maternal instincts overflow.  "There are so many, he won't be able to wear them all. Qingyue, we should pick some comfortable ones, no need to take so many. Just select a few for now." Jin Qingyue quickly picked several sets, small and medium-sized, "Of course, of course, children grow fast, too many won't be needed, it's enough to have just what he can wear, start by choosing a few." Chapter 1317: Just For You (15)  A good while later, Jin Qingyue took eight sets, and An Xiaoning felt it was not enough, so she took out another five sets. Then, the two of them also picked out some infant items, such as diapers, baby bottles, and the like. As for baby formula, there was no need to buy it for the time being; it could be bought later when needed. After making their selections, An Xiaoning said to the salesperson, “You can take these away; these are enough for us.”  Upon hearing this, the manager's face, which had been smiling just before, suddenly cooled down. He snorted coldly, “You people, pretending to be rich when you have no money, acting all generous and asking for the most expensive and best things to be brought out, but in the end, you didn’t even buy half.”  An Xiaoning explained, “Over a dozen sets of little clothes are enough to change into. If it's not enough, we'll come back and buy more. It's not far, and it's not like these items would be out of stock in City A, right?”  The salesperson, who was also a mother, hurriedly said, “Manager, if the customer doesn't want to buy, we can't force them. These are indeed about enough.”  However, her words not only did not have a positive effect but further angered the manager, “Am I asking for your advice? Who is the manager here, you or me?”  The salesperson was frightened, shrinking back and saying continuously, “You are, of course, you are.”  Jin Qingyue joined in, “Look, this manager knows even less than the salesperson. Maybe you two should switch positions. Manager, you can become a salesperson, or you can resign.”  Upon hearing this, the manager became even more furious, but no matter what, these were customers, so he still suppressed some of his temper, “This is our internal matter. Those who are capable can be managers, those who aren't can only be salespeople.”  Jin Qingyue, seeing how arrogant the manager was, became somewhat unhappy, “Forget it, we don't want any of these. There are other counters here. Sister-in-law, let's go have a look at another counter.”  Seeing that they didn’t want any of the items, the manager, on the other hand, was unwilling, “If you want to leave, you can go after you buy these.”  Wu Lianzhi watched coldly, “Isn’t this forced buying and selling?”  “Since you don't want them, who asked you to take so many? Are you purposely playing with us? Everything has been bagged for you.” The manager waved his hand, and immediately several security guards approached.  The meaning was clear to everyone.  However, at this moment, Jin Qingyue's phone rang. She was about to take out her phone when the manager, thinking she was going to call the police, snatched the phone away instantly.  “Pay the money quickly, and I’ll let you go.”  An Xiaoning could no longer tolerate it, “Who gave you the audacity to bully customers like this? Just take them out of the bags and put them back. Give me the phone.”  At this time, she still thought to let the matter go, considering it was Jin's department store; causing any trouble wouldn't be good.  But the manager did not see her intention and refused to give back the phone.  An Xiaoning had no choice but to take off her hat and mask. The manager and the salesperson who saw her face were scared silly.  She walked up to the manager, snatched the phone back, and delivered a sentence to him, “You really have some nerve.”  The manager turned pale, completely losing the face and tone he had before, now resembling a soft egg, unable to muster a response.  “Miss An... I'm sorry, I was blind and failed to recognize a great person, I truly apologize, I apologize to you.”  “There's no need to apologize. After all, your apology isn't sincere. It makes no difference whether you do it or not. Call over the person in charge here.”  The manager had a premonition that this matter wouldn't be easy to resolve and stood there without moving.  “You go.” An Xiaoning shouted to the salesperson, “Go call the person in charge here.”  “Yes.”  A few minutes later, the person in charge came running, followed by several people, along with the out-of-breath salesperson.  The person in charge had already heard the whole story from the salesperson on the way, “Young Madam, this is really a case of a single mouse dropping ruining a whole pot of soup. Normally, our department store staff would never dare to offend customers. It's my lack of management. Young Madam, rest assured, I will tighten up on this attitude issue, and I will fire this manager immediately.”  “That's good. I don't want to see anything like this happen here again, understand?”  “Yes, Young Madam, rest assured, it won't happen a second time.”  As the person in charge said this, he promptly ordered the salesperson, “Quickly bring the items that Young Madam liked.”  “Qingyue, do you still want these items?”  An Xiaoning called out, and then the person in charge realized that the pregnant lady in front of him was the sister of their own chairman and felt like dying.  “Forget it, they've been picked out already, I can't be bothered to look elsewhere. Let's settle the account, I'll pay with a card.”  On the way here, she had made it clear that she didn't need the items to be given to her for free, nor did she need An Xiaoning to pay for them, so An Xiaoning didn't stop her from paying with her card.  On the way back, just as the car rounded the corner ready to take the main road, a luxury car sped from behind to the front, with the man wearing black sunglasses driving away flamboyantly.  The three were somewhat dumbfounded by the flamboyance of the car, and most importantly, the car was very similar to Jin Qingyan's Mercedes, because it drove too fast, An Xiaoning didn't see it very clearly.  Wu Lianzhi looked at the passing car, shaking so much that his hands holding the steering wheel trembled, “The person driving is really wild, driving so fast, really doesn’t want to live.”  Just as they were talking, as the car drove further ahead, they saw that the car had stopped in front.  Wu Lianzhi asked, “Why has it stopped?”  An Xiaoning squinted and looked ahead, and when she saw the license plate number of the car's tail, she was somewhat speechless, turning to Jin Qingyue beside her, “That's your brother's sports car.”  “Ah? Is it?” Jin Qingyue asked, “What is my brother doing driving so fast?”  “Who knows.”  As their car was about to overtake the Mercedes, the Mercedes suddenly took off again.  “Lianzhi, follow him.”  “Alright.”  Wu Lianzhi narrowed his eyes, his gaze fixed on the car ahead that was running very fast, and his foot pressed hard on the accelerator, both fast and very steady.  Following the car, they finally arrived at a restaurant entrance.  Seeing Henry getting out of the car along with Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai, An Xiaoning immediately understood that he had been followed when he went out.  She got out of the car and asked Wu Lianzhi to take Jin Qingyue back first, since she was pregnant.  She herself walked quickly towards the entrance of the restaurant.  Henry sat at a table by the window, and the two people who followed him did not sit together but at another table.  “What were you doing just now?” An Xiaoning sat opposite Henry, “Why were you driving so fast, tired of living?”  Henry grandly rolled his eyes at her, “Why didn't the person with you come in?”  “They've gone back.”  He, of course, saw this, and deliberately asked her. Chapter 1318: As Long As You (16)  "Why didn't you go back with them?" "I saw you coming in, didn't I?" An Xiaoning spoke directly, "Did you come to the restaurant to eat because you couldn't eat at home?!" "Can't I occasionally eat out?" "Of course you can, but it's only ten o'clock, are you already hungry?" "Is there a set time for being hungry?"  Feeling that he was deliberately picking on her, An Xiaoning asked, "What do you want to eat? Let's order." "The person I'm meeting hasn't arrived yet, I'll order when they get here." "You've made an appointment?" An Xiaoning asked, "Who is it?" "Is it any of your business?" "..."  An Xiaoning deeply felt his strong irritation. What did she do to provoke him? Crazy. However, she fell silent.  An Xiaoning's hands were crossed and propped up under her chin, staring at him. He felt uncomfortable being watched and turned his gaze out of the window.  About ten minutes later, Li Baozhen hurried over. Seeing her, An Xiaoning instantly understood, "Miss Li has arrived, please take a seat." Li Baozhen did not expect to see An Xiaoning there, she said with a light smile, "Thank you, I was really surprised to receive a call from Brother Qingyan today to have a meal together, it just so happens I'm off work today."  "So that's how it is, your Brother Qingyan said he hasn't been able to see you lately, so he thought of inviting you out for a meal to ask about your recent situation. After all, you are his lifesaver, he always remembers you." Li Baozhen smiled slightly, "I'm doing well, at the company I work every day, eat meals, and after work, I stay where I live, occasionally going out for a stroll."  Henry handed her the menu, "Order what you like." "Alright." Li Baozhen took the menu, ordered a few dishes, then passed it to An Xiaoning, suggesting her to order too. An Xiaoning wasn't hungry, so she didn't order anything.  The atmosphere was somewhat awkward, perhaps because they couldn't find any common topics to discuss. During this deadlock, An Xiaoning suddenly said to Henry, "I want to have a second child."  Everyone who heard this turned their gaze to her face at the same time. Xiao Bai and Xiao Huang snickered, and Li Baozhen felt even more awkward. Henry had no idea how to respond. If it were just the two of them, he would probably have bluntly said, "Go have it yourself." But with others around, he could only say, "That's good, I've been thinking about this as well, we should have a good talk about this big issue when we get back."  Unintentionally, the three single people around them were suddenly force-fed dog food.  An Xiaoning actually understood very well that he didn't know about her past because he didn't have memories of her and Jin Qingyan, and he hadn't experienced her past, so naturally, he did not know that it was very difficult for her to get pregnant.  Under the table, she stretched out her foot and casually hooked his. Henry tensed up, his dark eyes met hers, and without thinking, he knew that the foot under the table was hers because Li Baozhen was sitting next to him.  When the food arrived, An Xiaoning only ate a few bites before stopping. As she wiped her mouth with a napkin, the napkin fell to the floor. As she bent down to pick it up, she took the opportunity to touch Henry's leg.  Henry was furious. She was teasing him surreptitiously in such a public setting. And when she picked up the napkin without any hint of a change in expression and quickly winked at him, he had to sit there as if he hadn't been affected at all.  This meal was not very enjoyable, at least the mood wasn't. So much so that when they finished, he said to her, "You and Xiao Huang, Xiao Bai go to the car, I have something I want to say to Baozhen alone."  An Xiaoning readily agreed, saving his face, "Okay." The three of them quickly left.  He waited until the three of them got into the car before turning to Li Baozhen and saying, "Work well at the company, visit your parents when you have time. If you need help with anything at the company, you can reach out to Xiaoning or Captain Fan, okay?"  "Brother Qingyan, you already told me this when I went to the company, and now you're repeating it. Are you going on a business trip again?" Henry told her, "Yes, I often go on business trips and am not often in A City." "Brother Qingyan," Li Baozhen looked at him, "why do I feel like you're going to a faraway place and not coming back?"  He didn't say more, "Let's go out, Xiaoning and the others are waiting, I'll take you back to the company." "Okay."  After sending Li Baozhen back to the company, the car returned to the Viney community, however... When they reached the garage, the car remained quiet. Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai got out first, followed closely by the two of them. It wasn't until they got back to the second floor that someone spoke.  It was An Xiaoning who spoke first, "What did you talk to her about when we were back in the car?" "I said some things that are not for others to hear." "..." An Xiaoning felt he was being strange, "What's wrong with you?" "Nothing." He opened the covers and lay down, closing his eyes as if he didn't want to bother with her.  An Xiaoning moved closer, kicked off her shoes, knelt on the bed and looked at him, "Henry, at the dining table, you agreed to have a second child with me." "Can't you tell I didn't want to embarrass you?" "You've changed." An Xiaoning looked at him, "You're not the Henry who hated me anymore. If it were the same as before, would you care if I were embarrassed?"  He squinted at her, "An Xiaoning, I want you to promise me something." "Is it that if I agree, you will want to have a second child with me?" "..." "Alright, what is it?" "From now on, when I'm not around, if he sees Baozhen, I hope he will greet her, and occasionally visit Baozhen's parents, even if it's just once a year."  "What if he doesn't go?" An Xiaoning asked. "No, he will go. He listens to you."  An Xiaoning was really going crazy, looking at his charming eyes, she really wanted to devour him. "I know you don't want to touch me at all, but I find it strange that at this moment I want to touch you. If you let me kiss you, I'll agree to it." "..."  "If you don't let me, then forget it." She was about to move over him to the inside of the bed when he suddenly said, "Just one kiss."  So, she straddled him directly, leaned down and kissed him. When Henry wanted to change his mind, it was already too late because she wasn't just giving one kiss. She practically kissed him until he had a physical reaction.  When she finally let go of him, Henry felt as if he was completely immobilized. Chapter 1319: As Long As You (17)  An Xiao Ning looked at him contentedly and sweetly said, "Oppa, saranghae." Henry's heart fluttered unexpectedly, and he found himself at a loss for words.  An Xiao Ning lay beside him, wrapping her arms around his neck, "Today, I went shopping for baby products with Lian Zhiyue, and seeing all those baby items made me really want to have another child. That way, we would have three children at home, how nice would that be?"  His lips moved, as if he wanted to say something, but he couldn't.  After a while, she did not hear his voice and thought he had fallen asleep. But when she looked up, she saw that his eyes were open, and he seemed to be lost in thought.  "Why do I feel like you have something on your mind?"  "There's nothing."  "Henry, let's go to sleep."  "Okay, let's sleep."  She repeated herself, emphasizing the word "sleep" heavily, "OK?"  "OK."  Now it was An Xiao Ning's turn to be dumbfounded. She sat up and looked at him carefully, "Qing Yan?"  "I am Henry."  "!!"  An Xiao Ning leaned in closer, "What's wrong with you? If something's troubling you, just tell me, don't keep it to yourself."  "An Xiao Ning."  "Hmm?"  "If I never disappear, will you really hate me?"  "I refuse to answer that question," she said, declining to respond.  He nodded, apparently understanding something.  "Ah! What are you doing?!"  "Henry, have you gone mad? What's gotten into you?"  "Let go, I'm telling you to let go, you're crazy, let me go!"  "..."  The soundproofing in the room was so good that none of the noise inside could be heard from outside.  In the afternoon.  Aunt Chen knocked on the door again, "Young Madam, Young Master, it's time to eat, it's already three o'clock."  Inside, An Xiao Ning made a soft and gentle sound, "I know, Aunt Chen, I'll be down soon."  After hearing her response, Aunt Chen hurried downstairs to get ready.  An Xiao Ning slightly opened her eyes, her gaze vacant for a moment before she turned to look at the man beside her.  She had never thought, really never thought that he would be so proactive, and in such a wild manner at that. Usually, he didn't even want her to touch a finger, which just goes to show the old saying, the more unexpected it is, the more surprising.  An Xiao Ning propped herself up and sat up, noticing a piece of paper on the nightstand alongside a pen.  She picked up the paper, which had a few lines written on it.  [I lost our bet, and I keep my word, I will disappear on my own, today... was the happiest day of my life, and it was you, the one I used to hate, who gave it to me, thank you. ——Henry]  Reading this, An Xiao Ning's hand trembled slightly.  For her, today, he had been too surprising.  She didn't even know when she had made him fall in love with her.  Originally, his disappearance would have been more than welcome for her.  But this silent goodbye made her feel a little sad.  She sat there in a daze for quite a while before she let herself lie back down, hugging the man next to her tightly.  The man she hugged instinctively hugged her back and whispered, "Xiao Ning..."  "Mhm."  He opened his eyes and saw her close at hand before looking at himself.  Soon, he realized.  They were facing each other with nothing to hide.  Jin Qing Yan's mind flashed back to the passion they shared.  Then, gradually, more and more memories began to flood in, prompting him to sit up abruptly.  "Qing Yan, what's wrong?"  Jin Qing Yan hugged her tightly, "Xiao Ning."  "Yes, what is it?"  "Why do I suddenly have Henry's memories?"  An Xiao Ning understood what was happening. If the two sets of memories were originally separated, blocked, now they were just connected, and the price was Henry's true disappearance.  "He kept his promise to me and disappeared on his own. Actually, it's just that your unhappy and negative things have come to light, you are still you, whether it's Henry or Jin Qing Yan, it's still just you. You guys were always one person. But this is also a precedent. Dissociative identity disorder is still diagnosed as incurable in current medicine, yet you recovered, didn't you? Unbelievable."  "He fell in love with you?" Although this was within Jin Qing Yan's expectations, he still found it somewhat incredible, "Earlier than I imagined. I thought at the very least it would take many more times of you two being alone together."  "I also feel it's quite sudden. I thought about it carefully, and he probably realized today that his feelings for me had changed from dislike to being moved. His behavior today was very off, and he suddenly went crazy and pinned me to the bed, hmph."  Jin Qing Yan raised his eyebrows with a meaningful "oh," "So..."  "There's no 'so.' I need to get up, it's already three in the afternoon, I need to eat. Since all of Henry's memories have merged with yours, I don't need to tell you some things separately, especially about Li Baozhen's matter. Henry said that at least once a year we should go see her parents and treat them well. I support that, after all, they're people who saved you, we owe them, don't we?"  "Of course, but say it one more time."  "Say what one more time?"  "Say oppa, saranghae."  "..."  An Xiao Ning complied with his request and called out, "Oppa, saranghae, brother, I love you."  He hugged her joyfully into his arms.  —  October 16th on the lunar calendar is Jin Qing Yan's birthday.  For him, the best birthday gift would be the lifting of the curse.  They were not worried about Wu Haigang deceiving them because he knew very well that he would die at their hands, while his descendants would still be alive.  At this time, he didn't have the time to choose otherwise.  On the 16th, he lifted their curse, but with the curse lifted, he also met his end.  The witchcraft of the Wu family was completely eradicated.  As for the Donggong family of Country R, An Xiao Ning thought that their decision to execute her resulted in Wu Haigang dying by her hand.  Nothing else mattered anymore.  After the curse was lifted, Wu Haigang was executed secretly.  An Xiao Ning finally felt relieved, and this was the most relaxed and comfortable phase of her life.  Wu Lianzhi's household registration application was approved.  "Now that you have permanent residence here, I've also arranged a job for you, a counselor at the university. Although the school prohibits romantic relationships between teachers and students, I think this is the place with the most female students. If you find someone you're mutually attracted to, you can choose another job, or you can keep your marriage and relationship secret. What do you think?" Chapter 1320: As Long As You Wish (18)  "It's exactly what I want, but I'm worried about one thing."  "What?"  "The Donggong family might continue to seek revenge on me."  "Do you think they would dare to do that?" An Xiaoning continued, "In that case, I will send another statement to them later, telling them that you are my good friend. If they dare to trouble you again, I will definitely hold them accountable. Is that okay?"  "Xiaoning is mighty."  An Xiaoning laughed, "Isn't that what I should do? Thanks to you, the curse has been lifted. I will protect you thoroughly. So, boldly pursue the peaceful life you want and find the girl you like."  "Mm, okay, I will try hard."  ...  The servants at the manor were busy preparing for the birthday party all day.  Although Jin Qingyan had already received the best birthday gift, it didn't mean that there wasn't another celebration.  In the evening, he would invite his closest friends to attend a small party.  They would celebrate together.  Just after five o'clock in the afternoon, An Xiaoning had just finished her bath and came out when he caught her and carried her straight to bed, domineeringly saying, "First, sing me a birthday song."  "I'll sing it properly for you when the party starts."  "I want to hear you sing it first."  An Xiaoning rolled her eyes, "True to Jin San Sui's style. Alright, alright, today is your birthday, you're the boss. It's just singing it once, and now I'll start singing for our Oppa."  He even clapped his hands, which made An Xiaoning want to laugh.  "Happy Birthday to you... Happy Birthday to you..."  "It sounds really nice."  He had just finished complimenting her when he pressed her down, turned over, and kissed and tickled her on the bed. The two of them rolled around on the bed, and at that moment, An Xiaoning couldn't stop laughing.  If it weren't for someone knocking on the door, she could have laughed for another three minutes.  It was Fan Shixin delivering the equipment for tonight's birthday party.  The specially tailored clothes and shoes for her.  After opening and looking at them, An Xiaoning particularly liked the outfit, a white evening dress with matching diamond-studded high heels. These high heels were specially made with care for An Xiaoning, who did not like to wear high heels. The heels were quite high, but they were very stable to walk in, and they made her feet look very pretty.  After both of them had gotten ready, when they came downstairs, a small group of people had already arrived.  Ling Ciyue and Jin Qingyue were leaning on the couch, while Long Tianze was originally sitting on the other side of Ling Ciyue. However, he felt uncomfortable sitting and simply lay down, laying on Ling Ciyue's legs.  If it weren't for the fact that they were buddies, Ling Ciyue would have long kicked him to Wakawakaland.  "Yah yah yah yah yah." Long Tianze smacked his lips in admiration, "Look at how beautiful sister-in-law is, beautiful, beautiful."  "Indeed, sister-in-law, you look really good in this outfit."  Jin Qingyue also praised, "Very beautiful."  "Money is useful, isn't it?"  An Xiaoning smiled, "How come Yangyang hasn't arrived yet?"  "He went to pick up the kids. How can the kids not participate in such a celebration?"  Once the kids were picked up, almost everyone had arrived.  There weren't many outsiders here. It was a small gathering.  So, at a little past six o'clock, the birthday party officially began.  Fan Shixin took on the role of the host, and after the opening words were said, it was time for Jin Qingyan to make a wish and cut the cake.  Jin Qingyan walked up to the cake, the birthday song played, and he held his own hand and closed his eyes. Soon, he gently blew out the candles on the cake.  Below, there was a thunderous applause.  Jin Qingyan spoke, "I just made a wish, do you all want to know what it is?"  Everyone looked at him with bated breath, curious about his wish.  "My wish..." he paused slightly, his eyes full of tenderness as he looked towards An Xiaoning in the audience, "is to marry Xiaoning as my wife as soon as possible."  "Great!" Long Tianze led the cheer, clapping excitedly.  The others also followed suit with cheers and shouts.  Only An Xiaoning stood there quietly watching Jin Qingyan, with a faint smile on her face.  When it was time to cut the cake, An Xiaoning cut it with him, and after everyone had a piece of cake, they started to eat, drink, and be merry. They danced together and had a blast.  The kids were incredibly happy, and they even sneakily gathered in a room together, bringing alcohol with them.  As a result, they all drank a bit too much and got drunk, sprawling out asleep.  ---  An Xiaoning never expected that Wang Jinsheng would actually come to find her. She still saw him, though she really didn't want to.  "Miss An..."  "If you came here this time to ask me to speak for you about your issue, then there's no need to speak, it's useless and unnecessary."  Wang Jinsheng didn't expect that she already knew, "Miss An, when did you..."  "Although the morning news reported it today, I already knew before that." An Xiaoning asked with a smile, "Isn't it you who told Heyi that it was me who blew up Shenjia Lake? Isn't it you who has been in frequent contact with Heyi, a member of the archaeological team in touch with tomb raiders so often, I really don't know what you're thinking? Moreover... you actually did those illegal things, it can be said that you can still come here now, the police must already be on their way to arrest you, right?"  Hearing her say this, Wang Jinsheng was already sweating profusely, "Miss An, please help me this time, I promise I won't do it again."  "Captain Wang, can't you hear what I'm saying?" An Xiaoning stood up, "You have to bear the consequences of your own mistakes."  "Madam, the Criminal Police Brigade is here, they said they are here to take Captain Wang."  "Isn't he right here?"  Fan Shixin made a gesture to the officers outside the door.  Several officers came in and took Wang Jinsheng away. An Xiaoning let out a sigh of relief and asked, "Shixin, I really don't know what Captain Wang was thinking?"  "I don't know what he was thinking either. He probably didn't know that you were already aware of the situation, so he came to try his luck."  "Possibly. There's nothing to be done when someone deliberately hurts themselves."  ...  After lunch, An Xiaoning received a phone call from Pan Zhenghui, asking her to go to the station.  An Xiaoning went, and Pan Zhenghui called her in mainly to discuss two things. The first was about Wang Jinsheng and Heyi, and the second was about a case he wanted to hand over to her.  First, talking about Wang Jinsheng's matter, Pan Zhenghui shook his head and said, "It's such a pity, he's been in the archaeological team for so many years, and as a team leader, how could he make such a mistake? He can't be a leader anymore, losing his job is one thing, but he will also have to go to jail. Speaking of Heyi, you asked me to keep an eye on him, and he really hasn't stopped, he's not an easy person to deal with. The police in Country Y are currently issuing a warrant for his arrest, requesting the assistance of our police force." Chapter 1321: As Long As You (19)  An Xiaoning asked, "Did you catch him?"  "Could we not have? You had already instructed me to keep an eye on him. I had people watching him at all times, and we easily captured him. He's already been taken away by the overseas police; his guilt is even greater than Wang Jinsheng's."  "How many years do you think he'll be sentenced to?"  "At a conservative estimate, more than ten years. He's fallen; he's got it coming."  Hearing this, An Xiaoning didn't say much more; after all, everyone has their own life, and everyone should be responsible for themselves.  "Let's talk about the case."  "Sure." Pan Zhenghui handed her several file boxes, "Here are two famous cold cases. Take a look and decide which one to investigate first. These cases haven't been solved for many years. However, one of them, despite having sufficient evidence, feels very challenging to me. Take them back and discuss with the members of the special group."  An Xiaoning took them and said, "Alright, I got it."  As she left the office, she opened the file boxes while walking.  The files inside had yellowed, showing their age.  An Xiaoning walked into the office, and the several people inside all looked at her. Ma Jianguo rubbed his hands and chuckled, "Xiaoning, you're here. We've been waiting for you. We've just finished our case, and the chief said that we're to start on a major case with you."  An Xiaoning sat down and spoke seriously, "I currently have two famous cold cases on hand. I've briefly scanned through them; one is from twenty-two years ago, and the other is from fourteen years ago. All of the cases don't necessarily involve meticulous thinkers with strong anti-investigation capabilities. Thinking back on ten or twenty years ago, when there were no surveillance cameras or fingerprints, it was indeed not easy to solve cases. Take a preliminary look at these two cases, and after you've seen them, I'll take a look."  She passed the file bags to every one of them to look through. After about ten minutes, everyone had quickly reviewed the key points and then passed the files back to her.  "Have you all finished? Which case do you think we should start with?"  Ma Jianguo suggested, "I propose we start with the Widow Village case. It's the oldest and, although there is a lot of speculation online, it's not as conclusive as the other one. I think that the case without evidence will be very difficult, so let's start with the more challenging one."  "I agree with Lao Ma," Gong Le echoed, "Team leader, I've been following the discussions about the Widow Village case online as well, but I think that the perpetrator is still living well to this day, which is the most unsettling part for the victims. This case will be the hardest to investigate, so I also think we should start with this one."  An Xiaoning nodded, "Then we'll start with this one. But do you really think the second case with conclusive evidence will be easy to resolve? If it were that easy, why was the investigation terminated despite the evidence and without a conclusion?"  Ma Jianguo said in a low voice, "Isn't it because the perpetrator's family background is too powerful? Someone was pressing down on it. Of course, compared to your status, Xiaoning, that person's status is nothing. There's always someone greater out there. I bet they don't know you're personally going to investigate this case. I wonder if they would be scared out of their wits if they knew."  "Keep your mouths shut about the second case. We haven't started yet, so keep your lips sealed tight, or else you'll be responsible for the consequences."  "Ah, Xiaoning, you can rest easy a hundred times over. What are we? We are police officers, alright? Trust your subordinates, OK?"  An Xiaoning hummed in acknowledgment, "I'll take the second case file home with me and keep it there. When we start working on it, I'll discuss it with you. For now, focus all your attention on the first case. I want to adopt a discreet approach to the investigation and delve into it slowly. This case has probably become a taboo topic in the village. Also, I want to confirm something: before this case happened, the gender ratio in the village was normal, right?"  "That's right. After the case, men in the village started dying one after another, and many men were too scared to stay at home and moved away. Now, the only ones living in the village are economically disadvantaged elderly men, middle-aged widows, and children. Most of the elderly are also widows. At that time, everyone suspected it was a problem with the water source, but that's not it. After all, both men and women in the village drank from the well, so why did only the men die one after another? It didn't take long for the village to be renamed Widow Village."  Ma Jianguo recalled, "More than twenty years ago, there were superstitious rumors that the deceased of the case we're investigating was taking revenge on the village. So now, basically, the victim's death is associated with this."  "It seems that to truly understand the situation in Widow Village, we must go there in person. I was planning to do so anyway."  Zu Dong asked, "Team leader, are we going with you, or do you have other plans?"  "If so many of us go together, it will definitely raise suspicions. I'll assign tasks."  She said methodically, "Zu Dong will come with me. Gong Le and Ding Liang, you two young ones will go to the area around Widow Village for a field investigation without arousing suspicion from the villagers. As for Ma Jianguo, being the eldest, you'll stay on standby at the station."  "Xiaoning, you're discriminating against me for being old," Ma Jianguo protested strongly, "I don't want to stay at the station. I'll go with the two of them. I'm an experienced old police officer, much more knowledgeable than they are."  "Alright, then. I'll take the case file home and take a closer look. You three go for the reconnaissance, and Zu Dong will come back to the Vini community with me."  "Okay."  An Xiaoning drove Zu Dong back and found that Jin Qingyan was still at home and hadn't gone to the company.  "Why didn't you go to the company?"  "I'll go in a while."  When Jin Qingyan saw Zu Dong come in with her, he asked, "Are you really taking on a case?"  "Yes, I've taken it. This afternoon, Zu Dong and I will go to Widow Village. I won't be coming back for a while."  Jin Qingyan disliked hearing such words, as it meant he'd have to sleep alone at night and wouldn't see her for a short period.  "So you plan to stay there?"  "Yes, of course."  An Xiaoning thought for a moment and added, "Zu Dong and I will pretend to be a married couple looking to rent a house."  It was better to tell him early to avoid him getting jealous unexpectedly.  "..."  Jin Qingyan disagreed, "Let Shi Xin go with you." Chapter 1322: As Long As You (20)  "Why? Shixin is your assistant, I'm going to solve a case, so it would be more appropriate to go with our team's police officers, right?" An Xiaoning seemed to have realized something, "Didn't I pretend to be a couple with Shixin when I went to Country V before? Don't be too petty."  "I'm not being petty. Am I a petty person? The main thing is I'm worried when you go, so I feel more at ease if Shixin goes with you."  "......" Seeing him making unreasonable arguments, clearly not wanting others to pretend to be her husband, so he...  "Have you considered his girlfriend's feelings when you command Shixin like this?" An Xiaoning waved her hand to let Zu Dong wait outside. Zu Dong felt a bit awkward and immediately went out.  "Either you don't go, or you take him with you, you choose."  "Jin Qingyan."  "I didn't hear."  "Brother."  "It's useless even if you call me Grandpa."  An Xiaoning approached him and sat down beside him, "How old are you? You're thirty-four, not three or four years old. I'm going to do my job with the police officers, not to do something else. Is it necessary?"  "I just want my person to accompany you. If I could accompany you myself, I would have gone, but I have to manage the company. Having Shixin go with you, I'm at ease if you two pretend to be a couple. You've pretended before and have experience."  "......"  "Did you hear what I said?"  "Alright, let Shixin go with you then. I see you trust your people."  An Xiaoning glared at him, "Are you satisfied now?"  "Mhm, satisfied."  He dialed Fan Shixin's number, called and then quickly hung up. In no time, Fan Shixin arrived.  "Young Master."  "Go on a countryside trip with your young madam."  Fan Shixin was confused. Generally, trips like this should be accompanied by himself, right? Why was it his turn now?  "Young Master, a countryside trip?"  "Mhm, considering you've been working hard for the company recently, I specially grant you this."  "Even though you say that, Young Master, I still feel like there's a catch."  "Don't listen to your young master's nonsense. There's no trip. I'm going to the countryside to investigate a case. Originally, I was going to pretend to be a couple with one of our male police officers...um..."  Before she could finish, her mouth was forcefully covered.  Fan Shixin roughly understood the situation and completed the unfinished sentence for An Xiaoning, "The police officer at the door, right? My young master doesn't want you to pretend to be a couple with him, so he assigned me. To be precise, my young master doesn't like you pretending to be a couple with people he doesn't trust, even though he knows it's fake, even though he knows nothing will happen, but he's just petty and unwilling."  "That's right!" An Xiaoning pried Jin Qingyan's hand away, "Did you hear that? Shixin expressed it so accurately. Jin Qingyan, you're really hopeless."  "If I'm hopeless, I'm hopeless. I'm happy to spend my money as I please, and I just like to do it this way. If you're not happy, don't go."  An Xiaoning had had enough and pointed her index finger directly at his forehead, "Fine, fine, fine. We'll do it your way. Shixin and I will go together."  Zu Dong, due to her sudden change of mind, could only go and meet up with Ma Jianguo and others.  She and Fan Shixin then packed their luggage and put it in the car.  The car left the city at half-past one and didn't arrive until half-past five in the afternoon, a full four-hour drive.  When they got to the market town near Widow Village, the sky was gloomy and looked like it was about to rain.  An Xiaoning had Fan Shixin park the car in a parking lot, then they both wore masks and took their luggage on a tricycle to their destination.  The tricycle driver, a man, was very surprised when he heard that the two of them were going there.  "Are the two of you going back to see your parents?" he asked.  "No, we're visiting relatives."  "Then don't stay there too long. That village is particularly strange. The village is left with only women, and it is very rare to see men, so generally no men go there. You and your man shouldn't stay there for long. Go quickly and come back quickly. Look, it's getting dark."  An Xiaoning suddenly asked, "Big brother, is it really that strange? You're making me a bit scared."  "It's really that strange. All the men in their village had accidents within a short period of time, and almost all of them died. Everyone here knows about this. You two don't sound like you've been here before, right?"  "Mhm, it's our first time."  "Then no wonder. Listen to me, you won't go wrong."  "Alright, thank you, big brother."  After seven or eight minutes, the tricycle arrived at a spot before Widow Village and stopped there. The driver, disliking the bad luck, didn't go further. "There, that's the place."  An Xiaoning paid the fare, and she and Fan Shixin walked the rest of the way.  "Shixin, remember when we went to Country V with Xiaobai? We pretended to be a couple, and starting now, we'll do the same. I'll be called Mu Ning."  "Okay, I got it. Don't worry, my acting skills are top-notch."  An Xiaoning smirked with pursed lips, "Yes, I acknowledge your acting skills. It's just that your young master is sometimes blindly worried."  "He cares too much about you, that's why."  "There are people at the entrance of the village. Let's walk faster and ask."  The two of them quickened their pace, and An Xiaoning greeted them with a smile, "Hello, is there a house for rent in the village? My husband and I are doing a small business at the market town, but the houses there are too expensive. This place is very close to the town, so we want to rent a house nearby. We asked around other villages, but there were none."  "There is one, there is." A middle-aged woman stood up enthusiastically, "My family has two lower rooms empty, but..."  Her tone gradually became hesitant, "If you and your husband don't mind our village's bad reputation, I can rent them to you."  "It's fine, my husband plans to sleep in the shop, and he won't live here much. Mainly, I'll cook and live here."  Hearing her say that, the middle-aged woman immediately spoke up, "Then that's great, I'll rent it to you."  Upon hearing this, An Xiaoning immediately beamed with joy, "Okay, sister, take us to see the house. If there's no problem, we'll settle down."  "Alright, girl, follow me."  The two followed the middle-aged woman into the village and stopped in front of an iron gate. She took out the key and opened the gate, "My last name is Wang. After the kids went to school and my husband went to work out of town, he hasn't come back for several years. Only I am left at home, and there's no one to talk to. The lower rooms were originally my daughter's place, quite clean, but she only comes back during summer and winter vacations, so they're empty anyway."  "Wang sister, are there many people in the village?" 
Chapter 1906: It's Hard to Forget Without Thinking (Twelve)  Thinking of these, Su Jue couldn't help feeling sorry for Su Yan and held his arm tightly without letting go. She pouted and said, "Brother, I really do hope you find me a sister-in-law soon, have a little nephew, so you also have someone to take care of you."  "Who asked you to worry about this?" Su Yan still had a smile on his face, and he reached out to gently pinch Su Jue's mouth.  It was still indulgent.  He wanted to avoid the topic with all his heart, and Su Jue, no matter how naive, could see it. She didn't want to force him, sat up straight, and sighed, "Well, let's leave it, I get worried every time we talk about it."  Her hands were still holding his arm, very affectionately.  Su Yan smiled slightly and said, "With my good conditions, I won't end up a bachelor."  "Cut." Su Jue gave him a dismissive white eye, "Narcissist, you've been infected by the third brother."  Su Yan laughed helplessly, while laughing, he shrugged noncommittally.  It seemed to say: That's how it is.  Su Jue reached out again to pick up the cup. The tea in the cup had a bit of a hot feeling just now, and it was just right to drink in one go now. After testing the temperature, she tilted her head back and drank a cup of water in one breath, looking very thirsty. Su Yan watched her and asked with curiosity, "Where have you been, why are you here at this time?"  After finishing the water, Su Jue put down the cup and replied truthfully to Su Yan, "I went to see Qiao Chen's mother. On my way back, I unconsciously came here."  "Oh."  Su Jue nodded and then asked, "Did you bring little Qiao with you?"  He looked at little Qiao, munching an apple, with his little legs dangling and swinging from side to side, an innocent look of carefree joy.  It was irresistible to want to protect her, not wanting, afraid that she would suffer any harm.  His mother didn't have the beautiful childhood she should have had, so he was particularly eager to give her a beautiful and warm childhood filled with colors.  There was a time when he wanted to intervene, there was a Qiao Chen, the guy who risked his life to save Su Jue.  He had thought he would be the one sent by heaven to compensate Su Jue for the shortcomings of her childhood and teenage years living in the dark.  He thought Qiao Chen would be Su Jue's best and final destination.  But unexpectedly, he was the best, but not the final.  That guy, even now, would suddenly burst into his mind, into his dreams.  So little Qiao must not forget him.  And he also hopes that Ming Ansheng won't be worse than Qiao Chen, that his love for Su Jue won't be less than Qiao Chen's.  This is a selfish thought, a selfish wish of a brother.  "Mhm."  Su Jue pursed her lips and said, "But I didn't go in, just looked from the doorway for a while. I was afraid that if I went in, she would remember Qiao Chen when she saw me, and it would upset her."  Su Yan smiled and changed the subject, "Is little Qiao adapting well to kindergarten?"  Su Jue nodded, "Mhm, with Yan Yan and the others taking care of her, she gets along quite well with the other kids."  "That's good."  Su Yan smiled slightly, then looked at Su Jue and said, "Bring little Qiao with you to the new product launch event to have fun."  Su Jue was thrilled, "Sure, I'll bring Ming Ansheng with me."  "Does he need you to bring him?" Su Yan raised an eyebrow, "Isn't he the one bringing you?"  Su Jue pouted, "If we're talking about who's more important, from Rongsheng's perspective, I'm the main one."  While the two were talking, the door to Su Yan's office suddenly opened. Hearing the door open, Su Jue looked over in surprise, wondering who was so rude to come in without knocking. The only one she could guess was probably the third brother, but the person who came in was a tall woman. Chapter 1907: Without Intention, Unforgettable (Thirteen)  Su Yue looked at the woman who walked in with surprise. This... wasn't this the big star, Aireli, from just before? Why has she come back again? No... the question should be why she came to her brother's office, and most importantly, she didn't even knock on the door; this woman was too impolite.  Watching Aireli stride in, Su Yue couldn't explain the feeling of annoyance that arose in her heart, she could only summarize it as feeling upset.  Aireli, with a light green Hermès bag on one arm and her spectacles she had just taken off after entering in the other hand, walked into the office. The high heels on her feet tapped on the wooden floor with a 'clack clack' sound, making her presence very noticeable.  Upon entering, she first glanced in the direction of Su Yan's office, and upon seeing Su Xiaoqiao, a look of surprise flashed across her beautiful face, followed by a confused gaze towards Su Xiaoqiao.  However, Su Xiaoqiao, who was engrossed in watching an animated film, didn't notice her presence at all. Her bright, sparkling eyes were glued to the computer screen, unblinking.  Aireli watched Su Xiaoqiao for a while, and just as she was about to divert her gaze elsewhere, Su Yan suddenly looked at her and called out, "Miss Ai."  After calling her, he stood up, ready to greet her.  Su Yue also stood up with him, her hands still wrapped around his arm, affectionate and natural.  Hearing Su Yan's voice, Aireli smiled with her lips curved, and as her gaze turned towards him, and then to Su Yue by his side, the smile on her face stiffened for a moment.  "President Su."  After greeting Su Yan, she looked at Su Yue with a puzzled... and slightly probing gaze, a complex look flashing in her eyes.  Su Yue noticed all of Aireli's reactions after seeing her, and deliberately hugged Su Yan's arm tighter, even resting her head on his shoulder.  Her brother was such a catch that even a big star couldn't resist the temptation. This woman, at one glance, it was obvious she liked her brother.  But for some reason, she felt an innate rejection of her, which was inexplicable.  Or perhaps, she thought that her brother's indifferent nature was not suited for women from the entertainment industry, especially those who appeared to be strong-willed.  Of course, her thoughts only represented herself and nobody else, including her brother.  "President Su, who is this?" Su Yue was pondering to herself when Aireli, after observing her for a while, pointed at her and asked Su Yan.  Su Yan then introduced, "This is my sister, Su Yue."  A simple introduction, but it made Aireli's beautiful face go from winter to spring, as if revitalized.  It was too obvious, Su Yue criticized in her mind, what a Best Actress, with no acting skills at all.  However, this also meant that her brother was excellent, to the point where even a Best Actress couldn't help herself around him.  Proudly thinking to herself, Su Yue watched as Aireli approached with a smile, "Hello."  Aireli walked up to Su Yue and politely extended her right hand.  The Su Yue of the past, when faced with people she didn't like, even if they were standing right in front of her, would just tilt her head up and not even glance at them. But now, time had smoothed her edges, and she understood the ways of the world and how to interact with people.  She reached out and shook hands with Aireli, smiling slightly, "Hello, Miss Ai."  After the greeting, she withdrew her hand, quite naturally.  Aireli didn't find it awkward either, withdrawing her hand and smiling again at Su Yan, "I just realized that I forgot my scarf here." Chapter 1908: Without Deliberation, Unforgettable (14)  As she spoke, her gaze swept across the sofa and finally landed on a corner of the couch. Her heavily made-up, somewhat enchanting almond eyes brightened as she pointed in that direction and said, "It's there. I was too careless, always losing and forgetting things." She laughed at herself, walked over, and picked up the scarf.  Although it was a large floral scarf, the pattern was very refreshing, not at all vulgar but rather elegant. This is also the value of big brands and top designers.  Su Jue stared at the scarf in Ai Rili's hand, thoughtful. She came to talk about work, left her scarf behind, and didn't bring an assistant. Was the scarf really lost by accident, or was it a ploy to find another opportunity to strike up a conversation with her brother?  Ah, ah, ah, Su Jue, why are you so narrow-minded, have you been reading too many novels? She reined in those melodramatic plot lines in her mind, pouted, and looked at Ai Rili, still feeling sour inside.  For some reason, she actually wanted her brother to find a girlfriend and get married soon. She held Su Yan's arm and never let go, always hugging it tightly, as if declaring her ownership to Ai Rili, or as if she was telling Ai Rili that she didn't like her.  Ai Rili, holding the scarf, returned to the front of the Su Yan and Su Jue siblings. Su Yan looked at her and politely said, "Make a phone call, and I'll have someone send it down."  Ai Rili smiled generously, "It's no trouble, I came up to get it myself."  To become a movie queen and to be so popular, there must be something extraordinary about her. Su Jue noticed that Ai Rili's smile with those dimples was really charming. Especially her face, which seemed perfect but with some indescribable small imperfections, compared to those flawless internet celebrities and surgically altered stars, was unique.  Su Jue's gaze, without realizing, was assessing Ai Rili again. Ai Rili suddenly looked towards her, her smile still generous. After glancing at Su Jue, she smiled and said to Su Yan, "President Su, your sister is very pretty."  Without waiting for Su Yan to respond, she added, "And she looks a lot like you."  Su Yan's lips curled up slightly, but he said nothing.  Upon hearing this, Su Jue secretly rolled her eyes at Ai Rili. Just compliment her brother on being handsome, why bother using her as a pretext?  In her heart, Su Jue criticized Ai Rili numerous times. She's popular, has temperament, has charm, but... she just didn't like her. She felt that personal feelings were really inexplicable.  Ai Rili showed no signs of leaving and kept looking for topics to chat with Su Yan about. As Su Jue listened to the irrelevant chatter, she found it boring and let go of Su Yan's arm, preparing to go to Xiao Qiao's place.  ‘Knock, knock, knock’  Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Without waiting for Su Yan to respond, the knocker had already pushed the door open.  "Su Yan, your third brother and I have to leave now," said Wen Xuxu, carrying a bag and rushing in to greet Su Yan. Seeing Ai Rili, she paused, and her hurried demeanor became a bit more reserved.  "Sister-in-law."  Su Jue saw Wen Xuxu and changed direction, walking towards her happily. "Xuxu is here," Su Jue said with a smile, though it seemed somewhat forced.  Seeing this, Su Yan grew anxious, "What's wrong? What happened?"  He asked while walking towards Xuxu.  Xuxu's mouth turned down sadly, "Ah Heng's grandfather passed away at the Cardio-Cerebral Vascular Hospital, and your third brother and I are going there now." Chapter 1909: Without Contemplation, It's Hard to Forget (Fifteen)  Her relationship with Jiang Zhuoheng, along with the fact that the old Master Jiang and the Jiang family had been very good to her, weighed on her mind. Now that the old master had passed away, although he had lived to a ripe old age, she still felt very sad.  Upon hearing the news, Su Yan's face showed a moment of shock, "Then you should hurry over."  "Okay," Xu Xu nodded, turned to Su Xuan and called out, "We're leaving now."  She then hurriedly walked towards the door. Su Xiaoqiao suddenly called out to her, "Auntie."  Xu Xu stopped in her tracks, turned around with a gentle smile to the little girl, "Xiaoqiao, auntie has something to do now and can't play with you. Be good, okay?"  "Okay," Su Xiaoqiao obediently nodded, then raised her little hand to wave goodbye to Xu Xu, "Bye, auntie."  "Goodbye!" Xu Xu quickly left, and Su Yan watched the office door close automatically, somewhat lost in thought.  "Brother, isn't Ah Heng's grandfather also Xin Yanting's grandfather?" Su Yan nodded in confirmation.  "Uh, aren't you going to pay a visit?"  "Don't gossip."  "Hmph, I don't like this attitude of yours."  "President Su, I'll be leaving first then."  "Miss Ai, take care."  Su Yan nodded slightly to Ai Ruili, then called out, "Mi Xiao."  Hearing this, Su Xuan asked in confusion, "Who is Mi Xiao?"  Before her words had finished, the door to the office opened, and in came a skinny little girl dressed in a white shirt and black fashion pants, her attire very professional. She wore black-framed glasses on her nose bridge and looked to be around her age, possibly even younger. At first glance, her looks were very ordinary.  Su Xuan sized up the girl who had come in. The girl adjusted the glasses on her nose bridge and looked at Su Yan, asking, "President Su."  Su Yan instructed her, "See Miss Ai out."  "Okay." Mi Xiao nodded, then turned to look at Ai Ruili. Her expression seemed a bit nervous, perhaps not very familiar with the task.  "Miss Ai, please." Mi Xiao bowed slightly to Ai Ruili, and after Ai Ruili walked out, she followed and closed the office door behind them.  "Brother, who was that?" Su Xuan withdrew her gaze from the door and looked at Su Yan, "Isn't it usually the secretary's job to escort guests out?"  That should indeed be the case.  "That's right, she is my secretary," Su Yan replied indifferently to Su Xuan, then walked towards Su Xiaoqiao with his hands naturally tucked into his trouser pockets, his steps leisurely.  Secretary? Su Xuan's eyes widened in surprise, "Wow!"  She watched Su Yan's tall figure and quickly followed after him, "Is there a problem?"  Su Yan glanced at her lazily, pretending to be puzzled. As astute as he was, he obviously knew why Su Xuan had reacted that way.  Su Xuan nodded quickly like a pecking chicken, "Mhm, it's a big problem."  As they walked, she said, "Weren't you the one who doesn't use female secretaries? I remember the last time you went abroad, you had that very handsome male secretary."  Hearing this, Su Yan laughed and curved his lips, "Just haven't recruited the right one, making a big deal out of nothing."  After saying that, he flicked Su Xuan's forehead.  Su Xuan winced in pain, covered her head with her hand, and pouted unhappily, "That hurt, but the one just now didn't seem that impressive either."  She then grinned again and laughed, "But brother, you've finally come around to letting other women come close to you, so I'm relieved. Otherwise, every time you travel on business, you always have to bring a handsome guy with you. It really worries me, I'm afraid you'd get confused." Chapter 1910: Without Contemplation, Hard to Forget (Sixteen)  "What?" Su Yan's eyebrows furrowed, a dangerous glint in his eyes, and the hand he had just slipped into his pocket was pulled out again. Su Yue hurriedly shrank her neck and agilely raised her hands to protect her head, giving Su Yan an ingratiating smile, "Hehe, a slip of the tongue, a slip of the tongue..."  Indeed it was a bit much, joking around with her own brother like that.  But even as she begged for mercy, Su Yan's eyes continued to stare at her unblinkingly.  Su Yue was on guard, "What? Why are you looking at me like that?"  Su Yan curved his lips into a smile, "I just remembered, you're idling at home now, why don't you come to work? That way, I don't have to hire someone else."  His tone and attitude made it hard to distinguish his sincerity.  Regardless of whether it was true or false, Su Yue immediately shook her head in refusal, "Psh, I don't want to."  As she spoke, she remembered something and, feeling unconvinced, pouted, "Who says I'm idling? My online store is still running, alright?"  And her online store was doing quite well.  She wouldn't give up such a free-spirited job to work nine-to-five at a company unless she was crazy.  "Besides, even if I wanted to work and be a secretary, I would go be Ming Ansheng's secretary, not run off to Rongsheng."  Su Yan nodded in understanding, "Mm, daughters married off are like water spilled out, but..."  He paused for a moment, then suddenly laughed, "But you haven't married off yet, have you?"  "Annoying." Su Yue's face blushed red, and she punched Su Yan's shoulder lightly.  Su Yan chuckled, then put away his joking demeanor and said to Su Yue, "I'll be busy for a while, you take Xiao Qiao to play."  "Okay." Su Yue nodded, "I'll take Xiao Qiao upstairs and downstairs for a walk, and we'll go eat dinner together after you finish work."  "Mm."  ...  "Sure enough, the traffic is jammed at this time, without exception."  On the ring road at six o'clock, the cars were moving slower than Mr. Sloth's speaking pace, causing Su Yue to complain.  "Are you very hungry?" Su Yan pointed at the storage compartment in front of Su Yue, saying, "There seems to be a bag of biscuits in there."  Su Yue shook her head, "Not hungry, just anxious."  She had to wait a long time at almost every red light, not to mention the slow driving speed.  Seeing Su Yue's anxious appearance, Su Yan smiled indulgently, "Still like a child."  At that moment, Su Yue's phone rang, displaying Ming Ansheng's name.  She immediately answered, putting it to her ear, "Hello."  "Oh, then I'll go over too."  "Mm."  After a brief conversation with Ming Ansheng, Su Yue hung up the phone, looked up at Su Yan and said, "Brother, I'm afraid I can't go to dinner. Ah Heng's grandfather has passed away, Ming Ansheng is there helping out, I should go over too."  Although she didn't have much interaction with Jiang Zhuo Heng, their relationships were intertwined, and most importantly, Ming Ansheng had such a deep relationship with him, and she was Ming Ansheng's... wife.  She had moved into his house, they had a child, she should be considered a wife, so she felt she should go.  Upon hearing this, Su Yan didn't say much, just indifferently said, "I'll take you."  "Okay." Su Yue nodded, then looked at Su Xiao Qiao beside her, the little girl was watching the scenery outside the window.  She thought for a moment, then looked at Su Yan again, "Take care of Xiao Qiao for me, or help me send her home."  Given the circumstances and it being late at night, it was better not to take a child there. Chapter 1911: Without Contemplation, Hard to Forget (Seventeen)  Su Yan nodded happily, "I'll take her out for a meal."  As the car approached the next traffic light, Su Yan changed direction.  The Jiang family, based in the capital, was reputable and influential. Coupled with Jiang Shaomei's extensive connections, the news of the old master's death spread quickly, and within a few hours, those who usually had good cooperation with the family all arrived.  The old master was highly respected, so the Jiang family unanimously decided to set up the memorial hall at home.  The entrance to the Jiang residence was like a shopping mall parking lot, with a line of cars extending to the road intersection, forming a long dragon. Fortunately, the road was cleared, and Su Yan took Su Jue to the entrance of the Jiang family's courtyard.  "Xiao Qiao, go have a meal with uncle. Mommy will come to pick you up tonight," Su Jue said as she patted Su Xiao Qiao's head and then opened the car door to get out. "Brother, drive slowly on the road."  After calling out to Su Yan, Su Jue reached out to close the car door. She looked up, paused for a moment, and her actions froze.  A black Cadillac stopped behind them, the driver's door opened, and a plainly dressed woman with shiny short hair tied in a simple ponytail and carrying a black bag got out. With a bare face and eyes red and swollen from crying, she appeared.  "Xin Yanting," Su Jue uttered almost instinctively upon seeing her.  Hearing Su Jue call her name, Xin Yanting also froze for a moment, then looked up and saw Su Jue, a flash of surprise crossing her eyes.  Then, she instinctively glanced at the driver's seat, saw half of Su Yan's profile, and her hand gripping the bag tightened.  Suddenly, she lowered her head and walked past Su Yan's car.  "Brother, you go ahead," Su Jue said after closing the car door and quickly followed after Xin Yanting.  She wanted to talk to her but didn't know what to say, and at a time like this, with her grandfather's passing, her heart must be filled with sorrow. So after some thought, she decided not to and slowed down her pace.  As she approached the entrance, she turned back and saw no trace of Su Yan's car, pouted her lips, and sighed helplessly. To like is to like, to dislike is to dislike... It's better to say brother is indifferent rather than heartless.  Ah, ah, ah, how can you think like that, Su Jue? He's your own brother after all.  Although she felt sorry for Xin Yanting, thinking she was innocent, as a woman, she felt guilty and sympathetic towards her.  "What are you thinking about?" Su Jue was pondering when a familiar voice came from ahead - it was Ming Ansheng.  She collected her thoughts, looked up, and gently shook her head, "Nothing."  She stepped up the stairs, one by one, and walked to Ming Ansheng's side.  ...  "Xiao Qiao, do you want to eat anything else?" After having dinner, it was already past eight o'clock. Traffic had finally eased. Su Yan drove around the bustling area with Su Xiao Qiao.  The colorful neon lights of the city flickered, disorienting people. At a traffic light, which was red, Su Yan gently pressed the brake pedal.  From behind came Su Xiao Qiao's voice, "I want to eat ice cream."  Su Yan withdrew his gaze from outside the car window and turned to look at Su Xiao Qiao with a smile, "You want ice cream again?"  Su Xiao Qiao pursed her lips and kept silent, which was her way of responding.  People really, really want to eat ice cream, okay? Is there even a need to ask? This is a secret known by everyone on Earth, right? Chapter 1912: Unwilling to Think, Unable to Forget (Eighteen)  Seeing her cute little appearance, how could Su Yan have the heart to refuse? He said, "Then we can only eat a small portion."  This was an agreement, and Su Xiaoqiao nodded happily, "Mhm."  Her chubby little face smiled, and her eyes curved like crescents, looking beautiful and adorable.  Su Yan drove past a couple of traffic lights, always keeping an eye on the roadside, searching for an ice cream shop. He seldom went out to shop, and he didn't like to eat out.  So he could only search blindly.  Finally, upon passing a shopping mall, he saw a Häagen-Dazs store at the base of the mall with a very conspicuous sign. His eyes lit up, and he pointed to the Häagen-Dazs and asked Su Xiaoqiao, "Häagen-Dazs, is that okay?"  "Mhm mhm mhm," Su Xiaoqiao nodded vigorously.  As long as it was ice cream, as long as she could eat ice cream, it didn't matter what brand it was.  She wasn't very demanding, okay?  Su Yan parked the car on a roadside spot and then carried little Qiao towards the Häagen-Dazs store. It was after mealtime, and there were many people out shopping and strolling. The weather was neither cold nor hot, and inside the Häagen-Dazs store, there were many teenagers, mostly girls, sitting in groups, with almost all seats occupied.  "What flavor does Xiaoqiao want to eat?" Su Yan held Xiaoqiao up to the counter to let her look at the flavors on the large poster.  Su Xiaoqiao glanced at the poster and pointed at one without hesitation, "I want vanilla and strawberry."  "Okay."  Su Yan pointed to the two flavors Xiaoqiao wanted and told the salesperson, "We'll have vanilla and strawberry, two flavors mixed."  The salesperson smiled slightly and said, "Our store has a promotion with the cinema in the mall today. If you buy ice cream with three flavors, you will get two movie tickets for 'Little Sea Star.'"  As she spoke, she looked at Su Xiaoqiao. The name 'Little Sea Star' clearly indicated it was a movie for children.  She was trying to entice the child's interest.  Su Xiaoqiao blinked and asked, "Is 'Little Sea Star' any good?"  "Over there is the promotional poster, it tells the story of Little Sea Star and its friends in the ocean."  The salesperson pointed to the promotional poster near the entrance.  The poster featured various marine creatures, with vibrant colors and a dreamy appearance.  Su Xiaoqiao immediately became interested, turned her gaze back to Su Yan, pouted her lips, and with a pleasing tone, said, "Uncle, I want to see 'Little Sea Star.'"  Although Su Yan was very good to her and doted on her, the two had spent very little time together, so the little girl didn't dare to act spoiled or throw a tantrum around him.  Every expression she made, even the petulant ones, made people unable to refuse, let alone when she was trying to please. Su Yan stretched out his hand, smiled, and gently scraped her little nose, "But you can only have a little bit of ice cream."  Su Xiaoqiao knew that this meant he agreed. She nodded her head and stretched out her chubby little hand to gesture, "Mhm mhm, just a little bit, this much."  "Okay."  "Smack..." Seeing Su Yan nod in agreement, Su Xiaoqiao happily stretched out her arms, hugged Su Yan's neck, and gave him a big kiss on his lips.  Her soft little lips left Su Yan stunned. As he came back to his senses, he hugged the little girl tightly, wishing he could spoil her to his heart's content.  When he was younger, he felt a sense of fulfillment and achievement as if a dream from his childhood had finally come true.  Back when he watched his sister being sent to the orphanage, watching her cry and yell, he wished so much to hold her and take her home. Chapter 1913: Without Intention, Hard to Forget (Nineteen)  After getting the three-colored ice cream, the three little scoops in three different colors were placed in a paper cup, which Su Yan used as a table while holding Su Xiaoqiao with one hand and the ice cream with the other.  Su Xiaoqiao, holding a fork, was eating happily while walking, her mouth covered with it.  They got two movie ticket vouchers; the cinema was on the top floor of the shopping mall, which had a total of ten floors.  The mall's elevator was like the one in the hospital, stopping almost on every floor, making adults incredibly anxious. Su Xiaoqiao, eating her ice cream, was in no hurry at all.  "Sorry, there are no tickets left for the nearest show, the next one is at 9:40."  Upon reaching the cinema's ticket counter, the ticket seller informed them that tickets for the upcoming show were sold out and the next one was more than an hour away.  Su Yan looked at his wristwatch and said to Su Xiaoqiao, "It starts at 9:30, and it'll be past 11 by the time it finishes. It's too late; Xiaoqiao can't watch it."  He pursed his lips, looking at the little girl, waiting for her reaction.  After hearing his words, Su Xiaoqiao's mouth corners drooped in disappointment, and she mumbled softly, "I want to watch."  Just as she was getting excited, being told suddenly that she couldn't watch was indeed a disappointment.  "But it's very late, Xiaoqiao won't grow tall if she doesn't sleep," Su Yan said, gently coaxing her while rubbing her head.  Upon hearing this, Su Xiaoqiao neither fussed nor threw a tantrum. Instead, she just looked down, pouting with a look of loss that was even more heart-wrenching than if she had cried and made a scene.  Su Yan felt a bit heartbroken. He looked around and suddenly noticed a long line of people standing opposite, not sure what they were doing.  He instinctively looked up and saw 'Snowy Love Ice Rink, National Champion Level Roller Skating Coach...'  His eyes lit up, and pointing in that direction, he said to Xiaoqiao, "There's an ice rink over there, how about I take you skating?"  Hearing this, Su Xiaoqiao followed the direction of Su Yan's finger and saw a long line of people standing outside the railing, looking very lively.  She blinked, still pouting, her mind still on the 'Little Starfish' movie.  However, since uncle said it was too late and the movie might not be possible, skating was better than not playing anything...  After considering it for a moment, Su Xiaoqiao nodded reluctantly and agreed, "Well, let's go skating."  It was with a begrudging tone.  Su Yan touched her little face sympathetically and comforted her, "Uncle will bring you to watch Little Starfish on the weekend."  Su Xiaoqiao's eyes brightened, and she stretched out her little finger towards Su Yan, saying, "Pinky promise."  Dumbfounded, Su Yan extended his little finger, made a pinky promise with the little girl, and even stamped it.  His shirt was neat, and just his aura and height made him stand out in the crowd, not to mention his high attractiveness. Passersby, whether married women or single girls, couldn't help but give him an extra glance.  Seeing him interact with Su Xiaoqiao made countless girls envious.  They wished they were the little girl in the handsome man's arms.  They decided on a whim to go roller skating, without any gear, but it was just a matter of buying what they needed—money was no object when it came to equipment.  A grown-up and a child, they made a list, paid, and the sales clerk handed over two complete sets of roller skating gear to Su Yan.  "Sir, we have several roller skating coaches here who are on the national team, including national champions, who specialize in teaching children," the sales clerk also recommended their roller skating coaches to Su Yan. Chapter 1914: Without Contemplation, Unforgettable (Twenty)  Su Yan patiently listened to his introduction, then politely shook his head to refuse, "No need, thank you."  He took the complete set of equipment, leading Su Xiaoqiao to the chairs in the resting area, changing shoes and gear.  ...  "Alright, are you scared?"  After getting equipped, Su Yan stood up first, then slowly helped Su Xiaoqiao to her feet.  Step by step, they walked towards the ice rink.  The ground was covered with thick ice, and cold air was rising in gusts, causing Su Xiaoqiao to shiver before she looked up at Su Yan and shook her head, "Not scared."  Seeing all the children in the rink, their screams, and laughter, the little girl slowly forgot the sadness of not having seen the movie.  Her chubby little face was radiant with smiles like blooming flowers.  "Xiaoqiao is amazing, there's no need to be scared, uncle will always hold your hand and support you," Su Yan praised her while leading her onto the rink.  He held her little hands with both of his, facing her and pulling her along.  He skated backward steadily, which surprised Su Xiaoqiao, "Uncle, can you ice skate?"  Su Yan winked at her, "Won't you know if you look?"  Saying so, he carefully let go of Su Xiaoqiao's hands, slowly gliding backward. Suddenly, he spun around, picking up speed rapidly, and in the blink of an eye, Su Xiaoqiao watched with an open mouth in disbelief, admiringly staring at Su Yan, "Uncle is so amazing, so impressive."  "So do you believe uncle won't let you fall?" Su Yan returned to Xiaoqiao's side with ease, holding her hand, leading her, and slowly skating along while patiently instructing her verbally.  He was wearing his own clothes; among all the equipment, he only changed his shoes and didn't bring things like knee pads.  But when it came to protecting Su Xiaoqiao, he was not careless at all, equipping her with knee pads, elbow pads, a helmet, and so on.  "Mhm," Su Xiaoqiao was incredibly admiring of her uncle at this point, trusting him completely.  At this moment, even if her uncle took her to sell for money, she would help him count it.  "The teacher is so cool."  The uncle and niece were in sync and had a great time chatting when suddenly, a burst of applause came from a distance.  Su Xiaoqiao's gaze shifted in that direction, and the next second she excitedly gripped Su Yan's hand, pointing in the direction she was looking, "Uncle, that sister is so skilled."  Hearing this, Su Yan turned his head to look in the direction Su Xiaoqiao was pointing, his expression indifferent. He looked not out of curiosity, but instinctively.  In that direction, there was a round of applause and cheers from a group of children, in a corner diagonally opposite them.  A girl in a white sports outfit... around her early twenties, was surrounded by a group of children.  Su Yan turned to look, and the girl was performing a 360-degree spin just like he had done for Xiaoqiao, but she was spinning continuously.  The girl's bun spun rapidly, her face indistinct due to the speed.  She was probably a roller-skating coach here; it was quite normal to have such little tricks. Su Yan glanced at her, ready to look away.  Suddenly, the elastic band in her hair snapped, and her dark hair cascaded down, creating a beautiful arc in the air with her spinning movement.  It was like a staged scene, yet it was so natural, so unexpected.  This accident was stunning to many people.  However, it was not anticipated by the person involved. The girl hadn't expected her hair to come loose, and she immediately stopped. Because of the abrupt stop, her body lurched forward. Chapter 1915: Without Thought, It's Hard to Forget (Twenty-One)  Su Yan instinctively reached out his hands. He was only acting on his nature to offer a helping hand out of love for others. However, he had indeed been a bit distracted just now. Otherwise, he wouldn't have forgotten to maintain distance.  "Teacher, teacher."  The girl staggered a bit, losing her balance. She tried hard to stabilize herself. The group of students surrounding her quickly came over and, working together, managed to steady her.  The girl stood up straight, bowed her head, and playfully stuck out her tongue at the children around her, "How embarrassing, the teacher almost fell down."  It wasn't just in front of a group of children; there were also a bunch of parents watching from outside. She should have felt awkward, but there was not a hint of embarrassment in her tone, just natural and calm.  Such a mindset...  Su Yan was somewhat surprised, and his gaze couldn't help but drift back to her.  The girl bowed her head, and her waist-length hair cascaded down, covering her cheeks. He only saw one word...  Calm.  It was so close to what he had always longed for in his heart...  The comfort, ease, and peace.  "Teacher is so beautiful."  "Teacher is like a fairy."  The little boys who came forward to comfort her were all eager to act as the teacher's 'warm men,' sparing no effort in praising her.  The girl teacher extended her hands and gently stroked the heads of two little guys, "How can your little mouths be so sweet?"  Her voice sounded somehow... familiar?  Su Yan suddenly felt that the voice of the roller-skating teacher was familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had heard it before.  He frowned and observed, when Su Xiaoqiao suddenly reached out and tugged at his hand, asking, "Uncle, do you also think that sister is pretty?"  Su Yan's thoughts were interrupted, and he looked down with a smile at Su Xiaoqiao, "Not as pretty as Xiaoqiao."  Being praised, every girl likes it, regardless of age, and Su Xiaoqiao was no exception.  She laughed happily, "Uncle has good taste."  Su Yan smiled slightly, then turned around to look in that direction again. The children were still there, but the roller-skating teacher was no longer in sight.  He pursed his lips and withdrew his gaze.  The roller-skating rink closed at nine-thirty, and they had only played for about fifty minutes. After taking off the skating gear, Su Yan packed it up and carried it in his hand.  Then he led Su Xiaoqiao to the exit, asking her as they walked, "Did Xiaoqiao have fun?"  Su Xiaoqiao nodded her head, "Fun."  She responded to Su Yan and turned her head to take one last glance at the now deserted skating rink.  Su Yan caught her little expression and bent down to ask her, "Do you like roller-skating?"  "I like it, can we come again next time?" Su Xiaoqiao looked up at Su Yan with a pleading face.  Su Yan nodded in agreement, "Okay, uncle will be your teacher."  Su Xiaoqiao was extremely happy, reaching out and affectionately hugging Su Yan's leg, "Good uncle."  "So, shall we go home to sleep now?" Su Yan bent down to pick up Su Xiaoqiao.  He walked out of the roller-skating rink with big strides.  She was dressed too lightly, Su Xiaoqiao's little hands were ice cold, and the tip of her nose was also red from the cold.  Su Yan put her little hands in his embrace to warm them up, and they headed towards the elevator.  "Teacher, goodbye."  "Goodbye."  The voices of the children and the teacher saying farewell came from behind. The voice of that female roller-skating teacher still gave him an inexplicably familiar feeling.  But it wasn't that strong. Chapter 1916: Without Intention, Hard to Forget (Twenty-Two)  Su Yan was prompted to turn his head, but all he saw was a graceful silhouette, with long hair like silk satin, almost completely covering the girl’s slender back. That feeling was familiar, as if it were from a few years ago, on that old street in N City of Country Y... In this world, there was still a girl who could give him such a feeling.  The girl had already taken the escalator downstairs and disappeared from Su Yan's sight. The sensation, like a person admiring a small bridge over flowing water in the mountains, slowly trickled through his heart.  "Uncle, what are you looking at?" Su Xiaoqiao looked up at Su Yan with puzzled eyes.  Interrupted once again in his thoughts, he withdrew his gaze, looked down at Xiaoqiao, and shook his head with a smile, "Nothing, let's go home."  Then he took her and walked towards the elevator.  ...  Although it's normal to experience birth, aging, sickness, and death, the passing of the old master was still a great shock to Jiang Zhuoheng, not just for him, but for the entire Jiang family as well. Thus, it's strange how the human heart works; some things are clearly anticipated, but when they actually happen, acceptance still requires a process.  Yan Rusheng and Ming Ansheng, who were also watched over by the old master as they grew up, stayed with Jiang Zhuoheng, busy until late at night.  The guests who remained had gone to rest, leaving only a few men of the Jiang family, Xin Yanting, and Yan Rusheng's group in the mourning hall.  Xin Yanting and Jiang Zhuoheng kneeled in front of the memorial hall, and she had been sobbing intermittently ever since she arrived.  She grew up in the Jiang family, where the old master treated her like a treasure in the palm of his hand, doting on her to the sky. She had not returned from abroad for four years.  During her years abroad, she and her grandfather almost talked on the phone every day. Even when busy, they would make contact every other day at most. Even if it was just a greeting.  Yesterday, upon receiving the news that the old master was near the end, she rushed back immediately, but ultimately, she still missed the chance to see him one last time.  That was probably the main reason she refused to rise, out of guilt, self-reproach.  The old master's several nephews and Jiang Zhuoheng were arranged to keep vigil overnight. Seeing that most people had left, Yan Rusheng and his group discussed and prepared to leave as well.  Xuxu voluntarily took on the task of saying goodbye, "Ah Heng, we're going to head back first."  As she spoke, she approached Jiang Zhuoheng.  Jiang Zhuoheng stood up to meet her, "Hmm, be careful on the road."  As he said this, his gaze turned to Yan Rusheng and Ming Ansheng's group, nodding at them as a gesture.  Xuxu pursed her lips as she looked at Jiang Zhuoheng's face, then spoke again to comfort him, "You... take care of yourself."  "Hmm," Jiang Zhuoheng nodded gently, "Go back, it's getting late."  Xuxu nodded, "Then we will come over again tomorrow."  Then her gaze shifted to Xin Yanting, who was kneeling there, head down, motionless, and very quiet.  She was quite different from the Xin Yanting of the past, who was always haughty and looked down on people, evoking a sense of compassion.  Sigh!  Love can change a person, and it can also destroy a person. In four years, she had not been in contact with Xin Yanting, and she thought several times to ask Jiang Zhuoheng for some news, but she never asked.  There was always a sense of guilt in her heart, even though Su Yan had only used the same tactics against her, even though in the end, he only took the thirty percent of Rongsheng's shares from her.  But from the standpoint of a woman, from a rational standpoint, Xin Yanting was innocent. Chapter 1917: Unwilling to Think, Hard to Forget (Twenty-Three)  However, she was considering things from the perspective of a woman, adopting a saint-like heart. The business world is full of deceit and trickery, even her mother had used such... despicable means before. She gave Xin Yanting a deep look, but in the end, she didn't step forward, and the words of 'condolences' for Xin Yanting were left unsaid.  She sighed helplessly in her heart, then turned around and whispered to Yan Rusheng and Su Yue, "Let's go."  "Oh!" Su Yue responded, and when she turned around following Ming Ansheng, her gaze lingered on Xin Yanting. Her thoughts and feelings were the same as hers, from the perspective of a woman.  Similarly, she ended up just pursing her lips helplessly and followed Ming Ansheng to leave.  ...  "I think Xin Yanting is a bit pitiful." Once in the car and the car had started, Su Yue, sitting in the passenger seat, suddenly said. She leaned her head back on the seat, feeling a bit tired.  Hearing this, Ming Ansheng turned his head and looked at her with a smile and raised eyebrows, "Didn't you use to dislike her?"  He looked at her, his eyes were gentle and satisfied, he knew she had always been kind-hearted, and only kind-hearted people could be so conflicted. Since she arrived, her attention was always on Xin Yanting, full of guilt in her gaze.  In fact, in their eyes, the matter between Su Yan and Xin Yanting wasn't really an issue. Deceiving the other's trust was a means and also a tactic.  Su Yue pouted and sighed, "Well, I don't like her, but that doesn't affect my sympathy for her, as a woman."  Hearing this, Ming Ansheng mischievously raised his eyebrows, "Woman? Are you sure?"  Looking at her with furrowed brows and her troubled expression, he didn't know how to comfort her, so he tried to adjust the atmosphere.  "Cut it out..." Su Yue glared at Ming Ansheng without good humor but also started to laugh. When she laughed, Ming Ansheng felt the atmosphere had improved a lot, and he started to joke again, "This is all your brother's fault."  Su Yue defended her brother, "But what my brother did wasn't wrong either, he just wanted to take back the thirty percent of Rongsheng's shares. Xin Yanting liked him, but he never made any promises to her, she just assumed that my brother liked her too."  It seemed to be the case, it was indeed the case, but why did she feel conflicted when she saw Xin Yanting? Why did she feel guilty?  As Su Yue was questioning herself internally, Ming Ansheng also asked her, "So why are you conflicted?"  "I don't know either." Su Yue frustratedly ruffled her hair, "I heard that Xin Yanting even got a tattoo for my brother, how much does someone have to love another to get a tattoo for them?"  She heard this later from her sister-in-law, saying that Xin Yanting had a rose tattooed on her back, and even had her brother's name on the rose. After hearing that, she felt very uncomfortable, a woman falls in love with a man, very foolishly and innocently, as if she wants to tell the whole world, always wanting to give her best to the other person, and once she commits, she forgets her way back.  How much Xin Yanting must have loved her brother to tattoo his name onto her body, into her flesh. She definitely did not anticipate that she was just a pawn for her brother.  Perhaps she had a similar experience before, when Ceng Tangfeiling branded her chest with a hot iron, it felt as if her heart was being gouged out. If that tattoo didn't have anything to do with Ming Ansheng, it would have been nothing more than a physical pain. Chapter 1918: Without Deliberation, It's Hard to Forget (Twenty-Four)  I don't know if Xin Yanting's tattoo is still there; if it is, I wonder if it hurts every time she sees it. And if it's gone, was the removal as painful as when she first got it?  Su Jue's brows were tightly knitted as she looked out the window with a solemn expression.  Ming Ansheng glanced at her and said with a smile, "Actually, tattoos are also a form of art. Some people get them purely for the sake of art."  Su Jue knew that Ming Ansheng was trying to make her laugh, and she really did smile. Turning her head with a cold gaze, she asked, "So when you got your tattoo, was it for the sake of art or to commemorate the unfulfilled love between you and Sister Meiduo?"  Ming Ansheng pursed his lips. "Let's continue talking about Xin Yanting and your brother."  As the conversation went on, he found himself back in the line of fire. He didn't want to be metaphorically 'shot,' so he decided it was better to calmly keep her company in her troubles.  Meiduo was no longer around, and Su Jue had no intention of bringing her up to tease Ming Ansheng. It was just a casual mention; the past, no matter what, was already in the past.  Looking out the window, the streets late at night were very quiet. It wasn't in a bustling area; most of the storefronts had turned off their lights and closed their doors, dark and oppressive.  Her mood was still heavy, perhaps related to just having come from the wake.  Suddenly both of them fell silent, and the atmosphere in the car quieted down.  As the car slowly moved, Su Jue's eyelids began to droop. After passing through the residential area, the light inside the car suddenly brightened.  Su Jue opened her eyes and looked outside. It was a hospital, brightly lit at the entrance, likely a private one. The display screen above was still flashing, showing images.  She sighed again, "Oh, I also heard that Xin Yanting attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills after learning the truth. She looked down on Tang Feiling's relentless pursuit of you, supposedly being someone who could easily embrace and let go of love, someone bold in both love and hate. Yet, she ended up trying to take her own life over just a man."  This was something she heard later from Mulí. When Mulí talked to her about it, she said she had heard it from someone else, so it was unclear if it was true.  "Hmm, so what you mean is that your brother is just a man," Ming Ansheng nodded, deliberately misinterpreting her words.  Su Jue knew he was doing it on purpose and turned her head to retort with a frown, "Don't always twist my words, okay? I'm talking about this matter; aside from all his outstanding qualities, my brother is just an ordinary man."  Setting aside his outstanding qualities, her brother was just an ordinary man... What kind of logic was that? Ming Ansheng looked at Su Jue amusedly and shook his head.  After laughing for a while, he raised his eyebrows and asked her, "But can you figure out a conclusion?"  "I can't," Su Jue shook her head vigorously and shrugged, "Forget it, I don't want to think about it anymore. No matter how much I agonize over it, I won't come to any conclusion, and it won't change my brother's feelings for her. If he doesn't like her, he just doesn't like her."  Seeing her so troubled, Ming Ansheng promptly changed the subject, "Are you hungry?"  Su Jue shook her head, "Not hungry, let's hurry up and pick up Xiaoqiao."  "Okay."  ...  When they arrived at Su Yan's house and knocked on his door, Su Yan, wearing a smoke-gray pajama, was just woken up from his sleep, his eyes still groggy.  Seeing Su Jue and Ming Ansheng, he knew they were there to pick up Xiaoqiao, and said, "Xiaoqiao is asleep, just let her stay here tonight."  Su Jue said, "She has to go to kindergarten tomorrow morning."  She had only started a few days ago and had already taken a day off today. She was still in the adaptation period and couldn't keep taking days off. Chapter 1919: Can't Stop Thinking, Hard to Forget (25)  "I'll take her there," Su Yan said while yawning. Then he turned around, pointed at the shoe cabinet, and lazily said to Su Yue, "The shoes are inside; you guys help yourselves."  He dragged his lazy steps to the sofa and sat down, while I was in the corner, yawning continuously.  Su Yue changed into her shoes and entered the room, looking at Su Yan and asking, "Which room is Xiao Qiao in?"  Su Yan stretched out his hand and pointed to a room. Su Yue walked towards that room and stopped at the door. The bedside lamp was on, its light dimmed very low.  She stood at the door and saw Su Xiao Qiao lying there, saw her peacefully sleeping face, and she didn't have the heart to disturb her at this time, in case she woke her up.  After thinking for a bit, she turned around and quietly walked away from the door, then said to Ming Ansheng, who was already sitting on the sofa, "How about I stay here tonight, and you go back alone?"  Before Ming Ansheng could speak, Su Yan preempted, "Why don't both of you stay here tonight? Just settle down here; it's very far from here to your house."  After all, he had moved to a bigger house, with plenty of rooms.  One in the south of the city and one in the north, indeed quite far.  Hearing this, Su Yue nodded in agreement without any hesitation, "Yeah, that's a good idea."  Then she looked at Ming Ansheng to discuss, "Let's stay here tonight, and we'll take Xiao Qiao to kindergarten together tomorrow morning."  Ming Ansheng pursed his lips, held back for a moment, then replied with a slight smile, "You stay here, I have a meeting at the company early tomorrow morning, I'll head back first."  He had never slept over at someone else's home, except for hotels, especially at the home of a younger... big brother-in-law; he would suffer from insomnia and be scared, okay?  He would rather drive for thirty or forty minutes to get a good sleep at home.  Hearing that he had work early the next day, Su Yue did not insist and bade him, "Then be careful on the road."  Ming Ansheng nodded, "I know, you go to sleep early."  He said this as he stood up, then looked at Su Yan, nodded at him, "I'm leaving now."  Even without adding a title or calling him "big brother," his tone sounded reluctant, and clearly, even Su Yue could hear it.  Suppressing her laughter, Su Yue escorted Ming Ansheng to the door, repeatedly telling him to be careful on the road until she saw him enter the elevator and the elevator doors closed. Only then did she return to the room.  "Ha ha ha..."   Back in the room, after closing the door, she covered her mouth and laughed.  While laughing, she walked towards Su Yan.  Su Yan looked at her amusedly and asked, "What's the matter, did you find money in the middle of the night?"  "I feel like Ming Ansheng is suffering," Su Yue said as she walked over to Su Yan and sat down next to him, still laughing.  Su Yan frowned, "Have you gone crazy?"  Su Yue said, "He wants to call you big brother, but is too embarrassed to do so."  Su Yan rolled his eyes at her, "It's not me who's tormenting him, it must be someone else."  After saying that, he closed his eyes lazily again.  "That's right, third brother!" Su Yue said, and couldn't help but burst into laughter again, "Third brother, you're so bad, always deliberately teasing him with this."  At this, Su Yan opened his eyes again, turned his head to look at her with a frown, "How is that teasing? Shouldn't he call me brother, call me third brother?"  "Should, should, okay?" Su Yue stuck out her tongue, then suddenly she moved closer to Su Yan, "Big brother."  The atmosphere suddenly became serious.  Su Yan gave her a sidelong glance, "What is it?"  "You tell me honestly, have you ever had anything happen with Xin Yanting?" Su Yue stared at Su Yan without blinking, as if afraid he would lie. Chapter 1920: Unwilling to Think, Unforgettable (Twenty-Six)  Su Yan knowingly asked, "What are you referring to?"  "You know what I mean," Su Yue pouted and hummed, "I hope you're not truly a big jerk."  Su Yan couldn't help but laugh irritably, stretching out his hand to poke Su Yue's forehead, "What are you thinking about? Go take a shower and sleep."  Then he stood up, walking lazily towards the room.  Su Yue, watching his back, also grinned, "Does that mean it's over?"  "I'm a Virgo," Su Yan's lazy voice came through.  Su Yue lifted her head to look over, his tall figure had already entered the room.  "I'm a Virgo..." Su Yue's mouth twitched; besides being a bit of a neat freak in his daily life and pursuing perfection in his emotions and career, she really couldn't see how he was anything like a Virgo. He had no demands on the people around him, was sparing with his words, and his indifferent nature always made him seem invulnerable, showing none of the typical traits of a big Virgo.  But his meaning should be that he hadn't had any substantial relationship with Xin Yanting, which made her feel quite relieved.  Su Yue sighed deeply in her heart, put down the pillow, and stood up to walk towards her room.  ...  These past few days, Yan Rusheng and Wen Xuxu spent very little time at the company, leaving most of the work piling up on Su Yan's head.  Upon arriving at the company in the morning, he buried himself in a pile of work. It took a while before the company's employees began to trickle in to start their day.  After dealing with several tricky tasks, he glanced at his wristwatch; it was only nine o'clock, just the start of the workday. He looked up towards the door and saw a bustling crowd outside the frosted glass door.  Every morning, everyone was busy.  He withdrew his gaze, reached out for the white porcelain cup on his desk, and took a look – it still contained yesterday's boiled water.  He stood up, walking towards the water dispenser.  "Uh..."  Just as Su Yan stood up, the office door suddenly opened, and the person entering was his new secretary, Mi Xiao.  Upon seeing Su Yan, Mi Xiao was taken aback, or perhaps frightened, with a somewhat panicked expression.  Stunned for a moment, she hastily apologized, "I'm sorry, President Su, I didn't know you came in so early."  Saying that, she prepared to step back.  Su Yan shook his head, speaking indifferently, "It's alright."  Then he continued walking towards the water dispenser.  He often came in early, but this new secretary had not encountered it before; it wasn't a big deal.  Mi Xiao watched Su Yan for a while, and perhaps confirming that he wasn't angry, she then pushed her glasses up on the bridge of her nose and stepped into the office.  She was holding two green file folders and walked to Su Yan's desk, looking at him cautiously.  Su Yan poured a cup of water and drank it as he walked back to his desk.  If there wasn't a board meeting or an important executive meeting, he didn't like to wear a tie. A white shirt and black suit pants, comfortable and casual, along with his naturally indifferent handsome face, were pleasing to the eye.  He approached Mi Xiao, swallowed the water he had just drunk, looked down at her slight figure and asked, "What is it?"  The new secretary had been working for just over two weeks, and this was the first time he was this close to her, realizing that the secretary he hired was so short.  To see her clearly, he had to lower his head.  Large black-framed glasses nearly covered half her face, and bangs cut straight across her forehead, making her look rather plain at first glance.  Unintentionally, Su Yan gave his new secretary Mi Xiao a once-over. Chapter 1921: Unwilling to Think, But Hard to Forget (Twenty-Seven)  He then mocked himself internally, as everyone said he was past the prime age for discussing marriage and was worried for him, urging him to interact more with women. In truth, he was only just 28 years old, but since she and Yueyue were both anxious for him.  So, this time he simply found a female secretary, but whom was he trying to appease?  Su Yan scrutinized without leaving a trace, so Mi Xiao did not notice. She handed over two halves of a document with both hands, "President Su, these documents are all waiting for your signature."  Su Yan hummed a response, reached out to take them, put the documents on the table, flipped them open, glanced at them, and then signed his name.  While he was signing, Mi Xiao continued, "You have lunch with Director Wang from the Hundred Corporations Group at noon."  "Uh-huh, I know. Are there any other schedules?" Su Yan nodded and asked while handing the signed documents back to Mi Xiao.  Mi Xiao took the documents, shook her head, "No more."  Just after she answered, she seemed to remember something, "Oh right, Miss Erelie called earlier, asking if President Su is free tonight."  When he heard the name 'Erelie,' Su Yan's expression paused momentarily as if in thought. After a moment, he nodded lightly to Mi Xiao, "I got it."  He did not directly answer Mi Xiao whether he was available or not.  "Then I will go out first."   Mi Xiao, holding the documents, nodded slightly to Su Yan, then turned and walked towards the door.  She wore black boat shoes with a three to four centimeter heel, making her slender legs look even more delicate. Walking on the wooden floor, her footsteps made a 'clump clump' sound, gentle, like her demeanor, petite, and with a style completely different from Erelie's high-profile and flamboyance.  Su Yan couldn't help but turn his head to look towards the door, seeing Mi Xiao's smaller figure, her ponytail gently swaying behind her back. He felt inexplicably comfortable. As Mi Xiao opened the door and stepped out, Su Yan suddenly opened his mouth to call out, "Mi Xiao, make me a cup of black tea."  "Okay."   Mi Xiao stopped in her tracks, turned her head to respond to Su Yan, and then went out.  Su Yan sat back down at his spot. After a knock on the door and his permission, Mi Xiao pushed the door and entered.  After entering, she pushed her glasses up on the bridge of her nose. It should have been a habitual action, but in Su Yan's eyes, it seemed awkward, as if she wasn't used to wearing glasses. But this was nothing strange; maybe she had just gotten glasses for myopia, or maybe it was his mistaken impression.  Su Yan didn't think too much of it, just glanced at Mi Xiao and continued to work with his head down.  "President Su, your black tea is ready."  Mi Xiao had brewed the tea and walked over to Su Yan.  "Uh-huh, put it here."  Su Yan nodded without looking up.  "Okay."  Mi Xiao placed the teacup in front of Su Yan, and as she was about to withdraw her hands, Su Yan finally lifted his eyelids, his gaze inadvertently sweeping over her hands.  Her hands were small and fair, but the joints of her fingers were somewhat prominent, resembling hands that had seen hard work.  He wasn't present during the hiring process; it was all arranged by the HR department, so regarding this new secretary, he only knew her name, the university she graduated from, and that she was a recent graduate who came out to intern early.  He was unaware of the rest, including where she was registered, whether she was from the countryside or a city person, whether she had other internship experiences, etc.  He was completely clueless. Chapter 1922: Unintentional Thoughts, Inevitably Remembered (Twenty-Eight)  As Su Yan thought to himself, he lifted his head to look at Mi Xiao from a top-down angle. Actually, Mi Xiao wasn't that tall, and even as he sat, he wasn't much shorter than her. However, looking from a different angle gave him a different feeling.  This girl's petite melon-seed-shaped face was quiet and gentle, her skin clean and fair, and even though her straight-across bangs and large black-rimmed glasses were plain to the point of being dull, the feeling she gave him was the same as the impression her silhouette had given him earlier—comfortable, as if basking in the spring breeze.  It seems that viewing a girl from different angles is important, no wonder those women always take selfies from the same angle, probably because it's their best angle. That's why on their Weibo and Facebook, the photos they post are always from the same angle, in almost the same pose.  As Su Yan thought about it, he couldn't help but shake his head with a smile, seemingly forgetting that his new secretary was still in front of him. Mi Xiao looked at Su Yan with a puzzled face, probably curious as to why he had suddenly started laughing.  Feeling Mi Xiao's gaze, he lifted his head, met her questioning eyes, and his smile naturally faded, returning to his usual indifference. It was odd that he had been studying a woman, an ordinary secretary, so intently.  Seeing the smile disappear from Su Yan's face, Mi Xiao quickly asked, "President Su, is there anything else you need?"  Su Yan shook his head, "No, you can go now."  "Okay." Mi Xiao nodded her head, turned around to leave, but then Su Yan seemed to remember something and raised his head to tell her, "Reply to Arielle that I am free after work this evening."  "Oh," Mi Xiao nodded in response, her tone sounding somewhat dejected. Anyone would feel dejected, considering Miss Arielle was very familiar with President Su, casually entering and leaving his office. Their relationship, which seemed unusual in the eyes of all their colleagues, why didn't they contact each other privately, instead of through the office phone?  In the afternoon, Su Yan received another call from Mi Xiao, saying that Arielle had called and they had already made plans to have dinner together that evening.  ...  "President Su, if there's nothing else, may I leave work now?" It was 5:10 PM, ten minutes past the end of the workday, when Mi Xiao knocked on the door of Su Yan's office and stood at the entrance, asking him.  Although she always seemed very careful, her speech and actions had good logic and efficiency. It always felt like she would make a clumsy mistake, but so far, she hadn't made a single one, just like a child learning to walk—you always feel like they might fall over, but they remain upright like a Weeble.  Su Yan thought about it and couldn't help but smile again; the feeling was strange, and for some reason, it felt familiar. Mi Xiao was still waiting for his reply. He collected his thoughts and said to her, "Make me another cup of coffee."  He still had a lot of work to do and needed to perk up.  "Oh..." Mi Xiao, who had been standing with her legs together, stepped forward with a sense of urgency in her step. She approached the office, came up to Su Yan, reached out to pick up his cup, then suddenly seemed to remember something, looked at him, and asked uncertainly, "President Su, should I brew it?"  Her expression gave Su Yan the impression that she was asking, annoyed and dissatisfied: It's so late, why the hell are you still drinking brewed coffee, such a hassle.  Thinking this, Su Yan couldn't help but smile again, then he said, "If you have something urgent, then instant is also fine."  He felt that Mi Xiao seemed to have something urgent; after all, it was already past working hours, and there were no difficult tasks waiting for her, so there was no need to delay her personal matters. Chapter 1923: Without Intention, Hard to Forget (Twenty-nine)  "I don't have anything urgent." Mi Xiao shook her head, and her neat bangs swayed with the movement. Under the light, they were exceptionally black and smooth.  However, the emotions that leaked from her clear eyes didn't feel that sincere to Su Yan. He obviously seemed very anxious...  He pretended not to notice and waved his hand at her, saying, "Then go and make it, don't add any sugar."  "Okay." Mi Xiao nodded, her small hands clutching the cup tightly.  When she turned around, Su Yan caught her frowning.  Su Yan smiled and shook his head; he really was bored from working all day long, to the point of teasing a little girl.  The coffee machine was in his office. Mi Xiao was fiddling with it over there while he flipped through his phone here, waiting for the coffee to start, the aroma drifting over.  He put down his phone and looked over. The girl was standing in front of the coffee machine, her back to him, waiting for the coffee to be ready. She was so still that she seemed to be deep in thought, very quiet.  Su Yan was stunned. He liked and longed for this feeling. When he was working, there was someone quietly by his side who didn't affect his work at all but was still there.  Not like... Xin Yanting, not like her, always trying to make her presence known.  "Su Yan, I just bought this bag today, Burberry's new model; it matches my white dress well, doesn't it?"  "Su Yan, which color of this lipstick looks better than the one I wore yesterday?"  "Su Yan, do you want to drink milk tea?"  "Su Yan, can you take me with you to Europe?"  "Su Yan, you..."  Thinking of Xin Yanting and all the things she used to say in his ear, he felt self-mockery in his heart.  He didn't know how he had put up with it.  It seemed that he was indeed just like most men, not too noble, not too individualistic, not too different.  "President Su, the coffee is ready."  Su Yan was lost in thought when Mi Xiao came to him with the brewed coffee.  The steaming coffee, with its hot steam and fragrance, entered his nose. Su Yan looked down and saw Mi Xiao's slightly rough hands again.  He said offhandedly, "Have a cup too."  It was just a casual remark, but Mi Xiao was surprised, staring with wide eyes for a second or two before reacting, "No thanks."  She shook her head gently, just surprised for a moment, and did not feel flattered by the invitation to have coffee together.  Very indifferent.  Su Yan raised an eyebrow, "Got urgent business?"  Mi Xiao shook her head again, "No."  It's obvious, yet still asking, asking your sister.  Impatience was already apparent on her face, probably without her realizing it herself. Su Yan smiled and decided not to tease Mi Xiao any further, saying lightly, "If there's nothing else, you can get off work."  After addressing her, he picked up the coffee, took a sip, and prepared to dive back into work.  There was still a lot of work to do.  Mi Xiao felt relieved, the uncontrollable impatience on her face also disappearing.  "Then I'll get off work first."  She nodded slightly to Su Yan, then remembered something and reminded him, "President Su, you have dinner with Miss Eireli at seven tonight."  Su Yan nodded, "Hmm."  Seven o'clock...  He watched Mi Xiao leave his office, took a look at the time on the bottom right of his computer screen—it was already six o'clock.  He picked up his phone, hesitating, when suddenly there was a knock at the door. He lifted his eyelids to look, and through the frosted glass door, he saw a tall figure. Chapter 1924: Unwilling to Think, Yet Hard to Forget (30)  "Come in." He put away the complex thoughts he had just had and responded indifferently to the door, then reached out to tidy up the documents and other items on the table.  The door opened, and a tall, fashionable beauty entered his sight. He was not surprised and greeted her politely with a faint smile, calling her 'Miss Ai'.  Ai Rui Li was wearing a light aqua printed blouse and white skinny pants that perfectly outlined her slender figure. Different from her work time, she had light makeup on her face, showing off her good complexion.  She was still wearing high heels not less than ten centimeters tall, also in a light color, and her outfit was very spring-like and fresh.  She walked gracefully towards Su Yan, smiling at him while she spoke, "President Su, I was afraid you would be busy, so I came up to wait for you."  Su Yan pressed his lips together and shook his head, "It's okay, I've also finished my work, we can leave." Saying this, he closed his laptop, stood up, walked over to the coat rack, and took down his jacket, draping it over his arm.  Ai Rui Li looked at the mountain of work on his desk and sincerely said to him, "President Su, I don't have anything tonight, and I'm not hungry, so there's no rush for dinner."  It was not easy to have the opportunity to be alone with him, and going to a restaurant would make the environment even more exciting.  It would be happiness just to sit here and watch him work.  Ai Rui Li stared at Su Yan's handsome face, slightly lost in her fantasies.  "Let's go earlier, I've booked the place for seven o'clock," Su Yan said indifferently, lifting his foot and walking towards the office door.  He had already left, and Ai Rui Li had no reason to stay, so she hurriedly followed him.  Along the way, she was looking for topics to chat with Su Yan, but she did it unobtrusively, very naturally, and casually.  Not like some people, chattering incessantly, making it obvious that they are deliberately looking for topics.  Su Yan held the steering wheel with both hands, looking ahead on the road. It was already early summer, the days had become longer, and it was still bright past six o'clock, but most of the shops that were still doing business at night had already turned on their lights.  Neon lights were flashing, and his mood suddenly became complex, inexplicably so.  "President Su, the red light!" Ai Rui Li suddenly exclaimed in alarm, interrupting his thoughts. Su Yan snapped back to reality, but the car had already entered the intersection and passed the crosswalk.  The traffic and pedestrians had already started moving, and he couldn't accelerate through the intersection, so he had to brake urgently.  The car stopped, the inertia was significant, but fortunately, both of them were prepared, so there were no injuries.  After the car steadied, Ai Rui Li calmed her heartbeat and turned to look at Su Yan with concern, asking, "President Su, what were you so engrossed in thinking about just now?"  "Work stuff," Su Yan replied casually, then showed Ai Rui Li an apologetic smile, "I'm sorry to have startled you."  Ai Rui Li shook her head, "I'm fine."  The red light ended, the green light came on again, and the car started up slowly, crossing the street.  Su Yan tried hard to control his emotions and thoughts, not letting himself get distracted again.  Actually, he didn't even know what he was thinking about just now; he was clearly listening to Ai Rui Li talking about recent stock issues.  But as he listened, he became lost in thought.  At seven o'clock, it was dinner time, and in the upscale Western restaurant, there were no empty seats as far as the eye could see.  They had reserved a seat in advance, so there was no need to worry about not having a spot.  Their reserved spot was a private booth, separated by beaded curtains, although also in the main hall, the environment was relatively much quieter and more elegant. Chapter 1925: Unintentional, Unforgettable (Thirty-One)  The meal was ready and quickly served; they ordered classic steaks and the signature snacks made by the head chef of the restaurant. Aireli also ordered a bottle of red wine.  The young male waiter, tall and slender, served their meals and then opened the red wine for them, ready to pour. Aireli looked up and smiled slightly at him, "Thank you, we can pour it ourselves."  Hearing this, the waiter put down the wine bottle, nodded slightly at them, and left.  In the private dining area, only the two of them remained. Su Yan had taken off his suit jacket and was now wearing a white shirt; he had undone his cufflinks and rolled up his sleeves a bit.  Holding a knife in one hand and a fork in the other, he skillfully and elegantly cut his steak.  "President Su, let's have a drink," Aireli said, picking up the bottle of red wine and tilting it toward Su Yan's glass, the mouth of the bottle tipping slowly downwards.  Su Yan glanced at it and opened his mouth, as if he wanted to stop her.  Aireli noticed this and, even though she stopped pouring the wine, looked at Su Yan.  Suddenly, Su Yan lowered his eyelids again and continued to cut his steak without saying a word.  This was taken as tacit approval, an agreement.  Aireli smiled slightly and elegantly poured wine into Su Yan's glass, and then a bit for herself.  After pouring the wine, she put down the bottle, picked up her glass, raised it towards Su Yan, and said with a smile, "President Su, let's have a drink to celebrate our pleasant cooperation in advance."  Su Yan put down his fork, picked up his glass, and clinked it against Aireli's, saying in a light tone, "To a pleasant cooperation."  Both took an elegant sip of wine.  Then Aireli looked at Su Yan and said with a smile, "Actually, I'm quite surprised."  Su Yan raised his eyebrows inquisitively, waiting for Aireli to continue.  Aireli said, "I'm surprised that you agreed to come out for dinner today, President Su. My impression of you is that you're always so busy. Every time I see you, you're very preoccupied and don't even have time to talk."  Hearing this, Su Yan smiled apologetically, "I'm very sorry; perhaps I haven't been a good host."  Aireli waved her hand, "It's okay, I know that's how successful people are."  As she spoke, she picked up her glass and took a small sip.  Her sexy red lips, painted with alluring lipstick and stained with red wine, looked particularly sensual and added a touch of temptation that men couldn't resist.  It was unclear whether she did it on purpose or not, but she didn't use a napkin to wipe the corner of her mouth, allowing the wine to remain on her lips while she smiled at Su Yan.  Unfortunately for her, Su Yan's gaze did not linger on her face; he gave a courteous glance and then continued to cut his steak methodically.  After a busy day of work, having lunch with clients and missing afternoon tea, he was genuinely hungry now.  Aireli, feeling somewhat let down upon seeing Su Yan so engrossed in eating, listlessly took a napkin and wiped her mouth.  She also picked up her knife and fork and began cutting the steak to eat.  She was a big star, an actress with millions of fans; even if she was interested in a man, she would not act like a lovesick girl in front of him.  The two fell into silence, remaining so until the meal was over.  After settling the bill, Su Yan and Aireli walked out of the restaurant side by side, with Aireli putting on her sunglasses as they walked.  "Niuniu, be careful."  As they walked out through the revolving door, a woman with a little girl entered it. The girl looked about three or four years old and was chubby.  Aireli thought of something and looked at Su Yan to ask, "President Su, that cute little girl in your office the other day, is she your niece?"
