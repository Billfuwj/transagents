Chapter 1064: Cross-Border Bombing  Even on the frozen soil of the north, within their own country, a violent uprising occurred, and the Finnish officials could not possibly be unaware of it. However, the Finnish authorities kept a tacit silence about the matter. The trouble was brought by the people of Arrow Corporation, and it happened on their "private territory." Since no Finns died and Arrow Corporation did not ask for help, why should they bother?  The local police of Paltak town sent out several mounted officers to patrol around the refugee camp, but these officers ultimately did not muster the courage to charge in. They showed their faces and then withdrew. Judging by the equipment in the hands of the rioters, this was not something they could handle.  The chief of Paltak made a decision to mobilize local militia to set up defenses within the town and to ensure the safety of the townspeople to the best of their ability. His choice proved to be correct. In less than half an hour, a document was issued urging the local police to protect the safety of Paltak town at all costs, while a special forces unit was sent to support them.  As for the refugee camp, it would be taken over by the Finnish Defence Forces hundreds of kilometers away – in name.  Through the intelligence of the Russian Security Bureau, Jiang Chen learned of these messages. The silence of the Finnish officials was unexpected to him; he originally thought Finland would at least send a rapid response force to maintain stability, but he didn't expect their reaction to be so indifferent. It seems that Carmen probably had some shady dealings within this military base.  Regardless of Carmen's reaction, Jiang Chen's plans were proceeding step by step. Most of the refugees were from the Middle East, and many had participated in militia organizations or had been conscripted as reservists and received basic military training. They couldn't be expected to operate tanks, but they were more than capable of using mortars without dropping shells on their own heads.  As the second batch of equipment crossed the Russo-Finnish border into the Paltak region, Sami, relying on his rapidly accumulated prestige, pulled together a guerrilla force of ten thousand from the refugee camp. With the rationale that "only by completely annihilating the army of infidels can the oppressive rule be ended," he mobilized the entire refugee camp to fight a decisive battle with Arrow Corporation.  Boxes of ammunition were loaded onto dilapidated vans and trucks, and workers took out welding torches from factories to weld heavy machine guns onto pickups. There was no doubt that this ragtag force had no combat effectiveness, and they stood almost no chance against mercenaries who had received formal training under equal conditions, but Jiang Chen was full of confidence in the outcome of the war. The reason was simple. If they couldn't outshoot them with marksmanship, they would outgun them with firepower!  At two o'clock in the morning, six hours after the uprising started and leaving only two thousand people to defend, the fully armed Sami army hit the road again, advancing towards Arrow Corporation to "rescue" those brethren who had gone astray.  The mighty army reached the tundra two kilometers outside of Arrow Corporation and spread out to surround the military base. Under the command of several veterans who had seen battle, the armed militants took shovels and hoes and dug out simple artillery pits. Hundreds of mortars were set up in dozens of artillery positions. With a signal flare launched into the sky, the "whoosh" sound of hundreds of mortars firing filled the entire tundra, and bursts of explosive flames covered the entire military area, bombing the waiting mercenaries into disorientation.  Of course, the mercenaries stationed in the military base were not to be trifled with. As soon as they encountered the bombardment, all mercenaries rushed to the shelters. At the same time, the base's howitzers began counter-bombardment on the rioters' mortar positions according to coordinates provided by scouts...  However, these mortar positions were simply too scattered, and the barrage of shells coming from all directions left the base's artillerymen running ragged. Although they were experts in artillery, the number on the other side was more than ten times theirs. A mortar shell landed on the roof of the command post, blowing a corner off the concrete fortifications. Covered in dust shaken from the ceiling, Colonel Yano steadied himself on the table, cursed as he looked out the window, "Shit! Where did these bugs get so many mortars?!"  The sudden bombardment caught everyone off guard; they had originally thought these ragtag forces would charge their machine gun bunkers with rifles in hand, howling, but they did not expect them to start with support weapons.  "Undoubtedly, it was Star Ring Trade that supplied them," Saldes braced himself on the table and returned to the tactical map, glancing around at those present, "Guys, we can't keep defending. No one knows how much ammunition they really have because the man supplying them is an absolute bastard. Yano, take your men out there and finish them off, tell them that modern warfare can't just be won by numbers."  "Yes!" Yano stood at attention, saluted, took the walkie-talkie from the arrow, and began to issue orders to the various units of the force.  After the order was given, the gates of the military ground opened, and a dozen Humvees roared out, with four "Cougar" armored vehicles following closely behind, charging towards the rioters' positions.  Under Jiang Chen's direction, Sami decisively ordered his men with a two-thousand-strong guerrilla force carrying boxes of anti-armor weapons to block the way. The front line of the battle was located at the edge of the pine forest, where the pine trees were thick.  When they encountered the rioters' guerrilla force, Arrow Corporation's Humvees and armored vehicles immediately slowed down, brandishing the heavy machine guns welded to the roofs and firing bullets the size of bowls at the crowd. The mercenaries in the vehicles also jumped out, seeking cover to exchange fire with the rioters.  However, they clearly underestimated the anti-armor capability of the mob. As the mercenaries fired their machine guns, various high-explosive and armor-piercing RPG warheads flew wildly through the pine forest. Although terribly inaccurate, the overwhelming number meant that the reactive armor on the four armored vehicles was simultaneously knocked out, with only one vehicle retreating intact to the rear.  Of course, this was still not enough to make up for the inexperience of these rioters in warfare. Although the sudden RPGs caught Arrow Corporation's armored units off guard, even without armored vehicles, this mob was no match for regular forces...  Less than ten minutes into the exchange of fire, Sami's forces had already suffered more than two hundred casualties, while Arrow Corporation had less than fifty.  Seeing that they were losing, Sami panicked and immediately called Jiang Chen for help. "Our forces on the front line are starting to collapse; their marksmanship is just too accurate! Many people are holding a gun for the first time; we simply can't beat them..."  "Don't worry, it will be fine soon," Jiang Chen's words stunned Sami.  It will be fine soon? What does that mean?  As he was puzzled, the ground trembled with an earthquake, followed by a loud explosion from afar. The shock wave spread through the pine forest, swept over the tundra, and even brushed over his forehead.  Sami hadn't realized what had happened before he saw thick smoke rising from the direction of the military base, his mouth agape in surprise.  Standing on the other side of the battlefield on a small hill, Jiang Chen observed the splendid fireworks through his binoculars, a smile curling at the corner of his mouth. It seemed that the Alpha Special Forces had succeeded.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1065: The Doomsday of Arrow Company  Under the suppression of the mortars, the base was in extreme chaos, and no one noticed that a special forces team had infiltrated the camp. Without much effort, Kutebov placed the beacon on the predetermined target, then led the team to withdraw from the base. After safely reaching the evacuation point, he called for an airstrike.  Soon, a Russian stealth bomber soared over from above the clouds, and the four missiles it dropped accurately hit two ammunition depots and two fuel depots within the base.  The shockwave from the explosions swept across the entire camp, directly collapsing a ring of concrete buildings around it. Exploding ammunition and blazing fireballs flew across the camp, causing a series of chain reactions. Everywhere was flame, everywhere was blood and corpses.  The guard brigade stationed in the camp lost nearly half of its forces instantly, and most of the remaining were wounded, with hardly a whole person to be found. Medics carried stretchers through the base, searching for the injured who had lost their ability to move.  Sappers wearing heavy bomb suits braved the fire, rushing into the flames to drag out unexploded ammunition from the ruins.  All the able-bodied soldiers got moving, looking for their units to regroup.  Saldes stared at the fire outside the window, his pupils gradually filled with a layer of despair.  The thick smoke obscured the entire base, and the fire colored the entire night sky red, as if it were the end of the world.  "Shit..." he muttered to himself, moving his leaden legs away from the window slowly.  Turning around, he met the eyes of the staff officer from the command center.  "Commander, what should we do?" he asked.  The aftermath of the explosions finally subsided, and there were no more sounds of ammunition exploding in the base. However, everyone's mood could not be calmed. The mercenaries who had escaped from the explosions were very clear that their nightmare was just beginning.  The previous explosions seemed to have ignited a signal, blowing the horn for Sami's troops to attack. Under Jiang Chen's instruction, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity, standing in front of everyone, calling out loud and leading the remaining mob to charge the front lines.  More than six thousand people ran across the tundra, rushing towards the pine forest where the lights flickered. From a distance, the scene was quite spectacular.  Meanwhile, as the mercenaries on the front lines saw the thick smoke rising from behind their base, they all fell into panic. Their morale, originally high, plummeted in an instant.  When faced with the mob that surged forward like a tidal wave, even though they had the strength to hold the line, they had no desire to continue fighting.  Without any suspense, Arrow Company's defensive line was broken, and the resisting mercenaries collapsed in the face of Sami's army's human wave tactics.  Some fled back to the burning base, but most became deserters, escaping deep into the forest.  Without needing Jiang Chen to remind them, even a pig would know what to do at this time.  Watching Sami leading the mob to attack the military base, Jiang Chen put away his binoculars, summoned the off-road motorcycle he had prepared in advance from his storage space, and gently patted Aisha's back.  "It's about time; let's get going."  "Okay!" Aisha nodded, and after Jiang Chen sat on the motorcycle, she quickly straddled behind him.  The engine roared, and the tires kicked up a layer of crushed snow.  Jiang Chen rode the off-road motorcycle down the hillside, taking Aisha to the side of the base, stopping the motorcycle by the roadside. He pulled out a laser sword from his storage space, held it casually in his hand, and effortlessly cut through the protective wall made of steel wire.  The entire base was immersed in fire and chaos. Occasionally, the sound of mortars could still be heard. All the mercenaries capable of carrying a gun were pushed to the front line, fighting with the mob for control of the main gate of the base.  Aside from a guard squad stationed in front of the command center, there were hardly any people in the entire rear area. For Jiang Chen and Aisha, this was no different from being undefended.  Ten guards in total, two stationed in the watchtower, the remaining eight at the entrances of the first and second floors.  Aisha took out a ghost sniper rifle, silently took out the two guards in the watchtower, then using the blind spots of their vision, she killed the eight people upstairs and downstairs one by one.  After Aisha dealt with the guards outside the command post, Jiang Chen took out a rifle, stepped towards the main gate, but when he passed by the Humvee at the entrance, he coincidentally ran into Saldes, who was frantically escaping from the command center, and the staff officer.  Their eyes met, and both sides were obviously stunned.  The staff officer was the first to react, immediately reaching into his chest to draw a gun. However, before his hand reached his chest, Aisha, who was quicker to act, shot him in the head.  Saldes was about to resist but was easily controlled by Jiang Chen, who twisted his hands behind his back and pressed him against the Humvee.  "Saldes, male, 43 years old. Serves as the general manager of Arrow Company and also as the supreme commander, am I right?" Although it was their first meeting, Jiang Chen's holographic helmet linked to the Ghost Agent database stored his photo and personal information. Just one encounter, and the information about him was projected onto the holographic screen.  With his face pressed against the car hood, Saldes was quite tough and refused to surrender. He gritted his teeth and said, "I won't say anything, just kill me..."  "Kill you? I haven't asked you anything yet." Jiang Chen grinned, not caring about his uncooperative attitude at all, and took out a syringe, unceremoniously injecting it into his shoulder.  "Ugh!" Saldes made a defiant growl from his throat, his eyes bulging with blood, but soon the brilliance in his pupils dimmed.  Jiang Chen simply let go of his grip, as it was unprecedented for an ordinary person injected with truth serum to resist.  Flipping Saldes over, Jiang Chen asked word by word, "Where is Carmen?"  "In the underground bunker... in the research institute."  "Where is the underground bunker?"  "The entrance is in the center of the base; you can only enter through the elevator. Next to the entrance, there are two helipads; you'll see it if you walk over."  After a question and answer, Jiang Chen quickly got the information he wanted.  "Very well, now you can get your wish." Jiang Chen pulled out a pistol and shot him in the head, then tossed his body aside.  It was a quick death, but for the widely reputed general manager of Arrow Company, Mr. Saldes, dying in such an obscure manner might be more painful than death itself... if the dead could feel pain.  "Underground bunker, huh." Looking towards the center of the base, Jiang Chen's mouth curled into a cold smile.  No matter what Carmen was still plotting, his luck was about to run out. The fate of the Rothschild family would be like how they started, rising to fame because of a war and dying obscurely because of a war...  But just then, a piercing scream came from a distance.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1066: Iblis! A shrill scream pierced through the entire battlefield, even drowning out the sound of bullets being fired. In the center of the battlefield, where mercenaries were fiercely exchanging fire with rioters, a dark shadow suddenly burst in. Illuminated by the flare, everyone saw the appearance of the monster clearly. Its legs were curved like a bow, its arms were two black scythes, and its spindle-shaped long mouth was embedded with rows of teeth the size of rice grains. It also had two pairs of short wings on its back, resembling a humanoid praying mantis.  The gunfire ceased for a brief two seconds. Everyone was bewildered by the scene before them. However, in the instant the gunfire stopped, the "mantis" moved. Its bow-shaped legs forcefully catapulted its seven-foot tall frame forward like a cannonball, defying science. The rioter closest to it didn't even have time to react before the crossing blades decapitated him, and his arterial blood gushed out as he fell backward.  After knocking its prey to the ground, the monster's spindle-shaped mouth fiercely stabbed into the neck's severed end. With a series of crisp crunching sounds, it gnawed away the prey's bone marrow and flesh as if it were drinking a beverage. Its manner of consuming flesh and blood was as brutal as a wild beast.  Even the devotees who had been in a killing frenzy couldn't help but feel their stomachs churn and their legs tremble as they started to retreat. "Iblis..." That was the name of a devil, just like Satan in the Bible. "It's Iblis!" Someone shouted this, followed by screams that rose and fell in succession.  The rioters raised their G36 rifles, desperately pulling the triggers and spraying bullets at the monster. However, the mantis simply raised its double blades, allowing the bullets to ping harmlessly off its chitinous armor, utterly disregarding the incoming 5.56mm rounds.  The most deadly fact was that there wasn't just one mantis-like creature! Dozens of dark shadows had already sprung out one after another from the underground bunker entrances, wielding double blades as they charged into the ranks of the rioters. Once they closed in, the only fate awaiting the rioters was slaughter.  In addition to the mantises, there was also a type of bloated, maggot-like creature spewing highly corrosive saliva. Even steel and concrete, much less human flesh, fell prey to its powerful corrosive effect. Facing these devils of legend, the devotees finally began to feel fear.  Just as they had arrived, the disorderly mob of rioters uncontrollably collapsed in defeat. On the other hand, the mercenaries cheered joyfully. It was one of their own! Though it looked a bit disgusting.  However, their cheers didn't last long before a similar nightmare descended upon them. Dense clusters of spores drifted out from the underground bunkers and began to spread slowly across the entire camp, virtually undetectable in the dark night.  The first people to encounter the spores began to have difficulty breathing, followed by tearing pain spreading from their chest cavities. They screamed in agony, scratching at their own skin as blood flowed freely. Soon, they lost sensation in their entire bodies, becoming akin to walking corpses.  Only those encased in mechanical exoskeletons were spared. Everyone on the battlefield, friend and foe alike, was engulfed by the spores.  To survive, the mercenaries and rioters turned their guns away from each other and began to face their common enemy. However, from the very beginning, they had no chance of victory.  ...  "Damn it, what the hell is that?!" A creature resembling a deathclaw and somewhat similar to the one before it lunged over. Jiang Chen, sweating profusely, kicked it in the chest, discarded his empty rifle, and drew his laser sword, brandishing it twice to sever one of its arms. Green blood sprayed out, vaporized by the heat of the lightsaber.  Taking advantage of the creature's retreat as it screeched backward, Jiang Chen didn't pursue. With a flick of his right hand holding the sword handle, a spinning blade of light separated from the hilt and cleaved into the creature's face, slicing off half of it. It was fortunate that his sword skills weren't rusty; otherwise, he would have been caught off guard.  Elsewhere, Aisha set up her Ghost sniper rifle and calmly blew off the heads of two mutant creatures. "There are too many of them; we can't stay here any longer," Jiang Chen picked up a PK2000 from the ground, reloaded it with a magazine, "Prepare to retreat."  Aisha nodded but did not move. "I'll cover the rear—"  "You go first, hurry up!" Jiang Chen slapped Aisha's shoulder, pushing her to the back, and raised his rifle to fire at several staggering zombies coming his way.  Yes, they were zombies. But they seemed a bit different from the zombies he had encountered in Cagayan City; these zombies seemed not to be due to viral infection but rather similar to the zombies from the wasteland.  [Warning: Unidentified bacteria detected in the air, filtration device has been automatically activated. To disable, please...]  When Jiang Chen saw the two lines of text projected on his helmet screen, he immediately understood what these things were. It was too similar to the creature he had once encountered in Wanghai City.  He could not afford to think too much at this point. Without any hesitation, using his highest command authority within the Star Ring Trade, bypassing all decision-making layers, he directly connected to the Electroray C-1 deployed in geostationary orbit, designated the underground bunker entrance in the center of the base as the strike target, and called for an orbital bombardment.  As for diplomatic issues, those could be set aside in the face of human concerns. At worst, they would just have to pay some compensation.  "This is Electroray C-1, airstrike target confirmed. Tungsten core bomb separated, leaving geostationary orbit. Airstrike expected to arrive in ten minutes, please evacuate from the target area..."  After turning off the communication in his ear, Jiang Chen emptied the magazine in his rifle and immediately ran towards the protective net.  Aisha, who had already reached the outside of the protective net, set up her sniper rifle and began to cover Jiang Chen's retreat. For some reason, these creatures seemed to be consciously chasing them, as if controlled by some kind of consciousness.  Before being surrounded by the army of zombies and mutant creatures, Jiang Chen successfully crawled out of the protective net, threw a nuclear grenade behind him, and ran without looking back, pulling Aisha with him.  The blast wave from the explosion knocked down a swath of mutant creatures. Once assured that the zombies and aliens had not pursued, Jiang Chen took out an off-road motorcycle from his storage space and with Aisha, sped towards a nearby mountain. Not in the direction of the refugee camp, but towards the Russian-Finnish border.  After reaching the hilltop, Jiang Chen stopped the motorcycle and glanced at the time on his watch before looking back in the direction of the military base. With the help of sporadic flames, he could barely make out with the naked eye that there were no more living people in the entire military base.  At that moment, specks of white light emerged in the night sky. Carrying long trails of fire, a dozen tungsten core bombs sequentially hit the center of the military base, with dust from the explosions rising tens of meters high.  "That should be dead, right?" Jiang Chen muttered, taking out a telescope from his pocket. When the dust settled, only a deep crater several dozen meters in diameter was left in the center of the base, like an abyss leading to hell. Mutant creatures, shaking their heads and bodies, were crawling out of the deep crater...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1067: Finland Caught in the Crossfire  The sky was already faintly turning light; it was six o'clock in the morning. An orange-red civilian helicopter circled high in the sky, its side emblazoned with the logo of Yle. When the ammunition depot exploded and black smoke rose, the Finnish Broadcasting Company dispatched their helicopter to the scene immediately.  They originally thought it was a forest fire, but when they arrived, they discovered it was not a forest fire at all. What was ablaze was the military base of Arrow Company, which had been widely criticized within Finland. It seemed as if a war had broken out, and in the center of the incident site, there was a deep, bottomless crater.  "This is the Finnish Broadcasting Company, live broadcasting the situation of the forest fire in the Paltak suburbs... Although it turned out this wasn't a fire at all, but an explosion caused by humans. We have witnessed a huge pit at the scene... Wait, what is that!"  The camera shook violently, the cameraman adjusted the focus, zooming in towards the direction of the military base. In the flaming base, corpses walked aimlessly, and from time to time, bizarre creatures climbed out of the pit.  "...It seems we have discovered something unbelievable. The rumors about Arrow Company conducting unsavory experiments at the military base seem to be true. What are these things? Aliens? Zombies? Extraterrestrials? God..."  While the helicopter was sending first-hand information to the Finnish people and the world, Jiang Chen, standing on the mountain, was also worried about the situation at the base.  It was clear that a lot of effort was put into building this underground shelter. The tungsten core bombs that fell from the sky did not completely destroy the underground shelter, but only collapsed the elevator leading to and from it.  Spores continued to spurt from the underground laboratory, and now they had spread outside the base.  Jiang Chen noticed that the terrifying bacteria could not only cause the animals that stumbled into it to mutate but could also infect the plants rooted there.  "Aisha."  "Hmm?"  Aisha tilted her head to look at Jiang Chen, her beautiful chestnut hair swaying in the wind.  "I think... we might have stirred up trouble," Jiang Chen said with a wry smile, putting down his binoculars.  "Stirred up trouble?" Aisha frowned slightly in confusion, not understanding the meaning behind Jiang Chen's words.  Trouble? What is trouble?  Jiang Chen shook his head and didn't explain further.  At that moment, a sudden premonition surged in his heart. Jiang Chen and Aisha almost simultaneously turned around, drawing their pistols and aiming towards the direction of the road.  "Come out, I'll count to three."  His finger flicked off the safety, and Jiang Chen said calmly.  With both hands raised above his head, a Russian in arctic camouflage stood out, speaking in rather unstandard Chinese.  "Don't be nervous, one of us."  Looking at the face covered with as many scars as wrinkles, Jiang Chen put away his pistol and breathed a sigh of relief, gesturing for Aisha to do the same and looked at him with a crooked smile.  "I was just about to shoot."  "Thank you for not doing that," Kutepov lowered his raised hands and walked up to Jiang Chen, lifting his chin towards the direction of the military base down the hill, "What's the situation there?"  "Special situation, it's complicated to explain right now, we'll talk about it when we get back," Jiang Chen shook his head.  "Alright, shall we go together?" Kutepov pointed towards the direction of the mountain, "If you're not planning to go back to the refugee camp, you can come with us to the evacuation point. There's a helicopter waiting for us there."  Jiang Chen, of course, had no intention of returning to the refugee camp.  Not only had he instigated chaos within the borders of another country, but he had also poked a hole in their map and left behind such a mess.  As long as the Finnish government wasn't foolish, they should be unable to sit still by now.  Without any hesitation, Jiang Chen took Aisha with him on Alpha Special Forces' "convenient flight" and returned to Russian territory.  As if to confirm Jiang Chen's guess, just as he crossed the Russian-Finnish border, the Finnish Defense Forces had already arrived in Paltak.  When national security faced a serious challenge, the Finnish authorities couldn't care less about any humanitarian crisis. Tanks and armored vehicles forcefully entered the refugee camp, and fully armed soldiers quickly took control of the ammunition factory and warehouse, confiscating the weapons of these defeated soldiers.  During the disarmament process, the Finnish Defense Forces did not encounter any resistance.  Or rather, Sami unhesitatingly led the way in throwing away his weapons, obediently got on the prison van, and sat in the corner, spiritlessly muttering the name of the old Ibris, begging for the true God's embrace.  And the expressions of those rioters who had luckily survived were mostly the same as his.  When asked what had happened the night before, the repeated words in their fragmented language were—"Ibris," "demons," "monsters," "slaughter"...  What made the commanders laugh and cry was that these disarmed and surrendered rioters seemed to have been truly terrified. They were desperate to get on the prison van and leave this damned place as soon as possible, with over a thousand people claiming that they had participated in the execution of prisoners.  However, in fact, there were only ten mercenaries executed that night...  "It's really like seeing a ghost! Ibris? What the hell is that!"  Throwing the briefing on the table, Duweo frowned and looked at the map, "How's the situation at the military base?"  "Our helicopters have flown over there, but they couldn't see anything. The entire military base is surrounded by a shit-yellow gas cloud. Concerned about the possibility of toxic substances, our pilots didn't dare fly too close," Duweo's assistant replied.  "Send scouts to have a look, and tell them to wear protective gear."  As soon as Duweo finished speaking, a sergeant walked into the temporary command tent, saluted, and handed a letter to Duweo.  "Sir, an order from the Ministry of Defense."  Raising his eyebrows, Duweo opened the sealed letter. His brows furrowed, and after reading the letter, he rubbed his sore forehead and threw the letter aside.  "The mission is canceled, no need to send scouts."  The assistant looked at his superior in surprise, not understanding what had made him change his mind.  Out of duty, he still reminded his superior, "If we don't confirm the situation inside the base, we can't make any operational plans for rescue."  "No need for plans, no need for rescue. Thanks to those bureaucrats, the reporters got there before us, they have already confirmed that there are no survivors there," Duweo shook his head, tapping the envelope, "This is an order from the Ministry of Defense, no one is to approach within one kilometer of the incident site. Our only task now is to hold this position, cooperate with the police to evacuate the townspeople of Paltak, and then move these refugees to two refugee camps at the Norwegian border."  Pausing for a moment, Duweo frowned and looked outside the tent, muttering, "Let those bureaucrats go to Russia and quibble. If they think that quibbling can solve all problems."  As he complained, a special plane had already taken off from Helsinki's international airport, carrying the Finnish Minister of Defense and the Vice President to Russia's largest city along the Arctic Ocean—Murmansk.  Meanwhile, the Russian Minister of Defense and the Head of the Security Agency also rushed to the location, ready to seek a solution with Finland...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1068: Only Xinghuan Trade Can Save You  The trouble with the Harmony civilization lies in their understanding of biology, which has far surpassed the imaginations of human civilization, which is still in its infancy. While the world's countries are busy exporting ideologies, they have started to spread something more dangerous—their evil genes. Their DNA code is to biology what computer viruses are to computers.  Whether Carmen is dead or alive, Jiang Chen isn't too worried about it now. Even if he's still alive, he's probably only hanging on by a thread. The greatest benefit Harmony civilization can promise him is nothing more than a reservation, similar to what America once promised the Native Americans—a few square kilometers of land for him to survive with a dozen or so natives as a "sample" of human civilization.  Jiang Chen's only relief now is that the power of the Communion is beginning to decline. If Carmen had made contact with the Harmony civilization at the height of his power, half of Europe might have become a breeding ground for the alien species by now. But then again, if he had not been driven to a dead end by the Future People's Group, if the golden apple he once zealously pursued had not become worthless, why would Carmen have gone mad down this path? Jiang Chen doesn't believe Carmen can't see the danger of the Harmony civilization, a civilization that almost has the gene of invasion written in its cell nucleus.  Murmansk, as the largest strategic stronghold on the coast of the Arctic Ocean in Russia, is less than ninety kilometers from the Russian-Finnish border. Realizing the seriousness of the problem, the Finnish Minister of Defense immediately dispatched the defense forces to seal off the scene and went to Russia with the Vice President. The Finnish President had planned to go in person, but diplomatic procedures were not timely, and he had to stabilize the domestic situation. Because the incident occurred very close to the Russian border, it could even cause a citywide evacuation in Murmansk. Russia also paid high attention to this accident, with Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu and the Head of the Security Bureau, Barlt, taking a special plane from Moscow to Murmansk to meet with senior Finnish officials.  In addition to the high-ranking officials from both countries, a foreigner with a special identity also participated in this meeting... or rather, a war council. Facing the high officials of the two countries, Jiang Chen briefly outlined the content of the secret experiments conducted by the Rothschild family collected by Xinghuan Trade and repeatedly emphasized that the unauthorized military operation against northern Finland was for the security of Finland and the whole world. This rhetoric easily won applause from Russian officials, as all these had been arranged by Jiang Chen and Barlt before the meeting.  However, the Finnish officials were not so easily fooled, and the Vice President and the Minister of Defense scoffed at it. Seeing that he had not achieved the expected effect, Jiang Chen stopped and began to talk about the first key point of the meeting—the danger of the X2 bacterium.  "In the center of the military base, the source of infection we call the 'Mother Nest' can produce a special kind of bacterium with spore-like characteristics," Jiang Chen explained.  "Our scientists have named it the X2 bacterium. This bacterium is highly aggressive and can easily infect organisms that lack antibodies to turn them into breeding grounds for themselves. Infected organisms will exhibit stronger aggression and invasive behaviors than before, and their original DNA will be modified to show distinctive enhancements. It's somewhat similar to the principle of Spider-Man and the Hulk."  "So you're saying, in no time, all citizens of Finland will become Spider-Men?" the Finnish Vice President asked sarcastically.  "Er... That's not a concern for now," Jiang Chen said, drawing a circle on the satellite map and pointing with a marker at the circled pine forest. "See those withered pines? Those mutated organisms... let's call them alien species, cannot leave the spore coverage area. Of course, it doesn't exclude them from going out to hunt, or the active range of spores continuing to spread."  Jiang Chen didn't say what he was most worried about—the X2 developing mutations or even an unheard-of X3 bacterium. After all, evolution is what biology does best. The X2 bacterium was defeated by his incendiary grenades, and it's been almost four years since then. It's possible that the Harmony civilization, having learned its lesson, could evolve a new biological weapon.  "Right now, only Xinghuan Trade can save you," Barlt, the Head of the Russian Security Bureau, emphasized.  "It's all because of your situation!" the Finnish Minister of Defense burst out in anger upon hearing this, slamming his fist on the table. "Now you tell us only you can solve it, what do we have to believe you?"  The Russian Security Bureau Head gave a wry smile, pinching his brow and awkwardly shifting his gaze. Jiang Chen also touched his nose awkwardly and coughed lightly, "To correct, I am definitely not the cause of today's situation, it's Carmen. If you hadn't brought in Arrow Company and rented your northern wasteland to them to build refugee camps, would today's situation have happened? You didn't even know they were conducting research on your land, don't you bear some responsibility?"  "What do you plan to do if we leave it to you?" the Finnish Vice President asked Jiang Chen seriously.  "Send out the orbital airborne brigade," Jiang Chen said without hesitation.  "Aren't your only two orbital airborne brigades in Ukraine?" the Finnish Minister of Defense asked, puzzled.  "In fact, we have a secret force that has been training for a long time," Jiang Chen coughed lightly. "I didn't plan to reveal this so early, but the situation is urgent, and we can't care about that much now."  As he said this, Jiang Chen acted as if he was making a great concession. The Finnish Vice President and Minister of Defense exchanged glances, then looked towards Jiang Chen and the Russian officials, finally resting their gaze on Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu's face.  "Sorry, but your sincerity is in doubt. We think NATO can better solve the current problems, at least they won't send bombers flying into our airspace without notice. You were the first to break the rules of the game, so don't blame us for making this tough choice."  The issue of Finland joining NATO has been discussed since the Cold War but has been unresolved. The parliamentary elections have basically set the agenda for joining NATO, but the biggest obstacle is in the final referendum stage, where Finnish citizens are not willing to give up their neutral status. But if NATO solves Finland's troubles, even the most difficult referendum stage will likely not encounter too much resistance.  Once Finland joins NATO, it will mean that Russia suddenly has thousands of kilometers of armed defense lines, not to mention the strategic significance of cities like St. Petersburg and Murmansk behind this line. This situation is what Russia fears the most and is unwilling to see by any means.  "Russia cannot accept NATO troops entering Finland; you have better choices," Sergei Shoigu immediately stood up, saying anxiously, "If you insist on the wrong decision, the situation will only get worse."  "Is this a threat?" the Finnish Vice President asked coldly.  "This is a suggestion," Barlt said in a conciliatory tone. "The Finnish people are facing a threat to their lives; what situation could be worse than now? On behalf of the President, thank you for your suggestion. In fact, two hours ago, our President had already met with the NATO Secretary-General in Helsinki. Goodbye!"  With that, the Finnish senior officials got up and left, while Shoigu wanted to retain them but ultimately froze with an expression on his face.  "Remember to use incendiary grenades. To deal with those bugs, incendiary grenades might be more effective than bullets and insecticides combined," Jiang Chen reminded as a goodwill gesture, "Also, if you must ask NATO to help you with this trouble, make sure they don't use 5.56mm ammunition; chitinous armor has natural resistance to small-caliber bullets, sending more soldiers is just feeding them."  "And if you can't solve it, remember to call me."  The Finnish Vice President waved his hand, whether he heard or not, and left the meeting with the Minister of Defense and other officials without looking back.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1069: Bugs Can Evolve  The conference room was silent. The scheduled agenda had only been half completed when the officials from Finland left early. Sergei Shoigu, who had stood up, could neither sit nor stand comfortably and gave a signal to his secretary, who immediately came forward to help his boss pack up the things on the table. The sounds of chairs moving and papers being organized filled the room. Seeing the minister beginning to pack up to leave, the Russian officials also started to pack up their things and left the long table. The meeting had ended without even reaching half of the expected results.  Standing in front of the satellite map, Jiang Chen tossed the marker pen aside and walked towards the door. He had only brought one person with him when he arrived, so he had nothing to pack. When leaving, he casually called Aisha to help reserve dinner at the front desk. He now just wanted to eat a hot dinner; the last time he had a proper meal was twenty-four hours ago. After spending all of last night outside, following Kutepov on a helicopter to Murmansk, the first thing he did was call the Hilton Hotel to reserve a room. After taking a limo back to the hotel, he went to sleep without even taking off his clothes and slept until the afternoon when the director of the Russian Security Service, Bart, called him to attend a meeting.  It was already seven in the evening. Before the meeting, he had only drunk a tube of fruit-flavored nutritional supplement, and now his stomach was starting to protest. Right as he left the government building, Bart waved at him. However, before Jiang Chen could walk over, Bart quickly approached him, patted his shoulder, and said with a grin, "How about having dinner together? There's a nice restaurant nearby, my treat."  "I've already reserved dinner at the Hilton Hotel. Let me treat you," Jiang Chen said, and then called Aisha again to tell her that the reserved dinner no longer needed to be delivered to the room. They would eat directly in the private room of the restaurant, and to add one more person.  "Alright then," seeing that Jiang Chen had already made reservations, Bart did not decline and took out car keys from his pocket. "Shall we take my car?"  "Then I'll trouble you," Jiang Chen replied with a smile.  Unlike the Defense Minister Sergei, perhaps due to work requirements, Bart did not have a driver and drove himself. Jiang Chen could not recognize the brand of the car Bart was driving, but it seemed to be a Russian-made car. Jiang Chen sat in the passenger seat and buckled his seatbelt. As soon as the car started, Bart's face turned bitter.  "Buddy, you've gotten us into big trouble," Jiang Chen glanced at him, defensively saying, "Why are you like those Finns? When something goes wrong, you throw the problem on my head. If your Alpha Squad had taken out Carmen, there wouldn't be so much trouble! I heard it was only five hundred meters away; you could have taken him out, but instead, you thought about bombing an ammunition depot?"  Bart was stunned for a moment, then frowned and asked, "Can one person really make such a big difference?"  Jiang Chen scoffed and leaned back in his seat to rest with his eyes closed, "You might want to give him a ten-year development opportunity; he might be able to turn all of Russia into that kind of situation."  "What do we do now?" Bart asked.  "Wait," Jiang Chen replied.  "Wait?"  "Wait until NATO stumbles there; they'll naturally think of us," Jiang Chen chuckled.  "Do you think NATO can't handle this trouble? It's just a few bugs," Bart frowned.  In his view, not only NATO, but even if the Russian border guards were sent over, they could easily crush those little bugs. Hearing such naïve statements, Jiang Chen laughed.  "Just bugs?" Holding the steering wheel, Bart was silent for a while.  Just as Jiang Chen was almost falling asleep, Bart spoke, "If I may ask, why are you so sure? Don't get me wrong, I mean no offense... I'm just very curious, you seem to be very familiar with this situation? The same with the T-virus, and now this X2 bacteria."  Years of working in intelligence told Bart that there seemed to be a deep connection between these two seemingly unrelated incidents. Jiang Chen's left eye, which was squinting, opened a crack, and he looked at Bart with surprise. He was just about to make up an excuse and laugh it off when he suddenly remembered the golden apples that flowed out of the factories controlled by Rothschild.  It was also those golden apples that forced him to change his mind on the spot. Maybe now was the time? After pondering for a moment, Jiang Chen suddenly laughed and said, "Yes, I'm indeed very familiar with these things, and I also know how Carmen got them. Do you want to know why?"  "If it's convenient," although Bart did not seem to care much on the surface, Jiang Chen could clearly feel that he was very interested.  "Let's talk about it during dinner; we can discuss this matter slowly." Jiang Chen did not answer but closed his eyes again and returned to a state of rest.  There was still a half-hour drive to the Hilton Hotel. Before being open and honest, he needed to think carefully about how he should phrase his words later.  The revolution was breaking out in Germany, and they were too busy to send troops to support their allies. The American aircraft carriers were too far away, and it seemed unrealistic to move them from the Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea. Moreover, it would provoke the fragile nerves of the Russians. The last to offer help was the United Kingdom, which had already left the EU but had not left NATO. However, the British apparently underestimated the danger of the "Hive" and only sent a mechanized brigade that was quickly deployed to the north of Finland through heavy transport aircraft.  I don't know if they took Jiang Chen's advice, but the Finnish government sent engineers to chop down trees along the "infected area" to create a fifty-meter-wide isolation belt. Then the British Army launched a total of twenty white phosphorus bombs at the "Hive" to sterilize the area physically before entering the infected zone. However, the results were unexpected. The white phosphorus bombs exploded and did indeed produce brilliant sparks, but the flames soon seemed to "freeze" in the air and were extinguished. The spores that had been burned to a crisp floated out of the ground after a while and filled the gap that was lost.  Realizing something was wrong, they extracted some spore suspensions from the infected area for testing and found that these single-celled organisms would rapidly consume themselves in high-temperature environments, secreting a special high-temperature resistant liquid that extinguished the fire by enveloping the burning substance!  Cells with their fire extinguishers! This incredible discovery made the biologists who were invited to test the spores from the infected area exclaim in disbelief. Even with their decades of experience, they couldn't understand what was going on.  This did not surprise Jiang Chen. Bugs can evolve. If they can do something as incredible as interstellar travel, what's a little fire extinguishing?  (To be continued.) Chapter 1070: Let the Professionals Handle It!  White phosphorus bombs, gasoline bombs, these things have all been tried, to no avail, even flamethrowers are ineffective. In addition to incendiary bombs, the British also tried other things. For example, pesticides, insecticides, and even strong acids and alkalis in chemical weapons. These chemical weapons would be absolutely inhumane in normal times, but there's no need to be so particular with a swarm of bugs.  However, regrettably, those bugs were not at all affected by their chemical weapons; there was no reaction when they were thrown in. Besides these, the British also considered deploying larger-scale incendiary bombs, theoretically capable of burning off all the air in the infection zone at once, but the Finnish government was not happy about that. Incendiary bombs on a larger scale would certainly render the more than fifty-meter-wide isolation zone useless, and if a forest fire were to occur as a result, the losses would be severe! This is the Arctic Circle, with its primitive pine forests of the tundra! Every tree is a living fossil!  The Finns were already heartbroken enough by the trees cut down to deploy the incendiary bombs. Moreover, the British could not guarantee that the larger incendiary bombs would not be "frozen" by those strange spores. That weird stuff could even wrap around vaporized gasoline!  If they don't allow it, then so be it. It's a good opportunity to flex our muscles to our future little brothers and make them feel at ease about joining the NATO family. The British Ministry of Defence made a decision, the commander they sent didn't take it seriously, deploying two mechanized platoons, totaling forty "Ajax" armored fighting vehicles leading the way, followed closely by over three hundred infantrymen in protective chemical suits.  The battle plan was simple: it was expected that within ten minutes, all alien species in the infection zone would be cleared, and within twenty minutes, the entrance would be suppressed. Then special forces would be deployed to rappel into the underground bunker to eliminate the source of infection.  The soldiers in protective suits were not at all aware of the danger of their mission; instead, they joked in front of the interviewing media reporters that if the hive had appeared in London, they wouldn't need to lift a finger, as the firefighters could probably have handled it.  The appearance of the hive had attracted attention worldwide, and of course, this interview was also broadcast globally. In the same conference room as yesterday, the satellite map on the big screen had been replaced by a live interview with British soldiers about to carry out their mission in the Paltak region by a Russian TV station reporter.  Originally, Jiang Chen didn't want to watch the news with these old Russians because he had already roughly guessed what the outcome would be. However, since the Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu had personally invited him, he couldn't refuse and made the trip.  Honestly, sitting there quietly watching the news with a group of big shots felt a bit odd.  "Are you sure they can't handle it?" Sergei looked to Jiang Chen, asking incredulously, "I don't mean to take pleasure in other people's misfortune, but this is very important for Russia's national defense strategy. If the British succeed, we will gain a defense line of thousands of kilometers."  "Just wait and see." Leaning back in his chair, Jiang Chen glanced at the screen at the British soldier full of confidence, and smirked.  London firefighters? Even if you send over the urban management officers from the Celestial Empire, Japanese high school students, and American homeless people, it would be useless!  As the military set off, the TV picture moved; the reporter gave a side shot of the forty armored vehicles hitting the road, and then quickly switched the scene from the ground to the air.  The helicopter followed the mechanized force from a distance, watching as they charged into the infection zone obscured by the murky spore clouds.  Confident in their "pest control" plan, the British military commander, with permission from the Ministry of Defence, exceptionally opened up part of the non-sensitive combat communications to the reporters to demonstrate NATO's combat capability. However, as for the combat footage, it would not be made public due to military secrecy.  "This is 12th Platoon, we have reached the target area, no abnormal situation detected so far." "Alien species sighted. Safety off, free to fire."  Intense gunfire and the roar of alien species lasted for a full two minutes. Sitting in front of the screen, the Russian officials, especially the Russian Minister of Defence, gradually showed more interesting expressions on their faces. They were all high-ranking military officials, and just by listening to the sound, they knew the situation of the British was probably not optimistic.  "...... We are engaging with the aliens! There are too many of them, but our firepower is superior—"  "Shit! They move so fast! Fuck! Infantry, fall back! I repeat, infantry, fall back! Charlie, are you crazy, get your people back——zzzz——"  The communication was abruptly cut off. Clearly, the British commander had realized that the content that followed was no longer suitable for media broadcast.  The only thing left to depict the severity of the war for the people sitting in the conference room was the flashing lights within the murky clouds on the screen.  Silence fell upon the conference room, the Russian military hierarchy looked at each other. No one expected such a result; no one thought that a mechanized force would be defeated by a group of mutant creatures... except for one person.  That was Jiang Chen.  If they overlooked their anti-armor capabilities just because they were bugs, he was not surprised at all that the British would suffer at their hands.  Now, he was merely curious about how many of these armored vehicles could retreat intact.  As for the infantry, there was no need to even think about it; at this point, their bones had probably been gnawed over.  "There has been a slight accident in the hive cleaning work. Now, we will broadcast a brief message...... " On the screen, the reporter said with a slightly awkward expression.  Even the picture was gone.  At this moment, Jiang Chen's wristwatch vibrated.  "I'll step outside to take a call." Saying this quietly to Sergei sitting next to him, Jiang Chen got up and walked out of the conference room.  The call was from the Finnish Presidential Palace. Don't ask how he knew; there was no need to guess.  Stepping outside the conference room, Jiang Chen went to the window in the hallway, opened the holographic screen, and pressed the answer button.  The call connected, but there was no immediate speech from the other side. After a two-second silence and a somewhat awkward atmosphere, the other side finally opened their mouth with a bit of embarrassment.  "...... Uh, the British are giving up."  As expected, regular armies are not mercenaries; in peacetime, every life is precious. Having lost a battalion inexplicably in the infection zone without even reaching the entrance to the underground bunker, the British public is probably already in an uproar.  "Oh."  "The Americans have indicated that they want to observe for a while, but the coverage area of the spores is spreading, and now even the fifty-meter-wide isolation zone has been covered."  Hearing the Finnish President's words, Jiang Chen revealed an expression of "as expected." The corpses of the killed British soldiers provided an easy-to-absorb organic matter for the hive, including human bodies, which are easier to use as a breeding ground for spores than wood and insects.  Just by swallowing up an estimated battalion's worth of troops, the hive couldn't wait to expand the coverage area of the spores. Judging from this point alone, the hive truly had the style of Carmen.  His guess was confirmed, and Jiang Chen's confidence in resolving this trouble increased a bit. But at this moment, he was not in a hurry to speak. Clearly, the other side was using a tone of asking for help. If he gave in so quickly, it would be too cheap for them!  "Uh-huh."  Adjusting his tone, Jiang Chen said indifferently, "Just speak directly about what you want to say."  "That... how about you guys take over?" inquired the Finnish President in a conciliatory tone.  Pretending to hesitate, Jiang Chen pondered for a moment before speaking slowly.  "The area of the infection zone has expanded quite a bit, and even the British mechanized brigade can't do anything about it; it might be a bit difficult. Why don't you try carpet bombing? Although those spores can block combustion, it doesn't make sense that they could also withstand high-explosive bombs, right?"  "We've tried that already, it's useless. The spores we cleared couldn't keep up with the rate they were secreted, and it blew the spores even further away," said the Finnish President with a wry smile. "Let's not beat around the bush, you're a businessman, so name your price."  A smile crept up on the corner of Jiang Chen's mouth as he spoke in a pleasant tone.  "300 million New Dollars."  Hearing this figure, the Finnish President's eyebrows twitched violently.  "......Can it be cheaper?"  The exchange rate for New Dollars is not low right now, and the Euro has recently depreciated. Unless he throws the entire Finnish military's annual procurement budget into it, which is obviously impossible.  "If you can't afford the payment, we can consider another payment method. For example, selling the assets of Arrow Company in Finland as a package to us. Of course, after an incident like this, we can only value their assets at 300 million New Dollars. Believe me, this is already a very conscientious price, much higher than what the banks would estimate."  At this point, Jiang Chen smiled wickedly in his heart. Although Arrow Company was an old adversary, the mercenaries who worked for money had no grudge with him. After this incident, Arrow Company would surely go bankrupt due to the heavy fines imposed by the Finnish government.  If the Arrow Company registered in Finland was acquired, more than twenty thousand experienced veterans would be a considerable asset for Star Ring Trade. Just pull them into a training camp for some integration, slightly improve the benefits and treatment, and these people would soon start working for their new boss.  The management could be completely dissolved if there were concerns about trust, filter the rank-and-file soldiers for reassignment, and sell the weapons and equipment in a package to Africa.  As for the remaining two refugee camps, these could be temporarily kept. As long as they are used properly, they can completely serve as a bargaining chip for negotiations with the European Union.  As for the two military bases that come with the refugee camps, he also had great use for them.  The Finnish President reluctantly nodded.  "Deal."  Jiang Chen smiled and nodded.  "Then, a pleasant cooperation."  "When can your people arrive? If it's ten days or half a month, we probably can't wait that long..."  "It won't take that long," Jiang Chen looked at the time on the holographic screen, "Just give me five hours. Also, inform the British military, tell them they can pack up and go home, let the professionals handle it." Chapter 1071: The Nest  The break with a diameter of tens of meters looked like a giant pit, located in the center of the military base. Below this pit, at a depth of about five hundred meters, was an underground shelter designed by the Rothschild Group for experimental purposes. At this moment, this underground shelter was devoid of any signs of living humans, completely covered by a suspicious blood-red fleshy blister, emitting an inexplicably foul stench.  If one could suppress the nausea and take a closer look, one would find that the surface of the fleshy blister was covered with densely packed pustules the size of sesame seeds. Whenever a pustule burst, spore gas would be released. With the efforts of these thousands of fleshy blisters, countless spores were born every moment and drifted up to the surface through the entrance, contributing to the expansion of the nest's domain.  In the center of the underground research facility, there was a mountain of flesh that resembled the roots of a giant tree, pulsating with fat fleshy blisters. As the heart of the nest, it was both the heart of the nest and its "central processor." The tendrils that spread from its base and crown were like data cables connecting the mainframe to the sub-machines.  In its belly, there was a coffin carved out of resin material, or rather, a "cultivation chamber." Unlike the flesh-red nest, this black cultivation chamber appeared to have a hard texture. Through the palm-sized translucent membrane, one could vaguely see a person lying inside. His eyes were open, fixated on the row of numbers on the translucent membrane.  【14731】  Four thousand of those were refugees and new soldiers that he had brought underground. More than three thousand were from his personal guard brigade and the underground research facility's researchers. The bulk of the seven thousand came from mercenaries and rioters who contributed in the chaos within the base, and the British had also contributed about six to seven hundred people just now.  Each person could contribute two units of organic matter, and he had already spent half of the organic matter on strengthening the nest and hatching alien species.  "Still not enough."  Lying in the cultivation tank, Carmen shook his head, beginning to reflect on whether his recent show-off had been a bit too much. If he had not wiped them out so decisively in one go, perhaps he could have given the British the illusion of "just about to win," tempting them to send more people into this pit, providing him with more organic matter to strengthen his power.  However, now, the British seemed to be much more cautious. Apart from continuously bombarding the area, they no longer sent people in.  Upgrading to a level two nest required five hundred thousand units of organic matter. There were two sources of organic matter: one was the most primitive photosynthesis, which would slowly increase just with time. The other was the fastest and most straightforward method, which was to keep eating.  By devouring living creatures and digesting their flesh, he could grow stronger. Carmen naturally preferred the latter method. If he relied only on photosynthesis to obtain organic matter from the soil and air, it would take centuries for the nest's domain to expand across the whole world.  But by relying on constant devouring, he could complete in just a few days what would take centuries to evolve. Thinking this, a hint of resentment flashed across Carmen's face. He had chosen this place as the nest because of the refugee camp next to the military base with a population close to five hundred thousand. If he devoured the population of the refugee camp and then ate the nearby Partak town, he would have already completed the first stage of evolution!  A level two nest would possess more terrifying energy. Not only would the hunting range of the alien species be extended to a hundred kilometers, but he would also unlock new "troop types." For example, a monster called the Flesh Mountain, which was said to be able to withstand tank shell fire with its fat alone.  However, his plan was completely ruined by the sudden appearance of Jiang Chen. Thinking of this, his teeth clenched tightly together, making a grinding noise.  Spores were his eyes and ears; he could clearly sense everything that happened within the spore-covered domain. He was sure that he had "seen" Jiang Chen in the military base that night, but unfortunately, he had not been able to keep him.  【Prompt, host, you are still far from the organic matter storage capacity of five hundred thousand. It is recommended to upgrade your troop types to transition through the early stages.】  An idea directly appeared in his mind, a suggestion from the nest. There was no need to use cumbersome vocal cords to speak, and there were no barriers in language and expression abilities; direct mind connection communication was incredibly convenient for Carmen.  This was also one of the reasons why, after seeing the greatness of biological civilization through the Golden Apple, he admired it so much.  【Upgrade troop types? You have a point.】Carmen replied with his thoughts, simultaneously closing his eyes to connect his consciousness with the nest's control center.  A simplified upgrade list appeared in front of him, and after careful selection, he allocated five thousand units of organic matter to strengthen the wings of the "Blade Warrior." The Blade Warrior, a name he had given to the mantis-like alien species, would have longer and more powerful wings after the enhancement, no longer serving merely as an aid to enhance jumping ability but as wings capable of short-distance flight.  As Carmen finished allocating the organic matter, indescribable fluids surged through the pipes towards the pile of eggs in front of the nest. With the input of organic matter, the eggs began to mutate, and so did the new "Blade Warriors" about to emerge from the eggs. These eggs were the incubators for hatching alien species, which to him were like "barracks."  At that moment, a violent tremor came from the ceiling. Carmen slightly lifted his eyelids, revealing a cold smirk. The soil above the shelter had been reinforced by the nest; fiber-like roots had woven a "bulletproof vest" in the soil, five hundred meters thick, with blast and earthquake resistance comparable to reinforced concrete.  The British army had dropped at least a hundred shells on his head, only scraping off a layer of cement surface. The reason the space-based weapons could blast open the entrance was merely because the nest was newly formed, and he had not yet had time to reinforce the entrance... Suddenly, his expression changed drastically, and at the same time, the consciousness of the nest also timely appeared in his mind.  【Warning, the protective layer has been impacted by external forces, part of the organizational structure has fractured, please host use organic matter for timely repairs.】  "Damn! It's the space-based weapons of Star Ring Trade!" Carmen cursed silently, realizing he had underestimated the power of Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons.  He had originally thought that a few tungsten core projectiles would at most scrape off a layer of the protective layer of the nest, but now it seemed to be more than just a layer. The damage to the protective layer required him to use organic matter for repairs, which, considering his already limited supply of organic matter, was a severe blow!  The amount of organic matter was being consumed visibly fast, and as Carmen frantically allocated organic matter to fill the gaps, a series of devastating breaking sounds came from above him.  Realizing what had happened, Carmen's face changed dramatically, and his facial muscles twisted violently.  "Fuck!"  (To be continued.) Chapter 1072: Force Breakthrough  Over forty armored vehicles entered the infection zone with impressive might. Just when everyone thought this would be a one-sided military show by the UK, the situation took a dramatic turn within a minute. No one knew how intense the firefight inside the infection zone was, but almost the entire world saw the outcome. Of the forty armored vehicles, only five returned, and all the infantry were left behind.  The long guns and cannons were at a disadvantage against a swarm of bugs, and Colonel Moston could hardly accept such an outcome. Not only could he not accept it, but the onlookers watching the disaster unfold on their cellphones were equally unable to accept this reality.  From Cagayan City to Tokyo, the term "biohazard" hammered away at the fragile nerves of people worldwide. A concept thought to exist only in literature and film was now brought into reality, easily garnering global attention and panic.  On social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Weibo, discussions about the X2 bacterium were incredibly heated.  "Last time it was the T-virus, this time it's the X2 bacterium? God, have those capitalists gone mad? How could researching such things benefit them? There should be laws to ban these dangerous studies!"  "Unbelievable, were those really British forces that went in? Are British armored vehicles made of paper? They're just mutants; why not just crush them with tank tracks? Can their teeth even bite through armor?"  "Survival manual for the apocalypse, learn from a ten-year doomsday enthusiast how to survive in the apocalypse, limited quantities, buy now while supplies last."  "Send in peacekeeping forces. This isn't a problem for just one country; it's a worldwide problem..."  "Now I'm really curious, does every Arrowhead Company military base have such a research facility?"  "..."  Colonel Moston couldn't see the situation on social media platforms for the moment. He was currently fretting over how to explain this disastrous defeat to the Ministry of Defence and Parliament.  An entire mechanized battalion had fallen without a fight! God, the Prime Minister was counting on him to settle this matter gracefully and bring Finland into NATO's family. But now, his face was ashen, and he lacked the courage to even devise a battle plan, let alone send more troops in.  Not to mention a brigade's mechanized force, even a division wouldn't be enough!  The Finnish government was desperate and half-threateningly stated that if they couldn't handle the nest's trouble, they would contact Star Ring Trade for a solution.  Moston scoffed at the Finnish government's statement because this was not a matter of combat power. Even armored vehicles could have holes melted in them by acid; could Star Ring Trade's mechanical exoskeletons be tougher than armored vehicles?  It was better to wait for scientists to thoroughly research what exactly the X2 bacterium was. Moston had a premonition that as long as they could develop something that could kill those spore clusters, the mutants would die off on their own.  "I admit that we underestimated the strength of the nest, and it was a mistake to rashly send troops into the infection zone," Moston explained to the media with a forced face. "The research team from London is studying the DNA structure of these spores, and I believe it won't be long before we can design a method to deactivate the X2 bacterium."  A reporter asked, "Colonel Moston, does this mean the UK will abandon military aid to Finland?"  "NATO will definitely not give up on any friendly partner, but this is no longer a problem that the UK can solve alone."  "..."  "God... Look! What is that!"  While Colonel Moston was busy explaining to the media, a cry of surprise suddenly came from the crowd around him. A female reporter looked up at the sky with a shocked expression, pointing in the direction of the infection zone.  "Fireballs" were falling from the sky. Even though several kilometers away, the sound of breaking the sound barrier was still clearly audible.  The cameras that had been pointed at Colonel Moston all turned toward that patch of sky. Almost simultaneously, an earth-shattering tremor spread from the feet of everyone present, shaking their eyes and hearts alike.  Unsurprisingly, this was the first time Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons appeared before the media's cameras.  Moston was relieved the cameras had shifted away. He was well aware that his facial expression at the moment must have been quite a sight.  ...  A hundred kilometers away in the presidential suite of the Hilton Hotel in Murmansk, Jiang Chen sat on the sofa with his leg crossed, looking down through the holographic screen, remotely commanding the battle between Star Ring Trade and the mutants.  The space-based weapons temporarily dispersed the spore clusters that shrouded the military base's exterior. After a round of bombardment, taking advantage of the brief gap, Jiang Chen saw the shattered ground through the satellite map on the holographic screen.  "Eh? It didn't collapse?"  Staring at the holographic screen, Jiang Chen exclaimed in surprise. Logically, even if the underground bunker was over five hundred meters deep, it should not have withstood the impact of the tungsten core projectiles. These tungsten spheres had fallen from geosynchronous orbit, and even if those five hundred meters were made of reinforced concrete, it should have turned into cement dust by now.  There was indeed something strange about this nest.  Jiang Chen's eyes flickered slightly as he gave Ivan the order.  "Keep bombing! If the first round doesn't work, launch the second round! Bomb until its true form is revealed!"  The mutants had strong regenerative abilities. Minor injuries only required a few breaths of spore-filled air to heal at a visible rate. Although the British military had bombed the military base multiple times, they hadn't truly killed many mutants. For humans, losing limbs might be fatal, but for these organized mutants, it was just a matter of lying in the nest for a while to recover. Even if they were blown up on the spot, dragging the bodies back for recycling into organic matter would allow new mutants to be hatched soon after. Moreover, most mutants were hiding underground.  Jiang Chen's battle plan was simple and brutal: fatigue tactics using space-based weapons to relentlessly bomb! As long as they could breach the defense, if one punch didn't kill, another punch would follow until the nest revealed its true form! The tungsten core projectiles weren't aimed at the mutants but at destroying the underground bunker. All the attacks were concentrated within a ten-meter diameter circle. No matter how strong the nest's recovery ability was, Star Ring Trade's space-based weapons were not to be underestimated. In terms of vertical penetration power, no country on this planet could catch up with them!  Jiang Chen didn't know that his straightforward and brutal plan was causing Carmen, hiding underground, to complain endlessly.  The first round, the second round... Rounds of tungsten core projectiles fell from geosynchronous orbit. Jiang Chen was burning money, while Carmen was burning organic matter. Both sides were bleeding internally, but clearly, Carmen, with limited resources, was more distressed.  Soon, the nest couldn't hold on any longer. How did Jiang Chen know? It was evident from the satellite imagery. As the dust settled, the soil layer was completely stripped away, revealing the tangled and intricate roots below. Undoubtedly, these sturdy roots were the reason for the underground bunker's solidity; the soil had the defensive power of concrete due to their reinforcement.  The nest released spore gas in vain, trying to cover its weakness, but Jiang Chen didn't miss this opportunity, ordering Ivan to pursue the victory. The strikes from geosynchronous orbit continued to fall, and when the electric ray C-1 in geosynchronous orbit dropped the last tungsten core projectile, the covering tentacles above the underground bunker also broke in response. The nest, with its defenses completely collapsed, revealed the flesh bubbles hiding in the underground bunker.  Seeing this, Jiang Chen knew the opportunity had arrived, immediately instructing Ivan.  "The nest has exposed its body; cease orbital weapon attacks. Transmit my orders, the Third Powered Armored Brigade, begin airborne operations!"  "Yes!" Ivan responded resoundingly.  The waterfall-like orbital strike ended—it had been a full fifteen minutes since it started. The journalists, soldiers, and townspeople standing near the town of Partak were still frozen in their stunned postures, looking up at the clear sky at a forty-five-degree angle.  Colonel Moston opened and closed his mouth without being able to utter a word. The Finnish Minister of Defense standing beside him had a dark face, full of regret for not asking Star Ring Trade to handle the situation from the start.  As for the journalists, they were already contemplating how to narrate this devastating "aerial bombardment" with eloquent words.  Everyone had not yet recovered from their astonishment. Just when everyone thought everything was over, rows of lights began to fall from the clear sky to the ground...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1073: Steel and Blood  For the onlookers standing in front of the Paltak town, it was only a blink of an eye before the roar of steel colliding with the earth came from several kilometers away. The executives of the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation quickly gave a cue to the reporters, and not long after, the broadcast helicopter took off again, heading towards the direction of the military base.  Not only were the media reporters interested in the orbital airborne brigade of Star Ring Trade, but even the British and Finnish military also dispatched two helicopters. Officially, it was to provide support to Star Ring Trade when necessary, but the real reason was understood by everyone without needing to be said.  Through satellite imagery, Jiang Chen saw all the little actions of Finland and the United Kingdom, but he did not take it to heart. Since he had brought out the powered armor, he did not intend to keep it a secret anymore. This "micro brigade" with only two hundred people had been in the works for two years. The reason for keeping it under wraps until now was partly because the surrounding small fry lacked combat strength, and it was not worth showing off the powered armor to flex muscles. It was better to keep it hidden as a trump card.  On the other hand, there was concern about sparking an arms race in the region, which would affect his grand plan for economic development. Now that he had brought it out, it was because the two concerns mentioned earlier no longer existed. As for why, that would be discussed after the end of the war.  Fifty drop pods fell one after another, and before the dust from the explosions had dispersed, two hundred fully armed T3 type powered armors, carrying tactical rifles, rushed out from the opened drop pods and stepped onto the battlefield covered in spores, gathering around the breach blasted by the space-based weapons.  Feeling the intrusion of uninvited guests, a piercing scream floated out from the deep pit. One after another, the "Blade Warriors" trembled their wings behind them, leaping out of the abyss. When the bombardment came, these aliens hid underground, but now, sensing the breath of living beings, they could no longer contain their bloodthirsty desire, eager to use their sharp claws to tear open the chests of their prey.  However, their plans were doomed to fail, as the opponents they faced this time were simply not on the same level as the previous weaklings.  With a roar, a Blade Warrior moved. Its bow-shaped legs sprang open, and the strengthened wings on its back powered up in an instant, with two serrated scimitars crossing like scissors, aiming to cut the nearest powered armor. If this blow landed, even steel would be torn open!  But at that moment, a transparent shield unfolded from the left arm of the powered armor. The Blade Warrior collided with the shield and failed to budge the powered armor, instead shattering its own double-edged blades made of keratin material. Its spindle-shaped beak opened and closed sharply, emitting a piercing scream.  The Blade Warrior protected its head with its arms and backed away, but before it could retreat two steps, the powered armor struck its defense with the shield and then grasped a tactical dagger with its right hand, stabbing it fiercely through the Blade Warrior's chest, and then tore downwards, splitting its intestines in two.  The clash happened in an instant. Carmen, lying in the hibernation pod, was dumbfounded. He had never seen such an incredible piece of iron, which reminded him of rumors about the Iron Man of Koro Island long ago. In fact, ever since the Los Angeles attack incident, there were rumors that Star Ring Trade had created a "steel suit of armor." There were even more unreliable rumors that Jiang Chen himself was the "Iron Man" who had appeared in Koro City, and his image greatly resembled the heir of Stark Industries.  Thinking of this, cold sweat involuntarily broke out on Carmen's forehead. Although he did not completely dismiss the rumors, he never imagined that Jiang Chen would not only create such a "steel suit of armor" for himself but also equip a whole army with such expensive gear.  Shocked as he was, he no longer had any other options to hesitate. The size of this force was not large, presumably, it was Star Ring Trade's ace, and an ace would surely be limited in number! As long as he could survive the initial development phase, the entire forest would be integrated into his hive mind.  To hurt Star Ring Trade, he would fill the gap with a sea of insects, and he had to keep this ace here at all costs—even if it meant paying a hefty price.  With determination, Carmen gritted his teeth and connected his consciousness with the hive mind. At almost the same time, the red blood vessels in the hive writhed like drilling mice, the meat blisters hiding in the shadows swelled violently, and pus blisters the size of sesame seeds swelled to the size of mung beans, then burst open, releasing spores containing a raging factor.  All the dark green eyes turned blood red in an instant.  With a roar tinged with brutality, all the Blade Warriors fell into a frenzy and threw themselves at the two hundred powered armors in a swarm. However, before they could get close, they ran into an oncoming barrage of fire.  In Jiang Chen's hands, the T3 type powered armors transported to the modern world had undergone functional differentiation to adapt to the modern battlefield. The most obvious difference was that the right arm was no longer uniformly equipped with a revolving machine gun but designed with various mountable accessories such as grenade launchers, foldable shields, and plasma cutters, based on battlefield needs.  The front row of powered armors knelt on one knee, placing a man-high shield in front, with the right arm emitting a faint blue arc of light. The powered armors in the back stepped forward, mounting the triangular-shaped gun barrels on their right arms, unleashing a barrage of fierce fire. There were also powered armors anchored to the ground with 72mm anti-vehicle cannons, tearing apart the alien formation with high-explosive shells.  In terms of firepower alone, this brigade of two hundred powered armors was already more than twice as strong as the nearly thousand-strong mechanized forces of the British army. Considering mobility, protection, and other comprehensive combat capabilities, Jiang Chen could say without exaggeration that, without using aerial strikes or other external support fire, these two hundred people could easily defeat a NATO infantry division.  The Blade Warriors at the front were shredded by the barrage, and those who got close were cut in two by the plasma cutters protruding from behind the shields. The keratin armor was invincible against bullets, but against the high-temperature plasma stream, it was as fragile as tofu.  Green blood splattered on the battlefield, mixed with the acid from the spitters. Carmen was determined to fight Star Ring Trade to the death and would not back down here. At this critical moment of life and death, he could no longer care about frugality; all organic matter was taken out, transformed into Blade Warriors and spitters, then pushed to the front lines.  The only advantage of the swarm was its fearlessness in the face of death. Under the interference of the hive will, even if it fought to the last alien, it would rush towards the muzzle without hesitation.  As the battle intensified, the distance between the two sides was quickly shortened to the extreme, turning from one-sided firepower suppression to close-range melee combat.  The powered armors were strong but not invincible, and casualties began to appear in the melee. Seeing this, a trace of joy appeared on Carmen's face. Following this trend, it would be Star Ring Trade that could not hold on first.  With this thought, he eagerly pressed all the organic matter forward. However, just at this moment, Carmen's mood plummeted from the peak to the valley, and his eager face gradually took on a layer of despair.  Through the eyes of a Blade Warrior, he saw a series of flashes in the sky. Star Ring Trade's second round of airdrops had begun. This time the drop was not people, but unmanned drone hives.  Before the airdrop began, the powered armors engaged with the aliens maintained their firing stance and retreated in an orderly manner, leaving enough battlefield space for the aliens crawling out of the deep pits. When they had almost retreated to the corner of the military base, several unmanned drone hives smashed into the rear of the alien army.  Thousands of drones swarmed out, rushing towards the wounds in the hive caused by the space-based weapons. When Carmen realized what was happening, it was already too late. The aliens underground had been mostly sent to the surface, leaving only those just emerging from the eggs in the underground shelters.  Although the number was still considerable, it was no longer enough to intercept the drones rushing in like a tide. Without engaging the aliens, these drones, without even firing a shot, ignored the aliens' attacks and pounced towards the bursting insect eggs.  Carmen's face turned green.  "Fuck!" Far away, a hundred kilometers from there, Jiang Chen suddenly sat up straight from the sofa, his fist slamming down hard on the coffee table.  "Blow it up!"  (To be continued.) Chapter 1074: A Swift End  The unmanned drone rushing toward the bug eggs suddenly exploded, covering row after row of wriggling eggs in a blaze, instantly blasting them into smithereens. The crimson and dark green blood plasma mixed together, splattering from the ruptured flesh bubbles, and along with chunks of flesh, were roasted into char under the high temperature.  Some of this blood belonged to the hive, and some to the yet unformed alien embryos.  Carmen, lying in the incubator, felt a chill from his head to his feet... if he could still feel the cold now. A sense of utter defeat surged in his heart. It felt as if you were on a high from a winning streak in an explosive battle, only to have your barracks destroyed by the enemy.  [Warning, large-scale damage to the hatching area, please repair immediately.]  The consciousness of the hive echoed in his mind, and Carmen quickly looked at the reserves of organic matter. However, this glance was startling; the glaring three-digit number caused his face to lose its last trace of color. Just now, he had allocated all the resources to the eggs for the incubation of Blade Warriors.  However, with the suicide attack by this group of drones taking advantage of a gap, he had lost a significant portion of his organic matter. It was possible to digest the remains on the ground, but to convert them into organic matter would take time, depending on the form of carbon present and the efficiency of the spores' photosynthesis.  Carmen was not clear on how long it would take, but several hours were certain. But would Star Ring Trade give him this time?  The speed of the exploding soldiers stopped, and the alien attack lost its momentum. The power armor brigade that had stabilized its position in the corner of the base began to counterattack under the command of the headquarters, striking at the faltering aliens!  On one side, the spitters were shredded by the barrage of fire, and on the other, Blade Warriors were sliced open by plasma cutting daggers, their corrosive dark green blood flying wildly, even washing away the paint on the power armors.  Thousands of aliens might look numerous, but without reinforcements, their annihilation was only a matter of time.  The clash of flesh and steel, the first confrontation between the harmonic civilization and the pure civilization, settled as the smoke and dust dispersed.  As the dust settled, no more aliens crawled out of the pit.  At the front of the troops, a power armor knelt on one knee, retracted its shield, supported itself on the ground with one hand, and slowly stood up.  "Shit, is it over?"  "It's finally over..." another soldier, shaking off the slime from his arm, answered in a muffled voice.  The battle was over, but no one took off their masks to breathe. High-density spore clusters still floated outside, which were quite dangerous even for those who had been injected with gene drugs.  Some stood waiting for orders, while others simply sat on the ground, not caring about the disgusting corpses of the aliens.  There was no cheering, only the relief of surviving disaster.  A total of forty T3 power armors were scrapped on the battlefield, and more than thirty people were killed in action. For the newly formed power armor brigade, this was a heavy loss, but relative to the results achieved, it was undoubtedly epic.  Nearly ten thousand aliens died under their barrage of fire. It's no exaggeration to say that even if a division from NATO was thrown into the fight, they probably couldn't have achieved such a bountiful result; the enemy numbers might even have increased the more they fought.  Walking to the front of the troops, the brigade commander glanced at his brothers. "Alright, guys, the mission isn't over yet. Let's go down and finish off this bug for good. Let me see..."  Saying this, he tapped a few times on the touchpad on his arm, controlling a reconnaissance drone to fly down into the deep pit. Before the drone was destroyed by the aliens, he saw the situation below and then said, "About thirty left. Who still has the strength to accompany me down there?"  A soldier stood up from the ground, supporting his rifle, and raised his hand. "I'll go, I can still move."  "Count me in."  The commander picked eleven people from the troops, leading this small team to the edge of the deep pit and jumped down with the vortex engine on their backs.  The twelve power armors landed, and the lurking Blade Warriors immediately pounced, ready for a desperate struggle.  The commander, with an unchanged expression, lifted his arm and casually caught the neck of one of the aliens, pulled out a pistol with his other hand, pressed it against its forehead, pulled the trigger, and then tossed the limp body aside.  The remaining dozen or so aliens, still at a distance, were shot into sieves by the rifles of the soldiers behind before they could even pounce.  Stepping over the bodies of the aliens, the soldiers clad in power armors reached the core of the hive. Here they saw the bug eggs blasted into a mess, along with the dark green and crimson fluids all over the ground.  "Shit, this thing is really disgusting."  "Finish it quickly, and we can get out of here."  Sappers took out blasting tools from behind and distributed thermite to the soldiers' hands, "The red end goes inside, drill it in deep."  Spores could extinguish fire, but the hive itself didn't have this feature. As long as the burning part was all stuffed into the core of the hive, it could effectively prevent the burning from being affected by the spore gas.  Watching everything that the Star Ring Trade soldiers were doing, panic emerged on Carmen's face.  When thermite was nailed onto the body of the hive, with eyes bloodshot, he roared, "No——!"  The soldier closest to him glanced at Carmen, smiled behind his mask, shook the thermite in his hand at Carmen, and then fiercely stabbed it into the core of the hive.  Brilliant flames leaked from the cracks, but most were sprayed inside. Under the scorching high temperatures, the core of the hive disintegrated at a visible rate.  Watching this scene, Carmen's heart bled. For this hive, he had sacrificed the researchers of the entire institute, his loyal guards, even his confidants.  Now, however, the people of Star Ring Trade were destroying it all right before his eyes.  Hatred, rage, fear... A mix of negative emotions blended together, his face twisted beyond recognition.  At that moment, the commander walked up to him, tapped on the resin material of the incubator with his finger, signaling Carmen to look this way.  Then, he took out a future phone from his waist, flattened it, and pasted it on the membrane of the incubator.  "We meet again."  Sitting in the presidential suite of the Hilton Hotel, Jiang Chen looked at Carmen lying in the incubator and smiled, "I didn't expect to meet in this way; it's really ironic."  Staring at Jiang Chen on the phone screen with bloodshot eyes, Carmen asked, "Are you here to laugh at me?"  "Yes and no."  Jiang Chen shook his head, looking at the fierce-faced Carmen in the incubator. He could no longer see any of the elegance and composure of an old noble, his tone carrying a bit of pity, "I'm just curious what made my opponent become like this."  Carmen didn't respond; his mind was already dominated by hatred.  At this moment, Jiang Chen noticed the black sphere above his head.  "The Golden Apple?"  His brows slightly furrowed, he vaguely recalled something from his encounters with the Rothschild family history. Members of their family seemed to be innately susceptible to the influence of Crey particles, able to sense external connections vaguely without the aid of objects, a capacity perhaps even Tanaka did not possess.  The universe is filled with chaotic Crey particle waves, just like electromagnetic waves. Carmen not only belonged to the type naturally sensitive to Crey particles but was also obsessed with the Golden Apple, even keeping this "Crey particle wave amplifier" by his bedside when he slept.  It was like placing a magnet on top of a TV set; it wouldn't take long for the TV to start showing distorted colors. To put it bluntly, he had gone mad.  Having analyzed this, Jiang Chen suddenly lost interest. The words he had intended to say to Carmen now seemed pointless. He sighed, turned off the communication window with Carmen, and ordered the commander.  "Give him a swift end."  "Yes."  The dark muzzle of the gun was pressed against the membrane of the incubator, and Carmen, stunned, looked at the gun pointed at his head.  Bang——!  The gunshot sounded, and without even a chance to cry out, his consciousness plunged into the abyss.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1075: The Pentagon's Concerns  The battle was not only watched by the British and Finns on the scene but also closely monitored by the United States from across the Atlantic. When the Star Ring Trade played the card of space-based weapons, everyone's face turned ashen. As the power armored brigade and unmanned aerial vehicle airdrop tactics emerged, the atmosphere in the Pentagon's meeting room dropped to an all-time low.  Though the footage captured by the British was not clear, those watching through the screens could still feel the terror of the surging alien species and how formidable the power armor was in holding off the alien onslaught. If the K1 exoskeleton could be compared to a bicycle, then the power armor was undoubtedly akin to a motorcycle. It not only provided soldiers with highly mobile armor but also served as a firepower support point, pushing individual combat capabilities to the limit.  Despite standing on the side of humanity, the last thing the U.S. Secretary of Defense wished to see was Star Ring Trade ultimately defeating the alien species. It would be preferable, as in a Hollywood script, for both the British and the citizens of the new country to fall before the aliens, with the U.S. Marine Corps stepping in as the savior to fight a war to save all of humanity.  The Secretary of Defense, Ashton Carter, kept praying that the swarm of insects would overwhelm the two hundred "humanoid armored vehicles," but reality did not comply with his wishes. The moment the drone swarm entered the alien nest, the fate of the alien species was sealed.  When the last Blade Warrior had its head severed by a plasma-cutting dagger, the meeting room fell silent. "These hypocrites, they go back on their word! They said there were only two orbital airborne brigades, and now how come there's another one?" a senior Pentagon official broke the silence and cursed.  Secretary Carter glanced at the officer and shook his head. Did you really believe them when they said there were only two orbital airborne brigades? The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has much more equipment that hasn't been disclosed. Blaming the intelligence work for not getting the news beforehand is inevitable. However, the Ghost Agent's domestic counterintelligence capability is simply too strong.  Long ago, the CIA tried to infiltrate Star Ring Trade to steal technology related to the space elevator, but every agent sent to the new country failed miserably, with some even vanishing off the face of the earth for going too far.  At this moment, Comrade Hillary, sitting at the conference table, suddenly spoke up. "More than the orbital airborne brigade and the power armor, I'm more concerned about their space-based weapons. If they can deliver tungsten core projectiles weighing dozens of tons over our heads at any time, it would pose a serious threat to the national security of the United States."  Everyone in attendance nodded. The 1966 Outer Space Treaty mentioned the prohibition of weapon development and "militarization" in outer space. However, in reality, vigorously developing military aerospace technology and space power to seize absolute air supremacy and strategic high ground for national security has long been a common strategic goal of major countries.  If the treaty were strictly adhered to, all high-orbit missiles should not exist, but is that possible?  After surveying the room, the CIA director cleared his throat and said, "Regarding their space-based weapons, we managed to get our hands on some tungsten core projectiles from Ukraine. According to technicians at the CIA, the technology for these space-based weapons is not complex, simply a tungsten alloy sphere the size of a watermelon, with a gyroscopic guidance component installed at its core."  "Imitating their weapons is easy," he said, pausing with a hint of helplessness on his face, "The key is how to get these tungsten spheres into geosynchronous orbit."  If they can't send these tungsten spheres to geosynchronous orbit at a reasonable cost, developing space-based weapons is utterly meaningless. "Exactly," said the military advisor from the White House with a wry smile, "If we use rockets to transport these things to geosynchronous orbit and then drop them, it's entirely redundant. Moreover, the dangerous thing about Star Ring Trade is that there is currently no international convention with enough binding force to limit the scale of private armaments. If they continue to expand their scale, we have no way to interfere."  Hearing this, Hillary tapped her fingers on the armrest of the sofa, pondering, "What if we now promote a relevant international convention?"  "We would likely become the biggest sacrifice," Secretary Carter said with difficulty, "You know, a significant portion of our annual defense budget is spent on military contractors. It's no exaggeration to say that they have become a part of the U.S. Army."  Including Hillary, the senior officials from the Pentagon and the White House fell into silence. If the White House clamps down on private military contractors, Wall Street would be the first to oppose. Messing with the military-industrial complex is like touching the wallets of all American consortia.  Notorious private military contractors like Blackwater, Triple Canopy, and DynCorp International all have intricate connections with Wall Street capital. Next year is the 20-year election, and whether one can sit here relies on winning the public's favor without offending the American consortiums too severely.  Now that Goldman Sachs has just fallen, other WASP consortia like Morgan Stanley and First Boston have already dominated the entire North American financial circle. No one wants to provoke those capital magnates at this time.  What should they do? Hillary frowned deeply in thought.  ...  The war was over, and after the destruction of the mother nest, the power armored brigade, under Jiang Chen's instruction, took control of the military base. Seeing the outcome decided, the commander of the British mechanized brigade arrived at the gate of the military base in a vehicle, applying to enter the military base to Star Ring Trade.  His reasons were well-prepared, such as "collecting the bodies of fallen soldiers" and "dragging out the wreckage of scrapped armored vehicles," but they were still rejected by Star Ring Trade.  The reason for the refusal was simple. There were no bodies to speak of; any creatures captured by the aliens would be devoured for flesh and blood at the first opportunity and brought into the mother nest as a high-quality supplement and a breeding ground for spores.  Star Ring Trade only promised to send over any dog tags with English letters they might find. This reason obviously did not satisfy the British. Collecting bodies was secondary; everyone knew that the bones of the dead were likely gnawed away. They were more interested in closely observing Star Ring Trade's power armor and collecting as much intelligence about this new type of equipment as possible.  Of course, apart from this factor, what they were most worried about was the X2 bacteria being appropriated by Star Ring Trade. The ferocious aliens had left such a deep impression that if someone were to use them for military purposes, the consequences would be unimaginable. The best way to overcome fear is to procure a portion for oneself, just like with nuclear weapons.  Determined, Brigade Commander Moston had no intention of withdrawing from the military base once they entered; he estimated that Star Ring Trade probably did not have the guts to directly confront Britain. Once the research team from London arrived, they would do whatever it took to figure out the formation mechanism of the mother nest, even if not for military purposes, at least to have a backup in their own country's sample repository, just in case.  However, Star Ring Trade unceremoniously refused them, declaring the entire military base as private property. Even Finnish officials coming forward to mediate were of no use; the president of Finland had already sold the nationalized Arrow Corporation assets to Star Ring Trade at a discounted price of 300 million new yuan when pleading for their military support.  Legally speaking, the agreement signed between the Arrow Corporation and the Finnish government naturally transitioned to Jiang Chen. For example, this military base now belonged to Star Ring Trade's private assets, protected by Finnish law.  The commander of the power armored brigade had no plans to negotiate with Moston, and the two soldiers guarding the gate sent him back. Even though Moston was extremely reluctant, he could only return to the military camp near the town of Paltak and report the news first to his superiors, waiting for the Ministry of Defense to decide.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1076: Right Beside Us  The night of battle had passed, and the sky at dawn the next day began to flutter with light snow. It was the end of May, nearing summer for the Northern Hemisphere, but this had nothing to do with the permafrost of northern Finland. Located within the Arctic Circle, if the Arctic Ocean monsoon occurred, locals could see traces of snow until the middle of June.  At this moment, above the military base next to Paltak, the flag of Star Ring Trade had already been hoisted. Due to multiple rounds of bombing, not a single intact building could be seen on the entire military base. After negotiations with the Finnish side, Star Ring Trade transported supplies to the base through Russia.  Logistics personnel and scientific research teams who arrived by plane at Murmansk followed up, setting up marching tents outside the military base. Unlike what Jiang Chen had seen in the apocalypse, these improved X2 bacteria had very strong survival abilities, and they could survive for quite a long time even without the queen nest.  Because of this, it was too risky to let them die out on their own. Without an injection of the gene drug, inhaling a certain amount of spore gas would lead to a "zombification" response in any organism. Especially in primates, it seemed that the more developed the brain of the organism, the more susceptible it was to these toxic bacteria.  After a logistics team of a thousand people arrived, Jiang Chen gave them their first order: to kill the spores floating in the air and eradicate all sources of infection. Although no drug had been developed to kill these spores, not everything had to be solved with technology.  These spores could put out fires, but conversely, since they sacrificed themselves to extinguish fires and now there was no queen nest to produce more spores, their fire-seeking properties would actually hasten their demise. There was no need for any special sterilization equipment; a flamethrower could produce unexpected, miraculous effects.  The entire military base was still shrouded in spores, with only soldiers in powered armor and logistics personnel in orange hazmat suits remaining inside.  The corpses of alien species were piled up a kilometer outside the military base and doused with gasoline for incineration. The dark column of smoke had been drifting from yesterday until the morning and had not yet dissipated. Even from the town of Paltak several kilometers away, it could be clearly seen.  Inside the command tent next to the military base, Colonel Klayman had already taken off his powered armor and was now wearing a heavy cold-proof uniform, standing in front of the command table, listening to the reports from his subordinates.  "...... The American Columbia Television station hopes to enter the military base to film the underground bunkers and the remnants of the queen nest."  "Tell them to seek permission from Star Ring Trade. We are soldiers; we don't have the authority to let them through," Klayman said impatiently.  This was already the fifth media outlet that had come to the gates of the camp. Now, the whole world's attention was focused on this military base, and almost everyone was concerned with the same issue: how Star Ring Trade planned to handle the aftermath.  "Additionally, this morning officials from the Finnish Presidential Office contacted us. The President hopes to have a dialogue with us regarding the disposal of the alien corpses. They hope we can come up with a more environmentally friendly solution, rather than burning them en masse."  Upon hearing his subordinate's report, Klayman raised his eyebrows. "Then go tell them to either accept our method or figure out their own way of handling these infection sources. If they need it, we can deliver it to the warehouse in the nearby town for free."  "Yes, sir." The officer saluted sharply and then turned to leave the command tent.  Klayman sat back down in his chair, planning to rest with his eyes closed. However, before his chair could get warm, an officer rushed into the command tent, pulling him from his half-asleep state.  The report was only six words short, and it didn't anger Klayman, who had been disturbed from his peaceful sleep.  The officer saluted sharply and said, "Report! The boss is coming."  ......  At noon, a helicopter flew over from the mountains and landed steadily on the helipad inside the military base. Jiang Chen, wearing a hazmat suit and a gas mask, jumped down from the helicopter.  Although he didn't need to wear these things and would be fine without them, the spore concentration outside was not low, so it was better not to be too shocking.  Following behind him was the director of the Russian Security Bureau, Balth, who was also tightly wrapped in a hazmat suit, looking around the messy base. Originally, Aisha was also supposed to come along, but considering that she wouldn't stay in Finland for two days, Jiang Chen asked her to return to Kolo Island first.  Wearing powered armor and stepping forward, Colonel Klayman saluted Jiang Chen.  Jiang Chen nodded at him approvingly. "Hard work."  "Not at all, not hard!" Klayman said with a grin.  Jiang Chen asked, "What's the situation underground?"  Klayman replied, "The queen nest has been confirmed dead, no live alien remnants. The logistics troops are still clearing the X2 bacteria, and the scientific research team from Kolo Island is investigating and sampling the queen nest's remains."  "Take us down to take a look."  "Yes, sir!" Klayman saluted sharply.  Following behind Klayman, Jiang Chen and Balth came to the edge of the huge pit in the center of the base. This used to be the entrance to the underground bunker, which was collapsed by Star Ring Trade's tungsten core bomb a few days ago. To facilitate cleaning personnel and the scientific research team's entry, the supporting logistics troops built a simple elevator here.  After stepping on it, the three of them reached the entrance to the underground bunker, which was 500 meters below.  "Is this the interior of the queen nest? The flesh bubbles on the wall are really disgusting." Balth glanced at the remnants on the wall and showed a look of disgust.  "You can think of it that way. Before the core was destroyed, the queen nest had already constructed the entire underground bunker into its own nest," explained Jiang Chen.  Not far away, researchers were taking samples from the remnants of the insect eggs. The unheard DNA codes and forms of existence of these organisms were completely overturning these scholars' understanding of biology.  Everyone gave their utmost effort, pouring their passion for science into these precious samples. For the entire human civilization, these were valuable data.  Regarding the Harmonious Civilization, Jiang Chen only glimpsed a shadow of it from afar, saying he knew nothing about it was not an exaggeration. He didn't expect to find out any weaknesses of the Harmonious Civilization from the remains of the queen nest, but for now, this was the only means for Earth's civilization to understand them.  Because they were wearing hazmat suits, no one recognized Jiang Chen's identity along the way. After saluting Klayman, the standing soldiers let them pass. In this way, accompanied by Klayman, the two unassumingly arrived next to the remnants of the queen nest's core and stood still.  Gazing at the pitiful remains, Balth glanced at the resin-like "coffin" and saw a familiar face through the broken membrane.  "Carmen Rothschild?"  "That's right."  "You really killed him."  Balth smacked his lips, "If you ask me, the International Court of Justice would have been his best destination."  "Keeping him would be a trouble," Jiang Chen said indifferently.  He was unsure what the Harmonious Civilization had revealed to him, but if those insects informed him about his ability to traverse, it would ultimately be a problem. Now the Rothschild family had produced at least tens of thousands of golden apples, which were a threat to him and human civilization.  And now, his presence here was to eliminate this threat!  Jiang Chen gestured to Klayman standing beside him, then pointed to the head of the resin coffin. Klayman understood, pulled out his tactical knife, cut open the resin surface, reached in with his steel hand, and pulled out a black sphere.  Seeing that black sphere, Balth's expression became somewhat subtle.  "Golden apple," taking the black ball from Klayman, Jiang Chen weighed it in his hand, "We have always thought it was a tool for communicating with the future, but in fact, it's not like that."  "Communication is only their basic ability; their true ability is brainwashing. They subtly infect their owners and turn them into their minions. Whether it was the previous Tanaka or the current Carmen, essentially, they are the same type of people."  Saying that, Jiang Chen pretended to disdainfully toss the golden apple back to Klayman, signaling him to stuff that thing back in.  Through the hazmat suit, he couldn't see Balth's expression, but years of experience in deceiving people told him that he had probably achieved his goal.  The German revolution was about to succeed, and Russia certainly obtained these golden apples from the rebels; if they referred to some intelligence and repeatedly experimented with these things, they might actually figure something out.  Jiang Chen had to administer a vaccine to them before they understood how to use the golden apples. To make them fear these things.  "The most fatal thing is that the biological civilization that the golden apples communicate with is not from the future."  After a pause, Jiang Chen looked meaningfully at Balth. "But right beside us."  (To be continued.) Chapter 1077: The Highly Effective Recruitment Advertisement  Long before the Munich incident, Carmen had seized control of the entire Rothschild family's power through a series of means. After using Xinghuan Trade's hand to deal with his own brother James in the Pearson Church massacre, the family was basically at his sole command. Therefore, with his death, it could be said that the Rothschild family was finished.  Jiang Chen could foresee that once the revolution in Germany succeeded, the first thing the Christian Democratic Union would do after ousting the New Choice Party would be to settle scores with the Freemasons for the "crimes" committed during the New Choice Party's governance. Without any surprises, the assets of the Rothschilds and several other families in Germany would be auctioned by banks to pay off the hefty fines issued by the courts.  It was foreseeable that in the coming period, even if Jiang Chen did nothing, the Rothschild family would inevitably decline in the frenzy of asset division. They were just too rich. And also too weak.  Jiang Chen wasn't worried at all about them dying out too slowly. The only thing that concerned him was the golden apples that were originally controlled by the Rothschilds. If they were only in Carmen's hands, it would still be fine, but now that Carmen was dead, these golden apples would inevitably fall into others' hands.  Not just Russia, Jiang Chen believed that the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and even Huaguo on the other side of the Earth, would certainly be interested in these things, and various forces would try their best to get one or two back for research.  The Harmonious Civilization had already mastered the communication channel of the golden apples. If the higher-ups of various countries failed to realize the danger within, it was hard to say where the next Hive would be born.  Sitting on the plane back to Moscow, Baltar was continuously pondering the conversation he had with Jiang Chen in the underground shelter that day, as well as what he had witnessed inside the Hive...  "...Are you saying that this is the product of an extraterrestrial civilization?" Baltar still couldn't believe the facts that Jiang Chen had explained to him. His eyebrows were tightly furrowed, looking at Carmen lying in the resin coffin, "And the golden apple is just a brainwashing tool?"  "That's right," Jiang Chen nodded.  "Unbelievable."  "I know, it sounds like an April Fool's joke, but that's the fact. On June 15, we will hold an Outer Space Security Summit in Ke Luo City, where we will reveal all the evidence we have collected about extraterrestrial civilizations in our space activities. I have told you openly what I already know; whether you take it seriously or not, the choice is yours."  Overwhelmed by the large amount of information, Baltar was stunned on the spot. Extraterrestrial civilization? What a joke! Baltar still couldn't believe it, even though Jiang Chen had alluded to it in Murmansk last time.  The golden apple that the Russian Security Bureau had finally obtained was actually part of an alien conspiracy to invade Earth? He really couldn't believe that such a plot, which would only appear on the big Hollywood screen, was happening right before his eyes.  However, when he recalled the serious expression on Jiang Chen's face, doubts started to creep into his heart again. If the golden apple was truly a brainwashing tool that could turn its holder into a lackey of an extraterrestrial civilization without anyone noticing, then it was indeed a dangerous thing.  After all, no one could tell who had been brainwashed, and those who had been brainwashed would not voluntarily come forward to admit it. If a brainwashed person unwittingly built a Hive within Russian territory...  Thinking of this, a drop of cold sweat slid down his forehead. Thinking carefully, the golden apple had changed hands several times from the resistance to the Russian Security Bureau.  Realizing the severity of the issue, Baltar made up his mind. At least wait until June 15 to see what evidence Xinghuan Trade can present. Before that, the golden apples should be sealed and kept away from anyone's reach. If they were as dangerous as he said, it wouldn't be too late to destroy them then.  ...  Through the lens of the Finnish National Broadcasting Corporation, Xinghuan Trade's orbital weapons and the cool power armors were broadcast to every corner of the world. Those who had been pessimistic about the alien species due to the British army's tragic defeat were also reignited with hope by the victorious battle of two hundred against ten thousand.  The demon-like ugly aliens fell one after another in front of the steel armors, their dark green blood dismembered under clusters of orange-yellow trajectories, especially during the final close combat, which was incredibly exhilarating to watch.  "That's awesome, are those two hundred Gundams? Or two hundred Iron Men? I just want to ask if joining Xinghuan Trade means I have the chance to wear that thing? If so, I'll go sign up for the foreign legion on the official website right now."  "@Robert Downey Jr., what do you think?"  "That model with the laser blade on the right arm is simply too much to my liking! Look at that move slicing the alien in half, it's just too cool. It's a pity the footage is too blurry; it would've been better if the Finnish TV station's camera was clearer."  Aside from those non-nutritious comments on social media, a discussion about the practicality of such weaponry also erupted on some military forums.  The military enthusiasts were divided into two camps, one believed that this so-called power armor could change the modern warfare landscape, and the other thought there was no need to make such a fuss.  "This individual armor reminds me of the bulletproof armor from World War I, just with a machine gun attached to the arm? I think there's nothing surprising, it's just a mechanical exoskeleton with a layer of steel. Instead of developing a piece of iron that wraps the whole person up, it's better to produce more tanks or armored vehicles."  "The person above is thinking too simply. How did the British mechanized brigade go in and how did it come out? Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth! Infantry with protection, mobility, support capabilities, and even anti-armor capabilities will become omnipotent Rambos on the battlefield! And it's the kind that can be mass-produced! As for welding steel plates on the outside of a mechanical exoskeleton equals power armor, are you talking about Krupp's 'Lightning' series? Don't compare it with the products of future military industries, they are not on the same level!"  Of course, not all public opinion was developing in a direction favorable to Xinghuan Trade. With the threat of the second "Biohazard" removed, people couldn't help but start to reflect on another issue after breathing a sigh of relief. If Xinghuan Trade could deploy a power armor brigade with combat power comparable to a division anywhere in the world within hours, then what was the meaning of borders?  Instigated by those with ulterior motives, numerous pacifists in major cities like New York and Los Angeles spontaneously held protests and rallies, protesting against Xinghuan Trade's repeated military use of outer space.  However, these protests did not gain much momentum. Even though the mainstream media in Western countries, representing the interests of the elite class, mostly agreed with these protestors, the public opinion on the internet was clearly biased towards Xinghuan Trade.  Since he had been busy discussing "compensation" with the Finnish government these days, Jiang Chen had not been paying attention to the internet. It was only when he was transferring flights at Moscow airport that he realized the power armor brigade of Xinghuan Trade had unexpectedly become popular.  This result was somewhat unexpected for Jiang Chen. He had anticipated that the power armor would attract widespread attention from governments around the world, but he did not expect it to cause such a sensation among the public.  Jiang Chen was still unclear about what kind of impact it would have, but one thing was certain. The high-definition video from the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation was like a free recruitment advertisement for Xinghuan Trade, and a highly effective one at that...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1078: Drive Carefully  Several days have passed since the military operation to clear out the Star Ring Trade's nest, and the White House and the Pentagon have held numerous meetings, both large and small, regarding the Star Ring Trade.  "...I don't care how you do it, but within three days, I want to see DARPA initiate a project on developing powered armor, separating it from the exoskeleton project. Don't worry about the budget; I will discuss it with Congress. According to the Secretary of Defense's opinion, the positioning of this powered armor is tentatively set as an infantry squad's fire support point. Besides having at least a fifty-kilogram ammunition load and NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) protection capabilities, it must also provide absolute protection against ammunition calibers below 12.7mm..."  At this moment, inside a small conference room in the White House, Hillary was having a one-on-one meeting with the director of DARPA. DARPA is an abbreviation for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as the real-life version of S.H.I.E.L.D. In many defense and aerospace projects, DARPA's influence can be seen, including the Faraday spray that restricts EMP weapons, which was co-designed by DARPA and Lockheed Martin.  Star Ring Trade had already surpassed the United States in defense technology, and Hillary had no choice but to pin her hopes on DARPA.  After carefully noting Hillary's requirements, the DARPA director twirled his ballpoint pen twice and lightly tapped it on his notebook.  "We will expedite the project initiation. Lockheed Martin has already made good progress in the research of exoskeletons, and we have existing technological resources that we can utilize. Additionally, I suggest negotiating with Germany to see if we can obtain information about the 'Lightning' exoskeleton improvement model from the Krupp Group, as they have clearly already developed a prototype of powered armor, though it is still somewhat lacking in design."  "I will have Kerry talk to them," Hillary said.  After exchanging some details with the First Lady, the DARPA director closed his notebook and stood up to leave. There were still several meetings waiting for him, and he had to prepare the proposal within two days to catch the Congressional budget committee's hearing on the third day. Such a research and development project involving hundreds of millions of dollars could not be decided by his signature alone.  As he was about to open the door to leave, the conference room door was pushed open, and a White House assistant entered with a document.  "First Lady."  Hillary looked at her assistant and asked seriously, "What is it?"  "The new head of state has sent us an invitation."  The assistant walked to Hillary's side and placed the document on the table, "It's an invitation to attend the Outer Space Security Summit on June 15th."  "Outer Space Security Summit?" Hillary scoffed, her crow's feet wrinkling. How dare Star Ring Trade hold an Outer Space Security Summit? Who exactly is using space resources for weapon development?  "Write a polite letter of refusal for me. Say that the American side regrets Star Ring Trade's violation of the 'Outer Space Treaty.' Until Star Ring Trade and the new state provide an explanation, we will not initiate high-level bilateral talks with the new state."  "Yes." The assistant nodded and left.  Leaning back in her chair, Hillary rubbed her tired eyes. There was another meeting in ten minutes. Just as she was about to sneak in a nap, she caught a glimpse of the invitation out of the corner of her eye. After hesitating for a moment, she reached into the document bag and took out the invitation, following diplomatic etiquette.  As her gaze quickly passed over a couple of lines, Hillary suddenly froze upon catching a keyword. "Extraterrestrial civilization?"  Reading down the invitation, Hillary's expression changed continuously. When she reached the last line, she threw the invitation onto the table, stood up, and hurried out the door.  ...  On the morning of June 1st, a Gulfstream jet landed at the airport in Korolo City. Surrounded by a group of bodyguards, Jiang Chen yawned as he passed through the special passage and arrived at his Rurka sedan. After the bodyguard opened the car door, he sat in the passenger seat.  Aisha started the car skillfully from the driver's seat, pressed the button to activate the magnetic levitation system after reaching the initial speed, and the car steadily took off. The main traffic arteries in downtown Korolo City have already been converted to magnetic levitation, and almost half of the private cars are floating in mid-air.  The endless stream of traffic complemented the neon lights on both sides of the street. Against the backdrop of skyscrapers and the lights of thousands of homes, the entire city looked like a dazzling gem, dreamy and beautiful. It was hard to imagine what it looked like four years ago.  On the car ride, Jiang Chen unexpectedly received a call from Warner Bros. Christopher Nolan, who had previously worked with him, contacted him proactively, stating that Warner Bros. was very interested in bringing the battle between humans and aliens to a "bigger" screen. He wanted to gauge Jiang Chen's opinion to see if Star Ring Trade could offer some assistance during filming.  Considering the positive publicity for Star Ring Trade, Jiang Chen happily accepted Warner Bros.' proposal, stating that as long as Star Ring Trade played a positive role in the film, they could provide help with the filming for free.  After hanging up the phone, Jiang Chen put away the holographic screen and stretched. After taking two flights in a row, he hadn't fully adjusted to the timezone, and he felt groggy.  Aisha glanced at Jiang Chen with some concern and whispered, "How was it in Finland?"  "Not bad, just busy with work."  "Did you meet Natasha?"  "I saw her before boarding the plane; she invited me to dinner."  Jiang Chen turned to look at Aisha, who was focused on driving, and smiled. His hand, which had been resting above his head, naturally wrapped around her slender and toned waist.  "Don't always ask about me. Did you miss me these past few days?"  Her cheeks blushing, Aisha whispered, "I thought about you every day."  Feeling the restless movements of that hand, Aisha fidgeted uncomfortably but did not resist. Jiang Chen was not worried about a traffic accident at all; magnetic levitation driving was at least ten times safer than driving on the road. The altitude-restricted lanes were controlled by intelligent programs that maintained a specific speed. Once entering the highest cruising lane, one could completely let go of the steering wheel and leave the driving entirely to the intelligent program.  Initially, Jiang Chen was just wrapping his arm around her waist, but he soon became more audacious. However, the little lamb was too compliant, allowing his hand to continue moving upward...  Biting her lower lip, unable to contain her feelings any longer, Aisha turned the car onto the cruising lane and handed over the driving completely to the intelligent system. Her hands left the steering wheel, and she agilely turned around to straddle Jiang Chen's legs.  Wrapping her arms around Jiang Chen's neck, Aisha blinked her clear, large eyes, her sapphire-like pupils staring straight into his.  Being so intently gazed at, it was Jiang Chen, who had been restless earlier, who became somewhat embarrassed.  "Uh, drive carefully—"  Before he could finish, his lips were sealed by hot and delicate ones, a silky and tender little snake breached his teeth and invaded, and a pair of cool, gentle hands wandered down his toned arms...  Through the dark-tinted glass, the colorful street scenery whizzed past the two of them. In this moment and setting, everything seemed to happen as naturally as water flows into a channel.  Jiang Chen felt that the fatigue accumulated over the past few days was dissipating with the warmth of their skin contact. In the dazzling night, a scene of speed and passion was unfolding...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1079: The End of the War  Looking up at the wall clock for the third time, Xia Shiyu let out a deep sigh and muttered softly, "Why hasn't he come back yet?" Half an hour ago, Aisha drove to the airport to pick up Jiang Chen and bring him home, so she took a shower in the bathroom.  It was summer, and the weather was quite hot. After taking a shower, Xia Shiyu didn't immediately put on clothes. Instead, she wrapped her wet hair in a white towel and sat on the living room sofa wearing a bath towel.  Imagining Jiang Chen looking at her with a flushed face and breathing rapidly, the corners of Xia Shiyu's mouth couldn't help but curve into a faint smile.  Suddenly realizing she was thinking about something quite embarrassing, Xia Shiyu's face turned red, she coughed lightly while clenching her fists, took a few deep breaths to calm herself, and regained her composed, pure, and elegant demeanor.  However, her gaze that couldn't help but look outside the window, along with the love and anticipation twinkling in her eyes, revealed her excited state of mind.  Time passed by minute by minute, and it was already past one o'clock. Looking at the wall clock again, Xia Shiyu's calm expression gradually faded, and she began to worry.  "Could it be a traffic jam... Impossible, how could a maglev car get stuck in traffic. Could something have happened on the road?"  Thinking this, Xia Shiyu couldn't sit still anymore. She quickly picked up her mobile phone from the coffee table and called Jiang Chen. The phone rang for a long time, but no one answered.  Then she called Aisha, but the phone was turned off.  Xia Shiyu became anxious.  Just as she stood up to change clothes and go out to check, the sound of the door opening finally came from outside the villa. The car lights flickered slightly, and the familiar Rurka car drove into the garage, and soon two people pushed the door and walked into the living room.  Seeing the two of them return safely, Xia Shiyu breathed a sigh of relief, walked up to them, and looked at Jiang Chen with some reproach. "Why did you come back so late?"  Jiang Chen smiled embarrassingly, "We were delayed on the road for a while, why haven't you gone to sleep?"  Xia Shiyu looked at Jiang Chen suspiciously.  It wasn't right. Normally, when he saw her wrapped in a bath towel, he would definitely have an unnatural reaction, but his current demeanor was too calm.  Little did she know that Jiang Chen, who had just completed a "four-shot burst," was now in sage mode. Even if they were to bathe together, he wouldn't have any strange reactions.  Unaware of what Xia Shiyu was wondering about, and feeling a bit uneasy under that suspicious gaze, Jiang Chen touched his face and whispered, "Is there something on my face?"  Xia Shiyu shook her head, then turned her gaze to Aisha.  Aisha's face was flushed, and she shyly shifted her gaze away.  Realizing the situation, Jiang Chen thought to himself, 'Damn it!'  Sure enough, Xia Shiyu immediately understood something. She walked smilingly to Jiang Chen's side and "gently" took hold of his arm.  "There is indeed something. Let me take a look for you."  The fragrance of lilacs entered Jiang Chen's nose, and the moist hair still covered in mist, as his gaze followed along her beautiful face down to a patch of deep and fair skin.  Feeling the beauty clinging so closely, Jiang Chen painfully and happily reacted.  "There is indeed quite a bit," Xia Shiyu said, seriously examining Jiang Chen's side profile and nodding as if it were a big deal. With a jealous gaze at Aisha and a "murderous" smile on her face, she said, "Let's go upstairs, I'll help you clean up thoroughly~"  After that, Xia Shiyu pulled at the bath towel in front of her chest with one hand and pulled Jiang Chen's arm with the other, quickly walking upstairs.  Jiang Chen, not sure whether to cry or laugh, gave Aisha a look of distress. However, the young girl just mourned for him silently in her heart for a second and then hummed a light tune as she ran to the upstairs bathroom.  It was already very hot in Kolo City during summer, and now she was sticky all over. She couldn't wait to take a shower and then go back to her bedroom to sleep beautifully.  ...  It wasn't until noon that Jiang Chen rubbed his sleepy eyes and sat up from the bed. The beauty who had slept in his arms last night had already gotten up and left.  As the old saying goes, there is only a dead ox, not a plowed field. Last night, he had used all his skills to play with Xia Shiyu until she begged for mercy with an exhausted body, but he didn't expect this dedicated female CEO to still be able to get up on time to go to work the next day.  Thinking of this, Jiang Chen shook his head and smiled, pulled off the air conditioner blanket, and got out of bed.  Hearing the movement in the bedroom, the well-behaved Aisha came in with clothes, gently helped Jiang Chen get dressed, and softly asked in his ear, "Do you have any plans for today?"  "Yes," Jiang Chen stroked Aisha's hair, "I'll spend the whole day with you two."  Enjoying the warm hand, Aisha smiled gently and softly said, "Spend more time with Sister Shiyu. She's always waiting for you at home alone, and I occasionally have the chance to go out with you. Although she rarely says it, I can feel that her love for you is no less than mine."  Looking into those clear eyes, Jiang Chen suddenly felt a bit sorry for her. He was about to say something, but a soft finger gently pressed against his lips.  "Say nothing."  After whispering softly, Aisha tiptoed and gave him a light kiss on the lips. With loving eyes, she reached out to straighten his collar.  "Let's get ready for lunch."  Looking at the lovely face close at hand, Jiang Chen's heart rippled slightly and couldn't help but wrap his arms around her waist, whispering in her ear, "Can I eat you first?"  "No, you still have to go to the company in the afternoon."  Lowering her head and gently touching Jiang Chen's chest with her forehead, Aisha softly said, "Don't delay the important matters, or Sister Shiyu will get jealous again."  Although Jiang Chen was sure that if he insisted, Aisha would not resist, considering Xia Shiyu's jealousy and the "harmony of the harem," he decided to follow the young girl's advice.  After having lunch together, Jiang Chen rested on the sofa for a while and then drove to the company.  Taking the elevator to the top floor, Jiang Chen greeted Xia Shiyu as he passed by her door.  Although she didn't show any response, Jiang Chen could clearly feel that seeing him appear here in the afternoon made Xia Shiyu very happy.  What she cared about wasn't whether Jiang Chen was dedicated to his work—she was already used to handling those heavy tasks for Jiang Chen—but whether he was willing to spend more time with her.  She didn't ask for the affection Jiang Chen poured on her to be more than that for Aisha, who had accompanied him through life and death. She just hoped that in terms of feelings, she wouldn't be too far behind...  Sitting down in his own office, Jiang Chen had his beautiful secretary make him a cup of coffee and casually asked to call CEO David Smith of Future People Bank from downstairs.  Soon, Mr. Smith appeared in front of his desk.  Since it was working hours, Jiang Chen didn't bother with small talk and gave his orders straight to the point.  "Within three days, I want to see 150 billion new yuan of funds that can be freely used on the books of Future People Bank. Also, upload the research reports of Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen Group to my mailbox. Oh, and make a list of German companies that are at the top in the electrical industry and send it to my mailbox as well."  After hearing Jiang Chen's words, the word "surprised" was clearly written on Smith's face.  As a senior financial professional, he was aware of any slight movement related to capital on the international stage.  Without Jiang Chen mentioning it, Future People Bank was already preparing to buy at the bottom of the European economy, with liquid funds ready. Now his team was only researching where to start for higher returns and where to start for higher success rates.  Companies like Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen, which have the technology and market prospects, are naturally the first choice for investment.  The only thing is that it's not something you can buy if you want to. Even if you can offer twice the premium, it still depends on whether the German government is willing to sell to you.  However, Smith never expected that his boss was so capable that he could even swallow up pillars of the German automobile industry like Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen. Would the German government just watch as their pillar industries get taken away by foreign capital?  "No problem." Despite the surprise, Smith had no choice but to nod and agree without another word.  "Then hurry up."  "Yes."  After Smith left, Jiang Chen took the mocha coffee from his beautiful secretary's hand, leaned back in his chair, and savored it contentedly.  The war was over, the money was spent, and the blood was almost drained.  The German revolution was on the eve of victory, Carmen died in Finland, and the Freemasonry led by the Rothschild family was powerless to return to heaven.  Now comes the climax of the entire war.  It's time to divide the spoils!  (To be continued.) Chapter 1080: Crazy Acquisition  In the city of Bremen in northwestern Germany, inside a budget hotel, a man of Germanic descent was hurriedly packing his luggage. Perhaps because he was too flustered, he accidentally knocked his mobile phone off the table onto the floor. Seeing this, he quickly bent down to pick up the phone, cursing as he stuffed it into his pocket.  "That damned Carmen, always causing more problems than solving! How did I ever get on his ship... Damn it!"  While cursing, he closed his packed suitcase and quickly headed towards the door.  Karl-Friedrich Krupp, this was once a resounding name in Germany's high society.  However, now he was living like a rat crossing the street, wearing clothes worth a hundred euros, staying in a cheap budget hotel, and even having to wear sunglasses and a baseball cap when going out, afraid that someone would recognize him.  For some reason, he suddenly missed his brother, Glauner Krupp, the man who strongly opposed joining forces with the Rothschild family, once the backbone of the entire Krupp family.  If he hadn't been blinded by power and had reminded his brother to be wary of Carmen that night, perhaps the Krupp family would have had a different outcome today.  Stepping onto the elevator, he shook his head vigorously, dismissing those unrealistic thoughts. Pondering such issues, other than causing himself distress, was of no benefit.  After adjusting his emotions and watching the descending floor numbers at the elevator door, a glimmer of hope slowly kindled in Karl-Friedrich's heart.  As long as he could successfully escape to South America, hide there for a while, wait until the storm passed, and then quietly move the money he had in the Cayman Islands through offshore companies, he could still continue to be a wealthy man in South America.  One hundred million dollars, if used sparingly, would be enough for the rest of his life.  As for the mess left by the Krupp family, he had two younger brothers and a sister who could deal with it as they wished!  When the elevator reached the first floor, Karl-Friedrich breathed a sigh of relief and walked out with his carry-on luggage. However, at that moment, four men dressed in black suits also noticed him, rising from their seats and converging towards him from four different directions in the hotel lobby.  Realizing he had been targeted, Karl-Friedrich's face was instantly stricken with panic.  Just as he thought about turning to run, he found that his retreat was already cut off, and there was no escape.  In a matter of seconds, he was surrounded by the four men in black.  The man standing directly in front of him took out a document from his chest pocket and said expressionlessly, "Hello, may I ask if you are Mr. Karl-Friedrich?"  "You must be mistaken..." Karl-Friedrich said nervously, "I am Francis Oder, a food processing entrepreneur from South America. I'm just here in Germany for an inspection..."  However, the man paid no attention to his excuses and continued, "We are agents from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Mr. Karl-Friedrich, you are currently facing at least twenty charges, including treason. Please come with us."  Karl-Friedrich panicked and suddenly lunged at the man beside him, trying to escape. However, his slight frame was no match for the battle-hardened agent; the man beside him didn't even move and casually restrained his hands.  "No! I'm not going anywhere! I have a plane to catch! Help! Someone here..."  While struggling desperately, Karl-Friedrich screamed shrilly, his face covered in snot and saliva, looking as miserable as could be.  Seeing that Karl-Friedrich had no intention of cooperating, the agent from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution stopped wasting words, signaled to his assistant with a hand gesture, and said cleanly, "Take him away."  "Yes!"  ...  On June 3, the German People's Liberation Front nonviolently marched into Berlin, and the citizens of Berlin welcomed them along the streets. This revolution, which had lasted for months, came to a victorious end after a month of armed struggle.  On June 5, the exiled government led by Evelyn returned from Russia to the Prime Minister's Office in Berlin, ending years of exile. As the leader of the Christian Democratic Union, he stood before all the German people and was sworn in as Chancellor.  On the same afternoon, 27 members of the New Choice Party were charged with multiple crimes, including war crimes and anti-federal constitutional crimes, and faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole.  At the same time, several European enterprises including the Rothschild Bank and the Krupp Group, suspected of providing substantial political donations to the New Choice Party, were prosecuted by the German government. The Supreme Court immediately froze their assets in Germany and initiated the trial process expeditiously.  If convicted, the Rothschild Bank might be fined a staggering one trillion euros. There was no doubt that the Rothschild family could not come up with that much money, and Evelyn had no intention of taking their money.  Once the sentence was delivered, shares of various companies held by the Rothschild Bank would be nationalized by Germany and auctioned off through several banks. The auction proceeds would be collected by the treasury to rejuvenate Germany's economy, which had been stalled by the revolution.  As per the agreement, Jiang Chen acquired a 20% premium from the German government to purchase shares of Daimler, Volkswagen, and BMW, replacing the Rothschild and other European financial groups to become the largest shareholder of these three top automotive groups.  The euro continued to fall as expectations for EU integration collapsed. The euro even dropped to a low of 1:3 against the new yuan, with 150 billion new yuan converted into euros, ultimately trading at 400 billion euros on the foreign exchange market.  Of this, 200 billion euros was a loan from the Future People's Bank to the German Central Bank, 100 billion euros was used to acquire 37% of Volkswagen, 41% of Daimler, and 39% of BMW, and another 100 billion euros was an impromptu investment by Jiang Chen in five electrical industrial companies including Siemens and Bosch.  In this feast of division targeting European financial groups, Jiang Chen's Future People's Group emerged as the biggest winner.  Germany's two mainstay industries were now branded with the label of the Future People's Group.  Originally, Jiang Chen had also planned to acquire the Krupp Group, but this time Evelyn was not as amenable as before. Exaggeration aside, Krupp was the heart of German industry; even though they sided with the wrong team in the New Choice Party, the German Supreme Court did not impose excessive punishment on them.  Moreover, the Krupp Group was a traditional Prussian nobility, not Jewish, and had never entered the core of the Freemasons. After the new family head took over, the Krupp Group firmly stood on the side of the victors, clearly severing ties with the Rothschild family and the Freemasons.  Evelyn decided not to pursue further, and thus, this chapter was turned over.  The EU integration process did not even last a hundred days before this farce ended abruptly with Carmen's death...  (To be continued.) Chapter 1081: Another Possibility  As the heart of the European Union, the victory of the revolution in Germany inspired the European people who were living in dire straits. The collapse of the Rothschild Empire accelerated the pace of "de-rightization" in various European countries, and people began to reflect on whether the choices they made two years ago were correct, and whether the rise of extreme right-wing parties had really led their countries in a better direction.  In contrast to the turbulent situation in Europe, the economy in Asia on the other side of the Earth was steadily rising. Especially in that country located in the Western Pacific with vast maritime territory, its GDP was soaring as if it had taken a space elevator.  On June 10th, a delegation from the Japanese government took the initiative to come to Koro City, leading the Central Electric Power Company and Tokyo Electric Power Company to facilitate an agreement to increase the total amount of electricity imports for the second half of the year by 31%, to replace the two domestic nuclear power plants that had been shut down.  At present, the mining speed of helium-3 in Guanghan City far exceeded the consumption rate, and the newly built second nuclear fusion power station was about to be completed, with a considerable surplus in production capacity.  For such an agreement, Jiang Chen naturally welcomed it with open arms.  Not only Japan, but the Chinese market, which Jiang Chen coveted, also relaxed its policies and sent many representatives of electric power companies to the new country for inspection.  As the world's number one electricity-consuming country, China's electricity market is larger than the second-place United States and third-place India combined. Even if China eliminated half of its coal power, it would make Xinghuan Trade earn a fortune.  As of early June, the Global Grid Plan had completed the most critical first step. With the efforts of many parties, the submarine cables of Xinghuan Trade have successfully covered the whole of Australia and 80% of the countries and regions in Asia, with the output electricity amounting to 88% of the domestic total electricity value.  Benefiting from the dividend of cheap electricity, according to the proportion of imported electricity in the total national electricity consumption, the maximum reduction in industrial costs for the member countries of the Global Grid Plan reached 1.7%, with the lowest also decreasing by 0.3%.  Don't underestimate this one or two percentage points of reduction. Reflected on a GDP measured in trillions, the energy produced is unimaginable!  Not to mention a series of benefits such as the ecological environment, investment environment, competitiveness of export products, promotion of the electrification process, and reducing the dependency of domestic industry on the energy market.  In short, the governments of various countries that have tasted the sweetness have also released positive signals one after another, sending their own entrepreneurs to the new country for negotiations to see if they can increase the import quota.  The New York Times even claimed that the new country has become a nation on a utility pole.  The Washington Post was accompanied by a cartoon full of irony, with the chains extending from the Western Pacific tying up the surrounding countries, large and small.  No matter how the media reported it, the countries that bought tickets to board the train had already sat on the high-speed electrification train, and naturally, there was no reason for them to jump out of the train.  Through a network of submarine cables, Jiang Chen's harvest was not just a continuous flow of cash, but also tangible diplomatic capital.  Why has the dollar been able to dominate the global market for half a century? One of the main reasons is that any country that wants to develop light and heavy industry cannot do without oil, and the dollar just happens to be linked to oil.  If the domestic crude oil production of your own country cannot meet domestic demand, then you can only reserve more foreign exchange to hedge against risks.  Now it's the same, Asian countries are increasing their holdings of the new yuan.  When the rise and fall of the new yuan can already affect the industrial and living electricity costs of many countries, even if Koro City is not the world financial center, the new Federal Reserve already has the potential to leverage the dominant position of the dollar currency.  This is unrelated to finance; it's about hard power.  ...  There are still five days until the Outer Space Security Summit, and Jiang Chen has already sent out invitations to ten major countries around the world. In the invitation, he subtly mentioned that the topics of discussion at the meeting will be related to extraterrestrial civilizations.  So far, all ten countries that received the invitations have indicated that they will send high-level foreign ministers to visit.  The holding of the conference is no longer in doubt; what evidence Jiang Chen will present at the conference has become the key issue.  At present, the space telescope he transported from the apocalypse has been installed on the space elevator and sent to geostationary orbit.  Jiang Chen is not very clear about the exact coordinates of that colony ship, but he knows where they will come from and what their destination is, and that is enough.  The Gliese 581 star system, about 2 degrees north of Beta Librae, 20.5 light-years away from Earth.  A week before the invitation was sent out, the astronomical observation team of the Xinghuan Trade Aerospace Department conducted a long-term observation and analysis of the star system and finally came to an astonishing ... conclusion that was expected by Jiang Chen.  The possibility of life existing on the planet Gliese 581g has reached 90%.  "Incredible..." Holding a stack of documents full of astronomical data, Kelvin walked into Jiang Chen's office and said with an incredulous face, "Your guess was correct, there is indeed the potential for life to be nurtured there. But I can be sure that even if there is life there, it is absolutely impossible for a civilization beyond the Stone Age to be developed."  Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows and asked with a smile, "Oh? Why is that?"  "Firstly, there is tidal locking; the entire planet's habitable zone is only around the twilight zone, which determines their living space." Kelvin continued, taking out a spectrogram from the documents and placing it in front of Jiang Chen, "Next is the most critical part, this planet's elemental composition contains a lot of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, but it severely lacks mineral elements such as iron and aluminum. Referring to the gravitational data we observed, the most likely scenario is that a group of arthropod insects exist along the twilight zone, and there may not even be any mammals!"  Hearing this, Jiang Chen nodded approvingly. Although the analysis was done with the help of 22nd-century observation equipment, to be able to analyze so much valuable information from limited data was already quite impressive.  "Have you considered another possibility?" Jiang Chen asked.  "Another possibility?" Kelvin frowned.  "We have always believed that the development of civilization is linear, from the Stone Age to the Iron Age, then from feudal times to the Industrial Revolution, and finally stepping through the door of the Information Age to the future."  "Is there something wrong with that?" Kelvin said, unconvinced.  "Conclusions drawn from only one reference frame cannot be universally applied. We cannot deny the possibility of other forms of civilization just because human civilization developed linearly," Jiang Chen said.  "You're saying a group of insects might give rise to a civilization? Don't joke around, they..." Kelvin shook his head, about to say they didn't even have hands, but then he suddenly froze.  He suddenly remembered the military operations of Xinghuan Trade in the tundra of northern Finland some time ago. There, the pride of Xinghuan Trade's powered armor brigade seemed to have encountered a horde of alien species that crawled out of insect eggs.  Why would Jiang Chen have the Xinghuan Trade Aerospace Department observe the Gliese star system? Why did Jiang Chen suddenly go to Finland before the X2 bacterium incident broke out? Why was Jiang Chen so certain of the dangers of the nest from the beginning...?  All the clues connected in Kelvin's mind.  He stared at Jiang Chen in shock, barely squeezing a few words out of his throat.  "You're saying..."  "That's right," Jiang Chen nodded, seriously saying, "The beginning and end of the X2 bacterium is not just a research accident as propagated by the outside world. From the beginning, this was a conspiracy of extraterrestrial civilizations."  (To be continued.) Chapter 1082: Developmental Disorder?   After leaving Jiang Chen's office, Kelvin's mind kept repeating the words his boss had said to him. The Outer Space Security Summit would take place in five days, where Xinghuan Trade would present evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations to the heads of various countries and argue their aggressive intentions... but actually, the latter didn't need proving. Two civilizations with completely different values had no option of trade from the start. Since both parties were seen as bugs in each other's eyes, there seemed to be only one method to prove who could continue to stand at the top of the food chain. And that was war.  With a complex look, Kelvin glanced at the document in his hand, recalling the task his boss had given him a minute ago, and for the first time in his life, he felt the weight of his job on his shoulders.  ...  After work in the evening, Jiang Chen didn't go straight home but took a boat alone to Coconut Island. This island had been completely transformed by him into a modern and post-apocalyptic material transit station, where a ship would come every month, unloading unsold food, daily necessities, and occasionally transporting tightly sealed containers away. These containers were filled with advanced industrial machine tools, T3-type power armor produced by the Sixth District, and other high-tech products.  Although the entire island didn't have soldiers stationed to guard it, it was home to a full drone attack squadron. There had been foreign agents who had their sights set on this "mysterious little island," but none had ever succeeded.  Upon reaching the island, Jiang Chen moored the boat at the dock, confirmed his identity with a reconnaissance drone, and walked toward the central warehouse. In the corner of the warehouse sat a machine named by Jiang Chen as "Hamster Killer No. 1," alone and unmoving.  Last time, it was through this machine that Lin Ling had transported a fat hamster from the modern world to the post-apocalyptic world and then back again, witnessing the breakthrough of life transdimensional transport from 0.1 to 1. Although there was still a distance to go before transporting living people, it was undoubtedly a good start.  However, Jiang Chen hadn't expected this device to come into use so quickly.  He sat down next to the machine, took out several test tubes filled with dark green liquid from his pocket, placed them in the center of two discs, then put on a strapped hand device connected to various tubes, and turned on the power. Watching the jumping sparks, he steeled himself and pressed the switch.  After some effort, he transported the test tubes to the post-apocalyptic world, quickly unstrapped his hand, turned off the power, and followed through the transportation.  ...  One of the test tubes contained a substance extracted from the remnants of a hive, while the other test tubes contained spores and insect egg extracts. The cells in the test tubes had not been inactivated, and through the dark green culture fluid, one could even see the wriggling of unidentified substances.  After taking these test tubes from Jiang Chen, Lin Ling immediately dove into the laboratory. Not waiting long, the laboratory door opened again, and Lin Ling reappeared, gesturing to Jiang Chen, then took him to a special microscope.  On the test tube rack, Jiang Chen saw not only the test tubes he had brought but also two familiar test tubes. From the labels on them, he quickly understood where these two test tubes came from.  "The sample you brought is obviously not the same kind as the one from Shelter No. 005 and the hive we encountered in the city center, but the DNA codes do have quite a few similarities. The hive you encountered is clearly an upgraded version, but due to developmental disorder, many functions have not differentiated," Lin Ling explained.  Hearing Lin Ling's introduction, Jiang Chen's eyebrows twitched involuntarily.  "Developmental disorder?"  It took hundreds of tungsten core bullets and a whole brigade of power armor to take down this tough nut, and you're telling me it was still developmentally disordered? What if it was fully developed, would we even stand a chance!  Lin Ling nodded seriously. "Yes, if it's provided with enough organic matter and given sufficient time for photosynthesis to digest and absorb those organics, this hive will gradually develop into a complete form. According to its DNA sequence simulation, the complete form will become a terrifying existence that is impossible to eliminate."  Pausing, Lin Ling's expression turned solemn as she continued, "At least with current technology, I can't think of a way to completely eradicate it. Every single spore cell has the ability to develop into a mature hive, and their division is no longer limited. Unless we can manage to kill every single spore, there will always be the day when it will pop up from some corner."  After hearing Lin Ling's account, the evolution speed of the hive sent a shiver down Jiang Chen's spine. For them, who had completely abandoned tradition, Earth was a completely unfamiliar planet. Whether it was gravity, air composition, or the magnetic field environment, even understanding them did not necessarily mean full adaptation.  In the war against them, humans had the home field advantage from the start. However, on this unfamiliar soil, after each encounter with humans, their abilities evolved at an incredible speed. If there are a few more hive incidents, it's hard to say what stance the Harmonious Civilization will take when the colonization ships land on the day of their invasion plan.  Realizing the deeper severity of the problem, Jiang Chen pondered for a moment and immediately ordered, "Compile the data of this hive, focusing on analyzing the similar genetic components of X2 bacteria and T-series viruses. Also, give me a paper file and an electronic file, preferably made into an easy-to-understand holographic image."  "Hey, do you think I'm your secretary? It's tiring, you know!" Lin Ling pouted, protesting.  "Ten boxes of mango pudding."  "Uh..." Lin Ling struggled for a moment, as if making a big concession, "Fifteen boxes of strawberry flavor."  Hearing Lin Ling's words, Jiang Chen smiled and shook his head. Was this a big deal for him?  "I'll bring it for you next time. But speaking of which, didn't you like mango flavor?"  Lin Ling stuck out her little tongue and looked away sheepishly, "I've had too much of the mango flavor, I haven't even finished what you gave me last time."  Compiling all the data on the hive was no small task, but for Lin Ling, who was an electronic person, it was not difficult. With the promise of pudding, Lin Ling assured Jiang Chen with a pat on her chest that she could finish it in no more than three days.  Leaving the chirping research institute, Jiang Chen went straight through the back yard door and returned to the villa. Before coming to the post-apocalyptic world, he had already notified Aisha, and if nothing unexpected happened, he would stay here for the next three days until Lin Ling had completely compiled the hive data.  This information would be of great use at the upcoming Outer Space Security Summit. Whether it could attract sufficient international attention depended entirely on it.  (To be continued.) Chapter 1083: Watching Intently  In the Morgan Stanley Tower on Wall Street, New York, USA, an informal Federal Reserve shareholders' meeting is taking place. The man seated near the door is the current head of the Morgan family, Daniel Morgan. Alongside him at the meeting table are representatives of the Rockefeller family, representing the Boston consortium, the Rocky family... Even the Giannini family, owners of the California consortium in the distant "countryside" of the West, have sent their own representatives.  It's no exaggeration to say that those qualified to sit at this meeting table mean as much to Americans as Franklin printed on the hundred-dollar bill, and they are the kind that can breathe. A casual fart from these individuals could cause a third or fourth-degree earthquake in the financial world. To put it dramatically, at least one-third of the world's capital is housed within this few dozen square meters of space.  "First, let us toast to our collective victory," Daniel Morgan picked up a champagne glass from the meeting table, raised it high, and looked around, "Victory belongs to 'The Wasps', Wall Street belongs to 'The Wasps'!"  The word for 'wasp' in English coincides with the acronym for the WASP consortium, and typically, members of the WASP consortium also refer to themselves by this name. Old Rockefeller smiled knowingly and also raised his glass.  Without any superfluous lengthy rituals, twelve champagne glasses were raised high in celebration of the WASP consortium's shared victory, led by Daniel, and drained in one gulp.  Twelve attendants stepped forward, respectfully offering towels, and after the big shots had used them, they collected the towels along with the glasses and exited the meeting room. Daniel confidently glanced over the guests around the meeting table, having thrown his towel onto the attendant's tray early on.  Among all the capital magnates present, the forty-year-old Daniel was undoubtedly the youngest and the most successful. After all the attendants had left the room, Daniel lightly clapped his hands to draw everyone's attention to him.  "Just yesterday, Morgan Bank completed the acquisition of assets related to Citibank shares from the Rothschild Bank. With this, I am honored to announce to you all that we have completely kicked those annoying Jews out from under our feet on this street."  Polite applause rose from the meeting table, and even old Rockefeller gently clapped, his muddy eyes flickering with an intriguing glint. Daniel nodded slightly, humbly accepting the praise from the core members of WASP for himself and the surname he carries.  When referring to the Rothschild family's control over America, one cannot help but mention the Federal Reserve. As is well known, the Federal Reserve acts as the central bank of the United States, holding the macro-control power of the "world currency." A simple move to raise interest rates could cause some weak economies to have their factories run for nothing for a month or two, with national finances piling up in debt, comparable to nuclear weapons in the financial field.  The most critical thing is that this nuclear weapon is in private hands. Although Federal Reserve committee members are nominated by the President and appointed by the Senate, strictly speaking, they are part of the government apparatus.  However, according to the Owen-Glass Act, the Federal Reserve has divided the country into 12 reserve districts, each establishing a regional reserve bank with independent legal entity status. The equity of each regional reserve bank is then subscribed by member banks in the region based on their asset proportions.  Taking the New York reserve district as an example, according to the latest public data, the major shareholders are Citibank with 15%, Chase Manhattan 14%, Morgan Trust 9%, Hanhua 8%, and Hanover 7%. Behind these banks often stand the shadows of financial families such as Rockefeller, Morgan, and Rothschild.  Goldman Sachs fell early last year, and now the Rothschild family has been kicked out of the game, with their shares in banks like Citibank and Hanover being divided between the two giants, Rockefeller and Morgan.  If Wall Street in '18 was a place where Jews and Anglo-Saxons competed, with the nuclear button in the hands of two people, then Wall Street in '19 can be called the world of the WASP consortium faction.  Old Rockefeller coughed lightly, pulling Daniel out of his intoxication with victory. "Celebrating victory can wait until the banquet tonight, gentlemen, we still have more important matters to discuss now."  "You're right," Daniel smiled, his face showing no sign of dissatisfaction.  Without saying anything else, old Rockefeller lifted his hand over his shoulder and wiggled his fingers slightly. His secretary, understanding the cue, stepped forward two paces and placed a document respectfully on the meeting table.  Sitting up straight, old Rockefeller put on gold-rimmed glasses and flipped open the document. "Just yesterday, on June 11th, Japan Central Electric Power Company, Tokyo Electric Power Company, and Xinghuan Trade reached an agreement to expand the import of electricity. According to Japan's electricity usage data for the last year, Xinghuan Trade has successfully monopolized 20% of our 'little friend' Japan's national electricity."  When these words were spoken, those present exchanged glances, and even a hint of surprise flashed in Daniel's eyes. "These two pieces of news have not yet entered the disclosure cycle; you may not have received the information yet. I owe my information to a certain cabinet official."  Here, old Rockefeller glanced meaningfully at all present, "I believe I don't need to say much; you may already have felt it."  "We are losing control over the situation in Asia."  As soon as these words were uttered, the room was in an uproar. Everyone present was a representative of major consortia, the financial tycoons of Wall Street, and with their intelligence and instincts, it was obvious that they could see this point. It's just that recently everyone's energy had been drawn to Europe, all wracking their brains to bite off a bigger piece from Rothschild, so much so that no one paid attention to the other side of the Earth.  "The hegemonic position of the dollar is being shaken; perhaps letting the Freemasons fall so quickly was a mistake."  "What else can we do? Are we to pull them out of their graves?"  "Perhaps we can support the Krupp consortium; as long as there's a new rival to contain the Future Group—"  "That's even more unrealistic."  Interrupting the discussion, Daniel shook his head, crossing his fingers in front of his chin. Previously still immersed in the joy of victory, he had now become aware of the looming crisis facing the WASP consortium, "We must check the continued expansion of Xinghuan Trade's influence. The bad signs have already appeared; if we allow their global electric grid plan to proceed, we will become increasingly passive."  "Exactly." Rockefeller nodded, glancing around at those present, "I know that many of you have cooperated with the Future Group in various fields, but if they shake the foundation of the dollar, I think you all very well understand what that means."  Wall Street's financial empire is built on the dollar. With the two levers of exchange rate and market, Wall Street's giants have plundered the world for nearly a century. Once the dollar loses its "world currency" aura, central banks around the world will open the floodgates to reduce their dollar holdings, and every bill issued by the Federal Reserve will become worthless paper, and Wall Street's financial empire built on paper will become worthless overnight.  In the two hours following the meeting, including Daniel, everyone had completely sobered up from the joy of victory. The Jewish financial consortium had fallen, yet the wolves that bit them to death were not yet sated, and at this moment, they were already eyeing the other side of the Pacific.  When everyone's interests were threatened, the WASP consortium united like never before and spent these two hours formulating a plan to encircle and blockade Xinghuan Trade's "global electric grid plan."  After the meeting, representatives of the major consortia got up and left their seats, hurrying towards the door. However, Daniel Morgan, the host of the meeting, did not get up but leaned back in his chair, lost in thought.  At that moment, he suddenly remembered the phone call he had with Carmen a month ago. At that time, the former financial overlord, the Rothschild family, humbly sought his help, but he almost immediately refused Carmen without hesitation.  "...On the contrary, I am absolutely certain that one day in the future I will be glad of the choice I made today... right?" His fingers tapped lightly on the table surface as Daniel murmured the line he had once said, his tone now carrying a hint of hesitation, no longer as decisive as before.  (To be continued.)
