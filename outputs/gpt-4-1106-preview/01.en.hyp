Prologue: The Legend Ends  Dark clouds shrouded the sky, and the ground was dim and lightless, surrounded by a mess. The spiraling staircase, bodies stained with blood, armor, weapons, everything was so chaotic, desolate, carrying the scent of death and danger.  Rhode took a breath, but he couldn't feel the coldness and the blood in the air—it was, after all, just a game.  Thinking of this, Rhode gave a wry smile and shook his head, then he turned around to look at his comrades who were sitting on the ground not far below him, quietly resting and recovering their strength while repairing their weapons.  It seemed no different from any other day, but Rhode knew very well that this battle was not as easy as the ones before.  "How many people are left?" he asked in a deep voice.  Hearing the question, the people exchanged glances, and then, a skinny mage stood up.  "Ninety-six, captain. The Void Dragon dungeon is more dangerous than we imagined. Many brothers fell in the previous traps. The only good news is that our job classes are still well-rounded."  "That's good." Rhode nodded in response, not saying anything more, and the others also fell silent.  If it were an ordinary team, they might have already lost their courage and become chaotic, because what they were about to face was the most powerful, most terrifying boss in the game, the one that had never been conquered by anyone—the Void Dragon. It is the final boss of the third chapter of the online game Dragon Soul Continent and, until now, the most terrifying existence.  Facing such a battle, a normal guild would have to organize at least ten teams to dare to come and try to challenge. And now, Rhode only had ninety-six people, not even enough to form a complete team. But even so, there was no trace of panic or confusion in their eyes, only calmness, confidence, and trust.  The man they trusted so much was standing on the stairs not far in front of them, looking up at the sky with a face as firm as a rock, and a cold scar running down from his brow, giving a deterring feeling.  His armor shone with the glow of magic, covering his majestic body like an unyielding wall.  Of course, it wasn't because of his serious appearance that they trusted him. No matter how tough the appearance, after all, it was just a character setting in the game, and the scar between the brows was just an accessory in the game's facial features.  What was truly intimidating was the countless halos and achievements behind this man.  The first player to reach the top level.  The first player to reach the pinnacle with the most difficult profession, the Summoning Swordsman.  Since the first chapter "Dark Descent" of Dragon Soul Continent, leading the guild with his own abilities, and the terrifying familiarity with all professions, he swept through three whole seasons of content, taking down all boss first-kills as the leader.  Each dungeon video would be reposted by countless players, revered as a holy scripture for teaching, the president of the first player guild in Dragon Soul Continent—Rhode.  He personally ended "Dark Descent," ushered in "Era of Turmoil," and once again conquered the "Era of Turmoil," reaching "Void Judgment."  And now, he will once again use his own hands to end this "Void Judgment," but the new era will no longer be started by him.  How many years has it been?  Rhode retracted his gaze from the distant sea of clouds flickering with Thunder Serpents and asked himself.  It had been seven years since his sister passed away and he entered the Dragon Soul Continent. In these seven years, to force himself to forget those painful memories, he set almost unattainable goals for himself time and time again, reaching them over and over. Only the immense excitement and glory brought by those moments could dilute the pain deep in his heart.  But it could only go this far.  A month ago, Rhode's parents were abroad on a business trip when a hurricane caused a plane crash, taking their lives. Rhode could no longer remember what he felt when he heard the news, but now he had made a decision.  To leave this game and return to real life, not just for his parents, but Rhode knew it was time for a change.  "Guild... Guild leader?"  A timid voice rang out, interrupting Rhode's reminiscence. He looked up, and saw a female mage in the crowd timidly raising her hand, her bright eyes fixed on him.  "Are... Are you really leaving?"  "Yes." Rhode nodded, then collected his complex emotions, shook his head, and looked back at his companions, his memories and friends gained during the seven years of struggle.  But now, he will leave them, and though in the game, he could guess their intentions with just a gesture, once he took off his gaming helmet and returned to the real world, he probably wouldn't recognize them anymore.  "I sent out my resume yesterday, hoping to find a company that will take me."  "If I received your resume, I would arrange for you to be a department manager directly, don't worry!" A knight waved his greatsword, and his words lightened the somewhat somber atmosphere, making everyone laugh.  "Thanks for your kindness, but unfortunately I didn't write those down in my resume. You know our guild has many enemies, and if someone from another guild received it, I would be in trouble."  Rhode also smiled and answered, then coughed and became serious.  "I think everyone knows how we got here over the years."  Hearing this, everyone who was laughing just now closed their mouths and quietly began to listen to him.  "We also know that on the forums, on the internet, many people criticize us. They say we've disrupted the balance of the game, monopolized all the boss first-kills, making competition meaningless... Frankly, I think they're right, but..."  At this point, Rhode clenched his fist and swung it hard.  "But, what does that have to do with us! We are the strongest guild, we are the strongest team! We have the power! So we have to do it, to grab it! Other guilds are not strong enough and lose, that's their own problem. If they were strong enough, they could break our monopoly. Our monopoly on boss first-kills is not based on rules, not on status, not on flattering the game company, but on our own strength! We never give up, we never admit defeat, we never slack off, so we have this achievement and everything, we deserve it, it's that simple."  Rhode paused, then continued.  "I love this guild, and I also cherish the seven years we've spent together, but all good things must come to an end, and I should also find my own life. But I will never forget everyone, nor will I forget the guild. It bears my most painful memories, and my happiest ones, I will keep remembering it here."  Saying this, Rhode pointed to his head.  "Many people say the guild can't play without me. I guess many guilds know this news now, and they must be planning to wait for me to leave and then rush to take the guild down and break our record, but that's underestimating us. Dragon Soul is not a game with only one person, I alone can't build the guild, I alone can't organize a team, and it's not possible to kill the boss and get first kill alone. So I hope after I leave, you can show those who have bad intentions why this guild is so strong, why Starlight has the true strength to occupy the first place in the Dragon Soul Continent guild rankings!"  "Yes!"  "No problem, guild leader!"  "Leave it to us, by that time we'll give those idiots a perfect answer!"  "Good." Hearing everyone's answer, Rhode nodded, then turned to the right side of the crowd.  "Old Liu."  Hearing Rhode's call, the tall and thin mage walked out of the crowd and came to his side. Rhode looked at the mage in front of him, silent for a moment, then took off the badge on his chest and placed it in his hand.  "The next era is yours."  Rhode let go, his voice very calm, without any change.  "So, I leave this battle to you to command."  "Okay, no problem, Rhode." The mage nodded, but soon he spoke again.  "So, as the guild president, as the team leader, I order you to lead the team."  "Old Liu?" Rhode frowned in surprise.  At that moment, the tall and thin mage smiled quietly, then patted Rhode's shoulder.  "You started this era, so end it well, Rhode, that's the way of a man."  Hearing these words, Rhode fell silent. He looked up at his companions who were ready in front of him, waiting for his command as always.  Rhode clenched his sword, then turned to face the high platform not far in front. There, thunder raged and flashed with bright light.  Then, Rhode raised his long sword and pointed forward. He had started out as the most ordinary, so let it end as the most ordinary.  "Pull aggro!!"  The Void Dragon was indeed extremely powerful.  Rhode had clashed with almost all the significant bosses in Dragon Soul Continent, including other Dragon Soul existences in the setting, but none were more troublesome than the Void Dragon before him.  Its attack patterns were more complex, almost without pattern, its damage several times higher than ordinary bosses, not to mention speed, response, and even defense—all at top-notch standards.  It was indeed a difficult opponent to conquer.  Rhode held his long sword, gritted his teeth and focused on the huge beast before him. The fight had reached the final moment, and he was the only survivor, but even so, Rhode's health was almost depleted, the glaring red warning that his life force had reached its limit.  And wasn't the Void Dragon in the same state?  Looking into the blood-red, angry dragon eyes, Rhode suddenly had a strange feeling. He seemed to understand the Void Dragon's mood—as the strongest boss in the game that had never been conquered, it was now facing such a fall, it must be feeling terrible.  So, let me accompany you to the end.  With that thought, Rhode raised his left hand.  Accompanied by a loud cry, Rhode's sword suddenly burst into flames, spiraling into a flying firebird, soaring towards the Void Dragon. Faced with this attack, the Void Dragon also roared and raised its front claws, crashing down.  Rhode felt his body shake violently, a powerful force rushing towards him. The firebird screamed before dissipating, but before it vanished, the intense explosion forced the Void Dragon's claw away, leaving an opening.  Rhode bit down hard, the red in front of him becoming more and more dazzling, indicating the damage he had suffered was at a critical point. But now, this was no longer within his consideration—it was the final chance, succeed or wipe.  He raised his long sword and thrust it forward, but the Void Dragon had also recovered its strength. It roared, and once again swung its claw down, while at the same time, Rhode threw his long sword.  Thunder Strike, activate.  The long sword turned into a dazzling light, shooting straight at the dragon's chest. Rhode focused on it, watching the lightning-mixed light penetrate the gaps in the Void Dragon's claws, then effortlessly tearing through the dragon's scales.  A deafening dragon roar erupted from the ground, and then, the massive dragon's claw hit Rhode hard.  The world turned almost completely red before Rhode's eyes, blinding him to the scene before him. But from the corner of his eye, the system prompt was still clear as ever.  It was finally over.  Staring at this line of system prompt, Rhode showed a trace of relief.  And at that moment, a bright column of light suddenly descended from the sky, enveloping the high platform.  The pure white light instantly lit up the originally dark sky, dispelling the lingering clouds.  At this time, the others who were reviving from the graveyard and heading towards the high platform suddenly stopped, and the world channel, which was buzzing with the news of Starlight Guild's latest first kill record, also suddenly fell silent.  For a moment, only one message remained there—a system announcement.  A legend that had dominated three gaming eras, thus concluded. Chapter 1: A New Journey  A fierce wind swept through the canyon, causing waves of ripples across the grassland. The bison grazing on tender blades of grass lifted their heads to look at the sky. There, a wooden merchant ship, dozens of meters long, was suspended in the air, with its sails billowing in the wind, moving forward slowly.  "No matter when you look at it, this wind tide is always so spectacular," said a middle-aged man in leather armor, standing by the deck and looking down at the endless grassland and beautiful scenery.  "For us merchants, this is also a rare business opportunity," said a somewhat portly merchant standing next to the middle-aged man. He had a head of peculiar curly hair, was dressed in a merchant's robe, and his small eyes were slightly squinted as if calculating something as he watched the scenery before him. It looked as if he was even thinking about selling the beautiful scene in front of him.  "If it weren't for it, I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to transport the goods to the central region so quickly."  "To be honest, when I first planned to expand this market, there were objections, but now it seems that my choice was indeed correct."  "But, forgive me for speaking frankly, you didn't choose the major shipping routes, but took this way instead. Although it saves time, the danger is also increased."  "I've heard that it's not peaceful on the other side lately. And, I think you've also been warned by the captain that there have been wind snakes spotted nearby recently. If by any chance..."  The man's expression became a bit solemn as he turned his head towards the nearby mountain range. The towering peaks blocked his view, and he couldn't see what was behind them. However, he could vaguely see that the sky in the distance was not pure azure but tinged with a somber darkness. That was not a world they should enter.  "Don't worry, there are not so many 'what ifs.' Fortune favors the bold; that's why I paid so much to hire you all!"  "Just a few snakes, right?"  The merchant extended his hand and patted the man's shoulder.  "By the way, how is the young man we rescued doing now?"  "He's not dead yet."  "Rijie has bandaged his wounds. He is currently unconscious but should not be in any danger to his life."  "That's good."  Hearing the man's response, the merchant nodded in satisfaction. Then his brows furrowed.  "But what exactly is the injury that the young man has suffered? Judging from the wound, it looks like it was caused by a large lizard—but are there such strange creatures in the northern part of Pafield?"  "I'm not sure, sir, but it must be a very ferocious beast. Let's hope we don't encounter it."  As he spoke, the man subconsciously glanced at the entrance to the cabin, then turned his head back to look forward.  Rhode opened his eyes.  What happened?  He stared blankly at the ceiling, his mind foggy.  He remembered that he had been leading his team on the ruins platform, fighting against the Void Dragon, the most powerful boss in the Dragon Soul Continent, and had successfully achieved the first kill. He was sure that he had received the achievement and system prompt, and then, the Void Dragon's final blow also took his life.  Originally, according to the plan, Rhode should have resurrected in the graveyard and then logged out. However, at the moment he was killed by the Void Dragon, the whole world immediately turned pitch black as if it had been forcibly isolated. Then, Rhode lost consciousness.  How could this be?  Was there a problem with the game?  Rhode struggled to turn his head and could see the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. Where was he? What was this place? What had happened? Was he still dreaming? Or was he still in the game?  At least Rhode was certain that this place was definitely not his cramped rental apartment.  With this thought, confusion immediately surged in Rhode's mind. He frowned and then tried to sit up.  "Ouch!!!"  At that moment, a sharp pain suddenly came from Rhode's chest, making him grit his teeth and stop moving.  Only then did Rhode realize that his left shoulder and chest were completely wrapped in bandages. Although he didn't know what had happened, the bloodstains seeping through them indicated that he was seriously injured.  This was definitely not a game!  Rhode could be sure of that; he knew that although technology had advanced considerably, and Dragon Soul Continent, the world's first virtual reality MMORPG, used a lot of high-tech, players were not supposed to feel pain according to the rules. This was designed to distinguish reality from the game and also to lower the threshold for players.  When players were injured, instead of pain, the game would use a decrease in the player's movement speed, a red screen representing danger, and other methods to disrupt normal gameplay to warn and remind players, rather than truly simulating pain.  There had been considerable debate about this practice when holographic simulation technology first emerged, and the operating company of Dragon Soul Continent would certainly be aware of this.  Rhode lowered his head to look at his right hand, which was not the muscular and wild body he had crafted in the game. Instead, the arm before him was slender and weak, and the skin was sickly pale due to the lack of sunlight. This was his real body, and he was very clear about that.  But how did he get injured? And this place did not look like a hospital, did it?  Rhode looked up; the room seemed to be a cabin with no lights, no telephone, and no call bell. A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed to the wall were all the furnishings there.  For some reason, Rhode felt as if he had seen this scene somewhere.   As Rhode carefully observed the room, the door suddenly opened. A blonde girl in a white robe walked into the room. She looked at Rhode, who was half-sitting up, with surprise in her eyes.  "You're awake? That's great!"  The girl didn't speak Chinese or English, but Rhode understood her perfectly. This surprised him; he knew this language. It was Nim, one of the official languages of Dragon Soul Continent!  "How do you feel? Are you okay?"  But the girl didn't pay attention to Rhode's expression; she quickly came to his side and carefully examined his left shoulder and chest.  "Your injury is really serious. To be honest, I was a bit worried about whether you could survive..."  "This is..."  Rhode frowned, not knowing what to say. He turned his head to look at the mirror on the wall, which clearly reflected his own face. That was indeed his face, but it shouldn't be here.  "Did you forget?" The blonde girl blinked her eyes, puzzled, and her ponytails swayed slightly with her movements. Her blue eyes were clear and lively.  "Two days ago, you were found in the Pafield Plateau with severe injuries."  "If it wasn't for the 'Silver Libra' merchant ship passing by, it would have been really bad."  "I don't know what you were fighting with, but your left side was severely injured. It was really dangerous at that time."  Wait, the left shoulder?  Rhode paused for a moment, then immediately remembered that he had been hit on the left side in his last battle with the Void Dragon.  But that was his character in the game that was injured; it shouldn't have anything to do with the player himself. However, now he was injured in reality?  Although the situation was chaotic, Rhode quickly calmed down. This was his psychological quality as a top player and the leader of the world's most powerful online gaming guild.  From his conversation with the blonde girl, Rhode also learned about his current situation. He was severely injured and found on the Pafield Plateau, and the Silver Libra merchant ship happened to pass by and rescued him.  According to the blonde girl, Rhode's initial condition was not optimistic, but his recovery ability was quite good.  "My name is Lijie Noelle. I'm a member of the Star Moon Mercenary Group, a spiritist. You can call me Lijie."  The girl introduced herself to Rhode straightforwardly.  "My name is Rhode Alander."  Although Rhode was still unable to make sense of the current situation, he hesitated for a moment before giving his identity and ID from the game.  "I come from the Eastern Plateau, an adventurer."  "An adventurer, I see. So that's why you were alone in those remote mountains."  Hearing Rhode's response, Lijie was not surprised. In this continent, many adventurers liked to explore alone, so there were no issues with the identity Rhode gave.  "But what exactly were you fighting?"  "Why were you so severely injured?"  "I remember that there shouldn't be any particularly frightening monsters in this plateau region."  Hearing the girl's question, Rhode smiled awkwardly. What could he say? Could he tell Lijie that he was injured while fighting the Void Dragon, one of the five dragons of creation?  "Because I was attacked at night, I didn't see clearly what it was. They were numerous, and they were fast. I think, maybe it's something from 'over there.'"  "I understand."  Although Rhode did not explain in detail, Lijie seemed to understand, nodding her head slightly. After she carefully examined Rhode's wounds, she stood up.  "You haven't eaten for two days. I think you must be very hungry. Please wait, I'll go get some food for you right now."  "Ah, right, I also need to report this to the leader. I think he will come to see you soon."  After saying this, the girl politely nodded to Rhode and then left the room. Chapter 2: The Holy Sword Deck  "Phew..." It was only at this moment that Rhode finally let out a sigh of relief and lay back down.  After the chat with the young girl, Rhode could confirm that this was indeed the world of Dragon Soul Continent. Moreover, this was not the era he had experienced before, but a more distant past—the Twilight Years, which, converted to game time, was when the Dragon Soul Continent game had just begun its open beta.  How did he come to be here?  Rhode sighed, shook his head, and stopped thinking about these strange and mysterious things. No matter what, he was already here, and that was a fact.  So what should he do next?  First of all, Rhode decided to try what he could currently do. With just a thought, a clear and familiar system prompt appeared before his eyes, displaying his current status and attributes:  Rhode Level 1 Race: Mixed Blood (??) Talent: Unsealed Race Reward: Unsealed Race Trait: Unsealed++ Occupation: Summoning Swordsman (Heroic Occupation) Occupational Skills: Spirit Summoning Art (Proficiency E) Owned Swordsmanship: Moon Shadow Swordsmanship (Proficiency E) (Usable Skill—Shattered Blade) Part-Time Job: Alchemist (Arcane Creation Specialty) Owned Skills: Concentrated Shaping (Proficiency E)  This was a very normal yet abnormal attribute list, especially the first item almost made Rhode cry out.  Mixed blood? How could it be mixed blood? On the Dragon Soul Continent, so-called mixed blood didn't refer to racial intermarriage like on Earth. Instead, most who had the attribute of mixed blood were produced from marriage between humans and non-human races.  But Rhode knew very well that he was human, and even as a player character in the game, he had not chosen any other race. But why now did his attribute list have an added mixed blood? And the question marks in brackets indicated that his bloodline had not fully awakened, so the race rewards and race traits were sealed.  This meant that Rhode had to understand what kind of blood he had and awaken the dormant power within his bloodline before he could receive them. This was a hassle for Rhode because normally, race rewards were provided after character creation.  For example, the human race reward was reduced time for learning skills, and depending on the specific human race, there were different bonuses such as poison resistance and increased reputation.  But now, Rhode was cut off from these rewards and traits.  However, there were also surprises. In the swordsmanship and alchemy section, Rhode discovered that, in addition to the necessary skills at level one, the dozen or so swordsmanship and alchemy skills he had learned as a player were not forgotten but quietly listed below. However, they were all in a dark color.  This indicated that with Rhode's current abilities and level, he was not yet able to learn and use them. But Rhode was not worried about this because as long as his strength improved and he met the conditions, he would be able to regain the right to use these swordsmanship and skills.  Of course, the only downside was that the proficiency of these swordsmanship and skills had been reset to the lowest E rank instead of SS rank. But Rhode did not dwell on these minor issues because he valued the skills not for their proficiency, but for their origins. Many swordsmanship techniques were quite difficult to learn. Not only did they require level advancement or attributes, but many times a series of quests had to be completed, or one's reputation had to be raised, or it was just a coincidence that hidden items were found.  All of these required a lot of money, time, and even luck. In the game, it wasn't until Rhode's last year on the Dragon Soul Continent that he finally fully crafted his character, which gave him the confidence to challenge the Void Dragon.  Unfortunately, there were joys and sorrows. The issue with swordsmanship was resolved, but Rhode soon discovered that not only were his experience, level, and proficiency reset to zero, but also the existence most crucial to a summoning swordsman—the summoning spirit.  In the game of Dragon Soul Continent, the summoning swordsman was a controversial occupation. Initially, it was introduced as an exclusive occupation for players and drew much attention. However, after actually trying it out, summoning swordsmen were criticized for their mediocre attributes due to their dual focus on magic and combat, the complexity of needing to summon spirits to assist in attacks, and the consumption of experience points during leveling, which made players call it one of the most troublesome occupations.  At first glance, there seems to be no difference between the summoning art of summoning swordsmen and that of mages. However, the two are completely different in reality. Mages summon creatures from sub-dimensions by using their power to tear through space and use the force of magic to forcibly constrain them to serve. Summoning swordsmen, on the other hand, lack the ability to tear through spatial dimensions, and all their summons come from the present world.  One of their abilities is to reawaken the souls of ancient and mysterious items filled with soul power through the unique "Spirit Summoning Art" of summoning swordsmen and reseal them for use through contracts.  Although it sounds powerful, there are many troubles. In fact, many players were initially confused by this skill and chose the summoning swordsman. They thought that by buying some broken ancient artifacts at a low price from relics or guilds and using the Spirit Summoning Art to call out the souls of those weapons for sealing, they would easily obtain a divine weapon without any effort.  Sadly, dreams are wonderful, but reality is cruel. Not to mention that only high-level Spirit Summoning Art can activate the sleeping souls of ancient-level weapon remnants, and because they lose their material form as soul entities, their strength is much weaker than before.  Take "Dragon King's Fury," a quasi-divine weapon Rhode once used in the game. He only extracted the soul from a weapon remnant after reaching max level, but the weapon's power was not even as strong as that of a weapon forged by a master blacksmith. Rhode then spent two years traveling around the Dragon Soul Continent, going through heaven and earth to reactivate the souls of all the weapon fragments and restore them to their original state. Not to mention the time, the dangers along the way were enough to deter many people.  Moreover, spirit weapons require the consumption of soul power during use, and the summoned spirits also consume soul power. However, the amount of spiritual power stored by summoning swordsmen is far less than that of mages, so many summoning swordsmen would rather choose ordinary weapons than use these "seemingly beautiful" spirit weapons that are not very helpful in reality.  There are three other sources for summoning swordsmen's spirits: one is to awaken the soul core condensed after the death of a magical creature and make it a summoning spirit; the second is to defeat non-human creatures and, under certain conditions, sign a contract with them for use as summoning spirits; the third is to awaken attribute adjustment talents after level ten, merging several summoning spirits to produce higher-level spirits. This method controls the uncertainty of summoning spirits to a certain extent. As long as one is familiar with the characteristics, races, and attributes of summoning spirits, one can generally predict what the merged summoning spirit will look like. However, the disadvantage of this method is that the level of the newly created summoning spirit is uncertain; it may result in a level one spirit after merging two high-level ones, or a spirit too high-level to use. If it is the latter, it is fine; just work hard to level up. If it is the former, then one might as well delete their account...  The experience of a summoning spirit is deducted from the owner, which is why summoning swordsmen level up slower than other occupations. The same amount of experience that other occupations only need to care for themselves, summoning swordsmen must share with their summoning spirits for leveling up, and it's difficult to balance this allocation. Distributing experience to one's summoning spirits can ensure their level increases and evolve after a certain point, but as mentioned, the evolving spirit is influenced by the environment, the holder's will, and external factors, so sometimes the evolved summoning spirit may not be what the holder wants.  Because of these "troublesome" characteristics of summoning swordsmen, they were voted the "number one most troublesome occupation" on the official forum of Dragon Soul Continent. Some people vividly described summoning swordsmen as either newbies who had never played the game and were tricked by introductions and CG promotions, leisurely players who didn't seek progress, gamblers who loved to bet on luck, or... Rhode.  The fact that Rhode's game ID went from a simple name to a representative of a phenomenon shows what players felt when Rhode, as a summoning swordsman recognized as extremely troublesome, achieved numerous server firsts and even conquered three new eras.  Most players don't like such random methods that make them feel out of control, but Rhode enjoyed it. Because of the unknown, there was a challenge, which is why he chose the summoning swordsman occupation. In fact, during his long gaming career, he encountered almost all of the "troublesome" performances of summoning swordsmen, but Rhode was undaunted because conquering such difficulties gave him a greater sense of satisfaction.  But now, the dozens of top-level summoning spirits he had cultivated over seven years were all gone. The mysterious summoning magic circle on the back of his right hand still existed, but within it, Rhode could no longer sense any trace of the spirits.  However, upon reflection, it wasn't surprising since this body was not the same as the one in the game, and he couldn't demand too much.  However...  At this thought, Rhode's heart stirred, and he reached out to touch the pocket on his chest. Sure enough, he soon touched a card.  It was a white card, depicting a long sword entwined with thorns, spotlessly white. It was engraved with complex and flourishing inscriptions, and the guard was a pair of beautifully closing wings. Merely looking at it was pleasing to the eye. In the four corners of the card, there were four different symbols. In the upper right corner was a white semicircle, while in the upper left corner was a small 'X'. Looking further down, the lower left and right corners each had two small numbers—3.  Turning the card over, mysterious and elegant text slowly emerged on the back.  [Eternal Holy Sword, Tenth Rank: Star Mark, No Attribute, Fusable—Even the dust of history cannot bury its dazzling brilliance.]  It's still here?  Looking at the card in his hand, Rhode was slightly startled. This was the exclusive equipment of a summoning swordsman, the summoning card. And he was very familiar with this one; it was a rare card souvenir given to him by the officials during a game event, after he led his guild to win the server championship for two consecutive quarters. To commend this incredibly strong top player, the game company specially made this card for him.  Of course, similar collectible cards were already too numerous to count, but for Rhode, he didn't have the leisure to waste money on things that could only be looked at and not used. So this was the only award card he had, which he carried as an amulet, as it didn't take up much space anyway.  Originally, this was just an ordinary commemorative prize, with the only distinction being that it was the only one in the world. But now, Rhode saw it emitting a faint glow on its surface, shimmering in his hand.  Should he give it a try?  Rhode hesitated for only a second before gripping the card with his right hand. Then, the magic circle on the back of his right hand suddenly lit up, and blue magical lines spread from it, extending to each finger of his right hand. Next, the white card burst into a dazzling white light and then turned into specks of dust, completely disappearing into the air.  At this moment, a system prompt also appeared before Rhode's eyes.  [You have obtained 1/10 of the Eternal Deck, Eternal Holy Sword, Tenth Rank—Star Mark.]  "Sigh..." Staring at this system prompt, Rhode let out a complicated sigh. Although he didn't know why the ordinary card from the original world here had the function of a summoning card, for Rhode now, this was definitely the most useful aid he could have—  In the game, it was rare to find a weapon with a +2 ability before level fifteen, and "Star Mark" actually had an initial +3 attribute, which was enough to compare a half-crippled summoning swordsman to a standard swordsman.  In addition to its fusable nature, it also meant that as long as he found the right spirit, he could turn it into an attribute weapon. Although as a summoning card, it required the holder to consume soul power to use, which made it somewhat inferior to normal weapons, but just in terms of attack power, it was already a rare and powerful equipment at the time.  However, Rhode was really unable to get completely excited right now, because for him, the situation he was involved in was too strange.  Is this a game? Or reality?  If this is reality, then what should he do?  "Knock knock."  Just then, a knock on the door sounded.  Rhode looked up and saw a middle-aged man entering through the door. He was dressed in an adventurer's leather armor, with a head of bright red hair casually combed back. Seeing Rhode, the man smiled slightly.  "Hello, sir, I am the leader of the Star Moon Mercenary Group, Carter." Chapter 3: Attacked  "Hello, Mr. Carter," Rhodes raised his head and greeted the man in front of him with a smile. "Thank you for coming to our rescue."  "It was nothing, don't mention it." The man was muscular and tall, with disheveled crimson hair that flowed back. Judging from his physique, he seemed to be a Lycatus from the northwestern desert. A long and a short sword hung quietly on either side of his waist, and his chiseled face exuded determination and scrutiny, proof that this man was no ordinary character.  While Rhodes observed the man, Carter was also quietly sizing up the man in front of him. At first glance, one might easily mistake him for an uneducated noble's son because of his slender build, pale skin, and somewhat feminine face, complemented by his attire, which didn't seem fit for adventure travel. He looked more like a wealthy second-generation looking for thrills and bored with leisure. However, Carter believed there was more to this young man than meets the eye, especially because of the peculiar and mysterious magic circle on the back of his right hand. As a spiritualist, Lijie could sense magic from it, indicating that it was not a fake, but in his many years of experience, Carter had rarely seen someone directly engrave a magic circle onto their body. This suggested that the young man's identity was far from simple.  Moreover, from their brief conversation, Carter noticed the young man's demeanor was neither servile nor arrogant. He was calm, and even after waking up from unconsciousness just minutes before, he was able to calmly assess his situation. This alone made him much stronger than those arrogant nobles who were uneducated.  "I heard that you come from the eastern mountains?"  "Yes," Rhodes nodded lightly.  "So, where are you planning to go?"  "I'm just traveling around," Rhodes shrugged. "I am an adventurer. Living freely and adventuring is my life. Of course, rest assured, I won't cause any trouble for you."  "That's good." Since Rhodes was cooperative, Carter didn't say much more. They were still on a mission and didn't want to complicate matters. After a few more words to comfort him and let him rest, Carter soon took his leave. As a mercenary captain, he had many things to do and couldn't afford to waste time here.  The following days were uneventful for Rhodes, although the food that Lijie brought up did pique his interest. Despite it being just ordinary white bread and jerky, and having eaten it many times in the game, it had always been "pretend eating," only restoring life and soul power without any taste or filling his stomach. Now he finally experienced the taste of white bread and jerky as described in the annotations, a novel experience. But it must be said, the taste wasn't as good as described in the annotations.  "How do you feel? Does the wound still hurt?" The blonde girl sat beside Rhodes, looking at the young man with a worried and serious expression, her eyes filled with a touch of sorrow as they rested on his shoulder.  "It's fine now," said Rhodes, clenching his left hand. The pain from his sternum had lessened since the beginning when even breathing felt difficult, but now it was much better.  "That's good," Lijie's tense expression relaxed on hearing Rhodes's response. "But you should rest more. Once we reach Deepstone City, the conditions will be much better, and perhaps your wounds will heal faster." Her expression was very serious. Although the man lying in front of her was a stranger she had just met, her expression showed she didn't mind such details.  "Thank you."  "No need to thank me; it's what I should do." Lijie stood up, her golden fluffy ponytail swinging playfully as she moved.  "Then..." Lijie's words were cut off because, at that moment, the ship suddenly shook. The girl's figure wobbled, almost falling on the bed. Fortunately, she extended her hand to the bedpost at the last moment, managing to stabilize herself.  The two exchanged glances, both seeing a trace of doubt in each other's eyes. Although airships relied on the powerful winds of the tide to move, and the sky didn't have reefs or whirlpools like the sea, it wasn't without dangers. The current situation was clearly not normal.  "I'll go take a look. Rest here; don't worry," Lijie said softly, then immediately turned and left, closing the room door. Watching her leave, Rhodes opened his mouth to speak but said nothing. He was probably older than her; was it necessary for her to talk to him in such a condescending tone? But the next moment, a figure that flew past the window made Rhodes's expression turn serious. He turned his head slightly, carefully watching outside the window. Soon, three or four green figures flashed by, and at the same time, a series of low hums appeared faintly.  "Hiss—" Hearing this sound, Rhodes's heart sank. They were in big trouble!  At that moment, the deck was in chaos. "I never thought we would encounter these damned things." The red-haired mercenary captain with dual swords stood at the forefront, his face stern as he watched the green figures circling the airship. They looked like snakes with bat wings, about a meter long. Although their slender bodies appeared fragile, the sharp fangs revealed in their wide-open mouths could overturn such impressions in the shortest time. Wind snakes.  "It looks like we have entered the territory of wind snakes," the fat merchant hid beside the mercenary captain, his face pale, wiping sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. "Damn it, that cunning Bick, I knew it, I knew there was a problem with him giving me such a route for so little money! This is murder! When I get back, I will let him know what I'm capable of!"  "Let's get out of this encirclement first!" Carter interrupted the merchant's hysterical shout. Looking around, there were hundreds of wind snakes surrounding the merchant ship. At first, he could order his men to use crossbows to attack, hoping to scare off the creatures. But the wind snakes' kamikaze spirit was beyond his imagination, or rather, the death of their companions only incited their ferocity. They had now occupied the outside of the deck and began to breach inward. The mercenaries had also abandoned their crossbows and were wielding their weapons in close combat.  "You, get inside, tell the captain we need to leave quickly!" Carter pushed the fat merchant into the captain's cabin behind him, then stepped forward, his swords flashing, cutting down a wind snake that roared in attack. But soon, another charged at him. There were too few hands on deck! Carter frowned, scanning the deck. He had only taken six people on this mission, and only these six were left. Although the merchant ship had its own guards, their experience was insufficient. In fact, a third of the merchant ship's guards had fallen in the first wave of attacks, and now only half remained, and seeing their panicked and clumsy state, they probably wouldn't last much longer.  Looking at the terrifying creatures, Carter's face was serious. He had faced wind snakes before, but facing such a number was a first, making him a bit nervous. He stepped forward again, his body turning half a circle nimbly, then his swords slashed to the side, heavily striking a wind snake. The injured creature fell to the ground with a few unwilling hisses before becoming a cold corpse. Carter looked up, scanning his surroundings, then his heart leaped.  "Lijie! Be careful!!"  The girl didn't react immediately. She had just finished treating a mercenary's poison wound and was still dazed from the exertion—although she had only been on deck for a few minutes, several people had already been injured. As the only spiritualist with healing power, Lijie naturally took on the responsibility. Hearing Carter's warning, she turned back in confusion. Then, all she saw was a gaping mouth with sharp fangs. In that instant, the girl's blood seemed to freeze. She stared blankly at the wind snake in front of her, her mind blank, not knowing how to react. In her eyes, Lijie could clearly see the sharp, gleaming fangs and the flesh-colored inner walls, and even the foul smell was so distinct. At that moment, a hand suddenly reached out from behind, grabbed Lijie's collar, and pulled her away just in time. Chapter 4: Fierce Battle  The wind serpent bit into thin air. It almost succeeded, if not for the sudden appearance of Rhodes from behind.  "Mr. Rhodes?" Lijie, who had escaped death, raised her head and was surprised to find Rhodes standing behind her, with her leaning into his arms. She was so soft all over, possibly due to being overly frightened, that she couldn't muster any strength.  She instinctively tried to stand up, but her legs gave way, and she sat down instead.  "Lijie!" Seeing Lijie escape death, Carter also breathed a sigh of relief, but soon, his heart tensed up again.  Because at this moment, the wind serpent that had missed its attack had turned around, spread its wings, and raised its head, preparing to launch another attack.  Damn it! He held his twin swords and ran towards the two, hoping to make it in time—but no matter how he looked at it, it seemed too late.  Looking at the wind serpent again, the girl held her breath. She wanted to do something but didn't know what she could do. As a spirit master, she didn't need to use weapons, and she didn't carry any with her.  So, what now? "Leave it to me."  Just as Lijie panicked, she heard Rhodes' voice. Then, she saw him step half a step forward, shielding her.  Was he planning to confront the wind serpent bare-handed? While Lijie was puzzled, she saw Rhodes extend his right hand.  At that moment, Lijie noticed a complex and gorgeous magic circle on the back of Rhodes' right hand, shining with a bright and clear magic glow. Lines spread from it, extending to each finger. A translucent, card-like object slowly emerged from the palm of Rhodes' hand.  Then, Rhodes grasped it with the back of his hand. A dazzling white light suddenly appeared. The invisible magic power released the seal, transforming into a tangible wave of air that spread out in all directions, with the wind serpent at the forefront screaming and flapping its wings, trying to maintain balance under the onslaught of the raging air currents.  But before it could take any further action, a dazzling light burst from the midst of the air currents and struck the serpent's body hard, sending it flying away.  "Phew..." Rhodes exhaled lightly. At this moment, the dazzling light had faded, and in its place was a beautifully exquisite, pure white longsword in his right hand.  He waved the Stardust Sword in his hand, and specks of light dust slowly fell from the sword, constructing a mesmerizing scene. He was completely oblivious to the fact that everyone else was completely stunned.  Lijie sat on the ground, looking at the man in front of her in disbelief, while Carter also slowed down, his eyes filled with surprise and wonder. Although he had sensed that Rhodes was no ordinary person, he had never imagined he would be this "extraordinary."  Although still sitting on the ground, Lijie couldn't help but admire the flawless white longsword. The slender blade was engraved with ancient patterns, emitting a faint glow, and the clearly visible light dust surrounding it was fantastically beautiful. The folded wings on the hilt were exquisitely detailed, with every feather visible.  While women generally showed little interest in weapons, this longsword far surpassed the category of weapons and could even be considered an art piece.  Lijie was purely admiring, but Carter's gaze was somewhat different.  As an experienced adventurer, Carter could swear he had never seen such a bizarre thing. In fact, when Rhodes summoned the weapon, Carter was stunned. Although he had seen some mages perform summoning, they mostly used crystals or such, and they needed to chant some strange incantations, then summon a few ugly monsters, which was not uncommon.  But summoning a weapon? He had never seen such a sight.  Although Carter was still unclear about what Rhodes held in his hand, he was very sure that ordinary people definitely couldn't use such a magical weapon. Only those of noble and special status were qualified to use it.  Now, seeing the lifelike wings on the sword handle, Carter furrowed his brow. He was well aware that on this continent, angels were a very noble race, with most of them being of prominent status or the backbone of important organizations.  For example, the ruler who ascended three years ago in the Mu'en Principality, Lidiya Pafielde Mira Franrica, was an angel.  Although the young man's true identity was still unclear, the sword was enough to confirm that he had some connection with that noble race.  These thoughts flashed through Carter's mind, and at that moment, he had already reached the two of them.  "Are you alright?"  "I, I'm okay."  Lijie's face was still somewhat pale, which could not be blamed on her being faint-hearted. After all, if Rhodes hadn't pulled her out of the way from behind just now, the girl would have been dead for sure. The fear of narrowly escaping death was not something ordinary people could experience.  After making sure Lijie was unharmed, Carter immediately turned his attention to Rhodes beside him.  "Mr. Rhodes, are you alright?"  Rhodes shook his head, indicating he was fine. Although his left side was still in pain from the movement, it didn't affect the battle much. Instead, he was more concerned about another matter.  "What are you planning to do?"  The number of wind serpents was increasing. Although the airship was moving at full speed, it still couldn't escape the attack of the majority of the serpents. Not only had their situation not improved, but it had also gotten worse.  "We plan to break out of their territory. Until then, we can only keep going."  If it were on land, Carter might have other methods, but they were in the air, and apart from this idea, he had no better solution to the current problem.  But Carter had barely spoken when he saw the young man in front of him frown.  "It's too late, Mr. Carter."  "Oh?"  "Wind serpents have an absolute advantage on plains. Even if you speed up, we won't be able to leave before the airship disintegrates."  "Really?"  Carter was not stupid. The reason he made this decision was that he was not familiar with this place. Once Rhodes brought it up, he immediately understood the severity of the situation.  "So, what should we do?"  "Descend immediately."  Rhodes didn't hesitate to give the answer, then he pointed to one side.  "Then we rush in there."  Carter followed the direction of Rhodes' finger, and then, he widened his eyes in surprise.  "You mean we should rush into the Twilight Forest?"  "To get rid of the harassment of the wind serpents, this is our only way. Moreover..."  As he spoke, Rhodes looked around.  "We don't have much time."  The situation was indeed deteriorating. The threat of the wind serpents was not only their poisonous fangs, but the corrosive venom was equally deadly, and they were small and agile. Once a frontal attack failed, they would immediately change their target.  There were already many wind serpents that had broken the glass and drilled into the cabin from below, but there was no way to fend them off in such a situation.  Although the narrow space of the cabin limited the flexibility of the serpents, their threat did not decrease. Therefore, the cabin was in chaos, and the billowing smoke from several breaches indicated the situation was extremely bad!  Carter did not hesitate any longer and immediately turned and left.  Rhodes, holding the Stardust Sword, blocked the front breach.  "Hiss!" A wind serpent flew in from the right, opening its mouth wide to attack Rhodes, but in the instant it charged, Rhodes had already moved to the left, and his white longsword swept up sharply, hitting the serpent's chin and sending it flying while blocking the hastily ejected venom.  Then Rhodes quickly turned around, his silver-white sword drawing a light curtain in the air, accurately piercing another serpent trying to attack from behind. As it lost balance, he delivered another strike, ending the serpent's life.  But the onslaught of the serpents did not stop. The smell of blood unmistakably aggravated them. As Rhodes pulled his longsword from the body of the now dead serpent, dozens of wind serpents pounced on him. They layered upon each other, looking from a distance like a green fog or a monstrous beast opening its maw, ready to swallow its prey in an instant.  "Mr. Rhodes!" After helping another mercenary dispel toxins, Lijie turned around to see this scene and couldn't help but cry out.  Streams of acid shot out like torrential rain toward Rhodes. If he were hit, he would likely be seriously injured or killed.  But at that moment, Rhodes swiftly retreated. The acid, reeking of decay, brushed past him, landing on the deck and corroding small holes with rising green smoke. But almost at the same time, the serpents had reached Rhodes, ready to tear apart the dangerous man in front of them.  If it was an ordinary person, they would have been terrified, but Rhodes was very calm. Facing the serpents surging forward to tear him apart, all he did was raise his sword and thrust forward.  Activate the Blade of Breakage. The white blade burst among the serpents, splitting from one to two, two to four, and several blades quickly shot forward, piercing one serpent after another. The powerful air currents swept up like invisible hands, cruelly tearing apart the bodies of those who were lucky not to be hit.  Almost in an instant, the green fog was torn apart by the dazzling light, leaving only scattered flesh.  Everyone held their breath at that moment. Chapter 5: Critical Moment  The fierce offensive of the wind serpent swarm paused momentarily, and on the deck that was originally chaotic, filled with angry shouts, calls, and screams, there appeared an instant of silence. Everyone looked at the young man with eyes of disbelief, completely unsure of what to say. Just a moment ago, almost everyone thought the young man was done for; they had never seen anyone retreat unscathed from the attack of dozens of wind serpents. Of course, that might have been possible for high-level professionals or fully armored shield warriors. But the young man didn't appear to be very old, and aside from the white longsword held in his hand, he had no other protective gear. Yet, he had done it.  At this moment, not only the mercenaries but also Lijie and Carter were stupefied as they looked at the young man, their hearts tumultuous. Who exactly was he? Perhaps it was the intimidation of Rod's attack that caused the wind serpents, which were originally attacking the airship desperately, to scatter and retreat. For a while, the deck was so quiet that nothing could be heard except the howling wind.  The mercenaries were shocked by Rod's performance, but for Rod himself, he didn't care about what he had done. Instead, looking at the pile of corpses at his feet, he felt a sense of relief in his heart. Though wind serpents are among the lowest level of monsters and aren't particularly strong, they are creatures that triumph through numbers. Rod's class as a summoning swordsman excelled in solo battles, but was not as effective when it came to dealing with large groups. In fact, the reason for his smooth success this time was mainly due to the initial +3 trait of the "Stardust" in his hand, which meant that while holding this sword, Rod's attributes could be increased by three points. An increase of three points was enough to change the danger level of a monster from red to green. Therefore, it wasn't particularly surprising for Rod to defeat this group of wind serpents.  However, Rod still found it strange. If his attributes were calculated based on human standards, then even with "Stardust", he should not have had such a sweeping victory and overwhelming advantage. He originally estimated that Blade of Breaking would at most leave the wind serpents critically weakened, so he was prepared to finish them off with additional attacks. Unexpectedly, the power of Blade of Breaking was far beyond his imagination; it actually wiped out the group of wind serpents entirely.  Is it possible that his attributes were not calculated based on human standards? With this thought, Rod subconsciously tried to access his attribute panel, but regrettably, since his race had not yet been determined, his attributes were hidden and could not be checked. Fortunately, this battle granted him 1900 experience points—surprisingly, there were indeed experience points to be gained, which Rod found quite astonishing.  Of course, for Rod, this only took a couple of seconds. To the onlookers, he merely gazed silently at the pile of corpses at his feet for a moment, then lifted his head again. It was then that Rod noticed the eerie silence around him, which was not due to the shock of the others, but the presence of an even more dangerous and lethal being. Where had the wind serpent swarm gone?  This thought flashed through Rod's mind, and then it seemed he remembered something. He swiftly turned around and yelled, "Everyone be careful...!"  At that moment, the airship suddenly shook violently. The intense shaking caused many people to fall to the ground, and two unlucky ones who failed to stand firm in time slipped and fell off the ship. Simultaneously, a crisp cracking noise came from the deck at the bow, followed by a giant serpent's head bursting forth. "Be careful, it's the wind serpent lord!" Carter finally appeared, shouting loudly, then drawing the twin swords at his side and rushing towards the huge wind serpent.  The other mercenaries also quickly got up, and although they were already battered and bruised, they clenched their teeth and followed their leader, trying to launch an attack against this colossal creature. However, Rod was quicker than all of them. He crouched down and lines of system prompts immediately appeared before his eyes.  [Experience points 1900/200, level up available, skill point gained: 1, level 2] [Experience points 1700/400, level up available, skill point gained: 2, level 3] [Experience points 1300/600, skill point gained: 3, level 4] [Experience points 800/1000, skill point gained: 4, level 5] [Consume 1 skill point, upgrade Moonshadow Sword Technique 1/3, proficiency E] [Consume 1 skill point, upgrade Moonshadow Sword Technique 2/3, proficiency E] [Consume 1 skill point, upgrade Moonshadow Sword Technique 3/3, proficiency E] [Consume 1 skill point, upgrade Moonshadow Sword Technique 1/4, proficiency D———Shadow Flash unlocked]  Activate.  Rod leapt into action. In that instant, everyone only saw a blur before their eyes, then saw the young man on the ground transform into a black shadow, slicing through the sky like a blade charging forward. Even the enormous wind serpent lord had no time to react. When Rod soared up and arrived in front of it, the serpent lord even seemed somewhat puzzled—it had never encountered such a bizarre situation where prey jumped up and delivered itself to its mouth.  Rod raised his longsword, and the radiance of stardust seemed to be drawn by an invisible force, condensing on the immaculate blade in that moment. Then he aimed for the wind serpent lord's eyes, as large as bells, and thrust down forcefully. "Blade of Breaking!"  Faced with the oncoming sword light, the wind serpent lord's first reaction was to dodge. After consecutively upgrading Moonshadow Sword Technique four times, the quantity and power of Blade of Breaking had surged dramatically. Dozens of silver-white blades erupted from the sword, spiraling and shooting forward.  One, two, three...  At first, the serpent lord's tough scales barely withstood the initial sword light, but even with its lord-level protection, it only held up until the twentieth blade before completely collapsing. The following sword lights easily tore through the scales and flesh, piercing its body.  Although the wind serpent lord was massive, Rod smartly chose a point to break through. Under his control, the blades did not scatter as before but concentrated on the serpent's neck, successfully breaching its defense. The wind serpent lord let out a piercing shriek, then heavily fell downwards. However, it did not give up on attacking. Even with its left neck severely mutilated, the lord still abruptly lifted its head, fixating on Rod, and then suddenly opened its wide mouth.  Rod's figure flickered, and once again, he turned into a phantom and quickly retreated. As he pulled back, a foul-smelling venom shot upwards, narrowly missing Rod's afterimage and hitting the mast behind him. Quickly, under the venom's corrosion, the originally thick and sturdy mast melted away within seconds and then collapsed with a crash.  BOSSes are still BOSSes after all. Based on Rod's experience in games, the average level of wind serpents is around level three, while their leaders are generally level ten. This BOSS in front of him should not exceed level ten. Although with Carter and the mercenaries' cover, defeating this BOSS wouldn't be difficult, Rod realized that this was probably not an ordinary lord-level monster but an elite. After all, an ordinary lord-level monster would have lost its wings to Rod's previous strike.  But the reality was that despite Rod's full effort, he only left a deep wound on the lord, which was very telling. "Attack its wings and try to stay away from its mouth! Attack from the side!" Rod commanded Carter and the other mercenaries while entangling with the wind serpent lord. As a summoning swordsman, he wasn't the main tank, but it seemed that the others lacked experience in combat with the wind serpent lord.  In the game, a team wipe due to lack of experience could be redone, but here, Rod didn't want to take that risk—his previously healed wound on the left chest was now burning with pain, as if it had split open again. If he were to die here due to a team wipe, it would be an embarrassing joke.  Moreover, although he was only level five now, Rod believed that as long as the opponent's level didn't exceed level fifteen, he had the confidence to fight. After all, in the Dragon Soul Continent, three classes are known for defeating monsters above their level: mages, rangers, and lastly, summoning swordsmen.  Mages are known for their unpredictable spells, rangers excel with their long-distance "kiting", and summoning swordsmen are essentially about outnumbering enemies. For these three classes, even a level difference of more than five levels is as easy as eating and drinking, until they reach non-elite BOSSes of up to ten levels apart.  Even so, these three classes also have their flaws—mages without mana are just targets; even a group of low-level fairies could beat them to death. Rangers, when approached closely, face complete tragedy, while summoning swordsmen have too much randomness and are complicated to the point where there's no template to follow. That's why these three classes haven't caused a big stir in the game. This also reflects the more realistic setting of the Dragon Soul Continent—either take an unconventional path and gamble, or move forward steadily and safely. Players can freely decide their fate and future.  The Night Raven Lord in front of him was a level ten elite BOSS, but due to the bonus from the Stardust in his hand, its defense was at most on a level six or seven standard. So Rod wasn't worried about insufficient damage in defense, but in terms of attack...  "Whoosh!" A fierce wind suddenly arose. Rod's figure abruptly flickered, dodging and retreating rapidly with a series of afterimages, narrowly avoiding the serpent's wing attack. The wing that missed struck heavily on the deck, smashing a large hole in the thick and solid surface.  It was indeed the attack power of a level ten elite. Rod wiped the sweat from his forehead; he was only level five now and had no equipment. If he were to be hit by that sweep, even the Lord of Heaven might not be able to save him. Although he was worried about Carter and the others, fortunately, it seemed that because he had caused significant damage to the wind serpent lord, it had focused its hatred on him. Unfortunately, being targeted by a BOSS with such high attack power put a lot of pressure on non-tank classes...  His soul power had dropped to a third, and Rod felt tired. Although he had anticipated a tough battle upon seeing the wind serpent lord, the current pressure was too great. He needed Shadow Flash to help dodge attacks because, with his current speed, avoiding the wind serpent lord's assaults was practically impossible. On the other hand, he also needed Blade of Breaking to inflict damage and take down this troublesome foe as quickly as possible. But it was not easy.  The airship was slowly losing altitude, but under the wind serpent lord's attacks, it swayed from side to side, like a small boat in a storm, making everyone's hearts leap. Two mercenaries had already been thrown off and were unlikely to survive.  Carter was still trying to drive away the wind serpent lord; his twin swords danced in front of him, attacking the serpent lord's side with agility, but to little effect. If it weren't for Lijie casting healing light on these mercenaries from time to time, they wouldn't have been able to hold on until now.  He must find a way, otherwise, before the airship could land, it might be torn apart by this damn snake. With this thought, Rod bit his lip. The wind serpent lord's attacks did not weaken; its wings stretched out long at its side, and the two claws on the edges were firmly grasping the edge of the ship's bow.  Although Rod's previous attack had inflicted considerable damage, as a lord-level creature, it obviously wouldn't retreat just because of those injuries. On the contrary, the cunning wind serpent lord seemed to have detected its enemies' weakness. Its sharp claws held fast to the airship's hull, shaking and pulling at its prey with force.  Although the airship's body was not fragile, it had already been battered in the battle with the wind serpent swarm. Coupled with the howling wind surges hitting the hull, it started to twist and deform. Even the deck had several alarming cracks, making a chilling sound of rupture.  "Oh my God! Oh my God!" Curled up in a corner of the captain's cabin, the fat merchant trembled as he stared at the terrifying wind serpent lord outside. His voice was twisted with nervousness and fear. "That damned Richard! Don't let me see him; I will surely take his life! To give me such a route, it's murder!" Upon saying this, the fat merchant shuddered violently and then turned his gaze to the captain beside him. "And you! With such a terrifying thing, why didn't you warn me earlier!?"  The captain did not respond to the fat merchant's angry shouts. At the moment, he was tightly holding the helm, his eyes fixed on the front. At the same time, he cursed this damn fool inwardly. He had warned him that taking this route at this time of year might provoke the wind serpent swarm, but the man had been indifferent.  Now, when death was imminent, he had the audacity to blame himself! If he had known it would come to this, he would never have taken on this job! Chapter 6 Fall Bad situation. Both Rod and Carter had the same thought at this moment, the lord of the wind serpents was really difficult to deal with. Although the airship was descending rapidly and the forest nearby could be seen clearly, if it continued like this, the airship might disintegrate in the air before it even had a chance to land on the ground!  "Ha!" Carter leaped forward, his twin swords in hand drawing two cold lights in the air, stabbing straight at the giant claws of the wind serpent lord in front of him. But just as he was about to succeed, the wind serpent lord suddenly opened its mouth, and Carter only felt a stench hit his face. He didn't even have time to confirm what it was and had to roll on the spot, evading the hiss of the wind serpent lord, which also meant the failure of his attack.  However, just as Carter stood up and tried to pull away from the space, the wind serpent lord seemed to find this little bug too annoying and suddenly struck out with its claw. Carter, who did not expect the wind serpent lord to let go of the ship's body, was caught off guard. He instinctively raised his twin swords to block, but was still knocked away. After sliding several meters on the deck, he finally stopped against the mast.  This couldn't go on. Rod frowned, then he looked towards the girl standing not far behind, her face anxious.  "Lije, I need your help!"  "Eh?"  "I will draw its attention. When it attacks me, I hope you can cast a protective shield on me!"  "Okay!" Hearing Rod's words, Lije didn't hesitate at all and nodded her head.  She clasped her hands tightly, a bright, gentle light emerging on her body.  Seeing this, Rod didn't say anything more. He just turned his head and then raised his long sword, thrusting forward violently.  Shattered Blade. The bright, snow-like blade of light once again swept across the air, heavily striking the body of the wind serpent lord. Although this time Rod did not intentionally concentrate the blade of light, but let them scatter and attack, so the power was smaller than before and did not penetrate the wind serpent lord's scales. However, the scattered attack tore several distinct bloodstains on the thin membranes of the wind serpent lord's wings, causing it to cry out in pain and anger, "Hiss!!!"  The wind serpent lord's movements halted abruptly. It quickly turned its head, its two red eyes burning with angry flames, staring intently at the young human on the deck, then it opened its mouth again and pounced towards Rod at great speed.  The wind serpent lord was indeed fast, in the blink of an eye, Rod could see its blood-red mouth appearing above his head, which made Rod tense his nerves. This was a very risky choice. He deliberately did not use Shadow Flash but maintained a relatively slow speed to lure the wind serpent lord into attacking. Although this would be very dangerous, when the enemy was fully attacking, its weaknesses would also become obvious—this was the opportunity Rod was waiting for!  The wind serpent lord's gaping maw was right in front of him, so close that in a few seconds, Rod would be swallowed by it. But it still could not achieve its goal. Because at that moment, a faint, white glowing egg-shaped barrier suddenly appeared on Rod, blocking the wind serpent lord's fangs. Although the wind serpent lord's actions slowed down, in the next moment it completely shattered the barrier, but it bit into nothing.  Because when the protective shield enveloped him, Rod had already activated Shadow Flash. He, like a ghostly shadow, dodged the wind serpent lord's bite, then raised the pure white long sword in his hand, slashing across its throat.  This was the weak point of the wind serpent lord, and also the most vulnerable part of its body. However, before this it had always been shrinking its neck, so it was very difficult to attack. But this time, the wind serpent lord, provoked by Rod, had completely opened up its attack, and therefore, it no longer had time to protect its most fatal weakness.  A sharp cry sounded, the wind serpent lord seemed to have been electrocuted, raising its head, and from its throat, filthy blood sprayed out, covering the entire deck. Then, its body softened and it collapsed heavily onto the deck, no longer breathing.  Just then, Rod saw a deep green color rapidly expanding in front of his eyes.  "Boom!!!" Then, he only felt a sudden shake of the ship's body, and his body seemed to float in the air for a moment. Afterward, Rod's vision went dark, and he completely lost consciousness.  When he woke up again, the first thing he felt was the bone-chilling cold wind.  "Where am I............" Opening his eyes, the first thing that came into view was a beautiful night sky. Unlike a normal night, the night here was very "bright", with soft moonlight shining down, casting every leaf's shadow on the ground.  In the night sky, in addition to the myriad stars, there were streaks of light, which condensed and converged into a ribbon of light, extending in all directions. This was a characteristic of the Dragon Soul Continent—according to ancient legends, this was originally a chaotic and dangerous space. Then, five giant dragons came here, creating the heavens, the earth, and everything with their bodies.  To suppress the evil chaos, after creating the world with their bodies, the five giant dragons also invested their souls into it, to suppress the evil chaotic forces and protect the order of this world. Each of the giant dragon's souls had its own unique form, like the sky above Rod's head now, representing the protected area of the Light Dragon Soul. Its characteristic is that even in the night, there would be light shining.  In contrast, the protected area of the Dark Dragon Soul is in darkness, even during the day, without any shadow of light. As such, the distribution of species on the continent is quite regular. In the area protected by the Light Dragon Soul, one can see various green plants thriving. But in the Dark Dragon Soul region, only traces of noctilucent plants can be seen.  Of course, this characteristic also affects the distribution of various races on the continent. Humans mostly gather under the protection of the Light Dragon Soul, followed by elves and angels. And undead, vampires, and nightmares and other dark races naturally become residents of the dark kingdom.  There are no gods on this continent. If one had to say, the five giant dragons that created heaven and earth are the objects of their worship. Similarly, this also includes the bearers of the Dragon Souls. Souls have their cores, even the giant dragons that created heaven and earth are no exception, and their soul cores will reside in someone's body, and this person can use this power to adjust the Dragon Soul's protection over the continent.  For example, if chaos is a virus, and the power of the Dragon Soul is a firewall, then the person holding the soul core is like a CPU. As long as the CPU can still compute, the firewall will not fail and is sufficient to completely repel all chaotic forces from this world. And these bearers of the soul cores are also regarded as the inheritors of the Dragon's Soul.  However, for Rod now, this doesn't mean much.  Rod slowly stood up, the intense pain sweeping through his body, especially the injury on the left side of his chest, now seemed even more serious. Before, Rod could still barely move his left hand, but now he couldn't move it at all. Even just moving a finger, he would feel as if his entire arm was soaked in a sea of fire.  But this made Rod relieved. If there was feeling, it meant his arm was still there. If there was no feeling at all, that would be a big problem.  Looking up, with the help of the bright moonlight, the first thing Rod saw was the wreckage of the airship, the tall trees around indicating that they were in a forest. With this, it was clear what had happened.  Although Rod killed the wind serpent lord, the airship, already fragile, was destroyed because it could not withstand the violent impact during the descent.  At this moment, the forest was silent, not even the sound of insects could be heard. Rod looked around and saw bloodstains and bodies everywhere on the ground, both of wind serpents and humans. And not far from Rod, a small figure was lying there, motionless.  "Lije!" Rod hurried to the girl's side, bending down to closely observe her condition. Fortunately, although the girl looked pale with her hands tightly clenched, her breathing was still even, and after Rod called to her, it didn’t take too long for the girl to open her eyes.  "Where am I........." Lije opened her eyes confusedly, staring at the man in front of her, and after a while, she seemed to regain her senses. It seemed she had taken quite a fall.  "I'm still alive?"  "That's right." Seeing Lije respond to his words, Rod was relieved, and the girl slowly stood up. She shook her head, bit her lip tightly, seemingly not fully recovered yet. But for the girl, there were more important things to do now.  "Where is everyone? The leader? How are they?"  "..............." Rod didn't answer, but Lije didn't need one, because at this moment, she had already clearly seen the scene around her. The originally pale face of the girl was now exceptionally stiff.  "How could this be......... Krite! Shal! Leader!" The girl rushed to the bodies of the mercenaries, desperately calling their names, but no one responded. However, Lije didn't give up, she squatted down and carefully checked the mercenaries in front of her, and after confirming that they were dead, she didn't cry but bit her teeth and ran to the next person.  But the girl's efforts did not get the deserved return. Facing those bodies that were already cold and stiff, she could do nothing.  Although Lije kept insisting, when she saw Carter's figure, she couldn't help but fall to the ground with weak knees. The leader of the mercenaries, who was previously in high spirits, had now also become a cold body. Half of his body was stuck in the gap of the deck, a broken wooden stake piercing through his abdomen.  "Leader...... Leader......" Seeing this, Lije sat dumbfounded on the somewhat damp ground, the flame of hope completely extinguished from her eyes, replaced by confusion and sadness. In the end, the girl lowered her head. Although she didn't speak, the faint sobbing carried by the night wind still reached Rod's ears.  Looking at the slightly trembling shoulders of the blonde girl in front of him, Rod could only silently stand behind her, unable to say a word. During the battle because of the matter of life and death, he had not paid attention to these. But now, when everything was over, looking at the corpses all around, Rod still felt complicated emotions.  He had seen bodies before, but those were only simulated scenes in the game. In the game, people could be resurrected with magic, or run back as a soul, but this was not a game. There were no resurrections, and no running back after death. Dead, meant dead.  At this moment, Rod seemed to recall that night seven years ago, he could only watch helplessly, unable to do anything—death resolutely passed by his side, but he couldn't even stop it.  Just as he was about to say something to comfort the girl in front of him, suddenly, a faint cry for help came.  "Hey......... Is anyone there? Help me........." Chapter 7: After the Disaster  Mace sat awkwardly by the fire, his plump face revealing feelings of helplessness and gloom. He wanted to lash out in anger, but he didn't know at whom to direct it.  On the other side of the fire, Rhode leaned quietly against a tree trunk, resting with his eyes closed.  Lize, silent and speechless, was preparing food. Although her expression appeared calm, her swollen eyes told a different story.  It was uncertain whether it was luck or misfortune, but the portly merchant ended up being the only other survivor of the disaster besides Rhode and Lize. As a merchant who often traveled, he had some magical artifacts for self-preservation. During the airship crash, the protective amulet in the merchant's hand exhibited its excellent and stable function, making him the least injured among the three.  Rhode's previous injuries had not yet fully healed. After the intense battle and fall, his condition worsened.  Lize wasn't faring much better. It wasn't until the tension eased that everyone realized not only had her right arm been dislocated, but she had also hurt her foot.  The only injuries the portly merchant sustained were some scratches and a concussion, but otherwise, he was fine. For an ordinary person, such injuries would have been enough to keep them bedridden for months.  Fortunately, Lize was a full-time Spirit Master, and healing was her specialty. Under her treatment, everyone's injuries improved. However, Rhode still needed some time to recover fully. Given his original condition and the subsequent battle, he should have been either dead or crippled, but now he was intact except for some limitations in movement due to his injuries. This greatly surprised Lize; since they had rescued Rhode, she had been taking care of him and was well aware of his condition. However, even she hadn't anticipated his body to be so resilient.  Not only was Lize surprised, but Rhode was also secretly astonished. Even though he had realized during the battle that his body wasn't measured by human standards, he had not expected it to be so extraordinary. To have survived such severe injuries, the intense battle, and being thrown to the ground, and still be able to move... could his mixed heritage be that of a barbarian?  There was another thing Rhode did not voice: he was well aware of the exceptional nature of his body, even though he didn't yet know what it was. It was definitely not that of a pure human. But the golden-haired girl's performance was quite odd. By all accounts, as a frail girl and a non-combat class Spirit Master, she should have perished. He could survive and move about because his body was non-human, so what was the reason for her survival and agility? It couldn't just be luck.  Rhode's question was answered when he noticed a hint of gold in Lize's beautiful azure eyes—it seemed that the young lady's survival was indeed more than just good fortune.  "Mister Rhode?" Mace rubbed his hands, his chubby face showing a clear attempt at ingratiating himself. "What do you think we should do next?"  After rescuing Mace, the trio searched the airship wreckage again but found no other survivors. To prevent their companions' bodies from becoming food for the beasts of the forest, Lize suggested cremation. Although Mace was reluctant to part with his valuable goods, seeing Lize's sullen face and Rhode's indifferent attitude, he had to change his mind. He watched with a pained expression as the airship was burned to ashes—it seemed like he was the one most grievously injured.  Although the expensive protective amulet had saved his life, it was now shattered from the impact and had become a piece of junk. It was clear that Mace's losses were significant.  Afterward, the group rested in the forest for a day. Although they encountered no trouble, the attack by the serpent flock had turned the fat merchant into a scaredy-cat. He had previously claimed that serpents were a small probability event and not a concern, but now he changed his mind completely. Those small probability rumors now seemed one hundred percent accurate to him. "Look, they said this route might encounter serpent flocks, and we really did meet them! And I've also heard that the Silvermoon Forest has man-eating wolves and terrifying birds. We couldn't possibly run into those as well, could we?" Once bitten, twice shy, as the saying goes.  Thinking of these possibilities, sweat beads formed on Mace's forehead. As a merchant, he was decent, but he lacked adventurer experience. Now, looking around at the dense shrubbery and trees, his legs trembled. The casual conversations he had once heard from his guards about poisonous snakes in the grass and evil wolves now vividly appeared in his mind, leaving him on edge.  With his only life-saving item now worthless, he had no choice but to rely on others. He didn't consider relying on Lize; she was obedient and likeable but lacked decisiveness, and as a non-combat class, she wouldn't be of much help in an emergency. In the end, Mace decided to rely on Rhode.  Although he wasn't a fighter, Rhode's performance had been very impressive, showing he had outstanding strength. Mace didn't know how Rhode's adventure experience compared to that of the mercenaries, but it probably wasn't far off.  As for Lize, she still seemed immersed in the grief of losing her companions and didn't care about such matters.  "Don't worry, Mister Mace." Rhode shook his head at the anxious merchant. He didn't dislike Mace; after all, if Mace hadn't ordered the airship to stop, Rhode might not have been saved. So Rhode was somewhat fond of him.  "I'm very familiar with the Silvermoon Forest. Based on our current location, it's unlikely we'll encounter any particularly dangerous creatures. You can rest easy."  Rhode's statement wasn't without basis. In the game, the northern plains of Paphield were a gathering place for new players, so Rhode knew the distribution of monsters in the area very well. The most threatening creatures in the plain were the serpent flocks, which were the nightmare of many melee classes and non-solo classes. In the Silvermoon Forest, the most dangerous were the silver wolves. Unlike the serpents that relied on numbers, silver wolves mostly acted alone, making them easier to handle.  Moreover, after killing the serpent leader, Rhode gained 3000 experience points and reached level eight. Since the newbie area was capped at level ten, Rhode was confident that as long as he didn't encounter rare elite bosses, he could handle himself in this region. The likelihood of him blundering into some deadly monster den, as some inexperienced players might, was essentially nil for someone known as a "walking library" like Rhode.  "That's good to hear." Mace sighed in relief and wiped the sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. Due to the high stress, he had hardly slept properly all day. Even the sound of the wind through the trees sounded like wolf howls to him. Now that he had made his decision, he seemed much more relaxed and stopped worrying about anything. He curled up by the fire and comfortably closed his eyes. With that mindset, Mace squinted and soon fell into a deep sleep.  Once Rhode confirmed that Mace was sound asleep, he quietly stood up from his seat by the fire and walked into the depths of the forest. Chapter 8 The Ten Primordial Essences, The Card of Wind  Rhode certainly had no intention of abandoning the fat merchant. On the contrary, his reason for leaving was merely to inspect his spoils of war. During the previous battle, Rhode had gained a wealth of experience but did not obtain many spoils. Although for players, the crashed airship was a treasure trove, and with so many dead, there must have been a considerable amount of wealth on them. However, Rhode eventually dismissed this idea. After all, the other party had saved his life. It was somewhat indefensible to now go and loot the possessions of the deceased.  While experience was valuable, what made Rhode feel that he truly profited was something else entirely. It was the black primal stone he now held in his hand. According to the lore of the Dragon Soul Continent, this was a Soul Core formed from the condensation of a powerful magical creature's soul at the moment of its death.  Its properties were diverse; it could be used as a gem inlaid into weapons or melted down to forge a Soul Weapon. For spellcasters, it was also an excellent material for making magical tools. Additionally, since the drop rate of Soul Cores was very low, their price was always high in the world of the Dragon Soul Continent. For a Summoning Swordsman, they served an irreplaceable function. This was precisely the treasure needed to awaken summoning spirits.  At this moment, Rhode stood deep within a dense forest. He raised his right hand, revealing the Soul Core the size of a nut, emitting a rich dark aura, lying quietly in his palm. Surrounding him was the calm and gentle wilderness, with the midnight moonlight shining through the leaves, scattering specks of light upon the ground and bushes.  Subsequently, the summoning magic circle on the back of Rhode's hand lit up once more, with its streamlined magical brilliance quickly extending outward. Then, a system notification appeared before Rhode.  [Contaminated Soul Core detected. Would you like to purify it?] "Purify."  Soon after, the summoning circle on the back of Rhode's right hand once again emanated a pristine gleam, flowing like water down his fingers and enveloping the Soul Core at the center of his palm. As the holy power infiltrated the core, the strands of black mist wrapped around it melted away like snow under the sunlight, leaving no trace. With the disappearance of the black mist, the true form of the Soul Core was finally revealed—a translucent core emitting a deep blue radiance, trembling slightly as if it were an egg-shaped gemstone, struggling to break free.  [Soul Core purified. Would you like to awaken it?] "Awaken."  Following Rhode's command, the trembling of the deep blue egg-shaped gemstone intensified. Then, with a soft "pop," the gemstone shattered instantly. Streams of blue energy, smooth as water, burst forth, rapidly spinning and coiling before transforming into the shape of a card, which finally came to rest quietly in Rhode's hand.  A cool, comfortable sensation spread from within Rhode's body, causing him to shiver with pleasure. At that moment, Rhode also came to know what kind of existence had formed a contract with him.  He picked up the card; on the front was a greenish-blue spiritual bird soaring in the sky, with a cyan-blue half-circle in the upper right corner (representing the card's element), and a "V" in the upper left corner. On the bottom left and right corners were two small numbers—2.  Rhode flipped the card over, and soon, the back revealed rows of text shimmering with magical light.  [Soaring Spirit Bird (Wind Elemental Attribute): A flying fusion spirit with a 10% chance to trigger paralysis and penetration effects during attack, ineffective against magical protection— Holding Skill: Spirit Wind Illusion (Children of the wind soaring in the sky, an area-of-effect skill)] [You have obtained 1/10 of the Sky Deck, Soaring Spirit Bird]  What luck.  Rhode couldn't help but smile. A flying summoning spirit was essential for a Summoning Swordsman in the early stages, and its wind elemental attribute allowed it to pass through non-magical objects easily, rendering ordinary protection meaningless. Combined with a 30-meter effective range and special effects, Rhode could at least ensure that he wouldn't face too much danger. Even if he accidentally encountered mutant bosses, he had the confidence to battle them.  However, what troubled Rhode the most was his attributes. Until now, his strength, constitution, agility, and willpower remained hidden, which made him somewhat uneasy. Although it was his own body, the current state it exhibited far surpassed Rhode's normal level. He was certain that his attributes were above those of humans, but this feeling of not being able to grasp the details of his own condition was not pleasant.  You think you're going to die, but then you don't. That's a beautiful misunderstanding. But if you think you won't die, and then you do, that's a damned nightmare. Since he couldn't see his attributes, Rhode could only rely on his experience and guesswork.  Through the battle with the Wind Serpent Lord, Rhode had some clues. After all, he had studied the data of a boss like the Wind Serpent Lord in detail. From the battle, it seemed that his strength was roughly on par with a standard swordsmanship practitioner, and his constitution was quite robust. Since arriving in this world, although he had faced several crises, Rhode's body seemed to have withstood the tests, with the lowest alert level never reaching a critical state. As for speed, it wasn't much different from an ordinary human. But Rhode couldn't test his willpower—he couldn't just ask a mage to cast mental spells on him to see how much he could resist.  Just then, a slight rustling sound came from the bushes, and Rhode raised his eyebrows. He lowered his right hand, the glow of the summoning circle on the back of his hand dimming in an instant, and the card he was holding turned into motes of magical dust and disappeared.  Once sealed as a card and the relationship confirmed with the holder, the sealed cards no longer appear in physical form. They would quietly sleep within the summoning circle, in the ring known as "The Ten Primordial Essences," waiting for their owner to awaken them. Currently, only two cards were sealed within—the attributeless "Star Scar" and the Wind Elemental "Spirit Bird," both in the outermost ring of the "Kingdom."  Rhode had no intention of revealing his abilities too much in front of others. Although it was introduced in the game that Summoning Swordsmen were an exclusive class for players, having existed on the continent during the ancient times, and players were the sole inheritors of this profession, embarking on a journey to find and restore the glory of this once-heroic profession——  Of course, this was all nonsense from the game introduction. If put more practically, by observing the expressions of Lijie and Mess, Rhode could confirm that these people had no idea about the existence of such a profession. Thus, he wasn't inclined to say much more. Besides, maintaining a sense of mystery was not without its benefits.  As Rhode was about to turn around, he saw Lijie emerging from the woods.  "Lijie? Do you need something from me?" "Ah... No, it's nothing, Mr. Rhode."  Lijie shook her head, but her expression was somewhat uneasy.  "Well... I just wanted to ask how your wound is, and if there's anything I can do..." Her voice grew fainter towards the end, her hands tightly clutching the hem of her robe, giving off an exceedingly fragile impression.  In fact, Rhode had noticed Lijie's unusual behavior. Mess could see her traits because, as a merchant who traveled far and wide, he wouldn't have lasted long without keen observation. Rhode, on the other hand, could see through her character because of his experience as the leader of the first major guild in the game Dragon Soul Continent. Players in the online world hide behind their characters, making their behavior even more secretive than in real life.  In such a virtual world, it was crucial to be sensitive to gather collective strength, as most players come to the game for enjoyment, not to treat it like work. To ask them to log in on time, raid on schedule, and refresh records to achieve success—if one couldn't balance and handle these aspects well, it would be difficult to manage.  Therefore, observing the emotions and inner thoughts of one's companions was very important for a guild leader like Rhode. Now, Lijie's behavior clearly showed her lack of reliance, making the girl very insecure. Rhode could also see that losing her companions had a significant impact on her, not just because familiar people had left her side but also due to a sense of uncertainty and fear about the future.  During the previous battle, Rhode had taken the time to observe the girl. She did everything very well, applying healing spells to her companions in the shortest time, quickly dispelling their toxins, and the protective shield she cast on Rhode was timed to the second. Her abilities were quite outstanding for a support class.  Moreover, at that time, she was confident with a clear goal, unfazed and undaunted by danger. But now, this trembling girl had lost all her previous confidence. There was only one reason for this. Chapter 9 Departure  Looking at the young girl in front of him, Rhode let out a sigh. "Lydia, the person who should be most worried right now is you. From last night until now, you haven't had a proper rest."  Hearing the words "last night," Lydia's body suddenly shrank, as if she had once again remembered that incident. Despite this, the girl stubbornly bit her lip and then shook her head.  "No... I..."  "Slap!"  Before Lydia could finish speaking, Rhode had already raised his hand and delivered a heavy slap to her face.  What was he doing?!  Clutching her reddened cheek, Lydia couldn't believe it and opened her eyes wide in surprise, looking at Rhode in front of her. Yet, the young man just quietly watched her and then spoke.  "I can understand what you're thinking right now."  Hearing this calm statement, almost devoid of any emotional fluctuations, a surge of anger immediately erupted from deep within Lydia. She lowered her hand and clenched her fists tightly, as if she wanted to refute Rhode's irresponsible remarks. However, Rhode's next words completely drained her of the energy to do so.  "Just because you are different, you feel guilty for being able to survive. For a half-angel like you, such thoughts are not necessarily correct."  "!!"  Lydia was taken aback upon hearing this. She instinctively crossed her arms in front of her and took two or three steps back until she hit a large tree behind her and stopped. But even then, Lydia still didn't pay it any mind.  She just stared at the man in front of her, opened her mouth, but could not say anything.  How could he possibly know? No, it was impossible. She had never told him, and even within the mercenary group, only a few knew about this.  "How did you..."  "Your eyes."  Rhode extended a finger.  "Your eyes reflect a golden radiance under the light, which is the mark of an 'Emissary of Light,' an angel. But unlike pureblood angels, the light in your eyes is not dazzling, and this is the part that is obscured by your human heritage—is that not so?"  The girl did not speak.  Although she did not respond, Rhode had already confirmed that his guess was not wrong. The young girl standing before him was indeed a half-angel. In fact, he had been observing Lydia for some time. As a top player, throughout his long gaming career, Rhode was already familiar with judging opponent attributes through equipment and features.  This was not only useful in boss battles to formulate the most suitable tactics in the shortest time but also in PVP combat to take the initiative. It could be said that this was a skill that all seasoned players would inevitably master.  In fact, after Rhode and Lydia were rescued, he began to consciously observe the young girl, and soon he noticed her true identity. Although she was only a half-blood, the powerful healing and damage resistance abilities of angels did not disappear, which was why Lydia was able to survive after being thrown from the airship.  Lydia herself must have been very clear about this, which is why she was so depressed.  "So I said, I can understand your thoughts," Rhode shrugged his shoulders. "You clearly know why you were able to survive, but it's not luck; it's because of the differences between you and others that led to this outcome, and you can't accept it... If possible, you even wish you were just an ordinary human, facing death like your companions, instead of cunningly surviving."  "....................."  Lydia lowered her head, her hands tightly clutching her skirt hem.  "But this is not something you can decide."  Looking at Lydia's slightly trembling shoulders, Rhode's tone became much gentler.  "You can't decide your birth, nor can you stop all this. It's something beyond your power, never regret what you can't do."  "So............"  Lydia finally spoke.  "...What should I do?"  "This is your path, you should choose for yourself."  Hearing this, Lydia was silent for a moment, then she raised her head.  "I understand, thank you, Mr. Rhode."  "Don't mention it."  "......... But, that slap really hurt..."  Although the process was somewhat "violent," in the end, Lydia stepped out of the shadows of losing her companions and self-blame. When the sun rose the next day, the blonde girl's face no longer bore the previous sadness, replaced instead by her usual gentle smile.  This surprised Mays, who had woken up without any clue what had happened. He curiously looked at one and then the other, and finally, a meaningful smile emerged towards Rhode— As to what that meant, no one knew.  However, before the fat merchant could satisfy his curiosity, Rhode's words immediately plunged him into the abyss.  "I think, it's time to set off."  Set off?  This word sent a shiver down the well-fed, burping fat merchant who had just woken up from breakfast. He then remembered he wasn't in his comfortable and warm room but in this endless and dangerous forest...  Right, they weren't out here for a picnic, that damned wind serpent, and that damned captain...  Forget it, forget it, it's pointless to talk about these things now.  The most important thing is—how are they going to get out of this damned forest?  Thinking of this, Mays hurriedly looked up at Rhode.  Since the young man said he had a way, then there must be a very careful plan, after all, they were in the deep mountains, and it wasn't impossible to get lost, not to mention the many fierce beasts lurking within—  That was essential knowledge for wilderness survival, and he had to pay attention, making sure not to miss a single word, lest he died here due to negligence, which would be a great loss.  With this in mind, Mays slapped his face hard to dispel the last trace of sleepiness and then watched Rhode carefully as he stood up from the ground, casually dusted off the dirt on his legs, moved his wrists, and finally said.  "Let's go."  .......................................  "...... Wait, wait, Mr. Rhode!"  The fat merchant almost seemed to be sitting on a chair with nails facing upwards as he "sprang" up.  "Where are we going?"  "Northeast, there's a town. Once we get there, the rest of the journey will be much easier."  "Isn't there anything we need to pay attention to?"  "Nothing special to note."  It was not surprising for Rhode to say this. After all, as the newbie gathering area of the Dragon Soul Continent, the Paphield region had been thoroughly explored by players, especially under the influence of online novels. At the beginning of the game, many players deliberately ventured into uninhabited, dangerous, or hard-to-reach areas in hopes of finding legendary artifacts that could dominate the game. Then they could wield powerful weapons, be invincible, and create a mighty force, and eventually unify the continent...  Of course, reality is always cruel. Despite the relentless efforts of the players, some very rare and well-attribute equipment were indeed found, but none met the players' standards of "With the artifact in hand, I have the world."  After all, that standard was too high.  Although for Mays, this place was full of dangers, and every step could be fatal, for Rhode, this area was as familiar as his own backyard. In the game, as a guild leader, Rhode often brought newbies here to level up, so he knew where there were more monsters, where there were fewer, what quest equipment was suitable for which profession, and where the attributes were suitable for the most efficient training, etc.  These were all second nature to Rhode, and even if he was randomly thrown somewhere, he could find his way out with his eyes closed.  Therefore, for him, there was naturally nothing special to remind, and as for Mays? Rhode had done the quest to protect merchants hundreds if not a thousand times in the game, how could he care?  Hearing Rhode's answer, Mays' face immediately drooped like a frostbitten eggplant. He obviously didn't understand Rhode's thoughts, but this was too careless, and he began to reflect on whether he had made a wrong decision. After thinking about it, this young man was severely injured in the mountains. If he hadn't been injured, it would have been acceptable to be so casual. But now that he was injured, to be so careless...  Wasn't that seeking death?  Although deep down he was beginning to regret it a bit, there's an old saying that one rides a tiger only to find it hard to get off. For Mays, there was no other way out.  So, with no other choice, he clenched his teeth and followed the two, heading deeper into the forest.  Under the bright sunshine, the Silvermoon Forest was very peaceful, with sunlight filtering through the gaps in the leaves, casting specks of light on the ground. The crisp chirping of birds occasionally broke the silence, and in the underbrush, one could even see the traces of wild rabbits. The scene before them was so peaceful that even the originally tense fat merchant began to relax.  No longer as suspicious and uneasy as before.  Rhode walked at the front. Although it wasn't easy to walk through a forest without paths, his figure was incredibly agile as he weaved through the forest, neither vines nor plants with hooked stems could hinder his movement. Just watching his figure, it was hard to imagine that he had been seriously injured before.  Lydia, following closely behind, was also quick. It was clear that she was accustomed to this kind of outdoor action and living. Despite wearing an inconvenient long robe, Lydia still followed Rhode steadily, occasionally speaking up to remind the merchant behind her to be careful of the path underfoot.  And the deeper they went, the more amazed Lydia felt inside. Although it appeared that Rhode's direction was quite arbitrary—instead of going straight, he would sometimes turn left or right, occasionally taking a big detour—from the surface, one would assume he was leading them aimlessly. But few noticed that under Rhode's guidance, what was originally a forest full of obstacles revealed a flat path as if it had always been hidden within the forest, waiting for people to discover its existence.  Lydia had once heard her team leader mention that this was a very high-level skill. After all, it is incredibly difficult for ordinary people to find their way in the forest. Only elves in harmony with nature and rangers who had been active in the deep mountains for many years could master this skill. She had seen it personally once.  At that time, her team had lost their way in the forest, but the elf who came to their aid did not follow the existing paths but chose a completely opposite direction to move forward. At that time, Lydia was very worried.  But in the end, they left the forest quite smoothly, and it was then that Lydia learned this skill from her team leader. But...  Looking at Rhode's figure, Lydia tilted her head with some confusion. According to her leader, such a skill can only be mastered by experienced elves and rangers. Ordinary elves also have the ability to communicate with nature, but they can't take this step.  But looking at Rhode, he did so with such ease. He had never stopped to communicate with the plants around him, which meant he should not be an elf. But...  He doesn't look like a ranger, does he? Although Lydia hadn't dealt much with rangers, she knew that rangers' main weapons were bows, but looking at Rhode, he had never used a bow since she first saw him...  Who exactly was he?  At this moment, Lydia grew more and more puzzled in her heart.  Rhode stopped.  Through the bushes, he could clearly see the clear lake water not far away, which was the center of Silvermoon Forest, Moonlight Lake.  In the game, this place was considered a midway resting camp for players.  "It's fantastic!"  Seeing the clear water in front of him, Mays unconsciously licked his dry lips. Although they hadn't walked for too long since setting off, to the always pampered merchant, it felt like several days of hardship. Seeing such a good place to rest, the fat merchant immediately strode forward, intending to rest by the lake.  But just as he began to move, Rhode's hand pressed on the merchant's shoulder.  Mays looked puzzled at the young man in front of him, but Rhode said nothing. He only extended a finger, made a silencing gesture, and then pointed ahead.  Mays looked in the direction of Rhode's finger with confusion, and then his complexion turned extremely pale.  Because under the shadow by the lake, a white giant wolf was quietly lying there, resting with its eyes closed. Chapter 10: Finding a Way in the Forest  As a merchant who had traveled far and wide, Meis had certainly seen wolves before. However, he could swear to the heavens that he had never seen a wolf of such size in his life. Judging by its size alone, this giant wolf was as tall as a man. Its thick fur glistened, and at the moment, it was leisurely squinting its eyes, basking in the warm afternoon sun. Its sturdy tail swung back and forth behind it, looking very relaxed.  At this moment, Lijie had already shut her mouth, quietly following behind Rod. As a mercenary, Lijie of course knew how terrifying and dangerous these beasts could be. Although she wasn't as nervous as the fat merchant, to the point of not daring to breathe loudly, the girl was also casting her gaze towards Rod, waiting for his command.  Rod was also pondering. The Silver Wolf "Moon Soul," a level ten elite, was not a boss-level creature, but it was still troublesome. After all, on the Dragon Soul Continent, aside from humanoid creatures, the danger levels of monsters were divided into three categories: wild beasts, giant beasts, and magical beasts. Wild beasts were ordinary creatures, while giant beasts were those that had grown huge and fierce from living a long time, or had been stimulated in some way.  When they awakened their own soul power, they would evolve into magical beasts. By then, they would not only rely on their bodies to fight but would become even more difficult to deal with. Although the Silver Wolf in front of them was not as high in threat level as the previous Wind Serpent Lord, for Rod, killing it was not difficult, but...  Thinking of this, Rod subconsciously glanced around. If this had been in the game, Rod would not have minded casually slaying the opponent for some experience and materials. However, this was not a game, and there were only three of them. Lijie was just a spirit mage and did not have the ability to protect herself.  As for Meis, he was even less capable in combat. In such a situation, it was better to avoid trouble if possible. With this thought, Rod made a hand gesture, then turned and walked in another direction. After all, Lake Moonlight was not small; there was no need to take shortcuts and do thankless tasks.  Seeing his actions, Lijie and Meis exchanged glances, then followed behind Rod, intending to leave. Unfortunately, it seemed that luck was not on their side. "Crack." Just as the fat merchant turned around, he suddenly slipped, fell heavily to the ground, and crushed a branch underneath him.  At that moment, Rod, who had been walking in front, immediately turned his head and raised his right hand. Soon, accompanied by a crisp chirping sound, a green figure shot out from his hand, pouncing towards the back of the two people. "Boom!" With the sound of impact, a low howl came from behind them, and Lijie and Meis turned their heads to see, to their surprise, the black giant wolf that should have been a distance away was now behind them. Its massive body lay sideways on the ground, seemingly hit by some external force.  Then, a shadow flashed past the two. The moment the fat merchant fell, Rod knew something was wrong. After all, in the Silver Moon Forest, these giant wolves' keen senses were ranked in the top three. Luckily, Rod had encountered situations caused by NPC-like stupidity more than once in the game, and those experiences came into play now.  Although Rod's perception was not high enough to lock onto these giant beasts, he made a judgment based on his familiarity with the giant wolves. Even though the "Moon Soul," currently at rest, was unlikely to immediately attack them, it had definitely noticed their presence. With the characteristics of these giant wolves, they would probably quietly follow behind, waiting to attack after dark. They could afford to wait, but Rod could not.  Instead of being passively engaged with these creatures later, it was better to take the initiative and control the situation. Rod's judgment was very correct. The Moon Soul had not expected the opponent to launch an attack so quickly. Faced with the soul bird that was pouncing on it, it reacted instinctively but was still a moment too slow.  The green soul bird hit it precisely, and the shockwave from the impact sent it flying away. As the black giant wolf lay on the ground, not yet recovered from the shock, Rod, who had activated "Shadow Flash," was already at its side. He looked intently at the giant wolf before him, then extended his right hand. "Cage!" (Elven language: Transform)  The green bird flew back to his hand, turning into a card, and its color instantly changed from green to white. Without another glance, Rod turned his hand around, grasping the card tightly, and thrust it towards the Moon Soul's right hind leg. A white beam of light instantly pierced the Moon Soul's leg, nailing it heavily to the ground, and at that moment, a snow-white longsword had already appeared in Rod's hand.  The silver wolf let out a painful howl, its eyes wide, staring hatefully at the despicable human in front of it, trying to stand up. Just as it managed to steady itself, it swayed, forced to stabilize again. At that moment, Rod's second strike arrived.  Rod, who had seen the silver wolf's movements, secretly relaxed, knowing that the elites' most significant trait was their incredible speed. If he could not disable that trait right away, a tough battle would ensue. Now, with one of its hind legs crippled, the silver wolf could no longer rely on speed for battle as before, making things much simpler.  Although it had lost a hind leg, the silver wolf did not panic. It stared at its target, and as Rod's sword thrust forward, it also raised its front paw and swung it heavily at Rod. Although the silver wolf had counterattacked, Rod, who had anticipated its move, was not panicked. Instead, he flipped his right hand, and the white sword's edge slid along the wolf's paw, drawing a streak of blood.  As the silver wolf retracted its paw in pain, what it saw was only the sword's edge in front of it, even more dazzling than the sunlight. A critical attack! The dancing Shattered Blade pierced the giant body, effortlessly tearing through the tough fur. Accompanied by a painful howl, the black giant wolf flew into the air, hit a small tree, and then fell back to the ground.  Half of its body had been torn open by a bloody wound, revealing white bones and slowly oozing innards. The sight was indeed nauseating. Even Rod, who had planned to deliver the final blow, frowned. After all, in games, critical attacks were represented by data and not such vivid scenes. Although he had seen something similar in the battle with the Wind Serpent, such things were never easy to stomach.  The black giant wolf had reached a critical point after being hit by the soul bird and Rod's targeted attack. Its once-threatening howling had now turned into a low whine. It struggled to support its body, trying to stand up again. But Rod did not give it the chance. With a swift motion, he plunged the Star Scar into its brain, decisively taking its life.  Although it seemed lengthy, in reality, only a minute or two had passed. To Lijie and Meis, what they saw was the silver wolf being knocked to the ground, and then Rod appeared beside it, ending its life with a few swift strokes. This surprised them greatly. After all, this was a giant wolf, not so easy to deal with.  Lijie knew that even her mercenary group, even when fully staffed, would probably have a hard time killing a giant wolf so easily. But looking at Rod's performance, it was as if he was not killing a wolf but a chicken!  As for the fat merchant, his feelings were even more complicated. He knew what his fall meant and feared the wolf would notice their presence. He had guessed the process but not the outcome. Indeed, the silver wolf had noticed them, but before it could act on its appetite, it tragically became a corpse...  Although the danger had passed, the fat merchant still felt uneasy deep down, anxiously looking at the young man not far away. He understood it was his fault. What if the other party turned against him and left him here? Under normal circumstances, he wouldn't worry about these problems, as those surrounding him were guards hired with money, and he wasn't concerned about making small mistakes. But now it was different; this young man was not a guard or a mercenary. Their relationship was entirely equal, and if he became displeased, he could leave the merchant behind.  If that happened, it would be the end for him! "This... I... I didn't..." Thinking of this, the fat merchant felt a cold sweat on his back. He licked his cracked lips, trying to say something, but he couldn't speak.  At that moment, he saw Rod stand up, turn around, and look at him calmly. "Be careful when you walk." The fat merchant realized that apart from nodding, there was nothing else he could do... Chapter 11: The Lingering Shadow  Originally, Rod planned to rest near Moonlight Lake for a moment before continuing on his journey, but after encountering the giant wolf, he had to change his mind. Considering that the bloody smell of the corpses might attract more unnecessary trouble, Rod finally chose a relatively flat highland upstream of Moonlight Lake as the campsite when the sun set.  After dinner, Rod once again took on the role of a sentry. Although this was harsh on his body, considering that he was the only one among the three who was most familiar with the environment of the Silver Moon Forest, and also the only one with combat ability, it was something that had to be done.  Although the fat merchant Meis also volunteered to help, looking at his obese body, Rod and Lijie didn't say much, but their eyes fully revealed their attitudes.  So the fat merchant, who wanted to cry but had no tears, had nothing better to do than to sit beside and boringly sort out the gear they had salvaged from the wreckage of the airship.  Of course, Lijie was also not idle; at this moment, she was kneeling beside Rod, placing her hands on his left shoulder.  "AliyMia." (Dragon language: Heal)  With the girl's crisp chanting, a faint white light emerged from her palms and slowly enveloped Rod's body.  In the Dragon Soul Continent, casters generally use Dragon language to cast spells, as since the creation of the world, nearly seventy percent of magic has been passed down in the form of Dragon language and was widely adopted by humans in the era of great magic.  The remaining part is made up of Angel language, Elf language, Demon language, and Undead language. As the races that were originally created and protected by the progenitor dragons, they also inherited the dragons' magical talent and long lifespans.  This also became the dividing line of the social classes on the continent, whether in the Night Country (Country of the Dark Night Dragon), the Light Country (Country of the Light Dragon), or the Law Country (Country of the Judging Dragon), no matter what political system they adopt, their highest leaders are inevitably the holders of the Dragon Soul of the five great dragons.  Next are the non-humans, mainly angels, elves, demons, and undead, followed by humans.  Of course, due to different political systems, the composition of each country's classes is not quite the same.  As a monarchy, the class system of the Night Country is relatively strict, and there are no humans among its leaders.  In the Light Country, which practices parliamentary democracy, half of the senior members of the parliament are humans.  In the Law Country, the upper class of angels, elves, and humans is quite balanced, each occupying one-third. This is because the Law Country, which is ruled by religious authority, believes in the path of balance.  To them, balance is the perfect choice.  Rod knew the situation of this continent like the back of his hand and was worried about what would happen next.  In the game, players are, after all, players. If they cannot play, they can simply take off the helmet and walk away.  But now, it's different. He has become a part of this continent; facing the disaster that is about to happen, what should he do?  "Mr. Rod... Mr. Rod?"  "What's the matter?"  Lijie's voice woke Rod from his thoughts, and he looked up at the girl in front of him.  After that, Lijie finally returned to her usual self, although a trace of worry occasionally appeared between her brows, it was a lot better compared to the gloomy expression that seemed as though she was on the brink of suicide.  "It's like this." Lijie shook her head carefully, glancing at Meis, who was sitting by the fire with an expression as if he had been bitten by a snake, and spoke in a low and serious tone.  "During the previous battle... with the Wind Serpent, I felt something."  "Oh?" Hearing this, Rod raised his eyebrows. "What kind of something?"  "I felt a dark aura from that Wind Serpent Lord," Lijie said, biting her lower lip. "But, this aura is very faint, not like what a dark attribute creature should have... Mr. Rod, Wind Serpents aren't dark creatures, are they?"  Of course not; Wind Serpents belong to the wind elemental creatures and have no close relationship with dark elements.  "Are you sure?"  "Yes, I'm sure."  Hearing the girl's confident and affirmative answer, Rod couldn't help falling into thought.  He, of course, knew what happened during this period in history. Wind Serpent flocks continuously attacked the merchant ships on the Wind Tide Trade Route, causing considerable losses. The Light Country, after investigating, claimed that it was the nomadic tribes living on the southern border of Paphield, under the rule of the Dark Country, who directed and manipulated it.  Not long after that, the Light Country launched a military attack on that area, driving out and slaughtering the inhabitants.  As for the reaction of the Night Country to this action by the Light Country, they quickly dispatched troops to attack the Light Country's garrison, reclaiming the land they claimed as their own, and using this as a fuse, launched a full-scale invasion of the Light Country.  This piece of history occurred during the open beta period, and at that time, Rod and other players were busy getting familiar with the new environment, new systems, leveling up, and did not delve too much into this background.  By the end of the open beta and the official start of the game, with a large influx of players, the Light Country and the Night Country had already broken out in all-out war.  As for what exactly happened, players had different opinions.  Some people thought it was a tragedy that the Light Country tried and failed to recover its territory, while another faction of conspiracy theorists believed that it was the Night Country deliberately provoking and starting the war to achieve the purpose of expansion.  And many others believed that the Night Country had long coveted the Light Country, and this was a loophole caused by the Light Country's mishandling—of course, players have no stance, and it all depends on personal preferences.  As for these claims, Rod believed they all had some truth— the southern border region was rich in crystal mines, an important resource for any country, and the Light Country had no reason to let go.  And the Dark Night Dragon Ieon, who ruled the Night Country in that era, was indeed a very strong ruler. Even until the mid-war period, even the most cunning, shameless, and rogue players found it difficult to take advantage of him.  It was even rumored that he was not an NPC but a character played by a member of the game company.  As for the last claim, after all, during the war, the performance of the Light Country's parliament could only be described as pig-like teammates, which caused the players to complain. In the end, there were even bizarre scenes where players of the same faction actively defected to the Night Country to fight against the Light Country, which shows how tragic the situation was at that time.  But now it seems that the second faction's conspiracy theory is closer to reality.  Lijie's feeling couldn't be wrong, as a creature of the light element, angels are very sensitive to dark elements. Her being half-blooded should not be far off.  So, the attacks of the Wind Serpent flock on the Wind Tide Trade Route were indeed premeditated by the Night Country, as a precursor to a full-scale attack on the Light Country?  Things didn't seem simple.  "Lijie, don't tell anyone about this."  "Alright, Mr. Rod."  Hearing Rod's answer, Lijie nodded, withdrew her hands, and after carefully checking Rod's wounds again, a smile appeared on her fair face.  "Your wounds have also healed a lot, if it goes on like this, you should be able to recover in about five or six days."  "Thank you."  Rod nodded to the girl in gratitude, then lowered his head to look at the system information that appeared in front of him.  The health of his body had begun to gradually recover its green color, and it would not be too long before he could move freely again.  And now, there was still a lot of things to do in front of Rod.  What should he do first?  Rod frowned and fell into thought...  Meanwhile, at the site of the airship crash, two figures slowly walked out from the woods.  "Is this the ship you mentioned?"  The leading man spoke coldly, wearing a beautiful white streamlined armor with patterns carved by shiny gold lines. If Rod were here, he would recognize that this was the insignia of an officer of the Light Country's border defense force.  The person standing behind the man was wrapped in a black cloak, his appearance indiscernible, and in response to the man's question, he merely nodded his head.  "They killed my messenger."  The hoarse voice echoed in the night forest, giving an eerie and chilling feeling.  "To be killed by such a group of filthy and incompetent mercenaries, it seems your pets are really incapable."  "It's your fault!" The voice of the man in the black cloak suddenly rose. "If you could find me a higher-level... Dominant-level... no, Master-level lord, I wouldn't have to use such low-level creatures!"  "What a joke, Dominant-level?" The man snorted coldly. "What do you take us for? We're only responsible for providing resources; you have to handle your own affairs. If we could take care of everything, what would we need you for?"  Saying this, the man paused, then softened his tone. "How long will it take for you to act again?"  "At least half a month, do you think it's easy to find a Wind Serpent flock that can be manipulated?"  "I'll give you ten days, and we'll double the payment."  Hearing the other party's complaints, the man's expression darkened, and he reached into his bosom, took out a purse, and threw it over.  "In ten days, I want you to start acting again."  The purse fell to the ground, making a heavy metal clinking sound. The man in the black cloak bent down, reached out with a withered hand to open the purse, then closed it immediately.  "Alright, ten days, I'll keep the promise."  "I hope you understand that no third person will know about this."  "Of course I understand... By the way, looking at the condition of this ship, it seems that two or three rats have run away, do you need help dealing with them?"  "No need." The man waved his hand. "I have my own way."  Hearing his answer, the man in the black cloak laughed coldly. "Very well, then I'll see what you can do."  A dense shadow suddenly appeared from the ground, enveloping the man in the black cloak, and then disappeared.  As he watched the place where the man disappeared, the man's face showed obvious disgust. "Greedy undead, one day even your bones will turn to ash!"  After a cold snort, the man turned around, with a thoughtful expression on his face, glanced at the surrounding forest, then placed one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other to his mouth, blowing a loud whistle.  Soon, a gryphon circled down from the sky and landed on the ground.  At the same time, three figures emerged quietly from the depths of the woods.  The man glanced at them, then mounted the gryphon.  "Go find those three rats and get rid of them."  Then, he coldly issued the command. Chapter 12: The Willpower Ring  Shadows flitted through the forest, occasionally splitting up before coming together again.  "Found anything?"  "There are residual traces in the eastern direction. It's very likely our target, and judging by the time, it should be no more than a day old."  "They move so fast. Continue the mission, and be cautious. The one we're after can take down the lord of the wind serpents. Don't underestimate them."  "Yes!"  After conversing, the three shadows once more merged into streaks of black and disappeared into the depths of the jungle, their movements silent, not even startling the birds perched in the trees.  After the shadows had left, a quiet green bird perched on a tree branch finally spread its wings and flew high into the sky.  "Are we being followed?"  Hearing the report from the soul bird, Rhode's expression darkened slightly.  At this moment, the translucent green soul bird that had been sitting quietly on his shoulder was shaking its head and stretching its wings, looking no different from an ordinary bird.  Only its translucent body and the elemental glow surrounding it revealed that this bird was not a living creature.  Summoning the soul bird for surveillance was a method Rhode came up with on the fly during their journey. Typically, players in teams venturing into the mountains would have a rogue or ranger for scouting, ensuring there were no dangers ahead on their path.  But Rhode, lacking such conditions, had to resort to using his own summoned creatures to scout ahead.  Fortunately, the soul bird not only had an advantageous field of view but also possessed the innate soul-sensing ability of spirit element creatures, allowing Rhode to feel relatively at ease.  Initially, Rhode summoned the soul bird to check if they had attracted any trouble after killing a level ten giant wolf. However, he inadvertently stumbled upon a bigger problem.  Although the soul sensing couldn't show the specific form of the target, it could judge through the strength of the soul's glow. From the speed of the pursuers, Rhode felt something was amiss. In the forest, those who could move so swiftly were generally rangers or spies—either way, professions that shunned the light.  Furthermore, the orderliness of their actions made it hard to believe they were ordinary adventurers. Was it a coincidence, or were they specifically targeting them?  Rhode didn't want to take risks. If they had approached openly, it would have been one thing, but these professions hidden in the shadows were the toughest to deal with.  Moreover, the reminder from Lize made him feel that there was something fishy about the situation. If these people harbored hostile intentions, it was hard to imagine how things would unfold.  However, when Rhode saw Lize beside him, he couldn't help but brighten up. He already had an idea.  "Mr. Rhode, where should we go next?"  Handing a water bottle to the fat merchant sitting beside her, red-faced and sweating profusely, Lize asked.  Rhode had not said much, but the task of looking after the fat merchant had always fallen to Lize. According to the girl, her mercenary group had accepted the commission to protect this gentleman, so even if she was the only one left, she had to continue the mission as long as it was not yet complete.  And of course, the merchant named Mets was extremely grateful, but with his current breathless state, it seemed unlikely he would last much longer without rest.  "Mr. Rhode... I'm so tired... Can we rest... for a moment?" Mets, who had slumped to the ground as soon as Rhode stopped, clutched his briefcase as if it were a treasure, wiping the sweat from his face with a handkerchief, shining brightly under the sunlight like a giant light bulb.  "Holy Spirit bless... I haven't walked... this much in... years," he said between heavy breaths, followed by a severe cough that even shook his chubby face.  After a while, he recovered his senses.  "I feel... I feel like I'm going to die from all this walking!"  "Rest for five minutes."  Rhode glanced at the sky, then calculated the remaining distance and time in his mind before giving the order.  Upon hearing him, the fat merchant who had been sitting on the ground let out a cry before lying back down. Lize also exhaled lightly and sat down on a nearby rock.  Afterward, they encountered no particular dangers. With the soul bird leading the way, Rhode smoothly guided them away from many hazardous areas. Though this meant missing out on chances for rare equipment, Rhode was not concerned. In this world, unlike the game where players were plentiful, ordinary adventurers did not venture into forests and mountains so carelessly. He could always return to collect treasures after escorting the two out of the mountains.  However...  Rhode looked up at the mountain range nearby and stood up.  "Lize."  "Yes, Mr. Rhode, what are your instructions?"  "I'll go ahead and check things out. After resting for five minutes, take Mr. Mets up the mountain. Do you see that white rock? Go there, then into the shadows, and you'll find an abandoned mountain path. Wait for me there, I'll arrive shortly."  Lize looked up, following the direction Rhode was pointing to, and quickly spotted the white rock on the side of the mountain. She turned to Rhode, puzzled about how he knew of this place.  However, the girl just opened her mouth but didn't ask. After traveling together for a few days, she realized the man before her was highly reliable. Though she didn't know what he was up to, she nodded and watched Rhode turn and leave.  Rhode, of course, had his own plan. The stone was the entrance to Zennal Mountain Path. It was once a glorious trade route, carved through the mountain range by the ancestors of the northerners, connecting the plains with other regions, creating a moment of splendor.  But with the development of wind currents and the unobstructed sky evidently safer than the dangerous forests, the trade route was gradually abandoned, and those who relied on it for their livelihoods had long left in search of better lives, abandoning their homeland, until it reverted to wasteland.  The progress of civilization always renders past miracles meaningless, which is the same in any world.  But Rhode wasn't here to sightsee, appreciate nature, or contemplate philosophy.  He stopped in his tracks, and in front of him lay desolation.  And corpses.  Barely visible bones were nearly buried in dust, with only tattered leather armor and corroded weapons strewn about. This was the mercenary group known as "Tiger Fang," which had fallen victim to bandits and died here after a mutual defeat.  In the game, Rhode would first need to accept a quest from the mercenary guild, then follow clues to investigate their last commission, find this place according to the map, and then return with the token and treasures.  But that was in the game, where following procedures was necessary.  Even so, many veterans wouldn't make it so complicated; they would simply take the token and report back to the mercenary guild. This not only saved time but was also convenient and straightforward, avoiding many tedious steps.  But Rhode wasn't here to skip steps.  He walked deeper into the battlefield and immediately saw a skeleton lying against the mountain wall, dressed in corroded steel armor, with a black, rusty iron sword fallen beside it.  That was Rhode's target, the leader of the mercenary group.  Crouching in front of the bones, Rhode glanced at them and then reached in, quickly pulling out a mercenary badge—the token of the "Tiger Fang" group, essential for completing the commission.  Rhode carefully put it in his pocket, then looked down and found his target.  It was a dirty, worn ring on the skeleton's finger.  Rhode carefully removed the ring. At first glance, the ring seemed useless, no different from the scrap metal in a junkyard.  But the system prompt that appeared told Rhode otherwise.  [Black Iron Ring, unidentified, magical fluctuations detected]  "Resonance."  Rhode closed his eyes, held the ring in his right hand, and whispered. He then infused his soul power into it. The ring in his hand trembled slightly, and its faint magical fluctuations became clear. When he opened his eyes again, what lay in his palm was no longer the piece of junk from before.  Instead, a black ring engraved with ancient patterns rested quietly in his hand.  [Ring of Willpower, identified, can activate a willpower shield, lasts five minutes, immune to mental attacks, recharges in three days]  Done.  Rhode slipped the ring onto his right finger, relieved, and then looked around to ensure there were no more valuables. He turned and headed back to the mountain slope.  There, he could clearly see Lize and Mets struggling toward the white rock. The fat merchant clearly had no experience climbing mountains, gingerly following behind Lize. He looked like he would have begged to be carried up if it weren't for the gender difference and loss of face.  What a waste.  Rhode shook his head, about to go down and join them when the soul bird's alarm suddenly sounded in his mind.  "———!"  Rhode was startled and quickly looked toward the forest. He saw three shadows darting out from within.  This did not bode well! Chapter 13 The Ruins in the Mist  This time, the three silhouettes did not search for more traces because the two figures on the mid-mountain were an extremely obvious target. They just exchanged glances and quickly rushed toward the direction of the two. However, Rod's speed was not slow either. With a flash, he slid down from the mid-mountain, accompanied by a loud whistle, the soul bird that had been circling in the sky seemed to have received some kind of command and swooped down, charging at the three men in black.  "——!!" Faced with the sudden attack of the soul bird, the three men in black did not panic. They quickly formed a defensive formation. One person waved the twin swords in his hands and charged forward, while the other two continued toward the direction of Lijie and Mes without changing course.  Clearly, they had a clear division of labor and were very professional. They would not stop their steps for such a minor entanglement. If the opponent was really just an ordinary bird, indeed, they would not be able to stop them.  Unfortunately, that was not a physical entity.  Facing the cold blade, the green bird did not show any intention to dodge, but instead directly met it head-on. The man in black’s eyes revealed a hint of joy seeing this, but in the next moment, his expression turned to horror——because he clearly saw that the green bird actually passed through the sword edge and pounced straight at him!  Elemental creature!  The man in black was greatly shocked. He hurriedly twisted his body, narrowly avoiding the attack. Still, the soul bird passed through his shoulder, and the man in black felt as if half his body had fallen into an ice pit and lost sensation in an instant. The body that was trying to maintain balance staggered mid-air and then fell heavily to the ground, even the short sword in his hand flew out.  The other two fared no better. When the soul bird swept past them, they did not take it seriously. But soon, a bone-chilling cold wind followed, blowing across their bodies. The two felt their bodies become numb and stiff in an instant and had to stop their steps.  Although this strange discomfort quickly dissipated, the few seconds of delay allowed Lijie and Mes to reach the white stone. Seeing this, the leading man in black frowned and made a hand signal before pulling out a crossbow from his waist.  "What, what's happening?!" The fat merchant, who was already paralyzed from exhaustion halfway up the climb, stumbled under Lijie's guidance to the side of the white stone. Supporting himself on the stone wall beside him and gasping for air, before he could complain any further, suddenly several dark shadows brushed past the fat merchant and struck the stone wall beside him.  "Whoa!" Mes quickly crouched down holding his head, and Lijie also instinctively shrank her body and did not forget to pull the fat merchant out of the way, pushing him into the shadows to avoid further attacks.  "We must hurry." Just then, Rod appeared right behind them and spoke as he looked at the three dark figures not far down the mountain.  "Who, who are they? What happened? Why are they attacking us?"  "Probably spies." Although not too far away, the clear weather still allowed Rod to see that they were wearing the standard attire of spies, and the attire of spies under the guard of the Dragon Soul of Light was more or less the same across different countries. As for which country these people were from, that could only be known after killing them.  However, Rod currently did not have such strength. It was clear from the fact that even the special abilities of the soul bird could only freeze them for a few seconds. It was not that these people had too high a resistance to soul elemental attacks, but rather because his own level was too low, he could not achieve a better attack effect. Lingering was of no benefit.  "As for why they are attacking us, I think you can ask them yourself. Maybe if they're in a good mood, they'll tell you one or two things before you die."  Although Rod rarely made a joke, the fat merchant could not laugh. As a merchant who had been doing business for many years, he knew that those spies were not to be trifled with. If he fell into their hands, what would happen to him? Just thinking of the not-so-pleasant rumors circulating among his peers, he was already pale and sweating profusely. So although he was already too tired to feel his legs, he still forced himself to stand up and follow Rod towards the small path hidden behind the white stone.  The Zenal mountain trail was once a very glorious trade route; the wide road could accommodate two carriages side by side. But now it has been completely abandoned, with various rocks from both sides of the cliffs piling up on the road, making the originally spacious road rough and narrow.  The three stumbled forward but dared not stop. Rod occasionally looked back, but the situation had not improved—the footsteps of the pursuers behind them were getting clearer and clearer. If it wasn't for the terrain here, they would have been surrounded long ago.  "Mr. Rod! There's no way through!" Lijie's exclamation made Rod turn back, and indeed, the mountain path ahead was completely blocked by rolling stones, with no way to climb over or break through.  As expected.  Rod shook his head slightly. He had originally thought that doing this in the game was to force players to follow the system-set route, but now it seemed that was not the case———  Never mind, after all, this was not his original intention.  "Go to the right."  "Right?"  Hearing Rod's command, both were stunned, and they simultaneously looked towards the small path on the right, hesitating even more in their steps.  Although the main road was blocked, there was still a path nearby. What was most peculiar was that despite the clear skies, there was a dense fog in that path, and the sunlight passing through the thick mist brought an even more eerie atmosphere. Just looking at it made one feel that there must be something strange inside, and now, Rod was actually asking them to enter?  "Hurry up, there's no time." However, under Rod's urging, the two quickly entered the mist, and soon, their figures were completely obscured by the thick fog and disappeared from sight.  Seeing the two enter, Rod also breathed a sigh of relief, once again looking back. He then extended his right hand.  "Cage!"  The card that appeared in the center of his palm changed from green to white, and then the snow-white blade appeared again. Rod gripped the long sword and flung it at the cliff. The bright blade of light flew out from the sword, striking the unstable boulders above the cliff. Soon, under the loud rumbling, the shattered rocks and dust rolled down together.  By the time the three men in black arrived, Rod's figure had already disappeared into the depths of the mist, obscured by the smoke and debris.  "Damn it!" Staring at the chaotic mountain path in front of him, one man in black gritted his teeth and complained.  The road ahead was completely blocked by debris, making it impassable. Not to mention Rod's sword also triggered a chain reaction, and now the cliffs on both sides of the mountain path were trembling. Continuing on might be even more dangerous.  "What do we do?"  "There's nothing we can do." Another man in black stared intently at the now completely sealed path.  "We have to go back and report to the captain, send people to monitor all the nearby villages and towns. They must be planning to leave from the back. But I didn't expect, these guys really have some tricks."  "Elemental creature, is there a mage among them?"  "If there really is a mage, then it's not surprising. But based on our observations, there doesn't seem to be a mage among them."  As the two men in black exchanged opinions, another who had been silent and observing the traces on the cliff spoke up.  "One of them is a quite strong swordsman."  After saying this, the man in black turned his head.  "Let's go, these three targets are indeed not simple, but we haven't lost yet. Send the order down, immediately monitor the surrounding villages and towns. I believe they can't stay in the mountains without coming out."  For Rod and the others, the danger was not yet over.  "What is... this place?" The fat merchant stared blankly at everything in front of him. He thought he had seen everything after many years of traveling, but the experiences of the past few days told him that there were still many things in the world he did not know.  After passing through the dense fog, what appeared before them was a desolate and abandoned small town, completely enveloped in dense fog, making almost everything blurry. Even looking up at the sky, they could only see a gray expanse. It was no longer clear and bright, and the whole world looked dim and lightless, as if it were a completely different plane.  "This is the Ruins in the Mist," Rod casually replied as he followed from behind.  "As long as we get through here, we can reach the Alarak mountain pass, and then we can leave."  "But is this place... dangerous?"  Anyone with eyes could see that this place was not peaceful.  "Of course there's danger." Rod did not fully explain, the Ruins in the Mist in the game was the first ten-level five-person dungeon, and also the player's first dungeon. To say it was hard would not be accurate, but to say it was easy wouldn't be right either.  But for their group of three, it was very troublesome. After all, Rod was only level eight, and Lijie was only level six, and the merchant with only a combat power of five was not counted at all. In the end, it was essentially an eight-level summoner swordsman and a support class soloing a ten-level five-person dungeon———in the game, one would be considered a fool.  Rod was not a fool. In fact, it was only after seeing Lijie that he came up with this risky method. Otherwise, Rod would not have chosen this path———  And in fact, this path was now the safest. Comparing the risk probabilities.  "But as long as you follow my orders, there won't be too much risk. So............" Saying this, Rod turned his head to look at the blonde girl beside him.  "Lijie, it's up to you now." Chapter 14: Strategy for Two  "Me?" Hearing Rod's words, Lijie opened her eyes wide in surprise, and even Mes next to her opened his mouth in astonishment. As everyone knows, Spirit Masters on the Dragon Soul Continent are professions similar to pharmacists, doctors, and nurses. They are basically the support roles within a team, responsible for bandaging wounds, healing injuries, casting shields, and dispelling toxins, which are the most common tasks for a Spirit Master.  As for frontline combat? This kind of thing is probably unheard of!  "That's right." Rod nodded his head, the moment he stepped into this place, he seemed to have become the commander who once led teams to clear dungeons.  "In a moment, follow my command. This doesn’t require particularly complex techniques, but it does demand a high level of reaction and awareness from you. However, once you get used to it, I don’t think it will be too difficult... How is your control over energy right now? How many times can you use Sacred Radiance?"  Although he had roughly guessed her level through Lijie's previous healing spells, it was still better to confirm.  "I am a full-fledged Spirit Master, at the seventh layer of the outer circle. As for Sacred Radiance... it can only be used once a day, and it can last a full day... if my soul power is not consumed too much."  The classification of spellcaster professions is different from that of combat professions. In addition to professional levels, they also have divisions based on soul power, namely the outer circle, middle circle, and inner circle, with ten layers in the outer circle, seven in the middle, and three in the inner. This is because spellcasters believe their power comes from deep within their souls, and in common belief, the soul is seen by spellcasters as three intermingling circular existences. The deeper a spellcaster delves into their soul, the more powerful they become.  And Lijie's strength has already reached the seventh layer of the outer circle, which means that she is very likely to break through the limit of outer circle spellcasters and enter the ranks of the middle circle.  For a level six Spirit Master, this is truly rare.  But this made Rod even more confident.  "Good, remember, from now on, you don't need to cast Healing Light on me, even if I'm injured, it’s the same. Pay more attention to Mr. Mes, if he is in danger, give him a shield... Understood?"  "This... I understand, Mr. Rod."  Although Rod's words occasionally contained some terms that Lijie found inexplicable, she still understood his intentions after guessing and inferring, and she nodded slightly to show her understanding.  "Mr. Mes, how many days can our supplies last?"  "About three to four days." Holding his travel bag, the plump merchant thought for a moment and then answered, but his face carried a hint of solemnity.  "If we are sparing with our food..."  "Now is a good time to lose some weight."  If Rod had said this with a smile, then Mes might have taken it as a joke. Unfortunately, Rod's expression was very calm, without any hint of a smile, which made the plump merchant even more worried. He was about to say something else, clutching his travel bag, but Rod had already turned his head and issued an order to Lijie.  "Cast Sacred Radiance."  "Okay."  Faced with Rod's command, Lijie nodded slightly, then stretched out her hands and closed her eyes. Soon, a soft glow slowly emerged from the center of the girl's palms, the gentle white radiance spreading out in all directions. It might have been an illusion, but the plump merchant noticed that the thick fog that was originally close at hand began to retreat rapidly under the illumination of this radiance. After rubbing his eyes, he discovered that the surroundings, originally shrouded in dense fog, had now become much clearer.  Some ruins that could only be seen as vague shadows could now be clearly seen with broken walls and houses. This allowed everyone to breathe a sigh of relief; after all, clearer visibility is always safer.  "I'll go first, Lijie follow up, Mr. Mes you go last, don't stray too far from us, no matter what happens, don't act alone."  Silence reigned amidst the ruins.  The radiance full of positive energy dispelled the fog, but it did not dispel the danger that lurked within. Everyone slowly advanced under Rod's leadership, occasionally stopping to observe their surroundings before continuing—however, soon, Rod gestured with his hand, signaling for the two to stop moving.  If his memory was correct, they were already approaching the respawn point of the first wave of minor monsters.  Sure enough, not long after Rod stopped, several faint lights appeared in the mist ahead. They twinkled on and off, resembling eyes.  "What, what is that?"  Mes immediately tensed up.  "They are wraiths."  Rod extended his right hand and quickly, Star Trace appeared in his grasp.  "Be careful, they won't dare to come too close."  As soon as Rod finished speaking, everyone saw the fog in front of them suddenly contract and then spew out three strange creatures. They had humanoid forms but were wrapped in dense fog from head to toe. The three creatures stood together, and it was somewhat difficult to see their boundaries, only the three pairs of bright little eyes allowed people to confirm that these were not simply ordinary fog.  Perhaps even less simple.  "Lijie, cast Healing Light on the first one."  Healing Light? Hearing this command, a trace of confusion flickered in the girl's mind. That was a healing spell, why cast it on such a monster? However, this question was only a fleeting thought in Lijie's mind, and she quickly raised her right hand, casting Healing Light on the monster in front of her.  As a Spirit Master, Lijie's skills were quite good.  Healing Light is a mid-range healing spell, and as long as the target's position can be confirmed, it is not difficult to cast. For Lijie, it was even more effortless. Perhaps because the target was not a companion but a monster, the girl hesitated in her movements, but she still completed the spell quickly.  A stream of pure white light immediately appeared from the air and wrapped around the wraith. According to the original effect, the life enveloped by it would immediately recover from certain injuries and even invigorate spirits, belonging to the most basic of spells used by a Spirit Master.  But the wraith's reaction was completely unexpected to the girl; at the moment it was enveloped by the white radiance, the wraith let out a piercing scream that even she could hear clearly. Its originally standing body bent over as if punched, shaking continuously, and the mist enveloping its body disintegrated in that instant, melting away like snow under sunlight.  This greatly startled Lijie, who even subconsciously looked down at her own hands, unable to comprehend how she had released a spell with such destructive power.  Seeing the wraith's reaction, Rod remained very calm. After all, the positive energy produced by Healing Light was naturally the nemesis of negative energy entities like wraiths, especially since Lijie had half of a pure angel's bloodline. The positive energy condensed by angels differed in quality from that of ordinary humans. If the latter's positive energy was like scalding boiling water to a wraith, then the former's could be likened to high-concentration sulfuric acid. It was fortunate that Lijie was only a half-blood. If she were a pure angel, that wraith would have been obliterated long ago.  Lijie didn't understand why a healing spell would have such an effect, but in fact, players on the Dragon Soul Continent were quite aware of this. In their view, calling it "Healing Light" was merely a disguise; the essence of the spell was to release positive energy. However, this energy had a healing effect when encountering living beings, and for convenience, it was named as such, not indicating that it could only heal injuries.  In the early days of the Dragon Soul Continent, there was a joke among players: the most tragic thing for a necromancer was encountering a group of undead—because the spells of a necromancer were mostly derived from negative energy, and using them to attack undead creatures composed of the same negative energy would only have a healing rather than destructive effect.  This also made many former necromancers, who once dreamed of dominating the world with an army of the dead, shed tears as they had to learn some elemental spells to maintain their advantage over undead monsters—indeed, they sometimes also had to play the role of a healer.  Essentially, there wasn't much difference between necromancers and Spirit Masters; they mostly lived in environments where their abilities could not harm their own kind, only showing effect when encountering opposite attributes.  However, for necromancers, the chance of encountering living beings was relatively higher.  And for Spirit Masters, it wasn't until the mid-period of the war when darkness descended and the undead ran rampant that they shed the label of logistics personnel and became valiant warriors at the forefront.  Before that, the chance of a Spirit Master encountering undead was very low, and NPCs, unlike players, didn’t have access to so much information, so it was not surprising for them to stick to the rules.  But now was not the time to adhere to the rules.  "Attack the other two!" Rod's figure flashed, rushing towards the wraiths while giving orders to Lijie.  "Yes!"  Perhaps inspired by the scene in front of her, Lijie's response was also very spirited. Soon, two more surges of abundant positive energy descended from the sky, landing on the other two wraiths.  The soft light enveloped them, halting their attempts to advance. Taking advantage of this, Rod, who had activated Shadow Flash, had already reached the first wraith.  "———!" The wraith, scoured by positive energy, let out a shriek, and Rod in front of it became the target of their vented anger.  Quickly, the wraith in front lunged with a semi-transparent claw, "whooshing" at Rod. Although Lijie's power had weakened their defenses, their attack power had increased quite a bit, and if not handled carefully, it could lead to an unexpected defeat.  But for Rod, of course, he would not allow such an event to happen. His figure shifted, narrowly avoiding the wraith's extended claw, then his hand holding the pristine blade swiftly rotated, stabbing forward.  Critical attack!  Star Trace precisely hit the wraith's only semi-solid soul condensate within its ethereal body, causing the already tormented wraith under the positive energy light to let out a wail of despair. It desperately raised its claws, and then its body, already on the brink of collapse, completely lost form and dissipated into a pile of dust.  And at that moment, the other two wraiths also attacked. Chapter 15: Deep into the Ruins  "Phew..." Looking at the spirit dust scattered all over the ground, Rod wiped the beads of sweat on his forehead and felt somewhat exhausted. Along the way, the three of them had encountered quite a few ghosts – a total of about fifteen or sixteen. This wouldn't be much for a well-equipped team of five, but now Rod only had one combatant under his command. Naturally, he couldn't fight like he would in a normal dungeon run, finding a MT (Main Tank) to take the aggro while everyone else went all out with their damage output. Instead, he had to carefully lure each one over, then let Lijie cast positive energy to weaken the enemy's defense, followed by killing them as quickly as possible.  Since ghosts were at least level 10 elite monsters, even those undead weakened by having their defenses reduced were still difficult to deal with. To maximize the damage, Rod, apart from utilizing the attribute bonuses of the Stardust in his hand, could only aim to hit the enemy's vital points with every strike.  But humans are not machines. Even in a game, such high-demand attacks consume a lot of energy, not to mention that Rod was now using his own body. If he failed in the game, he could start over, but failure here could very likely lead to death.  This pressure made Rod feel almost unbearable. He lifted his head and looked at the ruins shrouded in mist ahead, and only after confirming that there were no more monsters for the time being, did he finally breathe a sigh of relief.  "Mr. Rod, do you want to rest for a bit?" The young girl following closely behind him looked worriedly at Rod. As a spirit master, she didn't quite understand the meaning behind each of Rod's actions, but she could still feel the pressure he was under.  "No... not now..." Rod shook his head. Although they had cleared the minor monsters in this area, he still had a faint sense of danger. He vigilantly watched his surroundings but could not figure out where this faint sense of crisis deep in his heart was coming from. According to the distance, they had not yet reached the territory of the BOSS, so they shouldn't encounter too much danger. Moreover, Rod was quite familiar with the distribution of undead creatures here. In theory, the monsters should have already been cleared.  So, where was this sense of danger coming from?  Rod looked around again but found nothing. Just then, the chubby merchant suddenly shouted.  "Ah!!"  "What's wrong?" Rod and Lijie quickly turned around, only to see Mace pale, clutching his travel bag with one hand and pointing with a trembling hand towards the thick fog behind him.  "Just now, there was a shadow there..."  "A shadow?" Lijie looked in the direction Mace was pointing but saw nothing in the fog besides the dim sunlight.  "There's nothing there..."  "Get down!!" At that moment, a light bulb went off in Rod's head; he finally understood where the danger was coming from. He shouted while forcibly pushing the girl's head down.  "Whoosh!" Almost at the same time, a dark shadow swiftly passed overhead. Rod could almost feel the icy claws grazing his scalp, even feeling a sharp pain.  Damn it!  At this moment, Rod's heart sank. He now knew what this sense of danger was – it was a gargoyle!  According to legend, the misty ruins were once a bustling and glorious town that was gradually abandoned following the decline of the trade routes. After that, a mage came here to save his beloved lover and chose to research forbidden death magic in this abandoned town. However, the research ended in failure, and the mage died as a result. But the death magic did not stop there, creating the dense fog and many undead creatures.  Among all the dangers in the dungeon, the gargoyle left by the mage to guard his relics was the most dangerous – a rare level 15 elite! If it were a team in the game, Rod would be very happy. Rare elites are indeed rare; sometimes you might not encounter one even after several dungeon runs. But now, he just felt a chill in his heart. The opponent was a level 15 rare elite and a flying monster at that. Not only was it agile, but it was also vastly different from the ghosts that relied on negative energy to condense into a form. At least Lijie's positive energy would not be effective against it.  Moreover, its body made of obsidian was exceptionally hard, and the damage that could be inflicted by ordinary attacks was very limited. It was clear that this was going to be a tough battle. Rod had run the misty ruins dungeon over thirty times in the game and had never seen a gargoyle, so he subconsciously forgot about this. But who would have thought that he would encounter one on his first visit here?  Was this good luck or bad luck?  But Rod had no mood to mull over such questions now because the danger was right in front of him. A direct confrontation was hopeless. After all, he was not yet level 10, and challenging a level 15 monster was almost an impossible task. Even with the bonuses from Stardust, his attack power was very limited.  "Let's go!" Without hesitating for too long, Rod immediately gave the order. He grabbed Lijie with one hand and shouted, "Follow me, keep your heads down, don't look up!"  Retreating was not an option; the only way was to find the gargoyle's control core and completely destroy it. Although escaping its attack range was also an option, Rod looked at his team's configuration and really couldn't find anyone who could easily lead the opponent away – it would be nice to have a ranger or a thief.  But now was not the time for complaints.  Under Rod's lead, Lijie and Mace kept their heads down and stumbled forward. The dense fog around them started to move again, clearly, their actions had attracted the attention of the ghosts. Four or five ghosts had drilled out of the fog and began to advance toward where the three of them were.  "Lijie, attack! Don't stop!"  "Yes!" Although casting spells while running was not easy for the girl, she still clenched her teeth and extended her right hand. Soon, three or four streaks of pure white brilliance emerged in the air and fell upon the ghosts. Following that, Rod immediately swung his sword and stabbed out. Accompanied by screams, those obstructing creatures soon turned to dust and vanished.  At that moment, a system prompt flashed before Rod's eyes.  [Experience points 1900/1800, can level up, level 8]  But Rod didn't have time to pay attention to this system prompt right now, as more and more ghosts were appearing from all directions. Although the holy light made them hesitant and slow, the numerical advantage compensated for this gap.  Compared to the less agile ghosts, the gargoyle didn't care about the holy light at all. Although it was also driven by negative energy, as the guardian of the mage, the gargoyle's hard obsidian exterior was enough to resist most of the holy forces' invasion.  After missing its attack earlier, it immediately identified the group as its target and followed closely behind the three, waiting for the moment to strike – compared to the undead that attacked instinctively, a man-made life form with a certain level of combat intelligence was indeed much more troublesome.  "Ouch!" Just then, Mace stumbled and fell hard to the ground.  The gargoyle, which had been waiting for a long time, immediately swooped down, its sharp claws striking lightning-fast at the fallen chubby merchant. When Mace turned around, all he saw was a shadow about to envelop his body.  "Oh my god..."  Although the gargoyle was indeed fast, and Mace had cooperated by closing his eyes, prepared to meet his end, its attack still fell short – a faint barrier shimmering with golden light appeared out of nowhere, blocking the gargoyle's sharp claws. Then several bright blades of light flew from the air, striking heavily on the gargoyle's body. With a series of loud "clap clap" sounds, the gargoyle, unable to stop its momentum, was sent flying backward, crashing heavily into the crowd of ghosts.  At that moment, Lijie had already half-dragged the fat merchant, who had been ready to bid farewell to this world and greet his relatives in the next, and continued to run forward.  "Here!" Rod finally shook off most of the undead under the "siege" of the ghosts, then looked up and quickly found his target – it was an abandoned church, the place where the mage had conducted his experiments. According to Rod's memory, the control center for the gargoyle should be there.  However, such a place was, of course, not easy to enter.  As Rod approached the church door, he felt a darkness before his eyes. He quickly activated his Shadow Flash to retreat, and then saw a dark gargoyle crouching at the spot where he had just stood, one of its hard claws smashing heavily into the ground, shattering the solid blue stone bricks.  "This is really bad." Rod cursed inwardly while quickly scanning the area and noticing that the original decorative stone statues on both sides of the church door had disappeared.  It was easy to guess where they had gone.  Two at once; it seems he could make a fortune if he bought lottery tickets today.  If he lives, that is.  "Get inside, find the control device!" Rod faced the gargoyle in front of him while issuing orders to Lijie and Mace.  "The ghosts probably won't bother you inside. I'll hold these two guys off, you take the opportunity to go in, find the control device, and destroy it. Watch out for traps."  "But... Mr. Rod, you..."  "This is an order." Rod coldly interrupted Lijie's words, then gripped Stardust and flung it forward. The white blade burst forth instantly, and the gargoyle screeched as it took flight, dodging his attack and also clearing the way to the church.  "Go now!" Chapter 16: The Talent Tree Opens  Black and white shadows crossed in the air, sparking bright flames.  "Oof!" Rhode quickly retreated, the pure white blade of his sword trembling non-stop. The tremendous impact from the blade shocked his upper body, causing him a faint pain.  Just like in Rhode's memory, the level fifteen gargoyles were indeed tough to deal with, especially when there were two of them.  The only upside was that these creatures did indeed possess some battle wisdom. Although that would not be a good thing on a normal day, right now the surplus of artificial intelligence made their movements less threatening.  Especially the gargoyle that had previously taken a hit from the Shattered Blade, now it immediately screamed and retreated upon seeing the white light emanating from Rhode's sword. Although the other one had not been hit, seeing its companion's actions, it also hesitated, giving Rhode a chance to catch his breath.  But this was only temporary.  Holding Starfall, Rhode clenched his teeth as he looked up at the two gargoyles hovering in the sky. Although the gargoyles were wary of his Shattered Blade and dared not attack aggressively, Rhode was certain that they would not let him off easily.  Although both sides were in a stalemate for now, this situation would not last long.  Upon reaching level eight, Rhode had already maxed out the proficiency of Moonshadow Swordsmanship to 4/4. Although the soul power consumed by Shattered Blade had been reduced after leveling up, frequent use could still cause problems.  Moreover, this was not the final battle. Rhode had to conserve some strength to deal with potential emergencies that could arise at any time.  After all, he was the only one among the three with fighting capabilities. If he exhausted all his strength here, it would be very troublesome.  Meanwhile, the two gargoyles did not just stare at Rhode. Instead, they dived back and forth, extending their claws to attack Rhode, and promptly retreated whenever they sensed his counterattack intentions.  This wheel-style battle put a high demand on physical strength. However, for the two alchemical beings entirely driven by magic, this was not an obstacle.  But for Rhode, it was entirely different.  Sweat slowly emerged on Rhode's forehead. His body had gradually grown weary from the continuous defenses earlier.  However, Rhode could not back down. He knew that with his current abilities, it was nearly impossible to take on two gargoyles at once, so he could only place his hopes on Lize. After all, there wasn't anything particularly dangerous to guard against in the church, but...  Did I forget to remind them to be wary of the protective magic formation?  After a moment of thought, Rhode shrugged his shoulders and refocused his attention on the gargoyles before him.  After all, no one would die.  "Arghhh!!" Accompanied by a "miserable" scream, Mess collapsed on the ground, convulsing non-stop.  "I'm dying! Help! Help!"  "It's just an electric shock! You're not dead, Mr. Mess."  While rummaging through the dusty, cobweb-covered old table, covered with time-eroded unrecognizable clutter, Lize nonchalantly healed Mess's pain with a healing spell without even looking back, then returned to her search.  Although a typical mage would cast many protective spells in their room to guard their secrets, this church was, after all, "in disrepair" for a long time. Plus, with the passage of time, the power of the protective magic formations had weakened by seventy to eighty percent, posing no significant threat.  As a half-angel, Lize's resistance to magic was also not weak, so the weakened protective magic formations did not affect her much. The traps that would normally burst into flames and lightning upon triggering only flickered a few weak magical glows in her hands before disappearing.  Unfortunately, the tragic Mr. Mess allowed these traps to regain some confidence. As an ordinary human, he had little resistance, so his performance made these protective magic formations somewhat threatening.  "This, this damn place is really annoying..."  Mess dusted himself off and slowly got up, muttering under his breath while stealthily scanning his surroundings.  In the dimly lit church, only the holy light emitted by Lize quietly floated beside her, illuminating the originally pitch-black world.  However, these scenes terrified Mess. With the light's illumination, he could clearly see the dark, strange magic formations on the floor and the chilling white bones.  All these were enough to make Mess's legs go weak, not to mention the bloodstains on the walls that almost made him turn tail and run the moment he entered.  If Lize hadn't been so calm, making him lose face, and considering the two more immediate dangers outside, the fat merchant would have fled long ago.  But now, he had to steel himself and stay, joining Lize in searching for the "control hub," which neither of them even knew what it looked like.  How could they find that strange thing in such a messy place?  Mess tapped the dust off himself and muttered softly. But seeing Lize's serious expression, he didn't say more and continued his search.  Meanwhile, Rhode was also not having an easy time.  "———!" The gargoyle screamed as it swooped down. Rhode twisted his body, narrowly dodging the attack. But this time, the gargoyle didn't leave after a failed strike like before.  Instead, it spun around, and its thick tail whipped down instantly!  Bad news!  Hearing the wind from behind, Rhode's heart sank.  He quickly turned around, and his long sword was immediately poised in front of him to block.  Rhode was quick to react, but the gargoyle's attack was also fast. He had just turned around when he felt a massive impact through the sword, bending the pristine blade and sending him flying away, tumbling several times on the ground before coming to a stop.  "Oof!" Rhode got up, feeling dizzy, with his blood churning and even half his body tingling, nearly dropping his sword.  He intended to shake his head instinctively to clear his mind, but a faint sound from behind made Rhode tense up immediately.  "Sss..."  With that barely audible sound, a cold breath materialized behind Rhode. Without thinking, he rolled on the spot, barely dodging the attack, and when he looked up, he saw three specters slowly approaching.  The gargoyle's previous strike hadn't injured Rhode, but it had sent him flying from the front of the church to the edge of the barrier.  While the specters could not approach the church due to the barrier's influence, they had not dispersed. Instead, they lurked around the invisible shield, waiting for an opportunity with their instincts.  And now, that opportunity had finally arrived.  Rhode certainly didn't intend to give the specters what they wanted. Facing the encroaching enemies, he bit down hard, abandoning the idea of conserving his strength. His long sword suddenly burst into a flash of white light, projecting forward.  A white blade of light shot out from Rhode's sword, spinning and scattering, heavily hitting one of the specters, tearing through its defenses. Then Rhode, without hesitation, lunged forward, his long sword drawing a perfect arc in the air, piercing the core of the specter's body.  As the unlucky specter screamed and turned to dust, Rhode had already passed through its body, returning to the protection of the barrier.  What should he do next?  Just as Rhode pondered this question, a system notification appeared before his eyes, causing him to pause.  [Experience Points 4000/1800, Level Up Available, Talent Tree Unlocked, Level 8]  I'm level ten already? But before entering the Misty Ruins, I was only level eight, wasn't I?  Rhode was momentarily stunned, then remembered that he had indeed received a system notification earlier that he had enough experience to level up. At that time, he had been ambushed by the gargoyles, so he hadn't paid attention.  Now it seemed that the experience from the specters he killed along the way was enough for another level up.  This was not surprising; after all, this was a five-person instance, and almost all the monster experience was obtained by Rhode alone. Plus, his level was low to begin with, and there were bonuses for killing higher-level monsters, so reaching level ten was normal——  The only strange thing might be the existence of experience points in the real world. But now was not the time to worry about these details. Rhode quickly opened his attributes, made his choice, and this might be his only chance to gain an advantage.  [Experience Points 4000/1800, Level Up Available, Talent Tree Unlocked, Level 8] [Experience Points 2200/2000, Level Up Available, Talent Tree Unlocked, Skill Point Gained, Level 9] [Experience Points 200/2500, Talent Tree Unlocked, Skill Points Gained: 2, Level 10] [Do you want to open the talent system?]  "Open!"  Without any hesitation, Rhode immediately responded. In less than a second, three different talent trees appeared before his eyes.  In the Dragon Soul Continent, every profession has three talent choices after reaching level ten. They can choose one as their main focus, or they can select attributes and skills from other talents for support.  These talent attributes are also acquired through skill points.  This can cause new players to be quite confused. Because characters only receive one skill point per level, and not to mention the talent tree, skills like swordsmanship and magic also require a lot of skill points to improve.  This means that players have very limited skill points to allocate in the early stages.  Fortunately, once players enter the mid-tier realm, they can obtain additional skill points by using a "Wake-up Scroll" or completing some high-difficulty tasks to enhance their skills.  Rhode's Summoner Swordsman also has three different talent routes— "Summoning Master," "Soul Messenger," and "Hell Lord."  "Summoning Master" increases the number of spirits that can be summoned with each level.  "Soul Messenger" focuses on strengthening the power of summoned spirits.  The special power of "Hell Lord" is that after killing non-human creatures, the holder has a chance to convert them into their summoned spirits, although they are limited to the undead attribute.  It can be said that each of the three talents has its own strengths and weaknesses. "Summoning Master" relies on quantity, "Soul Messenger" focuses on quality, but considering the rarity of magical beasts and the expensive cost of soul cores, "Hell Lord" is also a very good choice.  If it were anyone else, they would probably hesitate and find it hard to give up any of the options, but for Rhode, this was not a problem. After all, he had been playing the Summoner Swordsman profession for a full seven years, and all his insights and techniques related to Summoner Swordsman were already regarded as classic by many players.  Even in the game, nearly two-thirds of the players who chose Summoner Swordsman used Rhode's insights as a standard to build their characters.  So, what seemed like a difficult choice for many new players had already been decided the moment Rhode saw the talent tree. Chapter 17: Summoning Master  The first principle of a Summoning Swordsman—never fight alone at any time.  [Consume 1 skill point, enhance Moonshadow Sword Technique 1/5, proficiency C—Unlock Moonlight]  [Consume 1 skill point, designate talent—Summoning Master Awakening]  [First tier talent of Summoning Master unlocked: Soul Resonance (character can summon additional spirits every ten levels raised), Mind Call (share senses with summoned objects, increased duration of mental connection), Construct Harmony (can perform dual spirit fusion)]  [Acquire permanent skill: Soul Resonance LV1 (character can summon +1 spirit every ten levels raised)]  [Can summon +1 spirit]  As the last line of system text disappeared, a huge shadow flashed past the corner of Rhode's eye.  But he did not retreat, nor did he show any fear.  On the contrary, Rhode raised his long sword and swung it forward fiercely.  "Swish!"  A cyan figure shot out rapidly from the edge of the sword and pounced towards the incoming gargoyle.  The Bird of Soul.  [Rhode's current problem is that he cannot summon two summons at the same time, and unfortunately, as his weapon, Star Stain is considered one of the summons. Typically, a Summoning Swordsman, just like a normal swordsman, would only be equipped with one "normal" weapon. Rhode is an exception, although he has also considered using more normal weapons, he simply cannot give up the attribute bonuses of Star Stain. It is precisely because of this feature that Rhode can so easily kill monsters of similar or slightly higher levels than himself, gaining so much experience in the early stages.  However, conversely, this also makes it impossible for Rhode to adopt the Summoning Swordsman's unique method of "attacking in tandem with summoned creatures." From the outside, he looks more like a standard swordsman. This makes Rhode quite uncomfortable, but there's no other way. If he wants to summon the Bird of Soul, then he would have to give up Star Stain, but by doing so, Rhode would find himself in an awkward situation without a weapon. Although the focus is on summons, don't forget the last two characters are "swordsman," not "mage," so Rhode cannot act like those spellcasters who hide behind and do nothing.  But if he wants to use Star Stain, he must seal the Bird of Soul, and fighting like a normal swordsman is not ideal for Rhode. Because compared to a true swordsman, a Summoning Swordsman has a significant disadvantage—career penalty—all sword technique proficiency -1. This means that a true swordsman's sword technique proficiency can reach up to SSS. But no matter how hard a Summoning Swordsman tries, they can only reach SS at best. And from the beginning, the starting line is different for both. A true swordsman has all initial sword technique proficiencies at D level. But Rhode's Summoning Swordsman can only start from E level, which is a gap. In fact, from the time he arrived in this world until now, Rhode has been fighting quite hard.  If it weren't for holding Star Stain and his understanding of the Dragon Soul Continent, he would have been in a sorry state long ago. Because he had already been accustomed to the state of having summons fighting alongside him all the time, this current situation put a lot of pressure on him.  But now, after selecting the "Summoning Master" talent, he finally felt a weight off his shoulders. That's right, a Summoning Swordsman does not have the same strong individual attack power as a true swordsman, but they never fight alone either.  Facing the Bird of Soul pouncing towards itself, the gargoyle was stunned for a moment. It sensed the magical aura on the opponent but its unremarkable AI couldn't determine what exactly the thing rushing towards it was. Nevertheless, it regarded it as an enemy and swiped down with its claw.  But this time, the gargoyle missed. Just as it felt its claw hit the target, the previously solid form suddenly dissipated as if a snowball had been scattered by someone, leaving only a faint stream of air passing quickly through its claws, disappearing without a trace.  Before the gargoyle could react, Rhode had already caught up quickly, and then gripping his long sword, he swung it forward.  A silver crescent burst out from Rhode's sword, flying towards the target whose guard was down after the missed strike. This was the third skill of the Moonshadow Sword Technique—Moonlight.  Although it, like Blade of Breakage, was a move that condensed sword energy for an attack, the effects of the two were completely different—Blade of Breakage fired in the form of blades of light, with strong power and penetrating force, but the range it covered was too narrow, making it easy to dodge.  But Moonlight was different, with its crescent-shaped attack sweeping across, at least threatening a large area in front of it, making it difficult to dodge.  As expected, facing the oncoming sword light, the gargoyle instinctively tried to flap its wings hard to dodge the attack, but it was a step too slow and was hit by the silvery blade on its right wing. Along with several small stones flying off, the gargoyle's body, which had been floating in the air, suddenly tilted and lost balance.  However, it wasn't over, as it tried to maintain balance, Rhode had already stepped forward two steps, and then with a strange gesture with his left hand, the Bird of Soul, which had turned into a breeze and passed the gargoyle's attack, reappeared behind the gargoyle in a circling motion. As the wind engulfed and wrapped around the bird, it crashed heavily into the gargoyle's back, the strong gust of air immediately blowing the gargoyle away.  This angered the already furious gargoyle, which screeched in rage. But before it could express its anger, a series of gleaming blades appeared before the gargoyle's eyes.  One, two, three. The spinning Blades of Breakage hit the wounded right wing of the gargoyle precisely, and even wings made of basalt could not withstand the continuous hits. As the gargoyle suffered these impacts, web-like cracks spread across its wings, and soon, accompanied by the crisp sound of shattering, the hard-material wings completely broke apart. This caused the gargoyle, which had lost one wing, to scream and crash to the ground, creating a sizable hole in the blue stone floor.  Fight with numbers, bully with the crowd, combine quantity and quality—that's the style of a Summoning Swordsman.  Rhode finally found his sense of battle. In fact, if he had a normal weapon in his hand now, then after activating "Summoning Master," he would be able to control two summons at the same time. By that time, let alone two rare elites, even if the BOSS himself came, he would have the confidence to grind the opponent to death.  But unfortunately, there are no "ifs" in the world, and Rhode currently doesn't have a second Soul Core to awaken a spirit. So he had no choice but to give up the thought of pursuing victory and quickly retreat backward.  Because at that moment, the second gargoyle had already dived down.  Perhaps seeing its companion wounded, this gargoyle's attack was extremely fierce. However, now able to summon the Bird of Soul, Rhode naturally did not plan to clash head-on with it again. Faced with the black shadow that had embarrassed him earlier, all Rhode did was look up and whistle.  Following that, a gust of wind suddenly howled past, forcibly pushing aside the black shadow that wanted to attack Rhode, causing it to lose its aim and tumble several times before crashing into the church wall and stopping.  Of course, Rhode would not miss such a good opportunity. Under his command, a cyan tornado rose from the ground, and the soaring bird spread its wings, attacking the enemy once again.  For a moment, the tables were turned. The two gargoyles that had been strutting in the sky were now in a sorry state like drowned dogs, while Rhode, who had been under pressure earlier, was now singing triumphantly, having regained the advantageous situation.  He consciously let the Bird of Soul cooperate with him, forcibly separating the two gargoyles, ensuring that at any time, they could maintain a "two against one" situation, forcing one of them to be unable to come to the rescue in time.  Although the situation had changed for a while, Rhode could not achieve further results. This was because his strength had already been largely depleted earlier, and although in the game, players can be "fully revived with full health" after leveling up, it's obviously impossible to have such a good deal in reality. So, even though Rhode had reached level 10 and activated his talent, his soul power had only increased based on the original amount he should have had.  Just relying on these was not enough to kill two gargoyles. Moreover, controlling two summons at the same time consumed more of Rhode's soul power, and he even had to be more careful with his consumption to avoid "powering down."  After all, the level difference between the two sides was too great, and the gargoyle's defense was not to be underestimated. Rhode's previous attacks only managed to break one of their wings, without causing particularly serious damage to them. In this case, if Rhode went all out, he indeed had the possibility to kill one of the gargoyles. But then, having exhausted all his strength, he would have to face the other one alone unarmed—the outcome is predictable to anyone with a brain.  Now all Rhode could do was try to keep these two annoying creatures suppressed and wait for Lije and Meis to find that "control core." Otherwise, the situation would revert to the way it was before.  "——!"  Although one wing had been disabled, the gargoyle had not lost its threat. It crawled on the ground like a huge black stone dog, running on all fours like a ghost across the ground. This was the terrifying aspect of these alchemical creatures—if you think of them as monsters that only show off in the air, you'll be in for a huge loss.  Fortunately, Rhode had a deep understanding of them. Although he wasn't naive enough to think that just by knocking the gargoyles out of the sky he could have his way with them, this still made Rhode feel much less pressure, after all, he didn't have to worry too much about what was above his head.  The dark figure appeared behind Rhode, and the gargoyle howled as it extended its right claw toward Rhode's back. But at the next moment, Rhode sidestepped, and the immaculate blade in his hand turned into a lightning bolt, barely blocking the attack.  At the same time, Rhode extended his left hand, and the Bird of Soul circling around him immediately chirped and flew upon seeing his gesture, barely stopping the other gargoyle that was trying to attack from the air.  Although the Bird of Soul was not at a level where it could cause much damage to rare elites like gargoyles, as a pure elemental creature, it wasn't particularly difficult for it to simply block.  As time ticked by, Rhode's heart became more and more anxious. He felt his body tired and even his spirit somewhat wilted, which was a sign that his soul power was about to be exhausted. But there was still no movement inside the church—had they not found the control core yet?  "Huff!!" A piercing wind sounded beside Rhode, startling him. He instinctively dodged to the side, trying to activate Shadow Flash, but as he prepared to dodge, he stumbled, and the skill he was supposed to activate failed.  The soul power was about to run out! This sank Rhode's heart, but at this moment he had no time to think about anything else. He quickly turned around and thrust his sword backward.  The hard stone claw collided with the white long sword, emitting a harsh friction noise.  The gargoyle, missing its strike, quickly retreated, but Rhode could not pursue.  And at that moment, suddenly, a voice came from behind him.  "Mr. Rhode! We've found it!!" Chapter 18: The Gargoyle's Heart  "Mr. Rhod! We've found it!" Hearing this voice, Rhod immediately turned around and saw Mace standing at the church door with a surprised look, holding a beautifully carved small statue high in his hand. The statue depicted a curled-up gargoyle with two eyes made of ruby fragments, faintly emitting a dark red glow.  That was the control core!  Mace's shout also caught the attention of the gargoyles. As alchemical creatures, they certainly knew what the object in the opponent's hand was. Quickly, two gargoyles shifted direction and charged towards Mace.  "Whoa!" Seeing the two terrifying monsters rushing towards him, Mace couldn't help but let out a scream in fear. He instinctively wanted to turn and run, but at that moment, Rhod's voice had already reached him.  "Throw it over here!"  Despite facing the fearsome creatures, Mace, with a delusion that he was about to be completely torn apart the next moment, still steeled himself and threw the black, beautifully crafted statue. It must be said that the fat merchant's aim was indeed not very good. The object he threw described an arc in the air but veered off its intended course, not landing anywhere near Rhod but instead flying past the two gargoyles. To an uninformed observer, it might have seemed as though the fat merchant was in league with the two gargoyles.  Caught off guard by the unexpected gift, the gargoyle was momentarily stunned, but it still instinctively stretched out its claws, attempting to grasp the small statue. However, just as it was about to succeed, a breeze blew underneath it, and the nearly formless Soul Bird passed through the air with a series of translucent ripples, forcibly snatching away the statue.  This was Rhod's last bit of strength. Exhausted, he had to sheathe his longsword and raised his right hand, snapping his fingers. Accompanied by this sound, the Soul Bird elegantly traced through the air and then flew towards Rhod.  The two gargoyles, however, also immediately stopped in their tracks and changed direction.  "Swish!" The gargoyle running on the ground flipped over, its thick and long tail swinging fiercely and hitting the Soul Bird. Although it didn't cause much damage, the green wind element swirling around the Soul Bird was slightly disrupted, causing its form to wobble.  The green bird did not give up its advance. It continued to flap its wings desperately, quickly skimming over the ground, striving to reach its master. But it did not make it to its destination.  A stone claw descended from above, piercing through the body of the green bird. The chaotic elements of wind could no longer maintain the solidity of its body, and it dissipated instantly into its most primal form.  The black statue previously held in the bird's beak also flew out, but soon two dark shadows chased after it from behind. They extended their sharp claws, opened their mouths wide, and reached for the sculpture—until it quietly and steadily fell into Rhod's hands.  [The Gargoyle's Control Core has been obtained, identification complete.]  [Command——]  "Aig!" Rhod's voice was not loud, even somewhat low.  But at that moment, the attacking shadows underwent a change—their bodies, which had been glowing slightly, turned dull and dim in the blink of an eye. Their limbs, stretched out in mid-air, seemed to freeze and stopped moving, and the eerie red glow that had burned on the gargoyle's faces also vanished in an instant.  Then, the two shadows passed by Rhod and crashed heavily onto the ground behind him.  "Boom!!!" Along with the impact, the gargoyles, now devoid of energy, returned to their original statue form. They lay quietly on the ground not far behind Rhod, still in the posture of pouncing forward just moments ago. But having lost the support of magic, they were no longer as hard as before. With this collision, both gargoyles crumbled, turning from what were once artistic sculptures into worthless rubble.  "Phew............" It was only then that Rhod let out a sigh of relief.  At this moment, he felt weak all over, his legs soft from the excessive consumption of soul power, and even the fingers of his right hand holding the statue lacked strength. However, on the surface, Rhod still maintained a calm expression. He stood silently, and after a moment, he pocketed the statue.  "Mr. Rhod!" At this time, Lijie and Mace also ran to his side, looking at him with worried and anxious expressions.  "Are you alright!?"  "I'm fine." Rhod took a deep breath. He really wanted to sit down and rest for a while. Although in the game, excessive consumption of soul power would also show various symptoms, feeling it on his own body was still somewhat overwhelming. But he couldn't fall now.  Fortunately, the surrounding fog no longer showed the figures of those ghosts. It seemed that after failing to get close, they finally made the decision to give up and leave this forbidden area. Although this did not mean they had given up for good, it was still a good thing for now.  However, Rhod did not show much reaction, which was also a habit he had developed as a team leader. The commander of a team must always remain calm and cannot panic over every little thing. If one yells and screams at the slightest difficulty or becomes overly excited after defeating a strong enemy, it definitely would not bring any positive influence to one's subordinates.  Although Rhod was no longer the guild leader that commanded tens of thousands of players in the guild, this habit still influenced him. Nonetheless, seeing his calm demeanor, the somewhat nervous Lijie and Mace both let out a sigh of relief. After all, they had been worried about the outside situation while searching and feared that something might go wrong.  Lijie was very diligent, but in terms of identifying items, Mace was clearly more adept. They finally found the small statue in a little corner. It must be said that their luck was indeed quite good. Had they been a moment later, the situation could have been completely different.  Originally, Rhod's plan was to pass through the Mist Ruins as quickly as possible, but the appearance of the two gargoyles forced him to change his mind. After all, the gargoyles had almost completely depleted his strength. If he didn't rest and recover properly, the battles ahead would be even more dangerous.  Therefore, Rhod decided to rest in the church for the night and continue on the next day. He wasn't worried about any accidents occurring here. In the game's dungeon, this church was also a place where many players rested and sorted their loot, so there shouldn't be any major problems.  Although Mace looked at the pitch-black church and its creepy decorations with twitching legs, unfortunately, as always...  He had no say in opposing Rhod's decision.  The sky gradually darkened.  Thick fog lingered outside the church. Looking through the windows, nothing could be seen but a white expanse. The three sat in the center of the church, using the rotted and decayed benches and tables as firewood, which now burned in the fire, giving off their last bit of heat. Cold wind blew through the gaps in the broken windows and cracks in the walls, carrying a trace of chilliness.  Lijie carefully reached out her hand and began to unwrap the bandage on Rhod's left chest. Then she frowned slightly.  "It's split open again, Mr. Rhod."  "I know." Rhod nodded without saying much.  In fact, this wasn't the first time. After all, it was Rhod who had been fighting in the front all the way. Although he had been trying to avoid using his left hand due to the chest wound, when faced with particularly annoying troubles, he couldn't care less, which resulted in his wound splitting open from time to time. According to Lijie, an injury that would normally take two or three days of rest to heal was now likely to take more than ten days to recover due to this.  However, the girl couldn't complain about anything. After all, it was all for their sake. So all Lijie could do was help Rhod change to a clean bandage every day to prevent infection. Fortunately, before leaving the airship, as a spiritist, she had not neglected to bring these things.  After unwrapping the bandage, the sight of the wound under the firelight made everyone involuntarily gasp, with Mace even fearfully touching his own chest and looking at Rhod's wound with trepidation. There, on Rhod's chest were three black claw marks as thick as a forearm, covered in black scabs formed by dried blood. And due to the previous intense fight with the gargoyle, many of the scabs had been torn open, with fresh red blood seeping out and mixing with the black blood clots, chilling to look at.  Lijie took out a handkerchief, poured some water from a bottle, and pressed it to Rhod's chest. This caused the latter's body to instinctively twitch, and even Mace turned his head away, not wanting to watch any longer.  "Sorry, does it hurt a lot?"  "It's okay." In response to Lijie's flustered question, Rhod shook his head. Although it did hurt, it was not unbearable.  Hearing Rhod's reply, Lijie breathed a sigh of relief and continued to clean Rhod's wound. Meanwhile, the girl also began to secretly observe the young man slightly older than herself.  To be honest, when they first met, Rhod gave Lijie a very ordinary impression. Because he was very handsome and had fair skin, Lijie subconsciously regarded him as one of those noble sons. But because Rhod's demeanor was not as arrogant as the noble sons Lijie had seen before, she could accept him. However, at that time, she didn't take him too seriously. After all, a man who looks like a woman usually gives the impression of being weak.  But later on, Lijie's view slowly changed. Unlike those noble sons who were utterly powerless, this young man possessed considerable strength, no less than her own leader, and his character was very steady. Following him made one feel very safe, and even in the face of danger, he would not panic.  And different from his appearance, this was a very strong man.  Lijie knew how painful such injuries could be. As a spiritist, she had treated many people, and many tough men who wouldn't frown on the battlefield would scream during treatment. But Rhod had never made a sound from the beginning to the end. Not to mention that he still fought in the front with such a severe injury...  Lijie's hand paused for a moment.  What was she thinking?  What a mess of thoughts.  The girl shook her head, throwing those strange thoughts out of her mind, and continued with her work.  Rhod didn't notice the girl's unusual behavior. His attention was focused on his right hand. In the palm of his hand lay two gems emitting a dark red glow.  Those were the spoils of war Rhod had obtained from the battle, the heart of the gargoyle. Chapter 19: The Holy Sword Upgrades  As a caster's intimate guardian, the gargoyle can be said to be a favorite among all mages. However, since they are mages, most would choose to make the best use of everything. Although the gargoyle is quite good as a guardian, it would be a huge waste to use them only as bodyguards. Therefore, for many mages, in addition to using gargoyles as guards, they can also be used as—safes.  These two gargoyles were no exception. Among their fragments, Rhode found quite a few good things. As level 15 rare elites, the "drops" of the gargoyles were indeed very worthy of their rare elite status. In addition to gems, crystals, and a portion of gold coins, Rhode also discovered three magical items.  Frost Amulet [Elite Item]: When attacked, it can automatically trigger a frost shield to block 50~150 damage and is immune to water attribute attacks.  Oath Guardian [Excellent Item]: The bearer can increase spell effects by +5 and spell resistance by +5.  Ring of Mist [Excellent Item]: Every ten natural days, it can activate "Ethereal Transformation" once, lasting for half an hour.  These were very nice caster equipment, and if they were sold at the auction house, they would certainly bring in a substantial profit. Unfortunately, they are all caster equipment.  In the end, Rhode allocated these items to Lize. As a spirit master, although not an offensive caster, they were still beneficial for her, so Rhode gave her the Frost Amulet and the Oath Guardian, while he kept the Ring of Mist for himself. In the game, the skill possessed by this ring was of considerable help to those who solo dungeons, so Rhode unapologetically kept it for himself.  However, Lize was extremely surprised and puzzled that she got two pieces of equipment for doing nothing. She knew that in ordinary mercenary groups, although they would also gain quite a few magical items during their adventures, these items were generally sold by the group leader. The money from the sales was then used to maintain the operation of the entire mercenary group. It was almost unimaginable for items to be directly given to others like this. This also showed the gap between NPCs and players.  As part of this world, the ultimate goal of the mercenaries was only to earn money for a living. So even if they found rare equipment, most would not keep it. In fact, many small mercenary groups rarely take on tasks that are too difficult. They may even spend their entire lives doing third-rate tasks that don't seem very impressive to players because their goal is to make money to live, and that's it.  As for those qualified to obtain magical equipment, they are generally the respected and highly skilled individuals within the mercenary group.  And the less powerful mercenaries? They can only drool over it.  But players are different. Their goal from entering this world is to be better, to gain more experience, higher prestige, stronger characters. This is what players pursue.  So for them, magical equipment is not considered rare, and they are not worried about it rotting away—after all, when they find better ones, they can still sell the replaced ones.  Just like the three magical items in front of him. In Rhode's view, these items were just transitional equipment for levels 10~15, and then they would be meaningless. Although the attributes of the Frost Amulet were not bad, Rhode didn't need it. If he could have a high-level water elemental summoning spirit, he would also get the effect of being immune to water attribute attacks. Therefore, distributing such "low-end" equipment was not a big deal for him.  Unless it was something like the "Sword of the Heavens" or "Heart of the Saint," legendary or pseudo-legendary, or ancient-level items, he might consider it.  But for Lize, these items were extremely "high-end." Even the leader of a medium-sized mercenary group wouldn't have more than three to five pieces of magical equipment on them. There might be more magical equipment for mages, but as an auxiliary profession, it was very difficult for spirit masters to obtain equipment. Moreover, from their position and nature, they generally didn't need it.  And now, as a spirit master of a small mercenary group, she suddenly received two good magical items? This even made Lize wonder if she was dreaming.  However, compared to Lize, Mes, who was on the side, saw more from this. As a merchant who had traveled all over the south, Mes certainly understood how valuable a magical item could be. Especially these magical items, in Mes's view, even if taken to the bustling port of Kalag in the Northlands for auction, twenty to thirty thousand gold coins would not be a problem. But Rhode gave them away as if the items were a piece of bread and not equipment. This calmness was not the kind of pretense that a young man would deliberately show in front of a pretty girl, but a tranquility that came from the heart—that is, Rhode truly did not care about these magical items.  This was definitely not something ordinary people could do. Mes had dealt with many people, including mercenaries and nobles. However, for them, these magical items were also quite valuable, and few would throw them away so casually. And they would not look down on these items as Rhode did.  What did this represent? It meant that in the eyes of this young man, such magical equipment was simply not worth mentioning.  And this performance also indicated that this young man might come from an extraordinary background. If Mes had previously only considered Rhode to be just another member of the countless nobles on the continent, he had now begun to associate this young man with those historically prestigious noble families or royal families. Only those families would have so many magical items, and only they would look down on them as such—just as a person with countless wealth would not care about a small loss of money, which might be a huge sum that ordinary people could not obtain in their entire lives.  This thought made the fat merchant excited for a moment. As a small businessman, he usually had no chance to meet those historical noble families. After all, those big nobles all had powerful assistants, and his small commercial association couldn't attract their attention.  But now he had such an opportunity. If he could grasp it well, maybe there would be hope.  However, this thought was fleeting. Thinking of his pig-like performance along the way, although the young man had not complained too much, the fat merchant himself knew—he had not shown anything that would be deemed valuable by the other party, which made him deflate again.  Rhode indeed did not care about those three pieces of equipment. In fact, what he cared about the most now were the two heart-shaped gems in his hands.  Gargoyle's Heart. A condensed aggregation of an artificial soul.  This description might seem a bit complicated, but to put it in player's terms, if the gargoyle is considered a robot, then the Gargoyle's Heart would be its chip.  Its value goes without saying.  In the continent of Dragon Soul, alchemical creatures are a very high-end skill. Creating life is the prerogative of gods, and even mages cannot defy this. Artificial souls are their reluctant choice as the next best thing.  Because of this, complete artificial soul cores are very rare, and not every mage can learn to make them. But for mages, owning an artificial alchemical life form is one of their ultimate goals—just like a rich and handsome man must have a sports car to prove his value.  Such things are closely guarded by mages, rarely circulated in the market, and produced in small quantities, naturally making them very expensive. Normally, they could sell for over a hundred thousand gold coins at auction, and even more in the black market. Depending on the quality, the best artificial soul cores could even sell for several million, which is enough to buy a not-so-small territory.  Moreover, mages are very wealthy.  But Rhode was not very concerned about the money. His many years of player experience told him one thing: money can always be earned, and no matter how much you earn, it's never enough. But some things cannot be bought with money.  For example, the Gargoyle's Heart had another ability.  Forced upgrade of a summoned spirit's evolution +1.  The experience of a summon is shared with the holder. Generally speaking, during battle, if Rhode gained 1000 experience points, then he would actually only receive 700, with the remaining 300 points being gained by the spirits involved in the battle.  Although this one-third of experience doesn't seem like much, it adds up over time, which is why summoners have a harder time reaching the pinnacle compared to other professions.  In fact, according to the game rules, if Rhode were of another profession, then having consumed the experience of a level 10 five-man dungeon at level 8, he should have at least reached level 12 or 13 by now. But because the experience was shared with the Azure Bird and Star Mark, Rhode had just passed level 10.  As for his summons...  [The Eternal Holy Sword, rank 10: Star Mark, no attribute, can be merged—Not even the dust of history can bury its dazzling brilliance. LV: 5, Glory of Victory, Charge Forward, Blade Trait]  A summoned spirit's level can go up to level 10, after which they can evolve once. After evolving, not only will they undergo changes, but their level cap will also increase by another ten levels, until the third evolution arrives.  The Gargoyle's Heart's ability is to forcibly elevate a summoned spirit's level to 10 and then initiate evolution. This way, not only can he save some experience points, but also reduce the time needed to level up.  What is something that money can't buy? Time is something money can't buy.  Rhode didn't know the upper limit of Star Mark's level, but according to his experience, the summoning cards at the end of a deck generally don't have a very high level, and three evolutions are likely the limit. If he used the two Gargoyle's Hearts he had, at least when fighting monsters of the same level, the forcibly upgraded holy sword would not compete with Rhode for experience anymore.  But...  Rhode fell into thought. This set of holy sword cards was very unique. When he received this card from the president of B&M Company, he was clearly told that it was the only one of its kind in this world.  At that time, Rhode didn't take it seriously, but now that he thought about it, he found it strange. The only one of its kind? But the system prompt had clearly told him that he had only obtained 1/10 of the Eternal Deck, so how did it become the only one of its kind?  What about the remaining nine cards?  And this was the tenth, which meant there should be nine cards in front of it. But there was no such deck of cards in the game because it was just a keepsake in reality. In the background of the Dragon Soul Continent game, Rhode had not heard any information about the Holy Sword Deck.  Moreover, it could not be hidden in the game because the birth of this deck of cards was due to his victory in the competitive tournament. Since the guild he formed was called Starlight, the company specially designed this card as a prize and memento for him.  Such a rush job product could not possibly be incorporated into the game system.  But no matter what, it was worth a try.  Thinking this, Rhode extended his right hand and held one of the gems in his palm. Soon, a system prompt appeared before his eyes.  [Discovery of the Gargoyle's Heart (Magical Item), do you wish to use it?]  Use.  Rhode answered in his heart.  Following Rhode's answer, the summoning magic array that appeared on his right palm immediately flashed with faint magical light. Then, the dark red gem shattered under this light, turning into dust and disappearing.  Soon, new information appeared before Rhode's eyes.  [Target?]  Star Mark.  Rhode lowered his eyes and answered in his heart.  [Target—Star Mark—Forced Evolution]  [Level upgrade completed]  [Proceed with evolution?]  Yes.  The immaculate card once again appeared in Rhode's hand, its radiance attracting the curious gazes of Lize and Mes nearby.  And at this moment, a series of system prompts also emerged before Rhode's eyes.  [Evolution completed]  [The Eternal Holy Sword, rank 10: Star Mark, no attribute, can be merged—Not even the dust of history can bury its dazzling brilliance. LV: 10, Glory of Victory, Charge Forward, Blade Trait, Snow White Wings Protect All, Guardian Trait, Holy Light Dispels Darkness, Piercing Trait]  [Attached Skills: Blade Technique, Wing Protection, Star Beacon. Can be used three times per natural day]  Not bad!  Seeing this system prompt, Rhode nodded in satisfaction. Star Mark had three special skills, and these skills were all attached to the weapon, which meant that using these skills would not consume Rhode's soul power.  And the usage limit of three times per natural day was also top-notch, and it was imaginable that it would play a significant role in battle.  But the following system prompt made Rhode slightly startle.  [Detection of magic condensation]
