Chapter 189: Affairs between the Supervisor and the Empress Dowager 64  Xiao Mo had a moment where her spirit was deeply stirred, and she felt a wave of sorrow. The Supervisor... he dares not move. Once his body moves, his mind would also start to function, and he, being so intelligent, would surely know that Bai Weiwei was already dead. He didn't want to admit it, nor dare to think deeply about it, so he could only force himself to sit there, convincing himself that Bai Weiwei was just asleep and would wake up.  Xiao Mo felt that only when Bai Weiwei's body started to rot would the Supervisor truly regain his senses and realize that the person he was holding hands with had been dead for a long time. However, strangely enough, Bai Weiwei's body showed no sign of change. Even her pale complexion had improved quite a bit, and although her body was cold, it was undoubtedly just like she was asleep. Not a single characteristic of a corpse appeared.  Mu Yanjun kept watch over her, his gaze becoming brighter and brighter. Finally, the wretched old doctor was brought in; he was consuming heart-protecting pills, "I reckon that most of my old life is already gone."  Mu Yanjun had not slept for five days, and anyone could see how weary he was. Yet, he was exceptionally lucid, alarmingly and unnaturally so.  "After I had her take the medicine, she has been sleeping like this. I thought it was time to ask you to come and see when she will wake up," he said.  The old doctor sighed and only then approached the bedside to take Bai Weiwei's pulse. "Actually, this phenomenon is extremely rare. There is no need for treatment, but there is one particularly important thing that needs to be done..."  Mu Yanjun listened attentively, like a studious student, with a fire burning in his eyes.  The old doctor's voice lowered, "It's that I have to treat another person now..."  Mu Yanjun leaned forward, not wanting to miss a word he said. However, the old doctor moved as quick as lightning, sticking a needle into his neck in an instant.  Mu Yanjun's eyes widened dramatically, and his hand already slapped towards the old doctor's Baihui acupoint. Xiao Mo's hand stretched out to intercept Mu Yanjun's attack. In this exchange, Mu Yanjun could no longer hold on and fainted.  The old doctor touched his own head, "I almost died. But I guess I won't live much longer either. If he wakes up and is not crazy, that would be good."  Bai Weiwei couldn't be saved. As for Mu Yanjun's condition, it was simply heartbreakingly sorrowful; all his organs were showing problems. Not eating, not sleeping, not thinking, not moving, he was no different from a living dead. If he persisted for another two days, he would probably join Bai Weiwei in death.  Xiao Mo looked at the old doctor, "You guard our Supervisor's life. If you can't protect him this time, I will kill you with my own hands." After speaking, she turned around and went out to the place where they received punishment, silently accepting her penalty.  The old doctor sighed, "No wonder my master said that one should not become a miracle doctor even if you're selling sweet potatoes. Everyone treats me like a god, but even a god cannot make a person who wants to die continue living."  Mu Yanjun only slept for two hours before his eyes opened. He was startled, a rare panic appeared in his eyes, but he found himself unable to move.  Seeing him awake, the old doctor said, "I gave you an acupuncture treatment. Your spirit is greatly diminished, but with some nurturing, you should go meet the King of Hell."  Mu Yanjun's eyes darkened, his face pale and haggard, but full of murderous intent, chilling to behold.  The old doctor gave him another needle, "I originally didn't want to save you, after all, a person like you is cruel and ruthless. Bringing you back to life, who knows what chaos you would bring to this world."  Mu Yanjun's voice was soft and eerie, "Let me go."  The old doctor shook his head, "That won't do. I can't save your beloved, but saving you is also a form of compensation."  Suddenly, Mu Yanjun let out a piercing laugh, "You can't compensate, how could you possibly make up for it? Even if you save everyone in this world, you couldn't make up for a single hair of hers." Chapter 190: Affairs of the Supervisor and the Empress Dowager (End)  The old man: "You are not stupid after all, knowing that she is already dead."  Mu Yanjun's body trembled violently, and the needle that was crucial to restraining him seemed to be unable to hold him back anymore. Seeing this, the old man had no choice but to insert a few more needles.  "Her situation is quite special; you were too late, and the medicine didn't have time to take effect before she died. Therefore, all the medicinal effects protected her body, allowing her to remain uncorrupted for years. Unless you burn her with fire, apart from being a bit cold, she looks no different from a person in a deep sleep," said the old man.  With a sigh, he continued, "So when the young emperor heard this, he had her body taken away and burned."  Upon hearing this, Mu Yanjun understood the young emperor's intentions.  "Good, good, good," he said in a chain of affirmations, laughing coldly, "Everyone wants to take her away, don’t expect any of you to live."  After that, the needles in his body burst out one by one, and blood gushed from the wounds.  The old man saw this and knew that there was nothing he could do to reverse the situation. The thing that hurts people the most since ancient times is the emotion of love.  Mu Yanjun freed himself from the divine doctor's acupuncture restraints and flew out of the place.  The old man thought he was doomed, but Mu Yanjun didn't have time to kill him and disappeared from the spot.  The old man shakily took out a pill to protect his heart and ate it, thinking, "I won't live much longer. Mu Yanjun is indeed very vicious. Not killing me outright, is he planning to torture me slowly?"  A huge pile of wood had already been set up in front of the palace.  Bai Weiwei lay in the midst of the firewood, quiet and soft as if in deep sleep.  Xiao Pang, with eyes red, was so angry he bit his teeth until they bled. He cried until his voice was hoarse, saying, "Send my mother on her way."  Except for Mu Yanjun, everyone in the palace had accepted to send Bai Weiwei off.  Mu Yanjun's people, fearing that their supervisor had become obsessed and delusional, tacitly allowed the young emperor to burn Bai Weiwei's body.  The fire ignited instantly.  Xiao Pang couldn't bear it and knelt down, crying.  But before the fire could reach Bai Weiwei's body, a shadow rushed in recklessly, diving into the flames, lifting Bai Weiwei's body, and then leaping out of the fire.  When Xiao Pang saw the person clearly, he yelled in immense hatred, "Mu Yanjun, may you die a horrible death. My mother was killed by you, and yet you still want to defile her corpse. You are not human."  Mu Yanjun held Bai Weiwei, his hair tips and clothing edges singed by the flames, but Bai Weiwei remained unscathed.  He didn't respond, only said indifferently, "It seems that any riff-raff dares to step on my head now. It's time to clean up the palace."  With these words, Mu Yanjun returned to his old self—sinister, cruel, the almighty Nine Thousand Years Old.  The emperor was placed under house arrest.  People in the palace were slaughtered and cleaned out, especially those who had tacitly agreed to send Bai Weiwei's body to be burned. Regardless of whether they were Mu Yanjun's confidants, they were killed without exception.  Mu Yanjun refused to change for the better, treating the emperor as a puppet and the whole world as a slaughterhouse. Killing became his only hobby.  Mu Yanjun lazily looked outside the door, the ground stained red with blood.  He tenderly stroked Bai Weiwei, who was leaning in his embrace, "Weiwei, look, I killed people again today. If you beg me, I'll stop, okay?"  Bai Weiwei remained silent.  Mu Yanjun smiled and said, "If you don't speak, then I'll continue to kill."  He had once said that if she dared to die, he would drag everyone in this world down to hell to accompany her in burial.  Holding her cold body, Mu Yanjun spoke with seduction, "I am such a bad person, but if you were willing to teach me, maybe I could change for the better."  As he spoke, Mu Yanjun suddenly couldn't bear it and rested his head on her cold neck, silently shedding tears.  "Why won't you, won't you give me a chance to change?" Chapter 191 Reality 1  When Ye Yuxuan struggled to get up from the bed, his entire body was drenched in sweat. He was trembling, his complexion pale to an alarming extent. Suddenly unable to bear it, he hugged himself, gritting his teeth as if trying to call out someone's name. But he murmured silently many times and still couldn't call out the name of the woman in his dream.  His heartbeat was fast, and with closed eyes, he could see the sea of fire from his dream spreading out, ready to engulf him at any moment. He looked down at his own hands, as if he was still holding her. The happiness, sorrow, and anger were slowly fading, but the deep love ingrained in his bones seemed to have been transmitted to him from a man named Mu Yanjun.  Ye Yuxuan knew that he had been particularly out of sorts recently. And this feeling of being off had started to affect his emotions. For instance, right now, he actually felt... sad? Was it sadness? His chest hurt as if someone had drilled a hole in it, yet all the medical checks showed no issues with his body.  Ye Yuxuan pondered for a long while in a daze before finally getting out of bed. Just as he got out of bed, a servant came over and whispered, "Doctor Qin is here." Ye Yuxuan nodded faintly, asking the servant to pour him a glass of water, and then went downstairs with the water.  He discovered that the front door of his house was open, and Qin Qiu was directing a bunch of medical personnel to move medical equipment inside. Ye Yuxuan watched quietly, his somber eyes showing no ripple of emotion.  Qin Qiu looked up and saw Ye Yuxuan, already accustomed to his deadpan expression, and quickly went up to him saying, "My guest room is still there, right?" Ye Yuxuan nodded, "Isn't your guest room supposed to be reserved for a lifetime?" He had many rooms in his place, and Qin Qiu often came over, so he had reserved a room exclusively for him.  Qin Qiu: "Of course I know, so I'm just using it temporarily." Ye Yuxuan did not make a sound.  Without needing to be asked, Qin Qiu said, "You think I want to live here long term, but you are wrong. I have a lot of work at the hospital; how can I have time to stay here often?"  Ye Yuxuan didn't even bother with a grunt of acknowledgment.  Qin Qiu continued on his own, "So I've moved your fiancée into my room." Ye Yuxuan thought for a moment, then calmly said, "Bai Weiwei?"  Qin Qiu: "Yeah, I've already taken her to the room. Old Master Bai suspects there are many problems in his household, especially since Bai Weiwei was kidnapped from the hospital a few days ago. He feels he can't trust anyone around him, so he has entrusted Bai Weiwei to you for now, since you are her fiancé, right?"  Ye Yuxuan thought for a while, "I don't have time to take care of a patient."  Qin Qiu: "But that's your fiancée."  Ye Yuxuan nodded, "Then I just won't have a fiancée."  Qin Qiu was shocked, "What?"  Ye Yuxuan: "Anyway, you can bring her in, but you take care of her."  Qin Qiu roared, "She's not my fiancée."  Ye Yuxuan looked indifferent, "I'll give her to you then."  Qin Qiu almost spat out a mouthful of old blood, defeated. Ye Yuxuan shouldn't have a fiancée; he should live with a robot.  Qin Qiu decided not to talk to this emotionally stunted child. He needed to calm down, no, he needed to set up the environment for Bai Weiwei. After all, she was not in good health and had been in a deep sleep, requiring special care and medical equipment to sustain her life.  Qin Qiu was quick with his hands and feet, setting up the equipment quickly and ensuring Bai Weiwei's condition was stable before instructing the caregiver to watch over her throughout the night.  After he left the room, he saw Ye Yuxuan holding a cup of water, still sitting on the sofa in the living room, as if pondering something. Chapter 192: Reality 2  Qin Qiu was also thirsty, and after asking a servant to bring some water, he took a big gulp before saying, "You have insomnia?"  Ye Yuxuan nodded lightly, "I feel there's something I need to think about."  Qin Qiu walked over to the sofa opposite him, sipping water and asking, "What problem do you need to think about? Is it possible that the company is going bankrupt?"  Ye Yuxuan said calmly, "I'm wondering, will I become a corpse violator?"  Qin Qiu spat out the water in his mouth, "Corpse violator!"  Ye Yuxuan continued calmly, "It's just that in my dream, I dreamt about that man, always wanting to violate the corpse."  Qin Qiu said, "Stop, stop, stop, what kind of strange dream did you have again?"  Ye Yuxuan's expression became rare and distracted, "I dreamt she died, but her corpse always looked as cute as if she were sleeping."  Qin Qiu's voice became strange, "Cute?"  It's unbelievable that Ye Yuxuan would describe someone as cute, as if the sky were falling.  Ye Yuxuan repeated seriously and emphatically, "Yes, cute."  Then he continued, "And in the dream, that man, many times he couldn't help it, wanting to violate the corpse."  ---  Sequel:  The hot springs were misty, in this space where steam was rising. A delicate and beautiful figure lay quietly on the edge of the hot spring, with black hair falling into the water, floating like seaweed.  Mu Yanjun's face was somewhat flushed, his eyes burning with a frightening intensity. He struggled for a long time before gently releasing her body, not committing the most beastly act.  When did it all begin? Was it watching her sleeping corpse day after day without any response? Or was it when he started to go mad, sick, and even twisted?  He had tried every method to stop himself, but in the end, he couldn't help but undress her.  Only when touching her cold skin did he feel alive.  Murder no longer provoked any reaction in him.  She was dead.  He knew, he always knew.  He even knew how dark and terrible he was for not wanting to bury her.  When the young emperor was six years old, he would rather burn her corpse than leave it to him.  Maybe he knew from the start that he would commit such an act of desecration upon her.  Many times he really wanted to do it, but often at the last step, when he looked at her peaceful face, he couldn't go through with it.  He was afraid that down there, she would get angry, ignore him.  Although they were already married, only the final step was left.  Still, he didn't dare to take the risk.  Mu Yanjun endured for a long time before suppressing the burning sensation in his body, not truly breaking through the line to enter her.  He carefully washed her body clean and dressed her in comfortable and beautiful clothes before carrying her out.  The palace was empty, and the servants were fleeing everywhere.  When he learned that the young emperor began to cultivate forces and contact various military powers, planning to stand on his own, he never stopped him.  He even occasionally helped him.  The young emperor had also grown up, Mu Yanjun calculated, he was sixteen this year.  Ten years had passed, and he had been guarding the cold body of Bai Weiwei for ten years.  So fast, yet so slow.  Mu Yanjun carried Bai Weiwei, slowly walking to the palace gate, only to see a tall figure in armor, holding a long sword, leading the imperial guards surrounding the palace.  The young man's face was handsome and stern. He pointed his sword at Mu Yanjun and said harshly, "Mu traitor, return my mother to me, and I can leave you a whole corpse." Chapter 193: Reality 3  The Little Emperor grew up quickly, living a life of humiliation and sneaking survival under the feet of Mu Yanjun. In such humiliation, he began to vie for power and profit step by step, treading on blood, until now, finally able to wield a sword to seek revenge.  Mu Yanjun's face remained calm as he gently smoothed a strand of Bai Weiwei's hair that the wind had tousled, tucking it behind her ear. His expression was indescribably tender, then he looked up at the Little Emperor.  "Still coming? She has always been mine from the beginning to the end; what makes you think you can have her back?" said Mu Yanjun.  The Little Emperor's eyes reddened with anger, and he said word by word, "My mother has already died, the dead should be respected, how can you... how can you keep holding onto her body and not let her rest in peace, as if you won't let her be reincarnated peacefully?"  Everyone in the palace knew that Mu Yanjun lived with his mother, sharing the same residence and bed. He had seen a lot of secret affairs, how could he not know those dirty thoughts this eunuch had towards his mother.  "You claim to love my mother, but what you do is to humiliate her. How can you have the face to say you love her?" The Little Emperor said this, almost unable to hold back his tears. He hated his own lack of strength to protect Bai Weiwei, and also hated that he grew up too slowly to give Bai Weiwei a grand funeral even in death.  Mu Yanjun looked at the Little Emperor with a dark gaze, then suddenly smiled, "I did it on purpose. I heard that as long as you keep a person's body from being buried, her soul can only be trapped next to the body."  The Little Emperor suddenly remembered that this Mu villain had once invited high monks to the palace. Sure enough, he heard Mu Yanjun laugh and say, "I invited high monks to cast a soul-locking charm. If there really is a soul after death, she will not be able to escape from me and will have to stay by my side day and night."  The Little Emperor trembled all over with anger, his eyes bloodshot, and he shouted, "Mu Yanjun, is this how you love someone? You're simply a madman."  Mu Yanjun's smile at the corner of his mouth grew larger, eventually becoming crazily twisted, "I have long been a madman. Even if she dies, she won't be able to get rid of me. I want her to be entwined with me life after life."  The Little Emperor waved his hand, "Charge in and capture him."  He wouldn't feel relieved unless Mu Yanjun was cut to pieces. But before anyone could move, suddenly flames surged up. The palace had already been doused with oil, and a spark together with the wind caused the flames to reach the sky instantly.  Everyone had to back away to avoid the fire. The Little Emperor saw Mu Yanjun standing in the fire, holding Bai Weiwei, and in a moment of impulse, couldn't help but rush into the fire.  The people behind him immediately held him back, "Your Majesty, you can't go in. The fire can't be extinguished. If you go in, how will you survive?"  The Little Emperor, disregarding everything, shouted at Mu Yanjun with all his heart, "Mu Yanjun, let her go, let her go!"  The fire would not stop burning until everything was consumed. Mu Yanjun, holding Bai Weiwei, could not be separated in the end as they burned together.  Hearing the Little Emperor's words, Mu Yanjun looked up and smiled. In the light of the fire, his smile was indescribably relieved and relaxed, even the teardrop mole under his eye became more vivid.  Then he held Bai Weiwei and turned around to slowly walk into the palace engulfed in flames. If they couldn't be together in life, they would merge into one even as ashes in death.  For ten years, he had been thinking about merging with her day and night, but always stopped at the very last step. Because he knew that even if he obtained her body, it would still be a lifeless object.  If there really was a next life, and she knew of his vile and dirty ways, she might not want him anymore.  Now it was good. In death, they could be burned together, inseparably. Chapter 194: Reality 4  Mu Yanjun couldn't help but hug her even tighter, as flames began to consume their bodies. He lowered his gaze to look at her. Then, he rested his head on her neck and whispered softly, "I miss you so much, Weiwei."  ---  Qin Qiu clutched his head, feeling a headache coming on. What the hell is this stuff? Ye Yuxuan continued speaking, "In the end, the young emperor simply couldn't separate their ashes, and had to grudgingly bury them together in a single urn."  Qin Qiu waved his hand dismissively, "I think there's definitely something wrong with you recently."  Ye Yuxuan nodded, "I know."  Qin Qiu said, "You must be so pent up that you're becoming a pervert, even your dreams are twisted. You've been dreaming about love all the time lately, don't deny it, you must be going crazy wanting a relationship."  Ye Yuxuan silently looked at him.  Qin Qiu clapped his hands forcefully, "Why are you looking at me? Otherwise, why would you have such dreams? Over the years, you haven't been with women much, let alone **. What kind of man are you?"  Ye Yuxuan spoke calmly, "I feel like it's not a dream, it feels more like reality."  Qin Qiu, "Oh my god, your delusions are so severe now? You're taking dreams for reality?"  Ye Yuxuan couldn't be bothered to persuade others, he stood up, "I'm going to the company."  Qin Qiu reached out to hold him, "It's four in the morning, what company are you going to? I'm telling you, you should get into a relationship and lose your V. I've seen many old virgins like you, longing for a woman to the point of madness."  Ye Yuxuan tried to pull away, but found that Qin Qiu was holding on tight.  Qin Qiu continued, "You should go meet your fiancée now, start a relationship with her, and once things fall into place, you can do some shameful things. That way you won't always have those frustrated dreams."  Ye Yuxuan said, "Let go."  Qin Qiu said, "Don't be shy, young man. I know the pain of never having been in a relationship..."  Ye Yuxuan, "Old virgin, let go."  Qin Qiu stood there as if struck by lightning.  Ye Yuxuan, with a poker face, defeated his opponent effortlessly and went to work at the company at four in the morning.  Qin Qiu clutched his chest, "Ye Yuxuan, I shouldn't have saved your future wife, I should let you taste the bitterness of being alone."  After Ye Yuxuan left, Qin Qiu sighed, feeling as if he had aged many years. He remembered that he should go check on Bai Weiwei, as she was still asleep.  However, as soon as he opened the door, he heard the nurse's voice, "Miss Bai, wait, you can't pull out the needle like that."  Bai Weiwei didn't care about that, she just wanted to strangle the system. That damn system had exchanged her life points for a life extension pill, and her life for an entire month had been traded away.  Adding on the life safety welfare she received from the last dimension, five days of life points were deducted.  As soon as she woke up, she heard that she owed the system five days of life, and her heart disease immediately acted up.  In order not to let her die, the system directly used the life extension pill, gaining ten days of life, and after deductions, only five days were left.  After more deductions, only an hour remained.  From five days, a total of one hundred and twenty hours, it was deducted down to just one hour.  She wanted to chop up the system; who would believe it wasn't the system's doing?  The system tried to soothe her, "Host, calm down."  Bai Weiwei, "Calm your sister."  The system consoled, "Broaden your horizons, it's just a little bit of life points, don't take it to heart."  Bai Weiwei, "Broaden your head, you'd better shut up, or I'll stuff you into a beer bottle and smash it with a hammer." Chapter 195: Reality 5  The system immediately shuts up. She doesn't have the time to ask in detail what was deducted, leaving her with only an hour of life left, as she has more important things to do right now. Bai Weiwei got out of bed, rushed to the door, and saw Qin Qiu opening the door, looking at her in astonishment. Bai Weiwei had seen him a few times before, after all, he was the hospital director. She spoke very quickly, "Director, hello, where is this place?" Waking up to find the room changed, could it be the hospital's super VIP ward?  Qin Qiu immediately said, "This is your fiancé's house, it's like this, your father wants you two to deepen your relationship... Holy shit, what are you doing?" Bai Weiwei's hand actually went straight for his clothes, like a starving wolf pouncing on a sheep. She didn't have time to listen to what he was saying, and took out a cellphone directly from his pocket to call her own father.  As soon as the call connected, she swiftly said, "Dad, that bitch Bai Yaoyao wants to kill me. I had a heart attack, she tampered with my medicine trying to steal my fiancé, my company's position, everything I have. I was lucky not to die, last time she even instigated An Le, that bastard, to kidnap me intending to drown me. You better get someone to control her, and then wait for me to come back..."  She paused for a moment, then slowly and forcefully said, "Come back and slap her a thousand or eight hundred times, to wake her up, a wild chicken is destined not to become a phoenix. Even if she became a phoenix, I could pluck her feathers and stew her." There was a long pause from the other end of the line, as if digesting her words.  Then suddenly a light laughter came through, "Big sister, I don't know what you're talking about, have you been sick for a long time, and something is wrong with your brain?" Bai Weiwei's heart trembled, Bai Yaoyao?  "Where's dad?" Bai Yaoyao: "You mean our father? He's asleep, it's so late, you shouldn't disturb him."  Bai Weiwei sneered coldly, "What do you want to do?"  Bai Yaoyao sneered, "What do I want to do? I want you dead, will you die?"  Bai Weiwei took a deep breath, "That's also your dad, don't hurt him."  Bai Yaoyao clenched her teeth, "Is he my dad? You ask yourself, in Bai Changyan's heart and eyes, there's only you, his precious darling, and I'm just a damn weed. If something happens to you, he gets anxious and upset, if I died, he probably wouldn't even blink."  Bai Weiwei quickly walked outside, but saw that the room outside was completely a strange house, a huge living room with a dazzling and expensive crystal chandelier overhead. The butler was on night duty, and the servants quietly came and went without a sound. The door was of a special design that couldn't be opened without permission.  Ye Yuxuan's room? Bai Weiwei finally had the time to remember, her strange and utterly useless fiancé, what kind of a wealthy man he was.  "What do you want? As long as you don't hurt dad, I agree to anything." Bai Weiwei's weakness was Bai Changyan. Although Bai Changyan was swindled when he was young, resulting in Bai Yaoyao, his illegitimate daughter. But to Bai Weiwei, Bai Changyan truly poured out his love.  Bai Yaoyao laughed with pleasure, "Big sister, my sister who always seems like a queen high above, you actually speak to me in such a humble tone? I'm at home now, dad is right beside me."  Bai Weiwei had already reached the front door, on the other end of the phone, that woman's voice was still arrogant. "Dad is tied up with a bomb by me, now you have to choose, do you exchange your life for his, or just watch him die without saving him?" Chapter 196: Reality 6  Bai Weiwei closed her eyes, calming herself down. Then she opened her eyes again, her gaze fierce and resolute.  "I choose to exchange my life for it," she declared.  Qin Qiu had just walked over when he heard Bai Weiwei's words.  He was completely confused. "What happened?"  Bai Weiwei turned around, "Open the door, lend me your car."  Qin Qiu also realized that something was wrong with Bai Weiwei's state, so he immediately ordered the servants to open the door, and then went to get the car.  Bai Weiwei quickly followed, and as soon as the car door opened, she squeezed past Qin Qiu, sat in the driver's seat, closed the door, and drove off. The sequence of actions was terrifyingly fast.  By the time Qin Qiu came back to his senses, the car had already sped away.  Qin Qiu was utterly shocked. He suddenly started to run wildly after his car.  "Bai Weiwei, give me back my phone!"  How was he supposed to play King's Glory without his phone?  ---  Ye Yuxuan's place was about an hour's distance from her home.  Bai Weiwei rushed over with reckless speed, and by the time she arrived home, the system reminded her, "There are only ten minutes left."  Couldn't she live a bit longer? What exactly did this broken system do with her life points?  She never managed to successfully live through a day.  Bai Weiwei unlocked the door with her fingerprint, and the house was empty, not a single person in sight.  Where were the dozens of servants that were usually there? Had Bai Yaoyao dismissed them all?  Bai Weiwei's heartbeat was racing; if not for the life points given by the system that greatly improved her physical condition, she would have probably had a heart attack.  Suddenly, Bai Yaoyao appeared at the top of the stairs, "Sister, you're here."  Bai Weiwei looked at her coldly, "Where's dad?"  Bai Yaoyao looked at her tenderly, "Dad took some sleeping pills. His vigilance is really strong. If I hadn't looked for the opportunity for so long, I wouldn't have been able to put him to sleep."  Bai Weiwei took steps upward, "You want my life, how do you plan to take it? Do you want me to jump off the building myself, or do you want to slash my face and stab me dozens of times to vent your anger?"  Suddenly, Bai Yaoyao said, "Don't come over, sister. I'm afraid of your special abilities."  Surviving poison, cars flying to the sky.  She found it ridiculous, but she couldn't help but guard against it.  Just as Bai Weiwei was about to stop, the system's cold voice said, "Three steps left, hurry, Weiwei, go up."  Bai Weiwei didn't expect the system to suddenly remind her—what did it mean by "three steps left"?  She almost instantly chose to trust the system.  Bai Yaoyao's face changed, "Stop!"  But Bai Weiwei was just a few steps away from reaching her.  However, Bai Weiwei suddenly surged forward a few steps, and the system also reminded, "Ding, ‘Deep Love for You’ is activated, the effect lasts three minutes, please enjoy it happily."  Bai Yaoyao was about to scream to have An Le kill Bai Changyan when suddenly her mind shook, her pupils scattered for a few moments, and by the time she regained consciousness, she was already looking at Bai Weiwei with shiny eyes.  "Sister, I love you, love you, love you!"  Bai Weiwei was stunned for a moment. What the hell?  Bai Yaoyao suddenly rushed over, happy to hug her.  Bai Weiwei was startled and kicked her away.  Bai Yaoyao fell to the ground with a happy face, looking up, "Hitting indicates affection, scolding shows love, sister, kick me again, kick me, please."  Bai Weiwei felt like she was about to have a heart attack from disgust.  Yet at this moment, the system recited deeply and emotionally: "Dear, as a lonely single person in the deep night, do you envy the mandarin ducks flying side by side? Do you silently cry alone, only able to watch those dog couples holding hands in the distance? Don't be envious, stand up. The ‘Deep Love for You’ package only requires 119 hours of life points, and you can bring your love home. From now on, in your life, there will be someone to love you, hug you, kiss you, hehe you!"  Bai Weiwei staggered a couple of steps; her 119 hours of life points had been exchanged for this useless thing.  And Bai Yaoyao took the chance to hug her thigh, her face rippling with pleasure, "Sister, I love you so much, kick me to death."  As Bai Weiwei wished, she kicked her away.  "Scram, are you crazy?" Chapter 197: Reality 7  When An Le came out, he saw Bai Weiwei kicking Bai Yaoyao away and immediately took out the remote control for the bomb. Then he rushed to Bai Yaoyao's side, hugged her, and said to Bai Weiwei, "I advise you not to act rashly. Now, as long as I press this button..."  Bai Weiwei gritted her teeth and said, "An Le, you ungrateful wretch, you know how my dad treated you, and yet you stoop so low for this cheap woman?"  An Le took a deep breath, about to say something, when suddenly Bai Yaoyao jumped up in a fury and slapped An Le's left cheek askew.  "You made my sister angry. Look at my loving slap, giving you a heart-shaped peach." An Le: "......" Bai Weiwei: "......"  Bai Yaoyao looked affectionately at Bai Weiwei, then suddenly slapped An Le's right cheek.  "Sister, look, even when I hit someone, it's in the shape of love for you."  Bai Weiwei, with a mouthful of old blood stuck in her throat, felt like she couldn't take it anymore. She thought she needed medication, otherwise her heart disease was sure to act up.  An Le touched his face in confusion, "......"  The system leisurely added, "Actually, I saw these two cheap people setting up your dad with a life-extending pill as soon as I got back, extending his life by only ten days. After deducting five days, there are only one hundred and twenty hours left. I was worried that after you woke up, you would be threatened by these cheap people and be in danger, so I had to use your life points to buy the love package."  Bai Weiwei covered her chest, "Are you trying to disgust me? You could have just let Bai Yaoyao ascend to heaven. What's with this ghostly package?"  The system sighed, "We in the system world have laws; we cannot directly take someone's life. And you're too poor. You really can't afford anything offensive. You got those 119 hours just as the love package was discounted, and managed to snatch three minutes. For three minutes, Bai Yaoyao's love for you will be as vast as the universe. Whatever you tell her to do, she will do."  The system paused, then worriedly said, "You only have a few minutes left of life. The bomb still needs to be defused. After we get through this, let's go complete the next mission to save your life."  Bai Weiwei knew that now was not the time to dwell on this; her time was running out.  She immediately said to Bai Yaoyao, "Defuse the bomb on dad."  To take this cheap woman's life, the bomb had to be defused.  An Le, thinking of the strange events he had experienced before, and seeing Bai Yaoyao's drastic change in behavior, immediately realized this must be Bai Weiwei's doing.  He immediately restrained Bai Yaoyao with both hands, "Miss, what have you done to Yaoyao?"  Bai Weiwei's face became cold, "I said, defuse the bomb on my dad."  These words were like a firework of love, striking Bai Yaoyao's heart directly. She burst out with tremendous strength, flipping An Le over.  "Yes, my sister. Even defusing the bomb is in the shape of loving you."  Bai Yaoyao stretched out her hand with a face full of bliss, making a big heart shape, then turned around and viciously grabbed An Le's collar.  "Sister said, are you deaf? Defuse the bomb on dad."  An Le, with a worried face, "Yaoyao, have you been poisoned? Wake up. If you defuse the bomb, you won't be able to gain a foothold in the Bai family."  They had reached this point today, with no way out.  Once Bai Changyan died, and with Bai Weiwei being sickly, Bai Yaoyao would definitely have a chance to control the Bai family.  Bai Yaoyao suddenly thought of something, abruptly searched An Le and pulled out a gun for self-defense, pressing it under her own jaw, "Defuse it, you pig. How dare you contradict what my sister said, defuse it or I'll die and show you." Chapter 198: Reality 8  An Le was shocked. Next to him, Bai Weiwei added fuel to the fire, "If he doesn't dismantle the bomb, kill him and then commit suicide." Bai Yaoyao's eyes were filled with love, "Yes, my dear sister. I will definitely shoot heart-shaped bullets, killing and suicide are all in the shape of love for you."  Bai Weiwei was mentally exhausted: She didn't want to talk to this love-idiot at all, feeling like her IQ had been dragged down to the core of the earth.  An Le, although unwilling, couldn't let the demon-like Bai Yaoyao commit suicide. After all he had done, it was all for Bai Yaoyao.  Bai Changyan had taken sleeping pills and was sleeping very deeply.  Seeing her father lying there tiredly, the tears in Bai Weiwei's eyes were almost unstoppable.  Although An Le slowed down his movements, there were only a few steps to dismantling the bomb, and even if he was slower, he still finished dismantling it.  Bai Yaoyao's eyes were sparkling, "Dear sister, the bomb has been dismantled."  Bai Weiwei nodded, "You did well, drag him to death, bye."  The tears in Bai Yaoyao’s eyes flowed out from excitement, "Even the way you want to kill me is so beautiful. I love you so much, I wish I could turn into fireworks, and when they burst into the sky, they are all little hearts of love for you."  Bai Weiwei: She really wanted to cover her ears. F*ck your ‘heart’.  Bai Yaoyao, laughing satisfied and lasciviously, aimed the gun at An Le, "Dear sister said, it’s time for us to die, bye."  She pulled the trigger, aiming straight at An Le. However, at the critical moment, An Le rolled on the ground with agility, dodging the bullet and swiftly rushing toward her to snatch the gun from her hand.  His skills were way better than Bai Yaoyao’s. When he was serious, ten Bai Yaoyaos wouldn't stand a chance against him.  Bai Weiwei’s complexion changed; she knew that if An Le knocked Bai Yaoyao unconscious, both she and Bai Changyan wouldn't be able to escape from An Le's clutches.  Moreover, she heard the familiar reminder from the system.  【Countdown ten seconds... nine...】  There was no time left.  Bai Weiwei's eyes hardened, and she shouted directly at Bai Yaoyao: "Go jump off the building, right now, immediately."  An Le had become like this also because he liked Bai Yaoyao. If Bai Yaoyao jumped off the building, An Le could only chase after her.  Sure enough, Bai Yaoyao, without any hesitation, rushed outside, "Even if I jump off the building, I will jump in the shape of loving you."  An Le roared, "Yaoyao, what on earth is wrong with you? Wake up."  He could not care about anything else and could only desperately chase after her.  Bai Yaoyao looked like she was really going to jump off the building.  Bai Weiwei immediately made a phone call to her trusted people in the company, asking someone to come and protect Bai Changyan.  She momentarily forgot that this was not her phone, and in her haste, she directly pressed the familiar position, not noticing that the numbers in the call log were all incorrect.  As soon as the call connected, she immediately said: "Quickly come over, my dad is in danger, Bai Yaoyao is the murderer, in cahoots with An Le planning to kill him..."  She didn’t finish speaking.  A cold and calm voice came from the other end.  "Who are you?"  Bai Weiwei was stunned, quickly looked at the phone, and realized that she had dialed someone else by mistake.  She had no time for idle talk, immediately hung up the phone, and went to call the right person, but time had already run out.  【The system offers a free newbie gift pack, ding, unlocked, the host has obtained three days of vegetative state life, please quickly complete the next task to save your life.】  Bai Weiwei finally couldn't help but roar: "Can't you give anything other than a newbie gift pack?"  Is the system so poor that it only has newbie gift packs left? Chapter 199: Reality 9  Ye Yuxuan looked at his phone and suddenly felt that the voice was familiar. But in a moment of distraction, he couldn't remember whose voice it was. He continued to work for a while before he remembered that the number was Qin Qiu's. Ye Yuxuan redialed the phone, and as soon as it was connected, Qin Qiu's roar came through, "Ye Yuxuan, let me tell you, your fiancée's sister actually tried to kill her, and she even wanted to take her fiancé, her company's position, everything from her, and even tried to drown her. Now, she is even trying to kill Bai Changyan. I'm at the hospital right now, Bai Yaoyao ran to jump off a building, Bai Weiwei fainted, Bai Changyan woke up..." Ye Yuxuan hung up the phone calmly.  So, was he really unable to distinguish between dream and reality? Just now, he actually felt that the voice was particularly similar to that of the woman in his dreams. But...  He looked down at his phone; it wasn't a dream. Qin Qiu's phone had called twice just now. He suddenly stood up, grabbed the suit jacket on the chair, and walked straight out.  ---  When Qin Qiu arrived at the Bai family's place, he saw Bai Yaoyao stepping up the stairs in an enchantingly joyful manner. "Sister, I love you, I love you, I love you, I still love you even if I jump off a building."  An Le was chasing behind her, "Yaoyao, wake up, you're just poisoned, deeply hypnotized, what the hell have you been given, don't jump off the building."  What the hell?  Qin Qiu watched dumbfounded as they ran to the highest floor. Then he immediately went to find Bai Weiwei.  Bai Weiwei lay pale at the side of the bed. Alarmed, he immediately rushed over to pick her up. He had a feeling that something would go wrong and had already called for an ambulance and a police car. After calling Ye Yuxuan, the ambulance had also arrived and swiftly moved the people onto the ambulance.  When Bai Yaoyao jumped off the building, she was blocked by a canopy below, suffered severe injuries, and was taken straight to the operating room.  Bai Weiwei was in a not so bad condition with stable vital signs but was unconscious.  Bai Changyan, who had woken up, looked haggard as he watched his daughter. The house's surveillance had been destroyed, and he didn't know what had happened. But he guessed that the recent events must be related to his second daughter.  An Le had been locked up by him and was under severe interrogation.  When Ye Yuxuan arrived at the hospital, he saw Qin Qiu sitting outside Bai Weiwei's hospital room, silently crying. He paused, then walked up behind Qin Qiu and asked indifferently, "What happened?"  Qin Qiu turned around, holding his phone, "I lost my rank match again."  Ye Yuxuan didn't pay attention to him, "Who did you lend your phone to just now?"  Qin Qiu: "To Bai Weiwei."  Ye Yuxuan immediately pushed open the door of the ward and saw a woman lying on the bed. She was sleeping peacefully, looking somewhat haggard due to her long illness. Her lips were pale, her complexion not good, and even her long black hair had lost some of its luster.  Ye Yuxuan didn't know what he was thinking. He had seen her before; after all, she was his fiancée, but he never had any impression of her.  Qin Qiu then realized something was wrong and came in, "What are you looking at?" His gaze at Bai Weiwei was too frightening.  Ye Yuxuan was silent for a while before he softly said, "When she wakes up, I want to hear her voice." Her voice, for an instant, stirred his otherwise tranquil emotions, causing his heart, hard as a rock, to tremble. Chapter 200: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (1)  When Bai Weiwei woke up, she heard the system's voice ringing out. "Your mission objective is to win the love of Song Yunhuan. Target: Song Yunhuan, completion: zero. Time: four months."  She had no time to think further because as soon as she opened her eyes, she saw a pair of eyes filled with disbelief and hatred. Bai Weiwei was stunned to find that she had just forcefully pushed someone out. The person was young, with black hair that caught a halo of light when tossed in the sun, and beneath the messy hair was an extremely handsome face.  That face looked at Bai Weiwei with hatred as it fell out of the car. Bai Weiwei instinctively reached out to grab his hand but only caught his sleeve. Due to the force of speed and gravity, the sleeve tore, and the man still fell, instantly swallowed up by a mass of... zombies?  Bai Weiwei took a closer look and gasped. She was standing at the very back of a truck's cargo area, the doors wide open. The truck was full of people, and outside, a large group of decaying zombies were rapidly chasing after the vehicle. Whenever a human fell from the truck, they would rush over to feed.  The man she had pushed out had already disappeared into the zombie horde, probably devoured completely.  The system's familiar reminder also chimed in. "Ding, the male lead's favorability towards you is negative thirty-five. The male lead is full of hatred for you, more than that of a little heart that wants to kill you, mwah mwah."  Bai Weiwei felt goosebumps all over. What's wrong with the system, has it been possessed by a lovey-dovey package? What kind of reminder style is this?  Suddenly, she remembered something very important. Looking at the piece of sleeve fabric hanging from her finger, she asked somewhat hazily, "The man that this body just pushed out..."  The system cheerfully reminded, "Yes, that's the male lead."  Bai Weiwei felt the world spinning. Her hands, stained with sin and blood, were also stained with negative favorability. She had just pushed the male lead out to feed the zombies?  With the male lead eaten by zombies, whom was she supposed to pursue?  Could this world be...  Bai Weiwei asked with a trembling voice, "Ah Ling, this world isn't a horror film, is it?"  The system replied, "Look at those zombies chasing after your vehicle. Any normal person would know this is an apocalyptic zombie world."  Bai Weiwei stumbled to her feet, "But the target of the pursuit, he's already been eaten by zombies."  The system responded, "That is something the host should strive to resolve, so go for it, love you little heart."  Bai Weiwei felt disgusted.  System, what's wrong with you, haunted by the resentful spirit of being loved by Bai Yaoyao?  The system then reminded, "Ding, please host begin to accept the memories of this body."  That familiar headache struck again, and Bai Weiwei's complexion grew much paler. After she absorbed the memories, she was speechless for a long time.  The mission target, Song Yunhuan, and this body, Bai Weiwei, were university alumni. Bai Weiwei, with her delicate and pretty appearance and sweet voice, was very popular with men.  Song Yunhuan, on the other hand, was a recluse, the kind of tech guy who holed up in his dormitory writing code every day. Although he had a good appearance, his gloomy personality did not make him likable to girls.  These two people originally had nothing to do with each other.  However, the previous Bai Weiwei was a green tea bitch, seemingly pure on the surface, but in reality, she very much enjoyed using her pitiable appearance to gain the vain satisfaction of men's favor. Chapter 201: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (2)  Song Yunhuan was favored by her because he was a loner, with no woman ever getting close to him. She thought that this kind of man, who didn't pay any attention to women, was very challenging. Thus, she made a bet with her roommates that she could win over Song Yunhuan, the man who never showed interest in women, within a month.  Due to Song Yunhuan's lack of experience in dating, he was momentarily deceived by Bai Weiwei's innocent appearance and actually accepted her confession. The result was that the two of them became boyfriend and girlfriend for three days, barely progressing to the point of watching a movie together. But then, Song Yunhuan saw through Bai Weiwei's true face and even found out about her bet with her roommates.  Feeling deceived, Song Yunhuan exposed all of her deceitful acts toward men on the internet and straightforwardly asked for a breakup. Bai Weiwei felt deeply humiliated and was just about to take revenge on Song Yunhuan when the apocalyptic virus suddenly broke out, and zombies besieged the city. The two, who had just broken up, were forced to flee.  Because there were too many people escaping and only one truck was available, Bai Weiwei couldn't squeeze onto it. Song Yunhuan, feeling a moment of compassion, pulled her up, but Bai Weiwei, thinking of the humiliation, vengefully pushed the unguarded Song Yunhuan off the truck to feed the zombies.  Right after pushing him, Bai Weiwei was struck with regret. Looking at her hands, she wondered why she couldn't have reacted faster to hold onto Song Yunhuan, who was now being eaten by zombies. Whom would she go after now? Seduce zombies? No, she should be thinking about how to survive.  Because the truck was overloaded, she stood by the truck's door and could easily be pushed off. Someone had already started to forcefully push her out. If she fell, she would likely meet the same fate as zombie fodder.  The system once again reminded her, "Side mission reward distribution, please accept, host."  Bai Weiwei: "Accept."  The reward had better be a powerful apocalyptic survival skill that lets her fly or hide away. At the very least, a space to avoid others would do.  System: "Ding, irresistible charm trait has been fully distributed."  Bai Weiwei: Irresistible charm trait... What use does this skill have? It could be useful in the entertainment industry, but what good is this rotten charm during the apocalypse? It would be better to have a golden finger that allows survival without eating.  Suddenly, someone in the front of the truck yelled, "It's not working, the vehicle can't accelerate, and at this rate, the zombies will catch up to us."  There were too many people, and the truck was excessively overloaded. If the vehicle broke down, everyone on the truck would feed the zombies.  "How about... letting some people off the truck?" Someone suggested this, not knowing who said it. But this was almost everyone's shared thought on the truck. However, no one wanted to be the one who gets off.  Stepping off meant becoming prey to the zombies. Standing next to the rear door of the truck, Bai Weiwei could step right out of the vehicle. If people were to be eliminated, she would be the first to go.  Sure enough, someone was already quietly trying to push her off the truck. Bai Weiwei's face changed, and she turned back to look, only to find it was a school senior. A man who was usually quite polite and gentle turned out to have such malicious and selfish thoughts.  Just as she was about to say something, a breeze blew by. The system's reminder sounded in her ear: "Ding, irresistible charm trait activated."  Pink heart-shaped bubbles with captions floated before her eyes. 【Her slightly curled chestnut brown hair was lifted by the wind, her clear and dazzling starry eyes shone with captivating light, pure and innocent like a fawn...】  Bai Weiwei: What is this?  Yet the school senior was staring at her dumbfounded, his face turning red.  Bai Weiwei frowned, just about to say something. Another string of pink captions floated up. 【Her eyebrows furrowed, on her exquisite, unparalleled face was a pitiable sorrow.】  Bai Weiwei: "......" Chapter 202: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (3)  The senior's heart seemed captured by her sorrow, and he immediately grabbed her hand, "Don't stand here, it's easy to fall off. Let's move inside a bit."  Wasn't he just about to push her down?  His attitude changed rapidly.  The senior pushed those people away and pulled Bai Weiwei to squeeze further inside the car.  Bai Weiwei realized that this senior had a lot of power; many people were afraid of him, and many followed his orders.  If it were anyone else, daring to push their way into the car during such apocalyptic times, they would probably incur public wrath and be pushed out.  They reached the innermost part.  Indeed, a small group had formed, and the senior was part of it.  The senior stuffed her into the innermost seat, "Weiwei, sit here. Once the car drives out of the city, my uncle will come to pick me up."  Then he sat down next to Bai Weiwei, looking at her with a flushed and shy face.  Bai Weiwei pursed her lips in silence, listening to them discussing how to get some people off the car.  Only then did she find out that this senior, Lin Xiao, came from a powerful family, especially an uncle who was a high-ranking military officer.  And the people in this little group were all rich second-generation or official second-generation like Lin Xiao.  This also let Bai Weiwei understand why this group of people received such favorable treatment.  Because the car would eventually run out of fuel, but if these powerful second-generation individuals were on board, someone would definitely come to their rescue.  Bai Weiwei heard someone scream in agony, and her brows furrowed, just about to say something.  But she heard Lin Xiao say, "Don't be afraid. There are always some people who accidentally fall out. You won't have any trouble."  Bai Weiwei looked at him in astonishment.  Was she that familiar with him?  In the original host's memory, this senior was low-key and gentle, but he never hung out with them.  Could it be that Lin Xiao secretly loved the original Bai Weiwei?  Just as she thought this, the pink bubble subtitles appeared again.  【Her downcast beauty, as soft as clouds on the horizon, and like fog by the sea, so fragile that it inspires pity, making one unable to resist the urge to hold her and protect her…】  Lin Xiao also got excited, "Don't be afraid, I will protect you, and I won't let you suffer from the storm."  Bai Weiwei was speechless for a moment and knocked on the system, "What's with the pink subtitles?"  Only she could see them, which was making her cringe.  System: "It's the charm effect subtitles. In others' eyes, you're just that touching and uniquely beautiful."  Bai Weiwei felt tired, "Can it be blocked?"  Such subtitles could drive one to suicide; they were unbearable.  System: "Blocked now, but the effect is still there. I think the subtitle effect is very good, it has a girlish charm."  Bai Weiwei: It's more like a brainless charm.  Just as Lin Xiao was excitedly vowing to protect her,  The system's reminder suddenly sounded.  【Ding, male lead's favorability minus forty.】  Bai Weiwei was stunned, is Song Yunhuan not dead yet?  And at that moment, in the pile of zombies that had devoured Song Yunhuan, the zombies without consciousness suddenly emitted a terrible hoarse sound.  It sounded like fear and like a warning.  All the zombies suddenly contorted, and their decaying bodies were twisted into pieces by a tremendous force of space.  And from the pile of rotten flesh and severed limbs, a pale, colorless hand emerged, stained with blood, slowly bending.  Then he slowly stood up, and his handsome, almost demonic face, with black pupils surrounded by a ring of blood-red haze, suddenly began to smile lightly.  His laugh was hoarse and strange.  "Bai Weiwei, I'm going to eat you." Chapter 203: The Zombie King's Girlfriend, the Heartthrob of Thousands (4)  When the car started to become chaotic, Bai Weiwei was already prepared in her heart. There were too many people, and the car was moving too slowly; even Lin Xiao, who was a second-generation elite, couldn't do much here when people were facing a massive disaster. In such times, being a 'second-generation' was of no use.  Especially when a zombie suddenly jumped onto the roof of the car, and several people standing at the back door were pulled down by zombies, many people inside the car completely broke down. They cursed and cried, and began pushing each other, with several people falling off the car.  Moreover, someone noticed that the zombies seemed to be increasing in number. Although there were other places with people around, the zombies, seemingly attracted by something, were rapidly chasing after the car and not letting go. In the end, a terrifying tide of zombies formed, surging after them.  This grand and terrifying scene was enough to scare the faint-hearted to death.  Bai Weiwei asked the system, "Is there something to drive away the zombies?"  The system immediately nodded excitedly, "Yes, yes, there is! Vigorous Zombie-Killing Agent, your best companion in the apocalypse, lets you easily drive away zombies. Your reliable choice is the Vigorous Zombie-Killing Agent."  Bai Weiwei said, "Give me a bottle."  Now, there was no time to consider anything else; if she was bitten by zombies, all her strategies would be gone.  The system said, "This thing is expensive; you can't afford it on credit."  Bai Weiwei looked desperate, "I've done so many tasks, why can't I save up any life points? Tell me, have you been stealing my life points? Is it you making me penniless?"  The system became serious, "How could you be penniless?"  Bai Weiwei: What else did she have? Why couldn't she see it?  The system's tone became cheerful and cute, "You still have me."  Bai Weiwei: "Can you drive away the zombies?"  The system blew her a kiss, "How could I do that, but I will cheer for you, cheer cheer cheer, love."  Bai Weiwei felt like she was about to spit out a mouthful of old blood. Was this broken system deliberately irritating her? With this kind of system, it would be better not to have one at all.  And had the system been poisoned with love? Why was its way of speaking so... brain-dead?  Suddenly, Lin Xiao grabbed Bai Weiwei's hand with a solemn expression, "Weiwei, don't be afraid, I won't let anything happen to you."  Bai Weiwei had no idea what kind of strange illusion her heartthrob aura had given Lin Xiao.  Suddenly, Lin Xiao's voice became shy, "Weiwei, after we're safe, let's get married, okay?"  Bai Weiwei: "......"  Lin Xiao blushed a little, "I've even thought of our children's names. It would be best to have two: a boy like me and a girl like you... hehe, and then the two of us can still be together when we're old, watching the sunset, the beautiful people together."  Bai Weiwei felt a pain in her chest; she would get heart disease from the aggravation.  Suddenly, a loud noise came from the roof of the car, as if something had jumped on top of it. The car shook violently and started to skid. Bai Weiwei felt the car lose balance and her body pitched forward.  Lin Xiao grabbed her, and the two of them almost rolled into a ball. The car seemed to hit something, shuddering violently, and many people inside were thrown out.  The zombies swarmed up, beginning to tear and bite at humans. The scene was cruel and horrifying, the heavy scent of blood permeating the air.  The car also started to slow down, and suddenly it emitted a struggling sound and then stopped altogether.  Everyone screamed; the stoppage of the car meant they were all going to die.  Lin Xiao reacted quickly and terrifyingly. He grabbed Bai Weiwei's hand, kicked a few people away, squeezed out of the car, jumped down, and then ran for his life. Chapter 204: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (5)  People who failed to get off the bus in time were swarmed by the pursuing zombies. Bai Weiwei didn't look back, but she could hear the roaring of the zombies behind her. And also, the screams of people. It was truly a hell on Earth.  Lin Xiao hurriedly ran forward; ahead was the edge of the city with a stretch of abandoned commercial buildings. He said, "If we rush through here, we can get out of the city. My uncle is waiting outside the city."  But Bai Weiwei suddenly shook off Lin Xiao's hand and said calmly, "You go ahead, I can't keep up with you." She was telling the truth; she really couldn't keep pace with him. Lin Xiao looked like he had training, and being a big man, his physical strength was much greater than hers.  Running to this extent with him was already her limit. Now her feet felt unbearably heavy, and her heartbeat was so fast that it pained her chest. She was very clear about the limits of a person's strength, and she had reached hers.  Regardless of whether it was due to her irresistible charm, Lin Xiao's character was still acceptable—it was a matter of each to their own escape.  Lin Xiao turned back, his face filled with emotion, "You are truly kind. Not only do you have the most captivating eyes in the world, but also the most beautiful soul."  Bai Weiwei couldn't stand it anymore, and as Lin Xiao was still speaking, "How can you be so cute, so beautiful, so..."  Slap!  Bai Weiwei swung her hand and delivered a slap. This left Lin Xiao speechless.  Bai Weiwei sighed, feeling that the world had finally quieted down.  After dodging several attacks from zombies, Lin Xiao also realized that he couldn't escape the city while dragging along the burden that was Bai Weiwei. Even if she was the most wonderful burden in the world.  But his own life was still the most important.  Lin Xiao bid farewell with tears, "Weiwei, wait for me to come back and find you, goodbye."  After saying that, he ran away frantically.  Bai Weiwei: Never see you again.  System: "Hurry, hurry, I see a hiding place ahead."  Bai Weiwei, following the system's instruction, desperately dashed forward. Several zombies lunged at her, their stinking and rotting smell nearly made her retch with nausea.  It might have been her imagination, but it seemed like the zombies were toying with her. Whenever she thought she would be caught, the zombies would slow down their pace.  Bai Weiwei spotted the warehouse the system had mentioned, she rushed into the warehouse, slammed the door shut, and pushed anything heavy in front of it to barricade it.  The pursuing zombies roared outside the door, banging against it and howling.  Bai Weiwei was so frightened that her hairs stood on end; if she got bitten by these creatures, she would have to commit suicide immediately. Becoming a zombie was too ugly.  She refused.  However, the warehouse door was exceptionally sturdy, and the zombies could not get in for the time being.  Bai Weiwei sat on the floor, drained of strength, complaining to the system, "I think that one of the zombies outside might be Song Yunhuan."  Song Yunhuan had fallen into the horde of zombies; it was impossible for him to still be alive. If he was still alive, he must have turned into a zombie.  System: "Perhaps."  Bai Weiwei grew despondent, "The target of my conquest can't be someone with rotting flesh, bulging eyes, pus flowing from all seven orifices, and sparse hair, right?" That's what all the zombies outside looked like.  System: "No matter what, he is still the male lead. Even if he's a bit ugly, can't you just bear with it?"  Bai Weiwei: "I just thought of a problem."  System: "What problem?"  Bai Weiwei: "The affection level is only at negative forty."  System: "Negative forty is already terrifyingly high, and yet the host is so amazing and still complains that it's not low enough?" Chapter 205: The Zombie King's Adored Girlfriend (6)  Bai Weiwei: "In the last world, I started with a negative fifty points, and in this world, I personally pushed Song Yunhuan into a pile of zombies, yet I only got negative forty points. It seems that to men, the real grudge is when you cut off their jj."  System: Is the hostess focusing on the wrong thing?  Bai Weiwei chatting with the system was also just a way to distract herself.  After all, there were zombies everywhere outside, and anyone would be scared.  Bai Weiwei looked at the door, "Fortunately, this door is sturdy, or else I would have been eaten long ago."  She had just finished speaking when suddenly the door shook, and the screws fixing the door burst open one by one.  Bai Weiwei and the System: "..."  Boom, the door was kicked open by something and shattered into pieces, falling to the ground with a crash.  Bai Weiwei sat on the ground, watching the sunlight spill in from outside the door.  A tall figure appeared at the door, backlit, with black hair emitting a strange halo, and his exceedingly handsome face wore a twisted, eerie smile.  "I found you, Bai Weiwei."  His voice, with a bit of huskiness, was strangely sexy.  Bai Weiwei was stunned, her mind racing through countless thoughts, calculating her appropriate reaction in a second.  Then she resumed a scared expression, her voice trembling, "Song Yunhuan?"  Song Yunhuan's eyes were dark and gloomy, the red in his eyes even more pronounced as he smiled, "Yeah, didn't expect I could come back, did you?"  Tears suddenly rolled down from Bai Weiwei's eyes, and after a few sobs, she suddenly got up from the ground and rushed to him, then stretched out her arms and hugged him tightly.  She began to sob loudly, "Song Yunhuan, you're not dead, that's really great, it's so good that you're not dead."  Her crying was full of relief, guilt, and a sense of release.  Song Yunhuan's body was stiff and cold, just like a corpse.  He looked at Bai Weiwei with a dead air, his smile deepening, "I thought you would be glad if I died."  Bai Weiwei punched his chest lightly, "I really wished you would die; how could you treat me so badly? I've never liked someone so much; how could you do that to me?"  Her tone had a coquettish feel to it.  Song Yunhuan seemed a bit baffled by her attitude, "You like me?"  Bai Weiwei looked up, her eyes filled with tears, "What do you mean? I've always liked you. It was not easy to muster up the courage to be your girlfriend, and then you scorned me, and also posted things online to slander and insult me. From love, hate was born, do you understand? I really wished you were dead."  The red in Song Yunhuan's eyes intensified, his smile at the corner of his mouth becoming more eerie, "Love?"  Bai Weiwei bit her lip, a face full of willful innocence, "Of course. Do you think I would willingly like you? Do you know how embarrassing it is to like you? Your family is poor, and you're introverted; all my friends say you're not likable at all, and I've always been determined to marry into a wealthy family. How could I like a poor boy like you?"  System: Such brazen shamelessness.  Bai Weiwei pouted, her tears about to fall, "But I... the moment I see you, I like you. I kept telling myself that you have no prospects and can't provide the life I want. But I still like you, and yet I couldn't lower my face to chase after you. Luckily, my roommate made a bet with me, and I found a way out and went to confess to you."  Song Yunhuan fell silent.  Bai Weiwei became shy again, "And you actually agreed to be my friend."  Song Yunhuan in contemplation.  Bai Weiwei turned sad again, "But you didn't like me, and I accidentally... thankfully, you didn't die."  Suddenly, Song Yunhuan laughed, "Do you really like me that much?"  Bai Weiwei became embarrassed, "It's so shameless for a girl to always confess to you."  Song Yunhuan reached out, lifted her up, his smile even brighter, "Then I'll confess too. I especially like... the way you look when you're eaten by zombies."  After saying that, he threw Bai Weiwei out the door.  Outside the door were all zombies. Chapter 206: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (7) Bai Weiwei: "Irresistible charm is useless?" She thought that her performance combined with her irresistible charm would soften Song Yunhuan's heart a bit. Only then did the system have the chance to remind her: "The irresistible charm only works on people with a favorability level above zero." Song Yunhuan's favorability was negative forty; she wouldn't say just negative forty anymore. Negative forty was deadly. Bai Weiwei fell to the ground, her hand scraping across the floor to slow her momentum, the skin breaking and bleeding immediately. The zombies outside, as if smelling fresh meat, excitedly howled and surrounded her. Bai Weiwei's pupils shrank, "Trash system, does the irresistible charm work on these things?" System: "Irresistible charm is not zombie charm; this kind of charm is useless on anything without consciousness." Zombies that have not evolved do not have consciousness. The apocalypse has just begun, and the only evolved zombie is Song Yunhuan. Bai Weiwei: "So this side quest reward, apart from confusing some passerby A, is actually completely useless?" The system encouraged: "Once you have raised the favorability to above zero, the charm will be useful." Bai Weiwei roared: "Who can wait until then, I'm about to be eaten." Right after she finished speaking to the system, several zombies already pounced. Bai Weiwei rolled on the ground in fright, narrowly avoiding the zombie attack. She looked at Song Yunhuan, her eyes filled with helpless despair. Song Yunhuan was still smiling, standing in the sunlight, his eyes eerily ghastly. It seemed as if the zombies received some command, their attacks on Bai Weiwei became more aggressive. Their mouths open, revealing their foul-smelling teeth, they ran quickly, about to catch Bai Weiwei. Bai Weiwei had nowhere to hide, as the entire warehouse was surrounded by zombies. Inside the warehouse, no zombies dared to approach except for Song Yunhuan. Bai Weiwei didn't care about anything else; she would rather be torn to pieces by Song Yunhuan than be eaten by these zombies. Bai Weiwei thought wryly, at least Song Yunhuan is handsome. Just as she ran into the warehouse, her foot was pulled by something, and she fell hard to the ground. A zombie's hand tightly grasped her calf, dragging her towards the outside of the warehouse. Bai Weiwei's fingers clutched the ground so hard they bled. She felt the zombie's sharp nails pierce into her leg flesh, blood starting to gush out. Bai Weiwei trembled all over, suddenly feeling overshadowed by darkness. Looking up, she saw Song Yunhuan approaching her. He slowly squatted down, his handsome face still wearing that eerie smile. Even the smile was mixed with a hint of malicious satisfaction. "Do you know? Bai Weiwei, when you pushed me out of the car, I looked just like you do now, desperate with no way out, only to be eaten alive by zombies." Bai Weiwei looked at him, her eyes reddening as she said with a trembling voice, "I'm sorry, Song Yunhuan." Song Yunhuan twisted his smile, "Sorry for what? Aren't women like you supposed to be the most selfish and self-serving, why apologize to me?" Bai Weiwei was dragged step by step by the zombie, desperately clawing at the ground with her fingers, but her eyes were fixed on Song Yunhuan. "I'm sorry, Song Yunhuan. I know I'm not a kind person. I'm selfish and vain, petty, and pleasure-seeking, but I really didn't do it on purpose. I didn't want you to die, I just wanted to scare you. I never thought that I would end up unable to hold onto your hand." As Bai Weiwei spoke, she broke into tears, using all her remaining strength to suddenly reach out and grab his hand. The corner of his sleeve tore off. Chapter 207: The Zombie King's Charmingly Popular Girlfriend (8)  It was when Bai Weiwei was trying to pull him up that it tore open. Bai Weiwei exerted all her strength, clutched his hand, and said, "I'm sorry," her face filled with guilt.  Song Yunhuan did not struggle, letting her hold his hand firmly without letting go. Bai Weiwei was almost out of strength; the power of the zombies was so strong that it was beyond human resistance, and her being able to hold on to this extent was already the limit.  Suddenly, Song Yunhuan's fingers tightened, clenching hers in return. A glimmer of light appeared in Bai Weiwei's eyes, like hope, like joy.  Song Yunhuan's voice was faint, even gentle enough to say, "I believe you didn't mean it, but..."  His thin lips curved up, the darkness in his eyes chilling, "But, what does that matter?"  Having said that, he released his grip one finger at a time, allowing the light in Bai Weiwei's eyes to fade. Due to his loosening grip, Bai Weiwei was dragged out by the zombies.  The fingers of that zombie had already burrowed into the flesh of her calf, the pain so intense that Bai Weiwei felt her scalp explode. She was quickly pulled out of the warehouse, the sunlight recklessly spilling onto her, as zombies pounced one after another onto her.  Bai Weiwei felt her legs, hands, and back being scratched and bitten through by the zombies.  System: "Ding, the host faces a serious danger, life protection is compulsorily activated."  Life protection is compulsorily initiated.  The pain on Bai Weiwei's body disappeared instantly, but the ebbing of life did not slow down because of this. She looked up, her eyes filled with desperate struggle, and self-blame, but no hatred.  Before being overwhelmed by zombies, Song Yunhuan saw her mouth a silent sentence. "Song Yunhuan, I'm sorry."  It was as if she really just wanted to scare him but ended up accidentally letting go of him.  Suddenly, Song Yunhuan stepped out of the warehouse. The zombies became terrified, running away in all directions, each one avoiding Song Yunhuan.  When Song Yunhuan came to, he found himself rotting all over, but for some reason, his flesh was constantly regenerating. In the end, he did not become a zombie, an ugly creature.  Instead, he looked no different from before. The only difference was that he had endless energy, immense strength, and a corpse-like body. Even his heartbeat was gone.  He hated Bai Weiwei for turning him into this. This hatred made him want Bai Weiwei to experience everything he had gone through.  Although Bai Weiwei was not in pain, she could still feel where she was injured. There was not a single part of her body that was intact.  Bai Weiwei's consciousness began to blur, and just when she thought she was certain to die, the zombies suddenly dispersed.  Her face was pale, her body covered in zombie bite marks, a ghastly sight to behold.  When Song Yunhuan approached her, she suddenly looked up at him. Her face, unscathed by any attack, delicate with a touch of coyness, now looked at him with a blurred vision, inexplicably exuding a pitiful softness.  Song Yunhuan gently asked, "Does it hurt?"  Bai Weiwei just looked at him, seemingly in so much pain that she was not lucid.  She suddenly reached out her hand, her fingers covered in blood from scratching the ground.  "Song Yunhuan..." Bai Weiwei struggled to get closer to him.  Song Yunhuan kindly stood and bent over, responding with an indifferent "Hmm" as if he was dealing with a pitiful prey that he did not take seriously.  Bai Weiwei struggled to sit up, which was already the limit of her body; she could not stand up, and her hand just managed to touch his face. Chapter 208: The Zombie King’s Irresistible Girlfriend (9)  Dirt and blood were smeared across his face from her fingers. Song Yunhuan remained indifferent, as if waiting for her hateful curses. However, Bai Weiwei let out a sigh of relief and began to laugh softly, "Song Yunhuan, I'm about to die, aren't I?"  Song Yunhuan calmly responded, "Yes."  Finally at peace, Bai Weiwei asked, "Before I die, can I say something to you?"  Song Yunhuan did not react, simply watching her indifferently.  Suddenly, Bai Weiwei grabbed his clothes with her other hand, pulling his head down with the last of her strength.  Song Yunhuan's body stiffened, the red in his eyes deepening.  The kiss was brief, and as they parted, Bai Weiwei smiled, "I've lied to you many times. Pretending to be pure, naive, pitiful. But the one thing I didn't lie about is that I like you."  She smiled as she spoke, yet tears were in her eyes.  "I didn't hold onto your hand earlier, causing you to fall off the vehicle, I'm sorry." Her voice grew weaker.  "I didn't do it on purpose..."  Her fingers lost their strength, slowly releasing his clothes.  "Song Yunhuan, I like you…"  She fell back to the ground, her eyes beginning to lose their light as death overtook her.  Finally, darkness came, and she completely lost consciousness.  Song Yunhuan stood in a daze for a while before finally, belatedly, touching his lips.  It was his first kiss, his lips still stained with her blood.  He stuck out his tongue, tasting it; the blood had a sweet flavor. To him, a zombie, humans truly were a gourmet delicacy.  Song Yunhuan, I like you...  Like me?  [Ding, male lead's favorability decreased by thirty-five.]  ---  Bai Weiwei felt that this time she was undoubtedly going to die.  She had been caught and bitten by zombies; the virus would surely corrode her body.  Her life support could only last one day, and after that, she would experience unbearable pain.  Heat, cold, severe pain, all sorts of discomfort assaulted her.  In a daze, she communicated with the system, "Trashy system, how can I pursue Song Yunhuan if I become a zombie? I'll be bald, with crooked teeth, my face covered in rotting flesh, intestines hanging out and swinging about, he definitely won't increase his favorability."  The system comforted her kindly, "It's alright, we'll just wash off the rotting flesh, stuff the intestines back into the stomach, sew it up with needle and thread, and put on a wig to look good again."  Touched, Bai Weiwei asked in confusion, "Trashy system, do I really look good?"  System: "Of course you look good, even if you become a zombie, you're still the best-looking one."  Bai Weiwei felt she had the strength to fight again. She struggled for who knows how long and finally opened her eyes.  What she saw made her a bit puzzled.  It was a room in an old house.  Somewhat dilapidated, but very clean and homely.  It looked like it had been lived in for many years.  She was lying on a bed with light green curtains fluttering in the wind.  Bai Weiwei sat up and found that she hadn't turned into a zombie; the wounds had turned into white scars.  Her heartbeat and body were also normal, all human characteristics.  To be bitten like that and not turn into a zombie...  Bai Weiwei breathed a sigh of relief. She got out of bed and walked barefoot out of the room.  Then she saw Song Yunhuan sitting on the sofa in the living room, reading a book intently.  Seeing her come out, Song Yunhuan asked gently, "Awake?"  Bai Weiwei was a bit puzzled, "I'm not dead?"  Song Yunhuan shook his head, "You have a very special physique, immune to the zombie virus."  Bai Weiwei was stunned at first, but then she smiled sweetly, "Is that so? I'm so lucky."  Seeing her smile so happily, Song Yunhuan also smiled, "You said you liked me, is that true?"  Bai Weiwei hadn't expected him to ask this, and she shyly lowered her head. After a moment of silence, she finally mustered the courage to look up.  Her eyes were bright, full of smiles, "Yes, I like you."  Song Yunhuan's fingers on the book tensed for some reason.  He suppressed those restless impulses, walked over to her, and gently stroked her face.  Then he said with a gentle smile, "If you really like me that much, would you die for me?"   Bai Weiwei: "......"
