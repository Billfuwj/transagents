Chapter 805: The Last Story  "In the East Campus?" Zhou Tu hesitated for a moment. Whether it was seniors or teachers, they had all warned the freshmen not to approach the East Campus. They did not specify the reasons, but from their tone, it was clear that the East Campus was dangerous.  "You have a deep misunderstanding about the East Campus. It's actually not much different from here; it's just that the two campuses are managed in completely different ways. They live in real terror, while you live in false happiness," Chen Ge looked into Zhou Tu's eyes. "Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope because at least they know who they are and know how to find liberation."  Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu. Whether it was students from the East Campus or the West Campus, all of them were trapped in this school.  The memories of the students in the West Campus had been altered, repeating the life scripted by the manipulator behind the scenes. The students in the East Campus, at least, knew to look for scapegoats and ways to escape.  "Students from the East Campus are closer to hope? But I heard that only the unwanted trash from the West Campus would be sent there."  Zhou Tu had been persuaded, but he still felt somewhat uneasy.  "No matter what the criteria for judgment are, any school that treats its students as trash is definitely a rubbish school," Chen Ge pointed to the high wall between the two campuses. "Do you know why that wall exists?"  "Why?"  "Because the school fears losing control. They use various methods to reshape human nature, but they forget that human nature is the most complex thing in the world. The events have already happened, and no matter how much they are forgotten, the scars will always be branded on the heart. Not remembering anything doesn't mean they don't exist, so some of the school's plans are doomed to fail."  Chen Ge said something that the club members couldn't understand. They didn't know why Chen Ge said this, but they felt that there seemed to be some truth to his words.  Children are inherently curious, and Chen Ge kept telling them the truth about the school, eventually sparking the club members' interest.  "So we're going now? To be honest, I really don't believe that there would be the art studio of my dreams in the East Campus," Zhou Tu whispered.  "Now is not the time," Chen Ge turned his head to look at a shadow. The dark figure in dormitory 413 was still sleeping, but its body had undergone a significant change.  If one looked closely, they would notice that Chen Ge's shadow was different from others—dark as ink, as if all light that shone upon it would be swallowed up.  It seemed to have become much stronger.  The enormous potential of the dark shadow was a good thing for Chen Ge. Once it awoke, Chen Ge would lead the students back to the East Campus to target isolated evil spirits again.  This would not only enhance his own strength but also muddle the stagnant waters of the school, covering for another "murderer" in the academy.  "We are still in the stage of accumulating strength. Before the school master notices this little bug, I need to prepare as many cards up my sleeve as possible," Chen Ge turned his head to look at Wang Yicheng, the club member who joined first and was a boy with a limp. Chen Ge was familiar with the stories of the other three club members, leaving only his.  "Our next destination is Wang Yicheng's dormitory."  "To my dormitory?" Wang Yicheng reacted strangely, waving his hands repeatedly, "Forget it, there's nothing interesting about the dormitory I live in."  "When you say this sentence, your voice is higher than usual, your speech rate is faster, and your eyes are evasive. You really are not good at lying," Chen Ge gently put his arm around Wang Yicheng's shoulder. "Why don't you want us to go? Are you worried about what we might see?"  "I..." Wang Yicheng struggled to find the right words and finally turned his gaze elsewhere. "It's nothing, let's just go directly."  "Alright."  Wang Yicheng lived in dormitory 413 of the West Campus, and Lin Sisi lived in dormitory 413 of the East Campus.  The dormitory numbers were exactly the same, but in the West Campus's 413, students occupied all the beds except for bed number four, while in the East Campus, it was the opposite—only bed number four was occupied, and the other beds were empty.  "Let's not tell anyone else the secrets of our club. Everyone try to keep a low profile. There are teachers like me in this school, but also some who are not so easy to talk to," Chen Ge was always on guard. The noise they made in the laboratory building was too loud, and the school authorities were likely to have started investigating.  "There's not much time left for me. After visiting dormitory 413, I'll need to lay low for a while."  There are four dormitory buildings in the male student dormitory area of the West Campus, several times more than the number of students in the East Campus. The lights had not yet been turned off, and it was the liveliest time in the male dormitory, with sounds of washing, plastic basins dropping, and conversations clearly audible even from downstairs.  "This building is similar to the one in the East Campus."  Chen Ge acted very naturally, following the four students into the first building.  The dormitory supervisor’s small living quarters had a closed door, but the glass window was open, and inside, a woman in her fifties was humming a song, looking in a good mood.  Next to the small window, there was a notice that strictly prohibited the use of high-power electrical appliances in the dormitory and forbade students from cooking in the dormitory.  "I remember that the notice in the East Campus dormitory building said—recently, a vicious case occurred, and students are prohibited from going out after lights out."  A wall apart, it was almost two different worlds, just like inside and outside of a "door."  Passing through the corridor, Chen Ge and the club members arrived at the door of dormitory 413.  "This dormitory is no different from the others."  Wang Yicheng opened the door, and after entering the room, the other people in the dormitory acted as if he didn't exist, doing their own things without speaking to him.  After Wang Yicheng walked a few steps inside, the boy sleeping on the bed next to the door suddenly lifted his mosquito net and glared at him: "How many times have I said it? Close the door when you come in. Your leg is lame, are your ears also not working?"  The boy's words were unpleasant, and he seemed to have a strong dislike for Wang Yicheng.  "He didn't close the door because there are still people coming in after him. If you need an apology, we can apologize on his behalf, but I'm not sure what form of apology you require," Chen Ge grabbed the door handle and entered the room, giving the other people in the dormitory a glance.  The boy behind the mosquito net was intimidated when he saw Chen Ge, said nothing, and pulled the net back down with a dark face.  "Mr. Bai, this is bed number four. Since no one lives here, we use it to store luggage," Wang Yicheng pointed to bed number four, which had a few suitcases thrown on it. Only his luggage was stored under his own bed; the others had tossed their miscellaneous items and luggage onto bed number four.  Chen Ge was familiar with bed number four; he had lain on it himself in the East Campus.  Approaching bed number four, although no one was sleeping there, it was made up with bedding and sheets, which were now dirtied by the luggage and miscellaneous items. Zhang Ya's Extra Chapter: Let's Register Our Marriage (Birthday Special Free Chapter)  The city was enveloped in dark clouds, and the sky seemed almost within reach. Li Man stood by the window, watching the rainwater slide down the glass, leaving behind trails. The ticking of the clock on the wall filled the small room with the monotonous passage of time.  "5:30, time to get off work." Li Man stretched lazily, moved the succulents from the windowsill into the room, and walked over to her desk. She put away the sign that said 'Marriage Registration Office' into a drawer, glancing at the wall that read—Administer by Law, Civilized Service.  "With such heavy rain today, it's unlikely that anyone will come to register their marriage."  Humming a tune, Li Man began to clean up; the empty marriage registration office only had her inside, as the staff from the divorce registration office had left fifteen minutes earlier.  "Hello, is this where marriage certificates are processed?" The door opened, and a mature, magnetic male voice came from the entrance.  With such a pleasant voice, the man must be handsome.  Li Man looked up and saw a man in a black raincoat standing at the door of the marriage registration office. He had an ordinary appearance, but there was an indescribable aura about him.  "Yes, do you... want to apply for a marriage certificate?" Li Man scrutinized the man carefully; it was her first time seeing someone wearing a raincoat and carrying a heavy backpack to apply for a marriage certificate.  "Yes, I made an online appointment for today."  "What's your name?" Li Man asked.  "Chen Ge."  Li Man typed the name 'Chen Ge' into the computer and indeed saw his appointment request: "I'm about to finish work. Let's make this quick. Did you bring everything? The household registration books for both parties, IDs, and proof that you two are not direct blood relatives or collateral relatives within three generations."  "I've brought everything."  The man opened his backpack, rummaging through it. Li Man faintly heard a cat meow and curiously glanced into the man's backpack. Inside were a repeater, comic books, stuffed dolls, ballpoint pens, and a large white cat.  "Thank you for your trouble." The man handed over two household registration books and two ID cards to Li Man: "Everything is here. I've met the woman's family, and they are very satisfied with me."  "It seems you've made a lot of preparations."  After registering the man's information, Li Man was about to register the woman's details when she realized that the magnetic strip on the woman's ID card was unresponsive. Looking at the name on the woman's ID card, she suddenly realized something.  The man in front of her came to register for marriage, prepared all the documents, and even brought a cat, yet his girlfriend was nowhere to be seen.  "Wait a minute, sir." Li Man stopped what she was doing: "You're here to get married, right?"  "Yes."  "Where's your girlfriend? How can you get married alone?" Li Man said with a wry smile: "Both parties must be present to register for marriage."  The clock on the wall ticked, the rain outside grew heavier, and the man slightly pursed his lips, looking up at Li Man: "She's here, standing right behind me."  The rain hammered against the window, and the air inside the room started to feel tense.  "Sir, please don't joke. Marriage registration requires both parties to be present. I can't help you if you're alone."  Li Man clutched her chest, suddenly feeling a little short of breath.  "She really did come. We are inseparable; where I am, she is too." The man's eyes were clear, his tone stubborn.  Li Man, holding the demagnetized ID card in her hand, thought of a possibility. She flipped open the woman's household registration book and on the page with the woman's name was a stamp declaring her death, dated several years ago.  "Sir..."  Li Man wanted to say something, but seeing the man's obstinate expression, she felt moved. Her eyes swept over the man's backpack, and she looked at the items inside. Were these things the girl had once used? Were these preserved treasures memories of their time together? Was this cat a pet the girl had kept before she passed away?  In an instant, Li Man understood why the man had brought a heap of things to the marriage registration office and why he said his girlfriend was always with him. With eyes stinging, she held the girl's ID card, unsure of what to say, whether to comfort the man or to tell him the harsh truth.  Her lips parted slowly, but Li Man couldn't bring herself to speak the words she had prepared. She looked at the man in front of her, who seemed like a child, her feelings complex.  She forced a smile: "Sir, you must have loved her very much. How did you meet?"  "She pursued me. The first love letter I ever received was from her." The man's gaze drifted, as if reminiscing: "Our first date was at an abandoned school."  "An abandoned school? For a first date?"  "West City Private Academy. That place holds her obsessions and past. I stood in the hall where she used to practice dancing, my back against the mirror, against her, and we confided in each other."  Li Man listened silently, imagining the scene. On a quiet night, the two of them reminisced about the past in their deserted alma mater; the once lively and beautiful academy now only had them, back to back, nestled against each other—a tragically beautiful love.  "Our second date was at a psychiatric hospital. She wore a red dress, stunningly gorgeous, boldly beautiful."  "A psychiatric hospital?"  "Because of my parents, that day I..."  "I understand, sorry."  Li Man apologized before the man could finish, not wanting to pry into someone else's wounds; perhaps his parents were another sorrow in the man's heart.  "Our third date was in a building. I cornered the man who had once upset her in an elevator and taught him an unforgettable lesson."  "You really spoil your girlfriend. I bet she was very happy to hear about that."  "She was right beside me then."  The man's expression was tender as he recalled the scene in the haunted house club's building, with the elevator wrapped in black hair.  "That must have been a very romantic, heartwarming moment." Li Man thought the man was incredibly devoted.  "Our fourth date was in the morgue of the forensic medicine academy. She had been hurt but didn't tell me. She sat quietly beside me, as if she even snuck a hug."  The man's voice was very pleasant, husky with mature charm, as he reminisced about the past, an air so subtle that even Li Man unconsciously overlooked the morgue as an unusual dating spot.  "Our fifth date was on the rooftop of a small town, much like today, with heavy rain. She leaned against me."  Compared to the abandoned school, psychiatric hospital, and morgue, this dating spot was so normal that Li Man felt a bit uneasy: "Did you confess to her that day?"  The man nodded lightly: "I stood at the highest point of the town, shouting my feelings to that strange world, believing there's nothing more romantic than being inseparable for life."  "Wow."  Li Man had heard many people's stories, but none as shocking as Chen Ge's, perhaps because she had seen the death certificate on the household registration book and already knew the outcome: "What happened after that?"  "After that..." Chen Ge took a deep breath: "She fell asleep, it will be a very long time before she wakes up, and I've been waiting for her."  The death certificate on the household registration book felt like a needle piercing Li Man's heart, and tears involuntarily welled up in her eyes. Bowing her head, Li Man pretended to look for something, secretly wiping away tears behind the computer.  The room was silent until the man broke the quiet, his hand gently resting on an empty seat beside him as if his girlfriend were sitting there: "Our sixth date..."  It didn't matter what the man said next; Li Man knew that after his wife's accident, the man had trapped himself in a prison called love, believing his girlfriend was still in this world. Out of deep love, he refused to accept the reality of her departure.  Her hands clasped together, knuckles white, Li Man wanted to tell Chen Ge the truth, but she couldn't bear to do so. She buried her face behind the computer, entering all the information into the application form, wanting to fulfill the man's dream, but when she pressed the confirm button, the computer displayed a page indicating a mismatch in household registration data.  The girl had died many years ago; she no longer existed in the household registration data.  Reality struck Li Man like a bucket of ice water. She looked at the man's face, lost in memories, bit her lip, and said: "Sir, our data is incomplete, the system is being upgraded, and I can't process your application right now. Please come back in a week."  Li Man wanted to help the man, even if it meant creating a similar, albeit legally ineffective, little red book.  "Alright, then sorry to trouble you."  The man slowly stood up, packed everything, and walked towards the exit. At the door, he suddenly took off his raincoat, holding it over his head as if someone else was there beside him: "Zhang Ya, don't stray too far, the rain is getting heavy."  Li Man had a clear view from inside the room; there was no one under the man's raincoat but himself.  Watching the man's retreating figure, Li Man wiped the corner of her eye: "Perhaps this is love, infatuated with you, loyal to you, wholehearted for you, ending with you." Chapter 806: The Possible Existence of a "Door"  "Why are there so many things on the bed? If the student of bed number four comes back at night, where will he sleep?" Chen Ge muttered to himself as if he was talking to himself, "Could it be that he sleeps on someone else's bed?"  Ever since he entered, the students in dorm room 413 couldn't help but glance at him. After all, it's hard not to pay attention to someone who walks in wearing the school's work clothes.  "Are you a school teacher?" A tall and thin student sitting on the bed opposite bed number four asked. He wore thick glasses and looked a bit odd, "Bed number four is unoccupied. We are just making reasonable use of the space by placing things there."  "The bed is made with sheets and a quilt. Are you saying no one sleeps there?" Chen Ge smiled at the tall, thin student, "Maybe it's just that you can't see him. Be careful when you sleep at night, don't sleep on your side, beware that there might be someone else lying behind you."  Chen Ge stood next to bed number four and moved all the luggage to the floor, "It's outrageous to even take advantage of a ghost."  "Hey! Don't mess with our stuff!" The mosquito net guy at the door stuck out his head again.  "I'm saving you guys. This bed has its own owner; he has always been here at this school."  Chen Ge found many things in the 413 dormitory of the east campus and looked forward to the 413 dormitory of the west campus.  "Do you also know about the legend of bed number four in the 413 dormitory?" The glasses-wearing guy had a stiff face, "That's just to scare Wang Yicheng, you actually believed it?"  "True or false, you'll know when you encounter it."  After clearing the bed, Chen Ge took off the pillowcases and duvet cover, making sure there was nothing hidden inside.  "You say there's someone on bed number four, then why are you moving their stuff?" The tall, thin student pushed his glasses up, not quite liking Chen Ge, probably because Chen Ge spoke up for Wang Yicheng, which was contrary to the atmosphere of their dormitory.  "I don't care. After all, I don't live in this dormitory. If he gets angry, you guys will be the first ones he comes looking for."  Chen Ge's way of speaking was far from what the students imagined a people's teacher to be, but of course, he was an impostor and didn't care about such things.  Lifting up the mattress, Chen Ge stopped bickering with the people in the dormitory and his gaze froze on the bed board. On the edge of the bed board near the wall, there were five blood fingerprints.  "This isn't another one of your pranks, is it?" Chen Ge scratched at the blood fingerprints, scraping off a bit and sniffing it at the tip of his nose. It seemed to be coagulated blood.  Why was there fresh blood on bed number four?  "Teacher, what is that?" Because the location of the blood fingerprints was very concealed, Wang Yicheng also just noticed it.  "Coagulated red pigment, I've studied painting, I'm very familiar with this smell."  Chen Ge glared at the other students in the dormitory, "Someone wants to play a prank."  He didn't linger on the topic and took out Lin Sisi's cellphone for lighting, looking under the bed board.  Similar to a scene in the east campus, there was writing under this bed.  Tiny characters, which seemed to have been carved little by little with a knife.  "Why doesn't anyone talk to me?"  "Why does everyone ignore me?"  "I didn't lie to them! There really is a ghost! I really saw a ghost in the toilet!"  "This place is dangerous! Why doesn't anyone believe me!"  Chen Ge looked at these sentences and felt they were somewhat familiar. He continued to read down and found a name that was even more familiar.  "I, Lin Sisi, swear on my life, there really is a ghost in the restroom! It's true, they are watching me!"  "I know everyone hates me and wants to play jokes on me. I'm happy, I understand, but there really is a ghost in the restroom! This time I'm not lying!"  Every character on the bed board was carved with great force, and some places were even stained with blood, as if the carver accidentally cut his hand.  "Were these also left by Lin Sisi? But his description doesn't quite match the one in the Ghost School Diary."  Chen Ge sharply noticed the discrepancy. The diary said that Lin Sisi was very mischievous, liked to tease others, and eventually his classmates couldn't stand it anymore and tricked him into the restroom, played a joke on him together, and scared him to death.  However, the words carved under the bed board told a different story. It seemed that Lin Sisi was not scared to death by his classmates but actually saw something in the restroom.  Thinking deeply was terrifying. Chen Ge's pupils shrank, and he now did not know who to believe.  The owner of bed number four was Lin Sisi, there was no doubt about that, whether it was the east campus or the west campus.  "If this dormitory has restored everything from memory, then the words under the bed board should also be true. But if Lin Sisi has been scared to death, how could he come back and carve words under the bed?"  Thinking of this, Chen Ge suddenly paused and looked at everyone in the dormitory.  In this dormitory, only bed number four was unoccupied, just like the situation back then.  Lin Sisi was scared to death, bed number four was vacated, and there were still five other people living in the dormitory.  Lin Sisi knew that the restroom was really haunted, so after he died, he still came back to inform everyone, leaving various marks, but no one paid attention.  "No wonder he would carve such sentences. As a ghost, of course, the living can't see."  Chen Ge didn't know if the five people in this dormitory were the same five people who lived with Lin Sisi before. If not, then they were really unlucky.  In the east campus, every living person who just entered the school was called Lin Sisi. This name signified ominousness and a curse, targeted by all fierce ghosts.  But from another perspective, for the fierce ghosts who want to graduate, they need a substitute ghost. Thinking from the perspective of fierce ghosts, the name Lin Sisi also represents hope.  "It's getting more and more interesting. The curse in the eyes of the living, the hope in the eyes of fierce ghosts, what exactly did Lin Sisi do in this school?"  Chen Ge was certain that Lin Sisi had a deep connection with this school. Even if he was not the owner of the school, he must be related to the owner of the school.  "If only I could find him or the last 'Lin Sisi.'"  Chen Ge continued to observe. The characters on the bed board became more forceful, and the carver's mentality gradually shifted from anxious to desperate.  "I really saw a ghost, can't you believe me just once?"  "Listen to my voice, I'm here, I'm right here!"  "Fine, I don't hope for you to believe me anymore. I only hope that you never go to the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building! Remember! Never go there!"  "It's over, they still got out..."  The information under the bed board abruptly ended there, and Chen Ge could feel the despair of the person who carved the words.  "The restroom on the top floor of the teaching building? Is that where Lin Sisi was harmed?"  Chen Ge stood silently, his brain working rapidly.  The ghost school scene was the most complex, largest, and most difficult task he had done, with various clues and mysteries intertwined like an endless fog.  It was impossible to clarify everything at once, and Chen Ge could only start from the most fundamental point.  "A door cannot appear out of thin air; there must be someone to push it open. Assuming that the pusher was Lin Sisi, then the most likely place for that door to appear is the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building!" Chapter 807: Black Leather Shoes  Chen Ge's eyes brightened as he found a critical piece of information. "Tongling Ghost School is a four-star scene. I have never dealt with a four-star before, and all my past experiences do not apply here. To know more, I have to check it out myself." Chen Ge did not know to what extent a person's obsession could go to weave such a huge nightmare; even Dr. Gao and Zhang Ya combined could not do it.  "It's possible that there was a door in that toilet to begin with, and that door was inadvertently opened when the students were playing tricks on Lin Sisi." Chen Ge had a door in his own haunted house that he dares not approach to this day, so he guessed that Lin Sisi might have encountered the same situation as himself back then.  It's just that he avoided the door, while Lin Sisi opened it.  "No matter what the truth is, I must go and check out the toilet on the top floor of the teaching building!" The plank on the bed did not specify whether the toilet was in the east campus or the west campus. To be safe, Chen Ge decided to take a look at the toilets in both districts.  "Let's leave here first, follow me to the experimental building." Chen Ge had already gained enough from under the bed plank, and there was no point in staying in dormitory 413 any longer, as it would attract the attention of the students in the building.  "Experimental building? But we just..." Wang Yicheng wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Zhang Ju, who gently tugged at his arm.  "Listen to the teacher, we go wherever he tells us." Chen Ge's suggestion to go to the experimental building was just a casual next move in the game. The attitude of the students in dormitory 413 was very bad; they might report to the dorm manager as soon as they left.  "It's almost lights-out time, let's grab our things and hurry back." Chen Ge restored his bed to its original state and left dormitory 413 with several club members.  They did not attract anyone's attention along the way, and after leaving the male dormitory building, Chen Ge saw many people running towards the experimental building, where something seemed to have happened.  "Zhu Long just knocked over the dissection table, the duty teacher can handle it himself, is there a need to alarm so many people?" Chen Ge was curious about the situation at the experimental building, but it was just curiosity. Going there now would be walking into a trap; the best choice was to avoid them.  "Teacher, are we really going to the experimental building? We just came back from there."  "Go to the number one teaching building, move quickly, we go there to check it out before the school reacts." Chen Ge kept changing locations, so even if the school's people came to investigate, they could only follow behind him eating dust.  The group ran in the direction opposite to the experimental building, and as time passed, fewer and fewer people were in the campus.  "Have you guys ever heard any strange tales related to toilets here?" Chen Ge asked as they walked, "Have you been to the toilet on the top floor of the teaching building?"  "No," several students shook their heads.  "This school looks very normal on the surface, but dangers are hidden everywhere. When we get there, you must follow my command." Chen Ge and the others made a round to the teaching building. The east campus teaching building was very imposing, with three buildings front and back, each four stories high.  "Your school seems to have a fondness for the number 'four'."  By this time, there were no students in the teaching building, the classrooms were pitch black, and only the corridor lights were still on.  "It's my first time coming to the teaching building so late at night. It didn't seem so scary during the day when there were many people, but the teaching building at night is actually so terrifying." Wang Yicheng walked slower; as he approached the teaching building, his expression became very unnatural, seemingly having an inner resistance to this place.  Wang Yicheng's change caught Chen Ge's attention. This lame boy seemed to have encountered some very unpleasant things in the classroom.  "Stick close to me, we will go straight to the top floor, and don't go towards anything you see in the other classrooms." Before entering the teaching building, Chen Ge first checked the surrounding environment. Each teaching building had two staircases on the left and right, and the toilets were near the left staircase.  "Are you sure you want to go?" Zhou Tu could not understand Chen Ge's various actions at all. Every step the other party took seemed to be well thought out, but upon closer examination, they realized there was no relation to each other at all. However, Chen Ge acted as if everything was natural and profound, making people want to lift his skull and see what was actually inside.  "Don't fall behind." Zhang Ju kindly reminded Zhou Tu, then helped Wang Yicheng into the staircase.  "Hurry up, this is a club activity." Zhu Long's eyes were bloodshot, and holding a pink female phone in his hands at over 1.8 meters tall, he looked surprisingly unawkward.  "I must be crazy, following you to the teaching building toilet late at night to look for supernatural phenomena." Zhou Tu reluctantly entered the staircase, and the group did not stop, running up to the top floor.  The teaching building was very quiet at night, completely different from the daytime.  "I and Zhang Ju will go in first. Zhu Long, you will be in the middle to respond. Zhou Tu, Wang Yicheng, you two stay outside." Chen Ge grabbed the toilet door handle, ready to push with force, when his arm was suddenly grabbed.  "Teacher, can we not go in..." Wang Yicheng stood by Chen Ge. His face was pale, cold sweat slid down his cheeks, and his pupils kept twitching, "I remember something very bad, and it happened here!"  "What is it?" This was the first time Chen Ge saw such an expression on Wang Yicheng.  "I only vaguely remember being forced by them to be involved in that incident. I was the only one who didn't enter this toilet, so I survived. Those who went in, they all died."  Wang Yicheng began to speak incoherently, with a crying tone.  "Everyone who entered this toilet died?" Chen Ge gently held Wang Yicheng's hand, "You're just a freshman, how could you have memories about this toilet?"  "I don't know, I didn't mean to! It was them who forced me! Teacher, let's go! Please don't open that door!" Wang Yicheng looked pitiable.  "We've come this far, I won't give up." Chen Ge took Wang Yicheng's hand away and pushed the toilet door open with force.  "Don't open it! Don't push that door!" Amidst Wang Yicheng's screams, Chen Ge opened the toilet door and looked inside.  Rubber ghost masks were thrown on the ground, and the walls were smeared with blood handprints and human features made with oil paint, making it feel as if one was being stared at from all directions upon entering.  "Lin Sisi was bullied here." Chen Ge picked up a rubber ghost mask from the ground and after ensuring it was safe, stuffed it into his backpack.  He moved forward slowly and took out Lin Sisi's phone to snap a few photos as he passed the first stall in the toilet. Everything in the toilet was normal, with no unfamiliar "people" present.  "It seems there's no problem, but I always feel something is off." Chen Ge looked at the tightly closed stall door and subconsciously pushed it, but the door did not budge.  "Is someone inside?" He bent down to look through the gap under the stall, where a pair of black leather shoes could be seen. Chapter 808: Roommates  "There's someone in the stall!"  At the sight of the black leather shoes, Chen Ge remembered Teacher Bai from the East Campus, who wore the same pair of pure black leather shoes.  "Don't come over just yet."  Chen Ge took two steps back and extended Lin Sisi's phone into the gap of the stall, quickly snapping a photo.  Looking down at the phone, Chen Ge's worry did not materialize; there was only a pair of leather shoes in the stall, no hidden "person."  "Lin Sisi's phone can capture ghosts and some special things. There's nothing in the photo, which means there are only shoes in this stall. But if there's no one in the stall, how is the door locked?"  The restroom stall doors can only be locked from the inside, and the position of the black leather shoes was as if someone was standing inside, not like they were shoved in from the outside.  "Teacher, could you have seen it wrong? Who would run to the top floor of the teaching building to use the restroom late at night? It feels creepy just thinking about it."  Zhu Long's memory was starting to loosen in his mind. He recalled some things, vague and unclear, but they indeed had an impact on him, causing some changes that no one else noticed. For example, he began to distance himself from other club members and preferred to stay by Chen Ge's side, as if Chen Ge and he were of the same kind.  "You guys stay here. If anyone else approaches, notify me immediately."  Chen Ge violently shook the stall door, using force to open it.  The narrow stall was painted with many ghost faces in oil paint, and standing inside felt like being stared at by many people.  "Why would there be a pair of shoes?"  Chen Ge didn't find anything unusual in the first stall and moved on to the second one. With the previous experience, this time he directly took out his phone and shot through the gap of the stall.  The photo showed that there was also a pair of shoes in the second stall, but these were not black leather shoes but a pair of worn blue sneakers.  "The placement is the same. Is there some meaning to this?"  Chen Ge checked the first six stalls in succession, and each contained a pair of men's shoes, including sneakers, travel shoes, and flat shoes, all different sizes, likely belonging to different people.  "The black leather shoes in the first stall look a lot like Teacher Bai's and seem to be worn by an adult, whereas the shoes in the other five stalls are all student shoes. Could each pair of shoes represent a person?"  "Lin Sisi was bullied by the whole class at the time. Could the owners of these shoes be the ones who targeted Lin Sisi the most?"  The biggest difference between a menacing ghost and a living person is that they are made of obsessions and negative emotions. Words like 'forgiveness' and 'kindness' are completely unrelated to them.  No matter what kind of person Lin Sisi was in life, at the moment he became a menacing ghost, his body and mind would surely be consumed by resentment. This is one of the obsessions of a menacing ghost, the foundation supporting their existence.  Imprisoning the people who bullied oneself in the stalls to keep oneself company, based on Chen Ge's understanding of menacing ghosts, they are likely to do such a thing.  "Teacher! Someone is coming this way to the teaching building!" Zhou Tu, supporting Wang Yicheng, shouted at the restroom entrance toward Chen Ge: "They seem to be coming from the direction of the laboratory building!"  "They're coming for us?"  Chen Ge hurried to the last stall door, subconsciously taking out his phone to take a photo, but was surprised to find that the seventh stall door had been dismantled.  "Where is the seventh door?"  Based on Chen Ge's previous guess, the door related to Lin Sisi would most likely appear in the restroom of the top floor of the teaching building, but he searched the restroom and did not find it.  "Calm down, don't panic."  Chen Ge bit his tongue lightly, knowing that those people downstairs would take some time to come up: "Each blood door corresponds to a pusher, which means the door is unique..."  Touching the door frame with his fingers, Chen Ge found that the hinge of the seventh stall had been broken: "The door of this stall was violently knocked open from the inside!"  He looked down at the interior of the stall, where there were no shoes placed in the seventh stall, only two blood-red footprints.  These two footprints, one in front of the other, were like someone walking out the door.  "If each pair of shoes represents a person, did the person from the last stall run out?"  Chen Ge suddenly turned his head to look around, and for some reason, whether psychological or something else, the ugly, bizarre faces on the walls seemed to come to life, and their expressions changed from before.  "All the despair and negative emotions in the West Campus have been transported to the East Campus. The real 'blood door' is probably in the restroom on the top floor of the East School's teaching building."  With one problem unresolved and new ones arising, Chen Ge's forehead veins bulged, and he bit his tongue hard to stay alert: "Step by step, I at least know that I am slowly approaching the truth."  "Teacher! They're coming upstairs! Let's find a place to hide first!"  Zhou Tu's voice was anxious, and he inexplicably felt panicked: "The people who entered the teaching building just now don't seem to be teachers and students from the school, and their way of walking is very strange!"  "Their way of walking is very strange?"  Chen Ge instantly realized the danger and called to Zhang Ju and Zhu Long to run out of the restroom: "Which side did they come up from?"  "The corridor near the restroom!"  "Good! Let's go down the other side! Be careful not to let them see you!"  Chen Ge had no intention of confronting the others head-on for the time being and ran to the first corridor, but when he passed by Wang Yicheng, he suddenly stopped.  His pupils shrank, his gaze landing on Wang Yicheng's shoes.  "Blue sneakers?"  The shoes Wang Yicheng was currently wearing on his feet were exactly the same as the ones in the second stall of the restroom!  "The shoes in the restroom stalls are all men's shoes..."  Chen Ge recalled carefully and suddenly found that the shoes in the restroom were exactly the same as those of the students in dorm 413.  "Dorm 413 has six people in total, and the top floor restroom of the teaching building has seven stalls. Six people correspond to six stalls, and one stall contains black leather shoes, representing the teacher, making up exactly seven people."  Chen Ge frowned:  "Why does Lin Sisi hate his roommates so much? Didn't he specifically run back to the dorm to remind his roommates not to get close to the restroom?"  Chen Ge rubbed his temples hard; he had too much to think about:  "The East Campus is chaotic and disorderly, while the West Campus is more like a keepsake in a glass bottle, frozen in the few days of enrollment, repeating over and over. To know the truth, one must compare the same scenes from both the East and West Campuses!"  "The West Campus is too perfect, so perfect that it's not real, like a dream made by a child. In comparison, the East Campus seems much more realistic."  Chen Ge's gaze moved away from Wang Yicheng's shoes, and he had already made up his mind to take everyone to the East Campus.  "I have no other choice now but to look for memories in dreams and seek the truth in reality." Chapter 809: They Forced Me!  The people who had run from the direction of the laboratory building had already entered the corridor and seemed to have noticed something. They headed straight for the restroom on the top floor without any stops in between.  "Let's go!" Chen Ge immediately picked up Wang Yicheng, and they quickly ran through the corridor to the other side of the hallway. They hid in the stairwell, holding their breath.  "Mr. Bai, why did you stop?"  "You guys watch the entrance to the third-floor corridor. I'll stand on this side of the fourth floor. Once they all go up to the fourth floor, then we'll go down," Chen Ge said, his courage quite large. He stood on one side of the corridor, and through the long hallway, he used his dark pupil to watch the restroom.  "But..."  "Do as I say."  Chen Ge stayed alone at the entrance to the fourth-floor corridor on the right, watching the left side. After about ten or so seconds, he clearly heard footsteps coming from the left corridor, and then several people in white clothes appeared on the fourth floor.  "What strange clothing? All white? Even the shoes are white?"  There were three people who came upstairs. Besides all wearing white clothes, there was another abnormal thing about them; these guys all had scars on their faces. It wasn't just one or two scars, but like Zhang Ju, their entire faces were extensively burned, looking a bit terrifying.  "Are they the school's managers?" Chen Ge saw them enter the restroom and then led the other students to run downstairs, perfectly avoiding them.  "Teacher, where do we go next?"  "We'll find a chance to go to the east campus."  Chen Ge's voice was urgent, and those in white clothes had given him a lot of pressure.  "No, why are you guys so nervous? It's like we're doing something shady that can't be seen."  Zhou Tu looked at the tense expressions of Chen Ge and the other club members, somewhat speechless: "We are students of the school, and Mr. Bai is a teacher of the school. Even if we are seen by the school, at worst, they'll scold us, at most compensate for the dissecting table in the laboratory building, it won't cost much money."  "Do you still think that if we get caught, we will only be criticized by the school?" Chen Ge stared into Zhou Tu's eyes, and the kid's gaze dodged, not daring to look at Chen Ge.  "You'll understand once you get to the east campus."  Chen Ge led the students to avoid the teaching building, slowly approaching the sports equipment room next to the teaching building through the secluded path.  "Teacher, aren't we going to the east campus? What are you doing in the sports equipment room?"  "Looking for tools. Wang Yicheng, Zhou Tu, you two stay outside to keep watch, everyone else come in with me to search, take anything like ropes or similar items."  Chen Ge pried open the door of the sports equipment room and found a lot of ropes used for jumping rope.  "Teacher! Those people seem to be coming this way!" Zhou Tu's voice came from outside the door, as he saw several white figures running out from the teaching building and heading towards their location.  "That's impossible? How would they know we're at the sports equipment room? If them going to the restroom on the top floor of the teaching building was an accident, how did they determine I was at the sports equipment room?"  Chen Ge had a bad premonition, he zipped up his backpack, and because it was stuffed with too many things, the backpack looked bulging and could only be carried in his hand.  "The sports equipment room is large enough for them to search for a while, let's retreat first."  Chen Ge carried the backpack in one hand, then waved to Wang Yicheng: "Come on, I'll carry you."  Chen Ge had good intentions, but this time Wang Yicheng refused. He shook his head, his eyes full of horror, like a child who had a nightmare: "Teacher, I'm very scared, I heard someone calling my name, those people behind seem to be looking for me, I heard their voices!"  "You heard someone calling your name? When did it start?" Chen Ge didn't give Wang Yicheng a chance to resist, time was tight and he couldn't afford to delay, forcibly picking up Wang Yicheng: "Let's talk while we walk."  "Teacher! Those people are looking for me! If you take me with you, they will definitely find us!" Wang Yicheng's facial features were slightly twisted, and his body was shaking.  "Stop talking nonsense, you're my student, you just need to answer my questions."  Chen Ge quickened his pace, but he was very curious about what Wang Yicheng had said.  "When you guys took me to the top floor of the teaching building, I suddenly felt very uncomfortable inside, I had an inexplicable urge to cry. That corridor felt very familiar to me, as if something bad had happened there before."  Wang Yicheng's eyes were red and swollen, like a fish thrown ashore, even breathing became difficult.  "You're a freshman, right? How could you feel that corridor was familiar?"  "I don't know, sometimes we go to a strange place and feel like we've been there before, that's how I feel right now."  Wang Yicheng's voice was intermittent, and his face was frighteningly pale.  "What about that voice? Did it appear suddenly? What did it say to you?" Chen Ge asked softly.  "Just when I saw the corridor, I suddenly started feeling uncomfortable. When we got to the door of the restroom, a scene suddenly flashed in my mind."  Wang Yicheng took a deep breath, pausing for a long time before saying: "It seems like a long time ago, I've been to this restroom. I was responsible for leading a very important person into the restroom. His skinny body stood in the restroom, and the restroom was filled with all kinds of demons and ghosts! It's also because these memories came up that I tried to stop you guys when you went in."  "Hold on!" Chen Ge keenly noticed a detail in Wang Yicheng's words: "You were responsible for leading someone important to you into the restroom?"  "Yes, that person seemed to be my best friend. I really understand that feeling because very few people are willing to be my friend, only he was an exception."  Wang Yicheng violently hit his own head, his memory seemed to start loosening as well: "When we got to the door of the restroom, his voice emerged in my mind, he was calling my name, I'm sure it was him! But I just can't remember who he is!"  "Is his name Lin Sisi?" Chen Ge whispered the name Lin Sisi into Wang Yicheng's ear, and as soon as these words came out, Wang Yicheng's body began to shake violently, his arms that were hugging Chen Ge's neck tightened, making it hard for Chen Ge to breathe.  "I didn't mean it, they forced me! I'm sorry! We are still the best friends!" Wang Yicheng closed his eyes and shouted, his voice was miserable, as if he suddenly found a ghost standing next to his bed in the middle of the night.  "Calm down!"  Wang Yicheng suddenly broke down, which was unexpected by everyone. His behavior could attract more trouble, so Chen Ge decisively tossed him off and struck him on the carotid artery of his neck.  "Mr. Bai?" The other few students were startled.  "Shut up! I'm saving him!" Chen Ge tried a few more places and finally made Wang Yicheng faint: "Mental breakdown can cause serious damage to the brain. The best solution I can think of is to let him stop thinking for a while." Chapter 810: The Other Side of the Wall  Looking at the unconscious Wang Yicheng, Chen Ge's mood could not calm down for a long time. He had obtained a very important piece of information from what Wang Yicheng had just said. The person who had lured Lin Sisi into the bathroom was Wang Yicheng!  "I didn't expect the most crucial person to be right by my side." Chen Ge was glad that even after entering the world behind the door, he still maintained his kind nature. When he first came into contact with Wang Yicheng, he didn't think too much; he just saw the other party alone and wanted to help change his situation.  In fact, he did it. Wang Yicheng now had several new friends, and these friends would not bully or discriminate against him.  Through what Wang Yicheng had said in his frenzy, Chen Ge roughly understood the ins and outs of the matter. Wang Yicheng and Lin Sisi both lived in room 413, and for various reasons, both were not very well-liked.  Because of different personalities, the two had different ways of handling the cold violence from classmates. Wang Yicheng chose to endure and silently bear it. Lin Sisi, on the other hand, thought of various schemes to draw everyone's attention.  These two could not really be considered friends; they were just bullied victims banding together.  The classmates really hated Lin Sisi and decided to dress up as ghosts to play a trick on Lin Sisi in the bathroom on the top floor of the teaching building as revenge.  To successfully lure Lin Sisi over, they found Wang Yicheng, who was on relatively good terms with Lin Sisi.  Chen Ge didn't know how those people convinced Wang Yicheng, but he knew the final result was that Wang Yicheng agreed to the students' request.  Wang Yicheng had his own difficulties, but the person who pushed Lin Sisi towards the cliff was him.  "Speed up! We need to get rid of the people behind us before Wang Yicheng wakes up." Chen Ge was very cautious. He went to a few more places and finally breathed a sigh of relief when he found that the person in white had not followed.  The atmosphere in the West Campus slowly began to turn abnormal, and the number of strange people in white clothes gradually increased. Chen Ge did not stay any longer and led the club members to the garbage classification processing center.  "Teacher Bai, are those people in white clothes also school teachers? Why have I never seen them before? And why were they chasing us just now?" Zhu Long had many questions to ask.  "They are not teachers; they are the managers who maintain order in the West Campus. As for why they were chasing us..." Chen Ge placed the unconscious Wang Yicheng on the grass: "Because of him, and because of you."  "Us?"  "Yes, this school is not as simple as you think. If it were compared to the human brain, then the West Campus would be the place responsible for processing all kinds of positive emotions, while negative emotions and garbage would be taken care of by the East Campus."  Chen Ge used a very common analogy to explain: "The West Campus has only good memories, and all garbage must be sent to the East Campus. But how could a person only have good memories?"  "So we forgot a lot of memories?" Zhang Ju was very smart; he understood Chen Ge's meaning before he finished speaking.  "That's right, what you have forgotten is filled with despair. These things are seen as garbage by the West Campus. Once these memories loosen or awaken, they will be sent to the East Campus."  Chen Ge spoke very seriously: "Now that you know the truth, are you still willing to continue searching for your memories?"  "I am willing." Zhu Long agreed without hesitation: "This feeling of not being able to remember something that clearly happened is too uncomfortable. If this continues, I will go crazy. I would rather remember everything."  "I also want to know what memories I have lost. Lacking memories, I always feel incomplete, like a... monster." Zhang Ju lightly touched the scar on his face, his eyes complex, and it was unclear what he was thinking.  "You guys are really crazy! Truly crazy!" Zhou Tu kept muttering as he paced back and forth like a mouse trapped in a cage.  "No refusal means consent." Chen Ge helped Wang Yicheng up from the ground: "Actually, there's another advantage to going to the East Campus now. The people chasing us want to send us to the East Campus, but they would never expect us to have gone there ourselves."  "Is there a difference?"  "If we go by ourselves, we can still maintain our 'human' appearance. If they catch us and transfer us over, you might forget even more things by then."  Chen Ge comforted the club members a few words: "The East Campus is not as scary as you think. Just be a little careful, and nothing will happen."  Carrying Wang Yicheng, Chen Ge opened the door of the West Campus garbage processing center. The room was very clean, completely different from the East Campus.  "Don't mess with anything here, and don't get close to the doors of the garbage classification." Chen Ge didn't know if there were any staff in the garbage processing center of the West Campus, so he distributed some ropes to the students in advance: "There's a small window on the second floor. I'll go out through the window and climb up to the top of the wall first. You watch how I do it and just follow my lead."  "What about Wang Yicheng?"  "Tie him up with a rope. After I climb up the wall, you guys lift him out of the window first, and I'll pull him up to the top of the wall." Wang Yicheng was short and thin, not too heavy, which was good news for Chen Ge.  "Be careful. Once you're up on the second floor, do as I say immediately. You must be quick!" After distributing the ropes, Chen Ge personally tied up Wang Yicheng and connected a rope between himself and Wang Yicheng, then carried him to the second floor.  After confirming there was no one on the second floor, Chen Ge didn't look closely and headed straight for the window.  Opening the small window, Chen Ge climbed up to the wall with practiced ease: "What are you waiting for? Hand Wang Yicheng out."  He was tied with a rope, and the other end of the rope was tied to Wang Yicheng.  "Is Teacher Bai a physical education teacher?" Zhang Ju was the first to react and lifted Wang Yicheng to send him outside the window.  "This is the second floor! Be careful." Zhu Long and Zhou Tu also started to help, and the three of them worked together to hand Wang Yicheng out.  After a lot of effort, Chen Ge finally got Wang Yicheng up on the wall. He was one of the key figures tonight, and Chen Ge would definitely not leave him behind.  Sitting on the wall again, Chen Ge's mood was completely different from before. He untied the rope from his body, moved on the wall to make room for the other students.  "Move quickly!" Chen Ge, supporting Wang Yicheng, found a few gaps between the bricks on the wall and tied the rope around them.  Next time they wanted to go from the East Campus to the West Campus, they wouldn't need to go through the garbage processing center; they could use the rope he left.  It took the group more than ten minutes to jump to the East Campus. For these students from the West Campus, the East Campus was a completely unfamiliar scene. Chapter 811: Zhang Ju's Memory  "The second day of the new student orientation, and I was being chased by a teacher, forced to climb over a wall to escape. This is nothing like the college life I imagined!" Zhou Tu brushed off the dirt on his body and untied the rope that was fastened around his waist.  "There might be even more unexpected things to come," Chen Ge pulled hard on the rope tied to the top of the wall a few times, hiding it behind the ivy. Even if someone walked by, they wouldn't notice without looking closely. "This rope is my backup plan."  When Chen Ge left the East Campus, he was alone, but when he returned, he had become the leader of a club.  "Teacher, have you noticed anything unusual?" Zhang Ju stood up straight, his eyes hidden within scars slowly widened.  "What's wrong?"  "I might be more sensitive, but the air on this side of the wall feels stickier, damp, and there's an odd smell, kind of like blood," said Zhang Ju in the calmest tone, but his words were weird.  He slowly opened his mouth, his tongue licked the scar on his upper lip, his eyes filled with confusion and doubt: "Compared to the West Campus, this place feels more familiar to me."  "Are you joking? Are you familiar with the smell of blood?" Zhou Tu originally just thought Zhang Ju was ugly, but otherwise normal. However, after hearing his recent words, Zhou Tu saw Zhang Ju in a new light.  "I'm not joking, it's true," Zhang Ju looked towards Chen Ge, who stood there with a smile.  "You're not wrong, this is fertile ground for cultivating beautiful dreams. In the world behind the door, only with corpses and blood as fertilizer can flowers that surprise people bloom," Chen Ge picked up Wang Yicheng and gestured for Zhang Ju to follow behind him: "I'll take you to a place first, remember, don't make too much noise."  They moved through the untended bushes, with the night serving as their best camouflage. Without incident, Chen Ge led Zhang Ju to the place where the tree hole ghost was.  "Do you find this place familiar?" Chen Ge pointed to the tree hole that contained the ghost's head, as well as the surrounding trees.  "It seems like we've been here before... Right, isn't this the crime scene of the girl's murder that we saw in the West Campus? Why is there an identical scene in the East Campus?" Zhou Tu's eyes widened; even the position and angle of the tree holes in the two scenes were exactly the same.  "The murder scene in the West Campus is just a shell, the bodies and the souls of the deceased are hidden in the East Campus, what you see now is the real crime scene," Chen Ge said as he spoke, Zhang Ju seemed to be attracted by something, standing alone next to the tree hole, his shoulders trembling slightly.  "Zhang Ju?"  He seemed unable to hear Chen Ge's voice, slowly squatting down, kneeling next to the tree hole, his hands trembling as he reached into the tree hole.  "Hey! What are you freaking out about? I remember the girl's head was found in the tree hole! What are you doing sticking your hand in there?" Zhou Tu wanted to pull Zhang Ju away, but Chen Ge stopped him: "Don't disturb him, the memories he lost are hidden in that tree hole, he needs to dig them out himself."  "Dig them out? You guys are really crazy!" Zhou Tu didn't have the strength of Chen Ge, and couldn't break free, so he could only stand by and watch helplessly.  Kneeling on both legs, Zhang Ju lay next to the tree hole, staring intently at the dark tree hole, his arm slowly disappearing into the hole. His body trembled continuously, sweat mixed with the scars on his face, like tears falling.  "There's nothing? Why is there nothing? There can't be nothing!" Zhang Ju didn't feel anything, his voice was intermittent, as if he was too anxious to breathe: "I saw it with my own eyes! I saw him hide it in the tree hole! How come it's not there?"  His fingers scraped the soil and tree bark, his nails began to bleed, but Zhang Ju did not feel the pain, his expression was fierce, and he frantically dug at the bottom of the tree hole.  "Zhang Ju, are you looking for this?" Chen Ge took out a rusty kitchen knife from his backpack, this knife was the attachment of the tree hole ghost, the shadow swallowed the ghost and found it deep in the tree hole (see Chapter 787), at first Chen Ge wanted to use the knife for self-defense, without thinking too much.  Suddenly everything quieted down, and everyone's eyes focused on the kitchen knife.  "This kitchen knife was found in the tree hole, the soul of the deceased who had gone mad was attached to this knife," Chen Ge placed the kitchen knife in front of Zhang Ju: "If you pick it up, can you remember your past?"  Zhang Ju was about to collapse, his arms trembled more and more, his pupils beating violently.  "Does it feel familiar? Have you seen this knife somewhere else? Whose hand was this knife in at the time, and whose neck did this knife finally chop into?" Chen Ge's words pierced into Zhang Ju's mind like spikes, and as his fingertips touched the handle of the knife, his face suddenly changed dramatically, his pupils contracted, his mouth opened wide, as if he had touched a red-hot iron.  Before Zhang Ju could scream, Chen Ge had already covered his mouth in advance: "It's okay, those things are in the past, it's just your past."  While comforting Zhang Ju with his mouth, Chen Ge's eyes were fixed on Zhang Ju's hand holding the knife, ready to push him down if he made any slashing motion.  Zhang Ju's strength was much greater than Chen Ge had imagined, and as his memories loosened, his strength continued to grow; this child was probably not just an ordinary ghost.  Just as Chen Ge was about to lose control of Zhang Ju, the latter finally calmed down.  Chen Ge let go, and Zhang Ju fell to the ground on his knees, his lips touching the muddy ground, the scars on his face glaring.  "I remembered some things," Zhang Ju stared at his broken nails: "That day was the birthday of a senior, a girl wanted to confess to the senior, but the senior had his own girlfriend, so he asked me to reject her on his behalf.  I arrived at the agreed place and didn't see the girl, so I waited. Later I heard some noise in the woods, I sneaked over, and then I saw someone with this knife..."  "The girl was still struggling, but I didn't dare to go out. I was scared silly, I had never seen so much blood before."  His fingernails dug into the soil, Zhang Ju's facial scars squeezed together: "If I had stood up then, maybe that girl wouldn't have died."  Guilt and self-reproach tormented Zhang Ju all the time, he clenched the kitchen knife: "By the time I went back to call the police, those people had already run away, I don't know if they were caught, but I saw one of the figures was very familiar."  "The next night, we drank a lot of alcohol, then went to sing, and then there was a fire, I was sent to the hospital, and what happened after that..." Zhang Ju suddenly beat his head: "What happened after that? Why don't I have any more memories?"  "Burned and passed out in the hospital, your memories stopped there," Chen Ge already knew Zhang Ju's past. Chapter 812: Portrait of a Doctor  "I could see the fire spreading, burning faster and faster, thick smoke billowing, screams and wails everywhere. I couldn't open my eyes, wanting to run outside, but as soon as I opened the door, flames rushed into the private room." Zhang Ju lay on the ground, veins bulging on his forehead, the scar on his face trembling slightly: "I don't know where the pain started from, I desperately rushed out, couldn't catch my breath, could barely see anything, and finally fainted in the corridor."  "I vaguely felt someone lifting me up, at that time I still retained some consciousness."  With fingers stained with mud and blood, he dug into his hair, using his elbow to prop up his body: "I must have been sent to the hospital, I could faintly hear the conversations between my parents and the doctors. I wanted to open my eyes, but when I did, I saw a completely dark world, as if everything had been charred."  Zhang Ju's voice gradually returned to normal, he collapsed on the ground: "I can remember my parents' faces, the doctors and nurses who took care of me, but I just can't remember how I woke up from the coma, nor how I came to this school."  "Is there a possibility that you have never actually awoken, and this here is the world after you fell into a coma?" Chen Ge's words took Zhang Ju by surprise.  "I haven't woken up? This is the world after the coma?" Zhang Ju muttered Chen Ge's words: "So all this is a dream? Are you all figments of my imagination?"  "Figment of your imagination my ass, the more you talk, the more ridiculous it gets. Can we be a bit more normal?" Zhou Tu snatched the kitchen knife from Zhang Ju's hand: "I'm not sure about others, but I'm definitely not the man of your dreams. I'll keep the knife for you, to prevent you from trying to use it on someone else as an experiment."  Zhou Tu felt like he was the only normal person in this club. It was safer to keep the weapon with him.  "What Zhang Ju said is not entirely without reason, but he got one thing wrong. This world is not his dream alone, but a nightmare formed from the negative emotions and despairing experiences of many people," Chen Ge glanced over the faces of all the club members: "You all are trapped in this world, a world that you have created with your own hands."  After Chen Ge finished speaking, the woods became extremely quiet, everyone looked at him with very vivid expressions on their faces.  "I know you might not be able to accept this for the moment, but it's okay, we still have time." Chen Ge carried Wang Yicheng on his back and glanced at the distant wall: "Wang Yicheng's awakening memory has attracted the manager, now with your memory Zhang Ju starting to unravel, it is very likely that the manager will come over, we must leave as soon as possible."  Chen Ge turned around and walked towards the outside of the woods.  "Wait a minute!" Zhang Ju grabbed the reddened soil on the ground, slowly raised his head, his eyes fixed on Chen Ge: "Who are you really? Why are you telling us this?"  "Who I am is not important, what's important is that I can help you escape from here. Your loved ones in reality have been waiting for too long." Chen Ge said with a smile: "Actually, I am quite similar to you, I too lost a part of my childhood memories, so when I met you, it was as if I saw my former self."  Waving his hand, Chen Ge walked towards the distance: "Meeting me is your fortune, the former me had no guidance, groping alone in the darkness, losing too much..."  Chen Ge led the club members past the laboratory building and the faculty apartment building, and followed the path to the side of the teaching building.  "The top floor bathroom of the teaching building, the answer I want should be here."  The teaching building in the west campus area was just quiet and gloomy, but the east campus area was eerie everywhere, and a chill would climb up one's back and rush to the brain as soon as one approached.  "Keep quiet, if something happens here, the consequences will be very serious," Chen Ge whispered.  "What could happen?" Zhou Tu's forehead was sweating, he held the kitchen knife taken out from the tree hole, hunched his back, and looked around nervously, looking very tense.  "In the east campus area, we store the garbage that the west campus area doesn't want. How do we usually deal with garbage in our lives?" Chen Ge maintained his smile, but his words made several club members take a cold breath: "After being caught, we will be disassembled for useful parts, squeezed dry of all value, then directly discarded. Dying here really is a luxury."  Once the arrow is shot, there's no turning back, Chen Ge was the first to enter the teaching building of the east campus area.  It might have been an illusion, but the night in the east campus area seemed even darker than in the west campus area.  Stepping on the old stairs, the burnt traces on the handrails of the staircase remained, and faint sounds of desks and chairs moving could be heard from the empty classrooms next to them.  "This place is so scary, I can't imagine it's just separated from us by a wall," Zhu Long whispered, walking at the end of the line.  "Shh, don't talk," Zhou Tu gripped the knife and followed closely behind Zhang Ju, afraid that the scarred-faced student would suddenly go mad and hurt himself.  The more you worry about something, sometimes the more likely it is for accidents to happen. Zhou Tu was staring at Zhang Ju when he suddenly stopped.  "What's wrong?"  "It's nothing, I'm just curious why there are so many doctor's photos posted in the corridor of the teaching building?" Zhang Ju looked up at the doctors on the wall: "We're not a medical university, and these doctors don't seem very famous. Many don't even have an introduction, just a photo of them in a white coat. By the way, have you noticed that all these photos of doctors are work photos?"  Zhang Ju's words caught Chen Ge's attention. He had felt that these doctors' photos were strange before, but couldn't figure out why. Now being prompted by Zhang Ju, he suddenly thought of a possibility.  "The world behind the door is woven from the memories of those who push it open. This school is very special, containing the memories of all its students. The doctor photos on the wall could possibly be people the students have encountered in reality."  Chen Ge gently pressed Zhang Ju's shoulder: "Take a look at these photos, see if there are any doctors you recognize."  "The doctors who are posted on the wall are the top people in the field, how could I possibly know them?"  "In this place, doctors might have some special significance, just do as I say."  Chen Ge led the club members to continue walking upstairs. When passing the third floor, he suddenly stopped: "Don't move, there's someone ahead."  The classroom near the corridor on the third floor wasn't locked, and the poor quality wooden door was creaking in the wind.  Chen Ge and the others stood still in the hallway for a while, then a shadow emerged from the classroom.  "That build looks a bit familiar, is it Chang Gu?" Chapter 813: Do You Dare?  The silhouette was similar in build to Chang Gu, but its movements were agile, nothing like those of a person who was nearly blind. Chen Ge didn't dare to go out rashly; he wanted to continue observing, but the figure ran directly to the other side of the corridor, seemingly searching for something.  "Is that Chang Gu? Have his eyes returned to normal?"  It was pitch dark inside the teaching building, and even though Chen Ge possessed Yin Pupils, he was still extremely cautious.  "Teacher, is that your acquaintance? Should we follow?"  "Better to mind our own business; let's head to the top floor first."  Chen Ge's gaze stayed on the shadow, which didn't leave but instead entered another classroom.  There were others in the teaching building late at night. The variables increased, and Chen Ge wasn't sure if it was good or bad.  The group reached the fourth floor; the bathroom was on the other side of the corridor, requiring them to cross a long hallway.  "No matter what sounds you hear, don't respond. No matter what you see, don't leave the group, understand?" Chen Ge instructed the club members a few times before carrying Wang Yicheng into the hallway.  He crouched down, scanning the classrooms on either side with the corner of his eyes.  The windows were pitch black, nothing visible.  The club members followed behind Chen Ge, trying to control their urge to look around, but the more they told themselves not to look, the less control they had over their eyes.  "What's that?"  It seemed like the classrooms hadn't been cleaned in a while. When Zhou Tu passed by a window, he saw strands of what appeared to be hair beneath the window frame, giving the impression that a girl was lying at the window-side position in the classroom.  "Could that really be a person?" Zhou Tu tiptoed, maintaining his forward motion, and tilted his head slightly to look under the classroom window sill.  "The hair... is it moving?"  Before Zhou Tu could see clearly, he bumped into something unexpectedly. He didn't hold onto the kitchen knife firmly, and the rusty blade fell to the ground.  The sound of the rusty knife colliding with the floor tiles was piercingly sharp in the quiet of the night.  Everyone stopped in their tracks, and Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu: "What are you doing?"  "I accidentally bumped into Zhang Ju." Zhou Tu covered his nose and pointed at Zhang Ju, who was standing still in shock, "You were walking fine, why did you suddenly stop?"  Zhang Ju didn't answer but instead looked up at the photo on the wall, his mouth slightly open, pupils shrinking to a point.  "Zhang Ju?"  No matter how others called out to him, Zhang Ju didn't respond; he just stared at the photo on the wall, his gaze calm but tinged with sadness.  When he saw the knife that killed the girl in the woods, he had a mental breakdown, hysterical, but now he had become completely different from before.  There were no crazy screams, no self-harm to relieve the mental pain; he just stood quietly in front of the photo.  "I've seen this doctor before."  His voice was very soft, so low that only people close by could hear.  "The fire scorched one-fifth of my skin; I watched my flesh char, smelled the stench of my body burning until my eyes melted, my eyelids stuck together, and my world plunged into darkness."  "I was taken to the hospital, it was so painful, I couldn't feel the pain anymore."  "My eyes couldn't open, my nose was burned off, one ear was left with two-thirds, the other ear with one-third."  "I turned into a monster; I couldn't see myself, but I knew I was no longer me; I could no longer go back and live like a human."  "Have you ever tried listening to your family's voices with two-thirds of an ear?"  "People were saving me, I could feel my body getting more and more painful, I was getting closer to being alive, but how could I wake up?"  "My eyes were cut open by something cold, cleaned bit by bit, my left eye was removed, and my right eye could vaguely see a gray world."  "I couldn't sense light; the world I saw with my right eye only had shadows. Tell me, should I keep living?"  Zhang Ju's hand pressed on the photo on the wall, his face bleeding, fine streams of blood emerging from beneath his skin as if they were threads used for surgical sutures.  "I recognize this doctor; he accompanied me for a week. The Grim Reaper wanted my life, and he gambled with the Reaper."  His voice became more hoarse, as if his throat had been scorched by a great fire, and his appearance also began to change.  Scars and blood threads spread across his face, his ears wilted like flowers, and the eyelid of his left eye slowly melted.  "I never spoke a word to him, but I was profoundly impressed by him. Among the three people who were with me in my final moments, he was one of them."  The guilt towards the dead unlocked Zhang Ju's memories, and the doctor who had once treated him made the previously vague memories clear, piecing together the fragments in his mind.  Blood threads seeped from under his skin, as if the healed scars were breaking open again.  The blood threads formed droplets, falling onto Zhang Ju's outer clothes, his coat slowly turning red: "If you were in my situation, would you choose to live or die?"  "Half in red clothes? After the restoration of memory, will the ghost regain its original form? Could it be that the ghost in the tree hollow couldn't maintain a normal human shape because the memory wasn't completely erased?" Chen Ge's eyelids twitched slightly, but his reaction was much better compared to the other club members.  Zhou Tu didn't even care to pick up the kitchen knife, grabbing Zhu Long's arm, and the two unconsciously retreated three meters away.  No one replied, and Zhang Ju's gaze slowly shifted from the photo. He looked at Chen Ge: "I remember who I am now, can you tell me who you are?"  The two stood in the dark corridor, looking at each other.  "You've asked me this question, and I've given you an answer."  Chen Ge stood still, not retreating a single step: "We are the same kind, I want to find my forgotten memories, helping you is helping myself."  "You're lying!" Zhang Ju reached out to grab Chen Ge, but stopped just as his fingers were about to touch him.  "Why did you stop?" Chen Ge took a step forward, approaching Zhang Ju's face of despair and horror: "Are you afraid that after killing me, another 'me' will rise from the corpse? Are you afraid of me in red?"  With both hands on Zhang Ju's shoulders, Chen Ge's expression was the epitome of madness, his hands moving across Zhang Ju's shoulders before slowly cradling his face, gently touching his forehead.  "Kill me? Do you dare?"  Not just Zhang Ju, but Zhou Tu and Zhu Long hiding behind were also scared.  The corridor was silent, and after a long while, Chen Ge let go of Zhang Ju, looking at the other club members in the hallway: "I just want to find my lost memories, helping me is helping yourselves, and vice versa." Chapter 814: The Movable "Door"  Zhang Ju had long noticed that Chen Ge was no ordinary person. His eyes remained calm no matter what he saw, as if there was nothing in the world that could surprise him. Frankly speaking, he was quite afraid of such a person, but it was precisely because of this fear that he chose to listen and follow.  Standing in front of the photo, Zhang Ju opened his remaining right eye and silently gazed at Chen Ge's face. Ordinary features that wouldn't stand out in a crowd, yet it was this very person who had inadvertently revealed an expression that even he found frightening.  It was hard to describe; it was like a combination of a deeply resentful ghost and a deranged madman. From that face, one could see madness, morbidity, and cruelty, but there was no fear or terror to be seen.  Zhang Ju knew his own appearance. He always felt like a horrifying monster, but Chen Ge's recent actions made him realize that there were even more terrifying "monsters" in this world.  "Yes, we should be the same kind of people."  He believed Chen Ge's words because such an expression could only be possessed by someone who had experienced hell. Like himself, the other party had also forgotten the past.  "I'm sorry, Teacher Bai, I recalled some very unpleasant memories, so I lost control," Zhang Ju's voice was harsh and grating, but his attitude had improved a lot.  "It's fine, how could a teacher truly blame a student?" Chen Ge’s face wore a smile, appearing very kind and gentle, making it hard to believe that the person speaking to Zhang Ju was the same one: "What did you remember? Don't hesitate, tell me everything."  "It's nothing much, just some painful memories."  Zhang Ju's wounds continued to bleed, his clothes gradually staining red: "I remembered how cowardly and timid I was when I witnessed a murder; the feeling of being burned by a great fire, as if needles were piercing into the flesh until I couldn't feel the pain; I also remembered lying in a sterile ward, struggling in agony, despair taking root and sprouting in my heart. I didn't want to die, but I didn't know how to keep living."  "During the last stage of your life, did anything special happen to you or around you?" Zhang Ju appeared in the world within the "door," yet he had already lost the ability to open it. Chen Ge was curious about how he entered this school; only by knowing the method of entry could there be a chance to speculate an escape route.  In a three-star scenario, the "door" was the only way in and out, but the four-star scenario seemed different.  "The last stage of life..."  Zhang Ju touched his face: "I seemed to have fallen into a coma but could still sense the outside world. I couldn't distinguish between reality and nightmares, but I clearly remember one thing—every deep in the night, a door would appear in the sickroom."  "A door?"  "I stayed in the hospital for seven days, and that door would appear every night, getting closer to me until finally, it moved to my bedside." Zhang Ju looked up, his face covered in fresh blood: "It was a door that could move. The more scared and desperate I became, the closer it got to me. Unable to call for help, on the eighth night, the door was pushed open from the inside, and hands reached out from the crack, pulling me in."  Zhang Ju's situation was the same as what happened to Chang Gushen; they both encountered a self-moving "door." Each midnight, the door would slowly approach a sleeping person, eventually standing by the bedside, and the door would be pushed open from the inside to take away the living person on the bed.  "Is this school behind the door?" Chen Ge was more curious about what happened next. He wanted to know the process of Zhang Ju's memory loss, how this student who was disfigured in a fire gradually became the half-red-clothed figure.  Zhang Ju shook his head: "I had a dream, a very real dream. In the dream, they all called me Lin Sisi. I repeatedly told them my name was Zhang Ju, that they had mistaken me for someone else, but they thought I was joking."  "No one believed me, and I could only live in the dream under the name of Lin Sisi, experiencing everything that Lin Sisi went through. Over time, even I began to doubt myself, wondering whether I was really Lin Sisi?"  "Being bullied, cold violence, being ignored, none of these feelings were pleasant, but on second thought, having become a monster in reality, it was actually quite nice to live in a dream."  His voice was flat as if narrating someone else's story: "I had no friends, the whole world hated me, and the dual torment of spirit and body gradually numbed me until one day, a girl walked into my dream."  "It was a rainy day, and someone had put a frog in my desk mate's bag; she suspected it was me, but why would I do such a boring thing?"  "No one listened to my explanation, my classmates drove me out of the classroom, and everyone in the hallway looked at me strangely. I had no choice but to escape to the rooftop of the teaching building."  "There, I met her."  "Even though I knew it was a dream, I still felt that the girl was special."  Zhang Ju's voice changed slightly: "Her name was Chang Wenyu, the only person who did not ignore me."  "I confided my grievances to her, and she expressed understanding."  "Later I told her about my past, told her I wasn't really Lin Sisi."  "She was very interested in what I said, and I liked being with her too, because only when I was with her could I remember myself, not be assimilated by that dream."  "We met on the rooftop every evening, and I slowly felt I couldn't be without her."  "Just when I felt that life was gradually gaining color, she suddenly asked me a question—do you want to see the view outside the school?"  "I didn't understand the significance of this question at the time; I just thought about being with her, so I nodded."  "That night, after midnight, she took me to the library."  "The school library's door was always locked; we climbed in through a window and found a mirror behind a bookshelf on the third floor."  "That mirror was very large, the girl said it could still be used a few times, and told me never to tell anyone."  "I trusted her, and at the same time, I remembered something—this was the first time I saw a mirror in a dream!"  "I asked the girl what I should do."  "The girl just said to quietly watch the mirror."  "I stood in front of the mirror, and she hid behind me. In the dead of night, I watched myself in the mirror."  "The more I looked, the less the person in the mirror resembled me. Gradually, the mirror image began to bleed, scars appearing on the face."  "His ears withered, his left eye closed, his face a blur of blood and flesh!"  "I didn't dare to continue watching, but when I wanted to leave, the monster in the mirror grabbed me!"  "Blood flowed on the mirror's surface until it stained the entire mirror red!"  "I screamed for help, turning to look at Chang Wenyu, but she was indifferent. I still remember the last thing she said to me—why be afraid? The you in the mirror, that's the real you."  "Her slender fingers gently pressed on my left eye, slowly taking it out!"  "The world lost color in an instant, and I was dragged away by the monster in the mirror, all the wonderful expectations turning into the most malicious curse at that moment." Chapter 815: This Is Just a Speculation  "Chang Wenyu took my left eye, and now I look exactly like the monster in the mirror," he said. "She shattered all my illusions; I am not Lin Sisi but Zhang Ju. The terrifying monster in the mirror, that is myself." Blood seeped from his wounds, and Zhang Ju's coat was mostly stained red, what's more terrifying was the intertwining and entangling bloodstains on his clothes, growing more and more.  At first, Chen Ge thought Zhang Ju was in a half-red coat, but he quickly realized he had underestimated the other party. As memories were awakened, the bloodstains on Zhang Ju's body grew more and more, almost enough to stain his whole body red.  "I was dragged into the mirror, watching Chang Wenyu standing outside the mirror, pinching my left eye, her lips moving, seemingly saying—just one more."  "My left eye slowly changed in her hands, the memories of my life flashing through the pupil. When she took my left eye, she also took away all my beauty and hope."  Drip, drip... The blood on Zhang Ju's body dripped onto the corridor floor, and there were faint footsteps in the teaching building, but no matter which direction he looked, there was no one coming.  "What kind of world is behind the mirror?" Chen Ge asked softly.  "Red, there is only red there, everything is red," Zhang Ju described, which made Chen Ge think of the scene behind the door of the three-star trial mission: "Then how did you come back from there?"  "There was another me in the mirror, all blood red, wanting to devour me. I didn't have time to think too much, I could only flee in panic. After running for a long time, I realized that the school behind the mirror was also empty, at least it seemed that way on the surface."  "What happened after that?"  "I didn't survive the first night, and in the end, the other me from behind the mirror caught me."  A hint of confusion appeared in Zhang Ju's eyes: "In my memory, he killed me, but when I opened my eyes again, I was back in this school and lost most of my memories, becoming one of the members of this school."  "So you mean, your memories were tampered with after you died?"  "That's one way to understand it, I don't know exactly what happened in between. If you want to get to the bottom of it, you probably need to go find the answer in the blood-red world behind the mirror."  Zhang Ju probably wasn't lying; although his appearance was terrifying, his expression was very serious.  "I think I understand," Chen Ge said softly: "Normally, the 'door' is the only passage into the blood-red world, but in this scene, there is a ghost beyond our imagination, possibly an existence above the red-clothed ones. This guy uses the mirror as a medium and has separated another scene in the blood-red world, which is the school we are in now. Do you understand what I'm saying?"  All the club members present shook their heads.  "Let me give you a simple example. We enter the blood-red world through this door. In this blood-red world, we find another mirror, and when we touch the mirror, we enter the world inside the mirror."  "If we compare it to dreaming, it should be easy to understand. Normal people live in reality; when we fall asleep and dream, our thoughts appear in the dream world. But what happens if we dream within the dream world? Our consciousness will appear in a dream within a dream."  "The blood-red world is made up of despair and negative emotions, while the world behind the mirror is more like a 'dream' created by the person who pushed the door."  Chen Ge had a hard time explaining clearly to the students, but he did figure out a key issue. When he woke up, he had lost contact with all staff, and the black phone was not with him, which made his situation very dangerous.  He could not understand how the owner of the school did it. Not to mention the black phone, his shadow was supposed to hide Zhang Ya, but at this moment, his shadow became very normal, Zhang Ya was not inside.  This can explain that he did not really enter this school in his true body.  Just like what Zhang Ju just said, when he looked in the mirror, there was another him inside the mirror. One gentle and kind, and the other cruel and bloody – the combination of the two is the real him.  "I must have encountered the same problem as Zhang Ju, part of my personality inside the mirror, part of it outside."  All this was Chen Ge's speculation and could not be guaranteed to be 100% correct. He was like walking in the fog, and the only light in the world at this moment was himself.  "The mirror used by Chang Wenyu is in the library; after looking at the bathroom, the next step is to go to the library," Chen Ge said his thoughts.  "Why do you want to go there when everyone avoids that place?" Zhang Ju couldn't understand Chen Ge; his memory had just awakened, various memories were surfacing in his mind, and his eyes were somewhat confused.  "Compared to here, I prefer the blood-red world because that place seems more real."  From what Chen Ge said, it was clear that he was not an ordinary person. After thinking about it, Zhang Ju did not object: "Well, I also want to figure out what exactly happened to me; shouldn't I be dead?"  After getting Zhang Ju's affirmative response, Chen Ge looked more relaxed; he now had a very good helper.  "Let's go, let's check out the bathroom first."  Chen Ge and his party had already stayed in the corridor for a long time, and fortunately, nothing abnormal happened in the teaching building.  Zhang Ju's blood dripped onto the ground, accompanied by the drip-drip sound, and faint footsteps could be heard gradually approaching, but strangely, they only heard footsteps without seeing anyone.  "Zhu Long, did you see the change in Zhang Ju? His face... it's too terrifying."  Zhou Tu didn't dare to approach Zhang Ju and Chen Ge, feeling that both of them were crazy.  "At this point, we can only trust Teacher Bai. Doesn't the change in Zhang Ju also prove that he hasn't deceived us? We are finding back our lost memories."  Zhu Long's face wasn't looking too good either; clenching his teeth, the fingers holding the phone had turned white.  "Okay." Zhou Tu turned his head to look behind him, and he was scared out of his wits, not daring to go back alone: "I must be crazy to have joined such a club."  He steeled his heart and looked down to pick up the kitchen knife on the ground, but at the moment he lowered his head, the moment his vision inverted, he saw a row of inverted heads staring at him from the corridor behind him.  No, that's not right! To be precise, those upside-down people were all staring at Wang Yicheng on the backs of Zhang Ju and Chen Ge!  Zhou Tu was so scared that he almost knelt on the ground, but thankfully Zhu Long helped him up.  "What's wrong?"  "There's someone behind us! There are a lot of people following us!" Zhou Tu's voice was trembling.  "Where?" Zhu Long looked back, and the empty corridor was clearly only a few of them: "Are you having a hallucination?" Chapter 816: The Faceless Boy  Zhu Long was dragging Zhou Tu along as they looked back. The surroundings were pitch black, and they could faintly hear footsteps, but they couldn't see any living person.  "Where are the people?"  "I saw them when I bent down to pick up the kitchen knife. They were all standing upside down behind us, as if they were living in a world that is the opposite of ours."  Zhou Tu was still in shock, "Those people have been staring at Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng, should we tell Teacher Bai?"  "That might be a good idea." Zhu Long looked back doubtfully, Zhou Tu didn't seem to be lying.  While they were distracted, Chen Ge and Zhang Ju had already reached the middle of the corridor. The closer they got to the bathroom, the more nervous they became.  "Teacher Bai, Zhou Tu just saw people following us from behind, all of them standing upside down. I don't know how to explain it; you'd better ask Zhou Tu."  Zhu Long pulled Zhou Tu to Chen Ge's side.  "When I bent down to pick up the kitchen knife just now, I saw that there were people behind us, their heads down, floating in the air. No, they're like walking on the ceiling. Those guys must have been attracted by Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng. I saw with my own eyes, those upside-down monsters were always staring at Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng."  Zhou Tu didn't want to get close to Zhang Ju, it was an instinctive aversion.  "Upside-down people?" Chen Ge had also seen those guys in the lab building: "Let's go to the bathroom first to see if 'the door' exists. If there's no gain in the bathroom, we'll leave immediately."  This school was too strange, even with the protection of the Red-clothed, it couldn't give Chen Ge a sense of security.  They quickened their pace, and just as Chen Ge was a few steps away from the bathroom, his neck was suddenly choked by a pair of hands. The cold, thin arms locked his neck, and the other party was slowly exerting force, making it difficult for Chen Ge to breathe.  "Wang Yicheng? Are you awake?" Chen Ge turned his head, Wang Yicheng's head was resting on his shoulder, his eyes full of black and red bloodshot, and he seemed to have been fighting something in his mind all along.  "Don't go in, they are inside."  Wang Yicheng's voice was very different from his usual voice, with a strong sense of regret, giving the impression of a scarred stray dog, fiercely protecting a companion's body, then allowing others to beat him.  "They? Who are they?"  "Classmates, seniors, everyone who hates you is inside. Don't go over there. I've secretly told the teacher."  Wang Yicheng tried to squeeze out a smile, but he couldn't.  "Did you get hit in the head by someone? Why are you talking nonsense?" Zhu Long held a pink phone and quietly approached Chen Ge, the atmosphere in this teaching building was too oppressive, only by following Chen Ge could he feel a little sense of security.  "Wang Yicheng, did you remember something?" Wang Yicheng's memory was triggered at the entrance of the West Campus bathroom. At that time, Chen Ge worried about exposure and knocked him unconscious. Now, although he has woken up, he seemed to be a bit mentally confused.  "They told me to deceive you into going in, I didn't agree, they beat me, made me limp and climb the stairs. I did what they said, but they still didn't plan to let you go. Remember, no matter who tells you to go to the bathroom on the top floor of the teaching building, you must not go! Do not go there!"  Wang Yicheng's voice was weak, and he seemed to be extremely feeble.  "Besides you, did they find someone else to lure Lin Sisi?"  "I don't know, but I've told the teacher everything, why hasn't he come yet!"  Wang Yicheng was a little anxious, the only lifeline in his heart was that teacher, but the teacher seemed to not appear, maybe that teacher also hated Lin Sisi very much.  "It's okay, I'm just going to take a look."  "Don't go! Do not go in!"  Wang Yicheng regarded Chen Ge as Lin Sisi, these were his true inner thoughts, and it was obvious that he felt very guilty and wanted to make amends.  Having already reached the door, it was impossible for Chen Ge to give up, and now with the help of Zhang Ju, this half-body Red-clothed who was constantly getting stronger was one of Chen Ge's reliance.  Wang Yibao's arms were exerting more and more force, and his arms showed bulging veins, the boy desperately trying to stop Chen Ge from going in, probably not wanting to see the tragedy happen again before his eyes.  The top-floor bathroom of the teaching building was at the deepest part of the corridor, the air here was filled with a pungent smell of disinfectant, and the wall tiles showed yellow-brown stains, the ground was left with water stains, as well as various shoe prints.  Those shoe prints came from different people, and there were many of them.  The bathroom door was locked, Chen Ge took out tools to forcefully open it.  When Chen Ge pushed open the wooden door of the bathroom, he stepped back, carefully looking inside the bathroom.  The bathroom in the East Campus looked completely different from the one in the West Campus, very dirty and messy, as if this place had been forgotten by the school authorities, never cleaned, and no one had ever come in.  "Has this bathroom been locked up since the incident with Lin Sisi?" Chen Ge turned to ask Wang Yicheng, but the boy could no longer speak, his body shaking violently as if he was having a seizure.  Compared to the West Campus, this bathroom gave Chen Ge a more realistic feeling, he carried Wang Yicheng into it.  As soon as he stepped into the bathroom, Wang Yicheng immediately closed his eyes, he didn't dare to look or to remember.  "This room gives me a different feeling than the others."  Zhang Ju looked around, the walls were covered with bloodshot-like things, crawling all over the bathroom like cracks.  The ghost faces drawn on the walls had become blurred, like memories that are about to be forgotten.  Those dried bloodshots crawled over all the patterns on the walls, wrapping them up, as if they didn't want to see them anymore.  Reaching the first stall, Chen Ge pulled out Lin Sisi's mobile phone and stretched it into the gap of the stall, and the screen showed a few figures moving.  "Who is inside?"  Chen Ge forcefully opened the stall door, and the scene before him was beyond his expectations.  Inside the first stall was a mannequin model, wearing a pair of black leather shoes, aged between thirty and forty years old, looking very much like the Teacher Bai Chen Ge had seen before.  "There were a pair of shoes placed in the West Campus bathroom, but the first stall of the East Campus actually has a mannequin, why is there such a difference?"  The Teacher Bai mannequin in the stall stood with his head down, his hands clasped behind his head, standing upright as if he had done something wrong.  Chen Ge used the Yin Eye but didn't see any problems, in the end, he took out Lin Sisi's phone and took a picture of the first stall.  The image on the screen surprised him.  The mannequin of Teacher Bai stood in the stall, but the picture taken by the phone showed a faceless boy, his hands clasped behind his head, in the same pose as Teacher Bai.  "Could this faceless boy be Lin Sisi? Had Teacher Bai punished him in this way before? So he used the same method to target Teacher Bai?" Chapter 817: Would You Be My Friend?  Chen Ge pushed open the second compartment, and inside was a thin male mannequin with a deformed foot, curled up inside, surrounded by mud and garbage. "Looks a bit like Wang Yicheng."  The mannequin in the second compartment and Wang Yicheng, whom Chen Ge was carrying on his back, were both wearing blue sneakers. This mannequin was supposed to represent Wang Yicheng.  Chen Ge raised his phone to take a picture of the second compartment, and the image on the screen was heartbreaking.  The faceless child was cornered into the toilet compartment by a group of people, who threw all sorts of garbage at him.  The boy in the image didn't resist and let himself be bullied.  The mannequin in the third compartment wore a pair of glasses, his body splashed with red paint, standing dully against the toilet compartment wall.  This mannequin looked somewhat similar to the tall and thin boy Chen Ge had seen in dormitory 413.  With the experience from before, Chen Ge directly aimed his phone at the compartment.  On the screen appeared a faceless boy, standing alone in the toilet compartment, with people continuously splashing paint into the compartment.  His originally clean clothes became dirty, and the paint slid down the hem of his clothes.  The boy bowed his head, silent.  "These bullies have already lost control as a group," Chen Ge pushed open the door of the fourth compartment, where the mannequin had no clothes on, and its clothes were wet and thrown beside the squat toilet.  Chen Ge took out his phone to film the fourth compartment, and in the image, the faceless boy slowly took off his paint-covered outerwear as someone poured bottles of water over him.  The fifth compartment, the sixth compartment...  Each compartment's scene was shocking. When people fall into madness, they do not realize how egregious their behavior is, and they unscrupulously vent all their negative emotions on one person.  When opening the first compartment, Chen Ge just wanted to find the truth, everything here was unrelated, he was just a passerby, a victim wanting to break free.  But after seeing six compartments in a row, his heart had already changed unknowingly, his face darkening. If someone familiar with him saw this, they would be very surprised because this man rarely showed such an expression.  A change in expression is a change in inner emotions, revealed on the face, the thoughts in the heart would be exposed, and weaknesses would be discovered. Therefore, Chen Ge always maintained his calm when executing tasks for the black phone.  "Are these still kids?"  Looking up, Chen Ge turned towards the seventh compartment, the only one without a mannequin placed inside, and also the only one without a door panel.  The door hinge was violently damaged, with splintered wood still visible at the joint. The door of the seventh compartment had been knocked open.  The door had disappeared, and the inside of the compartment was covered with blood-like strands. To be precise, the blood strands in the toilet actually all crawled out from this compartment, making the seventh compartment the source of all the bloodstains.  "Was Lin Sisi originally locked in this compartment?"  Those black and red blood strands looked like withered ivy, climbing all over the walls of the compartment, seemingly covering something.  Chen Ge took out Lin Sisi's phone, turned the screen brightness to the brightest, and then filmed the compartment.  The faceless boy was holding his outerwear and trousers, dirty water and paint flowing down his body, colorful, like a monster with fangs and claws clinging to his body.  The door of the toilet compartment in the screen seemed to be blocked from the outside, the boy with his head down, holding clothes, bumping against the door again and again.  He had no face, his expression couldn't be seen, his voice couldn't be heard, and it was unknown whether he was crying or calling for help.  All Chen Ge could see was the child continuously bumping into the door until it was knocked open.  He stood barefoot at the compartment entrance, covering his clothes that had been splashed with paint and dirty water, his arms hanging down, the arms that had been hitting the door were cut by wood splinters, blood trailing on his arms, but the paint flowed into the wounds.  Oppressed, uncomfortable, gasping for air, his neck twisted, that face without features scanned the empty toilet, the evildoers had left, but their malicious words seemed to still echo in the toilet.  The boy stood at the compartment entrance for a long time, then slowly raised his hand, putting on the wet clothes one by one.  Apart from his arms, there were no other injuries on his body, but his body trembled with pain.  The pants were cut open in the middle, the back of the clothes had a big hole, the boy put on all his clothes, the reflection on the ground water showed a hideous monster.  He wiped his face, attempting to take a step towards the toilet door.  The light from the corridor shone into the toilet, the exit was very bright, bright enough to clearly illuminate the boy's appearance at that moment, bright enough to leave him nowhere to hide.  The step he took out was retracted, wearing the dirtied clothes, he returned to the seventh compartment.  Leaning against the wall of the toilet compartment, the boy's body slowly slid down, he curled up in the corner, that face without features faced the toilet entrance, as if waiting for the lights to go out.  The scene on the phone screen did not end there, the child looked for a long time, then raised his head.  The face without features faced Chen Ge, as if he knew someone was watching him.  "Would you like to be my friend?"  Chen Ge heard such a sentence in his ear, he heard it very clearly, but when he looked in the direction the sound came from, there was nothing there.  "Did it come from the phone? Impossible."  The filming scene froze at the last moment, the faceless boy curled up in the corner of the compartment, that face facing Chen Ge, as if waiting for Chen Ge's reply.  "I'm willing to be your friend, though your words sound very much like a curse."  Chen Ge didn't care about curses, his life changed from a cursed love letter, without that letter, during the first task, he would have been chopped up by Wang Qi.  Chen Ge agreed, but the boy on the phone screen still maintained that gesture.  Moving away the phone, there was nothing in the seventh compartment, but the faceless boy could be clearly seen when filmed with the phone.  "Can you hear my voice?" Chen Ge tried to communicate with the other party, with no effect, he waited for a while, and the image on the phone screen changed again.  The door of the seventh toilet compartment was pushed open, and a blood-red hand reached in.  This hand gently grabbed the faceless boy, seemingly saying something to the boy, and the faceless boy lightly nodded.  Afterward, the faceless boy was led by that hand, walking towards the other side of the "door," disappearing from sight.  "That blood hand came from 'inside the door'? What did he say to the boy?" Chen Ge suddenly thought of the sentence he just heard: "The words spoken by the owner of the blood hand to the faceless boy, could it be that sentence—Would you like to be my friend?"  "The faceless boy agreed, and then he disappeared from sight?" Chen Ge carefully sorted through the details.  The faceless boy was Lin Sisi, he made no movement to push the door, but that blood hand was extended from inside the door, meaning there was originally a door in the toilet compartment.  The owner of the blood hand invited Lin Sisi, and in the end, Lin Sisi agreed to the other party. Thinking this way, that blood hand was the one who pushed the door. Chapter 818: He and I May Not Necessarily Be Enemies  After going around in circles, Chen Ge finally found the real master of the ghost school. Although he only saw the other party's hand, this was a big step forward for Chen Ge. "Just now, I heard someone asking in my ear—do you want to be my friend?" "This sentence did not come from the phone; I heard it very clearly coming from next to my ear." "What he said might not have been meant for Lin Sisi, but for me."  Chen Ge turned his head and saw that the black and red blood strands in the toilet cubicle had begun to fall off in large patches, just like the leaves in autumn, completely devoid of life. "Did you agree to him?" Wang Yicheng, who had been keeping his eyes tightly shut on Chen Ge's back, suddenly spoke. He buried his head in Chen Ge's shoulder; his voice was so low that one could hardly hear it if they didn't listen carefully. "Sort of, he looked quite pitiful."  Chen Ge's neck was tightly choked by Wang Yicheng, their bodies pressed together, and he could feel Wang Yicheng's body temperature continuously dropping. "All his friends are dead, all dead!" The sound of dripping came from behind Chen Ge, and he felt his shoulder getting moist. Turning his head, he saw that his left shoulder had been soaked with blood. The bright red was somewhat glaring to the eyes.  "You..." Chen Ge shook Wang Yicheng off his back. The child flailed his hands helplessly, violently scratching at the air, with blood tears seeping from his tightly closed eyes: "Did you remember something?"  Revisiting the old place, Wang Yicheng's memory was triggered. He had not opened his eyes but realized what had happened just by hearing Chen Ge's words. "There's no escape. You agreed to that person; he will come to find you, no matter where you go, he will find you!" Wang Yicheng's voice changed greatly, he fell into madness, completely different from the cowardice and timidity he showed at the beginning.  "If he doesn't come looking for me, I will go looking for him. I'm the kind of person who likes making friends, in all sorts of ways." Chen Ge had many friends, but they were not with him, so he also wanted to make some new friends.  Blood seeped from Wang Yicheng's eyes and slid down his cheeks. His outer garment was dyed red, the bright blood blossoming like flowers on his skin. This seemingly frail boy actually had the potential to become a 'red-clothed.'  "I'm getting more and more interested in the master of the school, how exactly did he bring all of you into the door one by one." Chen Ge did not expect the few club members he had casually found to be extraordinary. There was an element of luck, but it also showed the terror of the ghost school from another perspective. A half-red-clothed alone was enough to support a normal two-star scene, and in the ghost school, Chen Ge had seen several beings who were red-clothed or suspected to be red-clothed.  "Are you constantly joking to cover up the panic inside?" Hearing Wang Yicheng say this, Chen Ge was even more certain that the other party had regained his memory. The previous Wang Yicheng was timid and weak, never raising objections, only blindly complying.  "I'm not joking. To have the despair to push open 'the door,' one must also once have had hope, even if that hope was long crumbled. I genuinely want to help him, and becoming his friend is just the first step." Chen Ge carried Wang Yicheng and walked out of the toilet: "Have you noticed that most of the kids in this school have a deformed childhood, or congenital physical defects, or their personalities become twisted due to some external factors, each of them has their own unbearable memories."  "What are you trying to say?" "I'm very curious about what the school master has experienced before. As the one who pushed the door, what kind of experience made him push open this 'door'?" "Agreeing to be his friend would mean being left behind forever. The school was not so big before, it became what it is now because of continuous addition of despair and pain."  After Wang Yicheng said this, the bleeding from his eyes stopped, but his body was still trembling continuously. "It seems you know a lot of things." Chen Ge felt that this school was very similar to his own haunted house, except the ghost school was constantly looking for those despairing students, or rather, attracting those children who exuded an aura of despair, while Chen Ge's haunted house was open to all comers: "This school has been around for many years, hasn't it?"  "What I can remember is that when I opened my eyes, I was here. I don't have Zhang Ju's experiences; I died in this school and was reborn here, forgetting many things, only knowing that the scale of this school has been expanding."  "Why are you here? Could it be Lin Sisi's punishment for you?" Chen Ge asked another question he was curious about. Wang Yicheng paused for a while before speaking: "I am the only one that Lin Sisi let go. The reason I came here is that after Lin Sisi disappeared, I became his substitute. The panic and unease of the classmates turned into violence against me, and one night when I was about to collapse, that door found me."  "And then you came in? According to what Zhang Ju said, the door would appear far away from where you sleep the first time, and then it gets closer to you every day..." Chen Ge did not finish speaking, as he was interrupted by Wang Yicheng.  "He was completely passive, but I was active. I wanted to find a corner to hide, and moreover..." Wang Yicheng hesitated for a long time and revealed another secret: "At that time, the hand that reached out of the door was smeared with various paints, it was Lin Sisi's hand. He was inviting me, and I wanted to apologize to him face to face. That day I actually reported to the teacher, but he didn't come."  "What else do you know about Lin Sisi and this door?" "Nothing more, after entering the door, I did not see Lin Sisi, I haven't seen him until today." Wang Yicheng released his hands: "You can put me down."  "Are you sure you're not lying?" Chen Ge put down Wang Yicheng: "At the entrance of the Western Campus toilet, as soon as your memory showed signs of loosening, the school's manager appeared immediately, and in the end, if I hadn't knocked you out, we might have been caught by now, your treatment is completely different from Zhang Ju and Zhu Long."  "Maybe it's because Lin Sisi was his friend, and I was Lin Sisi's friend." The group passed by seven cubicles in turn, recording the events that Lin Sisi had encountered, which the phone only captured a part of.  "I can't imagine what the door-pusher had experienced before." As they were about to leave the toilet, Chen Ge looked at the seventh cubicle: "It can be confirmed that the door is in the seventh cubicle, to understand the school master, just need to investigate all the incidents that happened in the toilets."  Based on the clues already obtained, Chen Ge is preparing to go to three places next—the school archive room, the school library, and the oil painting room in the experimental building that Zhou Tu promised. Chapter 819: They Are Here  There might be information about the school's master in the school's archives room, a mirror that leads to the blood-red world might be hidden in the library, and the oil painting room in the experimental building is where Chen Ge promised to take Zhou Tu.  "Where should we go first?" Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu: "I know the location of the art club, and I've seen the scenes in your dreams. I can take you there anytime now, but are you really prepared to awaken your memories?"  Zhou Tu hadn't communicated much with Chen Ge and was somewhat at a loss when suddenly asked this question.  Before regaining his memory, he had always wanted to know what he had forgotten, but after seeing the fates of Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng, he began to hesitate.  "Are you ready to face the past? Without regaining your memory, you are just an insignificant student in this school, you can live without worries, repeating a peaceful and beautiful day. Once you awaken your memory, you will definitely be pursued by the school's administrators, and there will be no turning back."  Chen Ge kept questioning Zhou Tu, which was also a test. Among all the club members, Zhou Tu was the most decisive.  "I've thought about it, and it's better to regain my memory. Without the past, no matter how comfortable life is, it's just deceiving oneself."  Zhou Tu's gaze moved to Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng: "I don't know if the real me will scare myself to tears."  "Maybe you should consider it a bit longer," Zhang Ju said with a hoarse voice, turning his burned face away. "There's something about you that makes me very uncomfortable. The real you must be a terrifying monster."  Zhou Tu was momentarily speechless and did not know how to respond. His gaze was elusive, and he seemed to waver again in his heart.  "Let's go to the school's archives room first. You still have enough time to think about it."  Chen Ge patted Zhou Tu's shoulder lightly: "Don't feel pressured. I respect whatever choice you make."  "Thank you."  Zhou Tu looked down in contemplation, while Zhang Ju nudged Chen Ge: "His true form must be terrifying. If he can regain his memory, whatever we want to do next will be easier."  "Everyone has their own choices. I won't interfere."  "Aren't you helping us regain our memories just to let us retrieve our pasts and increase our strength, and then help you achieve your own goals?" Zhang Ju was somewhat puzzled, clearly remembering what Chen Ge had said before, that everyone was just in a relationship of mutual assistance and use.  "I once read a phrase in a book, 'A rose does not ask why, nor does it ask for a return. It blooms simply because it blooms.' Although I can't be so selfless, at least I have experienced the pain you all have gone through, and seeing you reminds me of myself."  Chen Ge looked seriously at the other club members: "Also, there's another point I want to reiterate. Our relationship is not one of mutual use, but of mutual benefit. Respect for each other is just the foundation."  Listening to Chen Ge's voice, for a moment, all the ghosts seemed to forget that the man in front of them was just an ordinary person.  Maybe he just hadn't regained his memories yet.  Zhang Ju and Zhu Long nodded and followed Chen Ge's steps.  Wang Yicheng opened his eyes filled with blood and tears, seemingly agreeing more with Chen Ge.  Zhou Tu, walking at the back, seemed to be in deep thought, his gaze gradually becoming firm.  Returning to the corridor, Chen Ge had only taken a few steps when he felt something was not quite right.  There was a strong stench in the air, a smell he had encountered before in the experimental building.  A bad premonition arose in his heart, and the further Chen Ge walked, the more oppressed he felt, as if walking at the bottom of a lake, with coldness surging from all directions.  "Have those inverted monsters appeared again?"  Chen Ge didn't look down. What had happened had happened, and looking down would only disturb his judgment. What he needed was to get as far away from the teaching building as possible.  Standing with Zhang Ju, Chen Ge's pupils shrank, and he lowered his voice: "Do you see the monsters in the corridor?"  "Monsters?" Zhang Ju stared at the corridor, blood flowing down his coat: "It seems there is something, but they don't seem to be able to harm us."  Before he finished speaking, Zhang Ju saw his hair floating upwards, as if an invisible baby in the dark was pulling at his hair.  Small wounds began to appear on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng's bodies, and those monsters were attracted by the two of them.  "I can't see them, how are they causing me harm?" Zhang Ju's scarred face was bleeding, his blood fluttering around him. Although his memory had awakened, he had not yet learned how to use this power.  "As long as we invert our vision, we can see them, but I don't recommend you do that."  "Why?"  "Because after you see them, you will feel even more despair."  Chen Ge signaled everyone to immediately leave through the stairwell. Whether those monsters attacked Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng out of instinct or were directed by someone, if it was the latter, it would be more troublesome.  The stench around them grew stronger, and more wounds appeared on Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng's bodies. Notably, with each new wound on their bodies, a very thin black thread would burrow into their flesh, which looked very much like a curse.  Just as they ran to the third-floor corner, Wang Yicheng couldn't hold on any longer, his steps becoming weaker: "I feel like many things are tearing at my body, and my memory is becoming fuzzy again."  "Mr. Bai, the situation is not good, there seems to be more dirty stuff downstairs," Zhou Tu said softly. They had just reached the third floor when they smelled a pungent stench, and what was more eerie was that the smell came from right beside them.  Looking down, Zhou Tu saw the place beside him that emitted the stench, just like when he picked up a kitchen knife earlier, he looked up from below. In the empty space between him and Wang Yicheng, there was an inverted human face, the monster's outer clothing was tightly attached to the flesh, it seemed to have no skin, blood vessels surged under the clothes, blood and clothing stuck together, dyeing the whole garment bright red!  "Wang, Wang Yicheng, that thing is right in front of you!" Zhou Tu screamed. His memory had not yet awakened, and seeing such a scene, he was so frightened that he almost fell down the stairs.  "I told you not to look. Out of sight, out of mind."  Chen Ge picked up Wang Yicheng and stepped on the spot with the strongest stench, then ran downstairs.  Zhou Tu held his chest, the spot where Chen Ge stepped was precisely the head of the monster: "Okay, I understand."  As they descended to the second floor, the foul smell filled the corridor. Zhu Long, whose memory was loosening, also became a target of those monsters.  Zhang Ju could still withstand it, but Zhu Long and Wang Yicheng could not hold on any longer. They could only continue forward with the help of Chen Ge and Zhou Tu. Chapter 820: The Archives  Things were still heading in a worse direction. Zhou Tu also began to be targeted by the monster, and the first wound appeared on his fingers.  "Teacher Bai, what should we do now?" Chen Ge had no better solution. All he could do was clench his teeth. Even if everyone was torn and bitten by the monster and lost the ability to move, he would bring them all out.  A foul smell rushed into their nostrils, almost causing fainting. As Chen Ge, carrying Wang Yicheng, was about to approach the corner of the first floor, a sudden sharp pain erupted in his chest.  Staggering, Chen Ge almost fell to the ground.  He looked down and saw a sharp spike had pierced his chest.  "The curse of dormitory 413?" He immediately realized something and looked at his shadow.  The normally normal shadow was now twisting continuously, as if the "person" hiding inside was enduring great pain.  "Even he is being attacked?"   The club members had all reached their limits, covered in wounds, looking very frightening.  "The exit is right in front of us, don't stop!"  Chen Ge's will was very strong; he had long been accustomed to pain.  Pulling out the nail, Chen Ge desperately ran forward, knowing that even one more step taken meant he would be a little closer to hope.  "Thud!" Zhou Tu, carrying Zhu Long, fell on the stairs. His right hand was full of wounds, looking like it was about to split open.  "My hand that I use to draw and hold a pen..."  It was already very difficult for Chen Ge to bring one person out; bringing out a few more was simply impossible: "Hang on! We're almost at the first floor!"  Their legs felt like they were filled with lead, each step becoming heavy. The stench on the first floor was even stronger than on the second floor; there were more monsters waiting for them there.  Everyone except for Chen Ge had already despaired, but just then, the foul smell in the air suddenly faded a bit, as if someone had led some of the monsters away.  "Opportunity!" Chen Ge pulled up Zhou Tu, carrying Wang Yicheng, and sprinted with all his might. When he reached the first floor, he saw a dark figure standing at the other end of the corridor.  The figure's physique was very similar to Chang Gu, with a hint of scarlet light floating in his left eye, his outer garment soaked with fresh blood, and it seemed like he was holding something in his hand.  "Chang Gu?" Chen Ge called out directly, but the other party did not respond, turned away, and the stench in the corridor faded a bit more.  "Did he lead those monsters away?" The Chang Gu in Chen Ge's memory was timid and weak, which was very different from the figure he had just seen: "He only entered the door a few seconds earlier than me, what happened to him?"  That figure had led away most of the monsters, and Chen Ge hurriedly led the club members out of the teaching building.  "Teacher Bai, what was the deal with those monsters just now? Why could we only see them by reversing our vision? And why did they only attack Wang Yicheng and Zhang Ju, but not you?" Zhou Tu collapsed on the ground, feeling as if the stench had permeated his body.  "Those monsters should be used by the school to punish students; it's even possible that they were once students who had broken school rules."  Chen Ge hadn't expected those monsters to not even be afraid of the red-clothed ones; they had completely lost their reason and were a group of utter madmen.  "The schoolmaster wants to create a beautiful 'paradise' behind 'the door'; you all recalled the past, which goes against his original intention, so naturally, he will target you."  Chen Ge checked Wang Yicheng and Zhang Ju's bodies. The black threads had already drilled into their wounds, and near the wounds, one could faintly smell a faint stench: "Be careful, those monsters might want to turn you into one of them."  Standing outside the teaching building, Chen Ge used his Yin pupils to scan left and right but did not see the dark figure that had saved him in the end.  "If he really is Chang Gu, why doesn't he come to find me? Is it not yet time to meet? Or perhaps he has already been targeted?"  Chen Ge and Chang Gu had little interaction; he needed to guess Chang Gu's thoughts before he could make the right choice.  "It's good to have someone to distract for me."  Chen Ge helped up Wang Yicheng: "Let's go, we'll head to the office building now, the school archives should be there."  ...  The office building in the west campus was very close to the fence, and standing at the highest point of the office building, one could take in the entire east and west campuses.  "I've seen several types of monsters in this school: ordinary fierce ghosts and obsessions, ordinary red-clothed ones, the white-clothed, burnt managers in the west campus, and the monsters in the east campus with their heads down and emitting a stench. Besides them, the most dangerous ones are the teachers and dormitory managers of this school. We're going to the office building, and there's a high chance of encountering them, so everyone must be careful."  Knowing the risks, Chen Ge didn't hesitate to go toward danger, a situation he had encountered before, but it was somewhat uncomfortable for the other club members.  "Teacher Bai, aren't you also a teacher?"  "Do you guys think I'm not dangerous?" Without turning his head, Chen Ge casually said a word and took the lead into the office building.  He had been to the west campus office building before, but what he didn't expect was that the interior architectural styles of the office buildings in the east and west campuses were vastly different.  The office building in the west campus was clean and tidy, but upon entering the east campus office building, it felt very oppressive. The floor had not been cleaned for a long time, with mud footprints remaining, the walls were scratched, the originally white wall plaster had turned light yellow, and there were large patches of mold scars.  "Do the teachers in the east campus usually work in this place?" Zhou Tu couldn't quite believe it.  "In this school, the duty of teachers is not to educate you but to manage you. Most of their time is spent with students, and the office building is just a place with symbolic meaning."  Chen Ge tried to push open the door of an office, and it wasn't locked; it opened with a push.  The various facilities in the room were very old, looking like they were from many years ago.  "I've been here before; I know where the archives are." Zhang Ju said coldly, becoming more and more taciturn since retrieving his memory.  "When did you come here?" Zhou Tu was a bit afraid of the current Zhang Ju and unconsciously lowered his voice when speaking.  "Before I was deceived by Chang Wen Yu, in order to figure out what this school was all about, I had secretly come to the archives."  Zhang Ju walked in front: "Stick close to me. This place makes me very uncomfortable; there might be something very dangerous hidden."  Whether the monsters in the office building had sensed Zhang Ju in advance or for other reasons, they did not encounter danger along the way and smoothly arrived at the third floor of the office building.  "This is the archives room. We'll find what we want and leave immediately, don't stay too long. I always feel like there are other people in the building."  Zhang Ju opened the door to the archives room, which was filled with several rusty metal cabinets and four rows of wooden shelves. Chapter 821: The Fire!  The archive room was filled with a musty smell, and Chen Ge was the first to enter, covering his mouth and nose. The wooden bookshelves looked ancient, and when placed next to the rusty filing cabinets, there was an inexplicable sense of dissonance.  "These bookshelves and metal cabinets seem to be from different schools," Chen Ge commented as he casually took a document from the wooden shelf, but perhaps due to the poor storage conditions, the folder tore with just a little force.  "Bug-eaten, damp, these materials seem to have been completely neglected by the school authorities." Chen Ge carefully opened the damaged folder, and the contents puzzled him, "A donor thank you list? Why does this paper look familiar?"  Chen Ge looked over it again and again, and suddenly a scene flashed in his mind. He looked at the worm-eaten folder in surprise: "I seem to have seen a list like this in the principal's office of Mu Yang High School!"  He observed carefully, tried hard to remember, and was even more surprised when he compared the names of the donors. "It's exactly the same! I've seen this list in the principal's office of Mu Yang High School!"  Originally, he had entered Mu Yang High School several times in search of the old principal. He had turned the two-star horror scene upside down, but unfortunately, not even digging three feet deep revealed the old principal.  "The world behind the door is woven from the memories of the person who pushes it open. This school is special; it seems to be formed by the combined memories of everyone inside the door," Chen Ge pondered with his chin propped up. "Besides the old principal, everyone else from Mu Yang High School is in my haunted house. Does the appearance of Mu Yang High School's donor list here mean that the old principal might also be inside the school?"  Chen Ge's eyes widened as he looked at the musty bookshelf, and the more he looked at it, the more familiar it seemed: "Could these items have been moved from Mu Yang High School? Could a part of that two-star scene be hidden here?"  "It seems I really do have a fate with the old principal." He put the document back in its place, his expression enigmatic: "Before the Psychic Ghost School trial mission is unlocked, there are nine prerequisite tasks. Could all these nine prerequisite tasks have some special connection with the Psychic Ghost School?"  "Mr. Bai, have you discovered something?" came a voice.  "I have made some discoveries, but nothing is certain yet," Chen Ge replied as he pulled out another moldy archive, covered in mildew: "A survey of the school's surrounding environment?"  The place was called an archive room, but it was more like a storeroom for documents, containing all sorts of files and materials, including graduation projects, reimbursement bills, club statistics, cafeteria procurement catalogs, and so on.  "Mr. Bai!" Zhu Long pulled out several crumpled newspapers from a corner and handed one to Chen Ge: "Look at the big picture in that news article in the middle."  "The teaching building caught fire for unknown reasons, several students were trapped in the bathroom, and firefighters bravely entered the blaze to rescue them." This report was prominently placed in the center of the newspaper.  "Judging by the layout and content, the person who wrote this report should be quite young." Chen Ge took the newspaper, which was covered with mildew and stained, making many parts unclear: "This seems to be the school newspaper."  Mu Yang High School was just a private welfare institution; it didn't have the resources to start a school newspaper. After flipping through the papers, Chen Ge came across a familiar place name—West City Private Academy.  This place name appeared multiple times, with many reports revolving around West City Private Academy. "Isn't West City Private Academy the school where Zhang Ya is?" Chen Ge recalled the abandoned school where he had his first date with the girl in red.  It was also in that school that he had entered Zhang Ya's heart. "Was there a fire in the West City Private Academy teaching building?" Now thinking back, he remembered seeing burnt stair railings in the teaching building: "It's strange, not just West City Private Academy, including Mu Yang High School, all the abandoned schools I've visited bear traces of fire."  He looked over the newspaper Zhu Long gave him again. At the time, firefighters rescued six people from the bathroom on the top floor, and the newspaper praised the firefighters as heroes throughout the article.  But he also noticed a small article in the corner of the newspaper calling for everyone to learn summer fire prevention knowledge, which vaguely mentioned that a student had died in the fire.  "The fire started in the bathroom, but how could a fire start there? The fire broke out after the end of the students' evening self-study session, school was over, so why were those kids in the top floor bathroom?" Combining several reports, Chen Ge acutely sensed the issue: "The fire burned on the fourth floor, and at the time, only the bathroom had students. The firefighters saved six, but one student died in the fire, meaning there must have been seven people in the bathroom!"  The cause of the fire was now unclear, and there was no record of it in the documents and archives. The child who died in the fire seemed to have become taboo.  "Did such a thing happen at West City Private Academy? But I didn't feel anything 'abnormal' when I was there," Chen Ge wondered: "If the door of that bathroom was opened by the student who died in the fire, then he should be West City Private Academy's 'Door Pusher', but West City Private Academy became a three-star scene entirely because of Zhang Ya!"  Now that West City Private Academy has become part of the haunted house scene, Chen Ge was certain that Zhang Ya was the most terrifying presence in that school.  "All three-star scenes have a door, but West City Private Academy, although three-star, has no door." Chen Ge looked towards his shadow, silently chanting that name in his mind, repeatedly calling but getting no response.  "West City Private Academy was rated a three-star scene by the black phone entirely because of Zhang Ya. As far as I know, Zhang Ya never pushed open any door, and I didn't see a door when I went to West City Private Academy..."  Chen Ge's hand holding the newspaper slowly lowered, and he envisioned the figure in the red dress: "Zhang Ya, the door that should exist but disappeared, the Door Pusher..." These three terms in Chen Ge's mind connected into a line, and suddenly he thought of a possibility.  With wide-open eyes, Chen Ge took a deep breath: "Could it be that Zhang Ya ate the Door Pusher of West City Private Academy?"  Only this explanation could account for why Zhang Ya was so different, so outrageously powerful.  "What happens to a door after the Door Pusher is eaten?" Chen Ge speculated on various possibilities: "Because of her obsession, Zhang Ya did not become the 'Door Pusher', so the door missing its 'Door Pusher' should become uncontrollable like the door in Liwan Town, but in reality, that hasn't happened. That door only appears beside those desperate children's beds... Wait! Could it be seeking a new 'Door Pusher'?" Chapter 822: Endlessly Searching for Desperate Children  Chen Ge was startled by his own thoughts—a masterless door endlessly searching for desperate children, spending years of time, eventually turning itself into a four-star scene? This sounded too incredible, and Chen Ge forced himself to calm down.  "In the experimental building's painting room, there are thirteen easels set up, with a total of thirteen people painting. They are aware of the school's secret, blood reversed; they are likely the thirteen candidates the door has been searching for."  It's hard for a single person's power to support a four-star scene unless they surpass the 'Red Specter', but if multiple 'Red Specters' join forces, the outcome is unclear, after all, even he himself has never seen so many 'Red Specters' together.  "Thirteen, this number is truly unlucky." Chen Ge glanced at Zhou Tu. He had been looking for the art club and had even dreamed of the scene inside the painting room. This person should be one of those thirteen painters.  "The door must have selection criteria, Zhang Ju obviously does not meet the criteria, but Zhou Tu does."  Initially, Chen Ge didn't have high expectations for the painting room, but after his analysis, he changed his mind: "Zhou Tu's memory is the key."  Among the club members, Zhou Tu was the most special one, and now Chen Ge needed to prepare for two possibilities.  Zhou Tu regains his memory and tells everything to himself, or Zhou Tu regains his memory and becomes his enemy.  "This is a big fish; was I too casual with him before?" Chen Ge's eyes fixed on Zhou Tu, making him shiver.  "Mr. Bai, I'll go have a look over there."  Zhou Tu found an excuse and ran to the deepest part of the archives.  "Why run? The one who should be afraid is me."  Chen Ge continued searching in the room, and the surprises the archives room brought him were far from over.  Soon, Chen Ge found several reports on fire incidents in the archives room. Fire seemed to have a special meaning in this school, symbolizing both destruction and heralding rebirth.  "There was a fire at Muyang High School, and there are burn marks on the stairs. The school's predecessor was even a crematorium. Now I've discovered that a fire occurred at Xicheng Private Academy as well. Are these coincidences, or is there a deeper reason?"  Besides the fire reports, Chen Ge found several well-preserved student records at the bottom of a metal cabinet, two of which were very special.  One of the records bore the name Lin Sisi, along with evaluations from teachers and classmates.  Classmates were unwilling to befriend him, and teachers didn't bother with him. This child had no mother, and his father was a murderer. He had been adopted since he was young, but for some reason, he often ran away from foster homes, which was very troublesome.  In his view, the only person in the world who truly helped him was an intern at a welfare institute.  That just-graduated college student, despite his own life not yet settled, sponsored Lin Sisi to complete elementary school and even attended Lin Sisi's parent-teacher conference.  According to the teacher's comments, it was only when that intern was present that Lin Sisi's "hyperactivity" could improve somewhat.  The record did not have Lin Sisi's photo and specific information but retained a handwritten signature—Gu Youjia.  The entire record was tattered and moldy, full of wormholes, but only the guardian's signature was clean.  "Gu Youjia, Hengjiang Welfare Institute, if I can live to leave, I might go have a look."  Chen Ge murmured to himself, as if speaking intentionally for someone to hear.  He then turned his attention to another record he had picked out. This record's date was earlier than the others, it had no name written on it, nor any records, just one sentence.  "Endure a little longer, just endure a little longer, everything will get better. They can't bully me forever, one day, I too will grow up."  The writing on the record was crooked, not like a teacher's handwriting, but more like a child's own writing while their hand was injured.  "Endless tolerance only makes the abuser more aggressive, and this is true in any situation. Those who derive pleasure from violence will not empathize or reflect."  Chen Ge took a photo with Lin Sisi's phone and then put the record back in its place.  "The earliest record must have been left by the real 'door-pusher'. After opening the door, his temperament likely changed drastically, going to another extreme."  "If the 'door-pusher' eaten by Zhang Ya is him, then after his death, the door he opened is likely still doing certain things according to his will. If I want to increase my chances of surviving behind the door, it's best to follow his mindset."  School violence has never happened to Chen Ge; the closest he got to school violence was when he was in elementary school.  The teacher asked the children to bring toys they no longer played with to school, to be donated to the welfare institute.  Everyone had donated except Chen Ge, who clutched his backpack and remained silent.  Several of the naughtiest children in the class began to snatch little Chen Ge's backpack, and in the scuffle, they broke the zipper. As a result, a bloody intestine and a backpack full of severed fingers were scattered everywhere.  The lifelike severed fingers rolled around the classroom like chalk, and the bloody plastic intestine even twitched a few times on the desk, scaring all the students and the teacher who was walking over.  Later, when the vice principal came over, he specifically asked the homeroom teacher—what is the family background of this child?  That evening, Chen Ge's parents were called to the school and then taken away by the police for questioning for half a day.  To put it, Chen Ge was probably the only student who was bullied at school, resulting in his parents being questioned by the police.  However, there was a good side to the incident; at least after that, no peer dared to bully Chen Ge again.  "Never give in to school violence."  Chen Ge's words had another meaning: in this school, some victims had become new sources of violence.  The spirit-communicating ghost school was expanding continuously. That door, not stained red with blood, would approach all desperate children, turning them into part of the door, recreating their nightmares behind the door, using their souls as bricks to build a large grave to bury reality.  After searching in the archives room for a long time, until a familiar stench wafted to his nose, Chen Ge decisively led the other club members out of the office building.  "Teacher, we're lucky, those stinky monsters only came looking for us at the very end," Zhu Long whispered.  "It's not good luck, someone helped us distract those monsters."  Chen Ge was not sure if it was Chang Gu helping him, but he knew something was happening in this school, and those things were likely related to Chang Gu and his siblings.  "Let's go; next, we're heading to the experimental building."  Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu: "You should have made your decision by now, right?" Chapter 823: The Red Clothes Society  Memory is a difficult thing to describe. It's like snow that will never melt, and like a fleeting light, what you want to grasp cannot be grasped, and what you hope to forget cannot be forgotten. Zhou Tu had been troubled by that dream for a long time. He knew he was different, but he didn't dare to be sure, and he eventually fell into deep self-doubt.  It wasn't until this day that he met Chen Ge. This man was the first to affirm Zhou Tu. The dreams he had were all real. The experiences he had were not fictitious, but rather indelible memories etched deep in his mind.  Zhou Tu got the answer he wanted, but at the same time, he also fell into a dangerous vortex. He didn't know if following Chen Ge would lead to his destruction or his salvation.  "Have you thought it through?" Chen Ge stood in front of Zhou Tu and repeated.  "I..."  "If you really can't make up your mind, you can look at him."  Zhang Ju and Wang Yicheng suddenly came over. They stood on either side of Zhou Tu, sandwiching him in the middle: "Zhu Long, come over here."  The last to arrive, Zhu Long, was not in the right state. His gaze was very strange, as if burning with flames, and he was on the verge of collapsing into madness.  "What did you do to him?" Chen Ge looked at Zhu Long's left hand, which was holding a mobile phone, and the veins on that hand were bulging.  "We found a piece of incomplete news report in the archives. A courier who often loitered around the university disappeared at the school. After several days of investigation by the police, a body that was no longer in human form was found in the dissection room's storage area." Zhang Ju handed a few severely damaged newspapers to Chen Ge: "That unrecognizable body is him—Zhu Long."  The fabricated memories were shattered, and Zhu Long remembered a lot of things when he saw the newspaper.  Studying hard and finally getting into university was just his dream. The reality was too harsh to bear.  The girl he liked was both talented and diligent, admitted to the best medical university, while his grades were a mess, and he couldn't even afford the tuition for repeating a year.  His family was impoverished, the only relative he had was seriously ill, with their health deteriorating.  Fate struck him hard, but it did not bring down this young man. He began learning to take care of others, to support his family on his own.  When looking for a job, others thought he looked listless, so he tidied up his messy long hair. Others thought his tattoos would scare off customers, so he scraped off a layer of skin with a small knife. He was not defeated, and eventually found a job that belonged to him—a courier.  He was diligent, friendly, stubborn in his eyes, and always smiling. He lived with all his might, earning respect and material security through his own efforts.  After getting through the most difficult summer, he got used to the job. He worked late every day, and his only pleasure was to pick up some orders to send to Hanjiang Medical College.  Every time he entered the campus, he had a hint of hope in his heart. He knew that girl was in this school. Even if it was just a secret glance from afar, it would make him very satisfied and happy for the whole day.  The school was neither too big nor too small; it was uncertain when they would meet.  In his mind, he had imagined countless scenarios of meeting her, but when the girl really appeared, he realized that all his preparation and rehearsals were of no use. He was so nervous that he couldn't speak, like a child whose secret had been discovered.  After that day, they exchanged contact information. The girl was unexpectedly proactive, liking the feeling of control, while Zhu Long mistook it for admiration.  His compliance led to spiritual torment. The girl liked to torture Zhu Long, constantly reminding him—you are nothing.  The self-respect he worked so hard for was slowly crushed, and Zhu Long became the girl's puppet. What was worse, Zhu Long was completely unaware of it.  This simple-minded fool was no match for the girl who was a master of anatomy and criminal psychology.  He was like a lamb stripped of its wool, bare on the woman's plate, to be slaughtered at will.  In the end, the harm extended from the spiritual level to the physical level, and it wasn't until death approached that Zhu Long realized, but by then it was too late.  Blood flowed from wound after wound. Zhu Long held a pink mobile phone, his eyes fixed on the newspaper in Chen Ge's hand.  The floodgates of his memory were finally burst open under repeated stimulation.  "Do you know which part of the human body is pink?" Blood threads, like stitches, sewed up the skin. Zhu Long took one step at a time towards Chen Ge: "The flesh that is about to heal is the most tender and pink. She likes pink."  Zhu Long's body began to misalign. His body had many marks of needle and thread sewing, it was hard to imagine what he had gone through after death.  "Another half-red robe."  Chen Ge's gaze was unusually calm. When Zhu Long was only two steps away from him, he raised his hands and gently embraced Zhu Long: "I want you to understand something. No matter when, no matter for what reason, anything that harms you should not be allowed, even if it is named love."  Looking at the boy close at hand, Chen Ge felt a bit of heartache. He patted Zhu Long's shoulder: "I don't know what you're thinking right now, but I can assure you, if we can leave this school, I will let you see that girl again."  The blood threads moving through Zhu Long's flesh suddenly paused. Zhu Long looked directly at Chen Ge, then slowly lowered his head: "It's a promise."  Clutching the pink mobile phone, Zhu Long silently retreated behind Chen Ge.  Zhu Long and Zhang Ju's outer clothes were still becoming redder. Even if they were not red robes, they were top-tier half-red robes. Adding Wang Yicheng to the mix, Chen Ge wasn't too afraid to face an ordinary red robe at this moment.  "We can go to the laboratory building now." Chen Ge no longer asked Zhou Tu. He had already gotten the answer from the other's eyes.  After seeing Zhu Long's state, the boy dug his nails into his flesh. He must also have unfulfilled wishes, only that he had forgotten what those wishes were.  Passing through the shrubs, Chen Ge led the club members to the laboratory building, his second visit of the night.  "That red robe should still be in the duty room. If we encounter him, we can return his clothes to him." Chen Ge spoke with much more confidence. He led the students to stop outside the building.  "This building is the nest of those upside-down body monsters. The art club we want to visit is on the fourth floor. After we check that room, regardless of whether Zhou Tu's memory has awakened, we must immediately evacuate."  Chen Ge took the lead to a window of a room on the first floor: "Now, follow me up."  The students looked at each other, then saw Chen Ge easily climb up to the second floor.  "I told you he must be a PE teacher."  Zhang Ju, Zhu Long, and Wang Yicheng had all awakened their memories. Climbing a building was nothing for a ghost, only Zhou Tu looked troubled.
