Chapter 455: Reversal 3  "This is to let you experience the fluctuation of aura; it's really very simple," another sorcerer nearby couldn't help but laugh and interject.  "Then please," Lin Sheng nodded.  He needed to find the other fragments at the fastest speed. Originally, he was planning to conquer more evil spirits and obtain more pure soul power.  However, now that he has encountered such an opportunity, the fastest way to get it in hand is the best approach.  Soon, the sorcerer elder led Lin Sheng to stand in front of a gate of evil spirits.  The two stretched out their hands and gently touched the frame of the gate of evil spirits, closing their eyes.  The sorcerer elder quickly used his special abilities to start building a spatial baseplate as a coordinate confirmation.  Then, following the ritual fluctuations of the gate of evil spirits, he carried Lin Sheng's perceptive consciousness and emitted it together with the ritual fluctuations.  "Ordinary teleportation gate rituals are point-to-point directional teleportations."  "But when we generally explore other space secrets, we change this point-to-point into point-to-many. This only requires a little modification of some small parameters on the teleportation baseplate."  The sorcerer elder led Lin Sheng's consciousness while teaching him the relevant techniques.  "In this way, the gate of evil spirits will spontaneously transmit our consciousness to the possible places of many similar target spaces. This is actually using energy to take a chance; with good luck, we can immediately hit the space secret we want, but with bad luck, we have to waste energy and try a few more times."  "That's quite random," Lin Sheng was speechless.  Once his perception entered the gate of evil spirits, it was immediately scattered and emitted by the ritual fluctuations within.  At the same time, it was as if his consciousness had split, dividing the perceptive consciousness into more than ten parts, simultaneously sensing more than ten completely different space auras.  "Generally speaking, it's very difficult for our consciousness to maintain integrity during the transmission process, so we can only try to remember the space coordinates that the main consciousness has come into contact with. The memory of the coordinates requires us to leave a simple marker..."  The sorcerer elder outside was still explaining in a low voice, guiding Lin Sheng and teaching him how to make a simple marker to determine the coordinate code.  But he had no idea that Lin Sheng's soul consciousness was so strong and resilient that after being split, he could remember the coordinates of all the spaces his more than ten consciousnesses had touched.  It was just a matter of multitasking with more than ten focuses. For Lin Sheng who could multitask with N focuses in his soul consciousness, this was nothing. He practiced the skill of multitasking with dozens of focuses every day.  He could control and observe each summoned creature through the divided soul consciousness.  So now, although he could not control many summoned creatures to act independently at the same time, he could easily remember the fluctuations of aura and establish coordinates separately.  Moreover, his soul was more resilient than ordinary people and had existed for a longer time.  This was still very easy for him.  Ten minutes later. The consciousness was exhausted and dissipated.  Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked towards the sorcerer elder and the others.  "Set the coordinates for this space secret," he immediately said one of the special space secret coordinates under the astonished gaze of the sorcerer elder and others.  This space secret, which had the same origin as the fragment of the Yin to Evil Wheel in his arms, was exactly what Lin Sheng had perceived.  "Was it a success in one go?" The sorcerer elder felt a bit bitter in his heart. When he first sensed the aura of space, confirmed the coordinates, and recorded them, it took him a full half a month to succeed.  "It's a simple operation. Start it, establish the teleportation gate. I want to go over," Lin Sheng instructed.  "Yes."  "Wait, my body," the soul transmission of Tian Gongxia made Lin Sheng's actions pause.  "What is it?" he watched the sorcerer elder and others start to instruct the evil spirits to move the material resources over, walking aside to wait, and meanwhile communicating with Tian Gongxia in his mind.  "There's a situation here. A big change has occurred on Bisha Island!" Tian Gongxia's tone was somewhat solemn.  This was a sign Lin Sheng had never seen before.  It should be noted that even when he told Tian Gongxia about the existence of the King of Night, he had never seen her so serious.  This gave him a sense of unusual tension.  "Miyue should be at an absolute disadvantage, right?" Lin Sheng frowned and asked.  "Or has new combat power joined?"  "No, it's not new combat power," Tian Gongxia said seriously.  "Miyue deceived everyone! Qiluo Tower has already been successfully summoned. He has already succeeded in summoning Farudo! Using himself as a sacrifice, he has merged with it!"  Lin Sheng's consciousness froze for a moment.  "Using himself as a sacrifice?... This madman!"  "So, what we're facing now in the three great secret realms is the merged monster of Miyue and Farudo..."  Lin Sheng was at a loss for words.  "What should we do now?" Tian Gongxia asked gravely.  The combination of Farudo and Miyue was not as simple as one plus one equals two but rather a result of three times ten.  "Don't be agitated. For Miyue and Farudo, the biggest enemies are still the three great secret realms and many other major forces. Plus, this world is not as simple as you think," Lin Sheng recalled the information he had investigated before.  "The Big Star Pool and those with the divine artifacts of fate are all not simple characters. As long as they don't provoke us, we can't be bothered with how they develop."  "I understand what you mean. But it's best to prepare early," Tian Gongxia reminded.  "I've had that level of destructive power before. It was during the period when I was controlled by the demonic sword. So I know very well what kind of outcome that level of power can lead to."  Lin Sheng was silent.  Among all his lieutenants, Tian Gongxia was the most special one.  Because Tian Gongxia had once been influenced and controlled by some peculiarly powerful existence.  At that time, even in her memory recall, she had noticed Lin Sheng's peering.  Just a mark of an image in memory could discover Lin Sheng who was peering into the memory.  Such power had already exceeded Lin Sheng's understanding.  "I understand," Lin Sheng replied again.  "I will be prepared. Don't worry."  At worst, he would activate the strongest special state, summon all the lieutenants' power, and merge it into himself.  After disconnecting from Tian Gongxia, Lin Sheng quietly stared at the newly constructed evil spirit gate.  His thoughts returned to the original plan.  "It's ready. Your Excellency," the sorcerer elder said in a low voice.  Lin Sheng stared at the teleportation gate, silent for a moment.  "Call the Fairy King over. Also, Degaal!"  "Here."  Degaal's magic hand had already arrived nearby and was waiting.  Hearing the summon, he immediately walked in from the doorway.  "Your Excellency, I am at your command," Degaal's magic hand said.  Lin Sheng nodded.  "I will open multiple teleportation gates at the same time to explore multiple evil spirit spaces."  "Select one hundred great evil spirits, divide them into different numbered teams, and explore separately."  "Understood!" Degaal's magic hand felt solemn, knowing that perhaps his Excellency had encountered some turning point.  Otherwise, he wouldn't suddenly undertake such an urgent large-scale exploration. Chapter 456: Moving Forward  1. Following Lin Sheng's instructions, they set out to explore the various secret worlds. After receiving the order, Degar's Demon Hand quickly went down to dispatch the troops. On the other side, the sorcerers also sent a message to the Fairy King, starting to gather forces.  Soon, the Fairy King, accompanied by several elite messengers, stepped out from one of the Gates of Evil Spirits. "Your Excellency, what are your commands?" Standing in front of Lin Sheng, this being with a perfect figure yet only one eye on her face bowed.  "I need the Fairy Empire to send a slave army to explore the new spatial secret realms. Arrange the exploration however you see fit; I only want the results." Lin Sheng knew he couldn't be as rough with the Fairy Empire as he could with the Evil Spirit race. The Fairy Empire had largely become a race that was a combination of fairies and humans. Their emotions and bonds were deeper. Giving them the task and asking only for results was the best approach. Let them accomplish the objective in their own way.  "Your subordinate obeys," the Fairy King said calmly. Compared to Degar's side, she undoubtedly had more methods to explore the new spaces with minimal damage.  After instructing the Fairy King and Degar's Demon Hand, Lin Sheng quickly sensed the new spatial secret realms, continuously searching for spaces that might contain fragments of a certain essence. Sensing, determining coordinates, then opening, establishing portals, and dispatching troops to explore.  One portal after another was opened in the square. Time slowly passed. Massive armies of Evil Spirits and the Fairy Empire's troops set out. They were first teleported here and then flowed toward other secret realms.  A vast amount of teleportation resources were consumed, and various materials were used as consumables. Following this, an incessant stream of over ten thousand Evil Spirits and Fairy Empire troops set out into the various opened portals.  Several days later. Some of these portals were canceled because Lin Sheng determined they were worthless during the exploration. Others were kept due to their richness in resources or research value, among other reasons.  Lin Sheng found three realms that definitely contained the essence of the fragments. He sent a large number of troops to these three realms for a detailed exploration and investigation. The feedback from the troops indicated that the spaces on the other side were relatively vast and complete, with intelligent life activities.  After some thought, Lin Sheng decided that he couldn't trust his subordinates to find such divine-level treasures. If they found them and kept them for themselves, that would be a real loss. So after a moment of deliberation, he decided to first let his people investigate the information and environment of those spaces, and then he would personally enter. He aimed to quickly find the fragments and leave with them once he obtained them.  ..............................  ..............................  Bisaga Island.  "Soul Gaze." Millie, or rather Farudo, raised his head as numerous dense gray tentacles grew from his back, forming a giant human face. The face was covered with hundreds of red eyes. The eyes fixated on several fleeing Lieutenants.  Hum! An invisible fluctuation followed a mysterious channel, instantly crossing thousands of meters, and precisely landed on the bodies of the fleeing Lieutenants.  "No!!!" One of them screamed in terror as layers of protection around him popped like soap bubbles. Once the protections were gone, his body twisted and deformed rapidly under the effect of a mysterious force field.  Boom! In an instant, this family head from Oro Hell's Flames twisted like a pretzel, and with a crackling sound, his body was severed into pieces and scattered, falling into the sea. Seeing this, the others fled even faster without a word. They were beyond the point where they could overcome this by sheer numbers. No matter how many more came, it would just be delivering themselves to their deaths.  Farudo had reached a higher realm than the Lieutenants. Without power on the same level, they would be marching to their deaths by facing him.  "Black Hand." Farudo opened his mouth, and a pitch-black shadowy arm extended from it, reaching towards the escaping individuals.  Plop, plop! Two Lieutenants, like lambs to the slaughter, burst into a spray of blood with light sounds and fell into the sea below.  On Bisaga Island, blood and chunks of flesh were scattered everywhere. The last burst of power from the dying Lieutenants had left the island in utter ruin. The ground of the entire island had been blown away layer by layer, and its altitude had dropped by more than ten meters.  Farudo stepped on the white flag of the Heaven's Tower on the ground, glancing at the strongest of the Heaven's Tower, the golden-armored white-winged man, and the red angel, who had been turned into mummies by his absorption of their life force.  "What a pity. In the end, I am the winner," he said, with a mysterious smile on his almost-rotted face.  "Do you think... you've... won?" From a protruding rock formation in the distance, an old man nailed to it, covered in blood, spoke with a heavy voice.  "You're not dead yet?" Farudo raised an eyebrow, looking at the old man. "Xi Ji, if you hadn't meddled in this mess, you wouldn't have ended up like this."  He had merged with Millie's memories, and in fact, he was now a human amalgamation of Millie and Farudo. Naturally, he retained Millie's personality and emotions. In reality, he wasn't the complete Farudo, but rather a spokesperson.  "Heh... I lost this time... but this world is not as simple as you think. Just wait, someone will avenge me. Just wait..."  The old man spoke coldly. "I'm looking forward to it," Farudo said as he reached out his hand. At the same time, a giant grey arm automatically condensed behind him, grabbed the old man fiercely, and squeezed.  Pop! A burst of blood spattered from the grey palm. "It's such a pity. One less old friend..." Farudo looked up with a sigh, feigning lament.  Around him, not a single intact body of the Lieutenants from Oro Hell's Flames remained.  While he was pretending to lament, an invisible, silent silver spike shot out from behind him, aimed directly at the back of his head. The one holding the spike was the strongest of the Blank Paper, Solar Crowned Kesha. His face was pale, evidently, he had been seriously injured in the chaos that had just occurred.  He had successfully hidden himself, but at this moment, the entire surroundings of Bisaga Island were enveloped and suppressed by a powerful red ring force field. Any contact with the edge of the force field would reveal his presence.  With his current strength, at his peak, he could barely withstand a casual blow from Farudo. If he couldn't hide afterward, certain death awaited him. So he had no choice but to return and look for an opportunity.  "Soul Piercer... Just one hit, regardless of injury, can stun a living being's soul for a day," Kesha thought grimly, knowing that if he didn't suppress Farudo quickly, he would have no chance of escaping safely.  Instead of sitting and waiting for death, he chose to strike back!  His Lieutenant ability was to conceal his aura and life fluctuations. This ability allowed him to hide in an invisible interstitial dimension. Only during an attack would his presence be revealed. This was also one of his biggest reliances on being the strongest of the Solar Crown.  The silver spike inched closer to the back of Farudo's head.  Five meters. Three meters. Two meters. One meter.  Suddenly, the spike accelerated, thrusting forward. "Curse Word: Intimidate!" Farudo suddenly uttered.  Shhh! A ring of pure gray shockwaves spread out from his body in all directions. Chapter 457: Moving Forward 2  The ripples carried an extremely strong sense of shock, and almost in an instant, they pushed away the star behind Faraldo.   "Curse Words - Tenacity." "Curse Words - Spirit Binding." "Curse Words - Suffocation." "High Order Killing Intent Shackles." "High Order Death Gaze." "Ultimate Enhanced Extreme Flame Demon Blade."  As Faraldo unleashed a series of magical words, dense and numerous colorful spiritual lights burst and flashed upon him.  At the same time, a series of oddly shaped magical word effects exploded upon the star.   Bindings, soul suppression, death gaze, ultra-high-temperature flame damage, air deprivation, mental intimidation, and so on.  A series of high-level demonic powers, which normally would require at least a day to prepare, were as simple as ordinary tricks in Faraldo's hands, easily cast through spoken words.  By the time the star regained his senses, he could only resist and neutralize two of the magical word effects, and there was no way to deal with the rest.  Layers of magical word effects perfectly bound and wrapped him up, turning him into an immobile gray-black giant rice dumpling.  Pfft!  Without any nonsense, Faraldo stretched out his right hand and pierced through the star's brow.   His hand, like a sharp knife, easily entered the star's skull, shattering and mashing his brain.  Boom!!  The moment the star died, as a ranked envoy, the huge energy aggregated in his body suddenly exploded, turning into a fiery light and suddenly enveloping Faraldo within.  The red flames quickly dissipated, revealing an unharmed Faraldo.  He looked up and gazed into the distance at the numerous warships that were rapidly turning to flee.  "Next, as long as I open three different underworld passages, my true body can completely descend here. At the same time, the hand of the netherworld can also be resurrected ahead of time."  "...Struggle, let me feel more surprises... Otherwise, it would be too dull for having been bored for so many years, wouldn't it?"  With a step forward, Faraldo softly recited a magical word.  "Curse Words - Swift Movement."  Whoosh!  His body instantly turned into a gray light, shooting out like a meteor, charging towards the warships.  ................ ................  Unknown secret world.  On the vast white snowy plains, tens of thousands of evil spirit armies were crazily battling against the opposing centaur army.  The blood of the centaurs dyed the originally pure white snow.  The evil spirits' natural immunity to physical attacks meant they could only be harmed by a small number of energy weapons.  Only one-third of the centaur army had such energy weapons.  And this was already the peak power of this secret world.  Lin Sheng rode a demon-like colossal warhorse, Blood Demon. Clad in heavy pure white armor, he stood silently on a hill, overlooking the battlefield below.  His face was covered by a mask, his expression unclear, but his eyes revealed a trace of indifference and coldness.  "Have you found what I was looking for?" he suddenly asked in a deep voice.  "It's found. The tailbone chieftain had it secretly hung on the ankle of his second son, which I discovered and immediately took down."  The Fairy King's figure suddenly appeared, kneeling on one knee to Lin Sheng's right.  In her hands, she held up a platinum-colored bone that looked like a ghost face or a symbolic text.  The palm-sized, curved bone had fine cracks on the surface, as if it had suffered significant damage.  Lin Sheng grabbed it, closing his eyes to feel the heartbeat-like pulsation on it.  "This is it."  He clenched the bone, then cast a final glance at the centaur tribe fighting desperately below.  The Misher tribe, a powerful force that once dominated this secret world, was brutally suppressed by the evil spirit army simply for refusing to give up what he wanted.  "Let them submit and surrender, those who are unwilling, deal with them," Lin Sheng left these words behind and rode away.  The remaining leaders of the Fairy Empire knelt on one knee, respectfully seeing him off.  In just four days.  Lin Sheng had continuously flattened eleven different secret spaces.  These spaces varied in size, with the largest being as big as a province in Miga, while the smallest was only as large as the city of Hengruika.  However, the number of powerful beings hidden within them was not small.  The most resistant among them was the centaur tribe that ruled over the human-horse secret space.  The white snowy plains were all under the dominion of this powerful tribe.  They had been invincible for too long, having forgotten how to treat those stronger than themselves, completely lacking the respect they should have.  Thus, when Lin Sheng's envoys arrived here, contradictions and conflicts began to unfold.  After Lin Sheng's envoys were mercilessly beheaded.  Under Lin Sheng's command, the evil spirit armies gathered and surged into this white snowy plains secret space.  The arrogant Misher tribe finally tasted the bitter fruit of defeat.  And the price was nearly the annihilation of their tribe.  Two days later, the strongest of the Misher tribe, Centaur King Kul · Warlance, visited the evil spirit palace with sorrow and pain to meet Lin Sheng, who sat upon the throne.  His tribe had been slaughtered, with only the last branch of bloodline remaining.  Under such circumstances, he, who was originally most passionate about cultivation and battle, had to take on a heavy responsibility at the moment of crisis, become the new king, and join Lin Sheng's ranks in exchange for clemency for the centaur race.  Like the Fairy King, in order to protect the last bloodline and heritage of his race, he had to seek compromise and join Lin Sheng's ranks, becoming one of his minions.  From then on, Lin Sheng's subordinates included the Fairy King, the Centaur King, and the Dejarl Demon Hand, three great legion commanders.  They each represented the powerful forces of three different races.  Both the Fairy King and the Centaur King were truly powerful beings who had reached the level of ranked envoys.  ............ ............  As Lin Sheng was mustering troops and scavenging for the Yin Zhuan Evil Wheel fragments, in reality.  Faraldo also truly committed a huge atrocity that shocked the world.  After crushing and killing most of the ranked envoys, Miyazuki, or rather Faraldo, also caught up with the World United Fleet and personally initiated a terrifying massacre.  And it was not just a simple killing.  Instead, he used a large-scale sinking curse word to freeze and sink eighteen warships, with a total of more than thirty thousand people, near Bishaga Island in the vast ocean.  These frozen soldiers did not die but were physically immobilized, their spirits only able to sink to the bottom of the sea, gradually falling into madness amidst the endless silence and desolation.  Boom!!!  Above the blue sea, a half-formed gray smoke figure appeared behind Faraldo.  The figure raised its right arm and caught a giant long-barreled missile falling from the sky.  The white intercontinental missile continuously emitted huge high-temperature orange flames, exerting an unimaginable force trying to break through the gray figure's hand.  At the same time, a diamond-shaped green crystal was embedded at the top of the missile.  The crystal flickered with a large amount of demonic energy, providing even more terrifying momentum to the missile.  But it was to no avail.  Faraldo's hand tightened.  Squeak.  The more than ten-meter-long white intercontinental missile, like a lump of scrap metal, was twisted and mashed into a lump in his palm.  Various liquids and powders leaked out, scattered over the sea's surface, without any signs of explosion or combustion.  As if some strange force was suppressing the missile's explosion. Chapter 458: Moving Forward 3  Boom boom boom boom boom!!! Amidst the thunderous cannonade, a dense barrage of shells rained down on Phaludo from afar like droplets of water.  "Curse Speech: Reflect." Phaludo pointed with his hand raised.  A huge square gray barrier suddenly emerged in front of him. The surface of the barrier was etched with patterns resembling maggots, with a large lion's head in the center. The ends of all the maggots were connected and fused with the lion's mane.  Boom boom boom boom!! In an instant, all the fel cannonballs hit the barrier and then paused for a moment before being sharply reflected back.  All the cannonballs returned along their original trajectory.  Boom!! Explosions and flashes of fire could be heard in succession from the distant sea, and distant roars of infuriated fel users shouting to abandon ship could be heard.  Phaludo gazed into the distance from where the cannonballs had come.  "The nearest place is Redion. Then let's head to Heaven's Tower first." He smiled, tapped his foot lightly, and suddenly the seawater exploded, forming a huge swirling vortex that rapidly spun.  In the instant the water splashed, Phaludo had already disappeared from his original spot.  .............  .............  Evil Spirit Palace.  Click.  Lin Sheng gently placed the white-gold bone on the black crystal column.  Something miraculous happened. The white-gold bone actually began to change its shape autonomously, fitting tightly onto the black crystal column. The crystal column itself also began to slowly deform, becoming thinner and wider. Its edges gradually evolved into sharp and thin blades.  In less than ten seconds. This originally rough black crystal column had transformed into a wide-blade, black greatsword over two meters long. The hilt of the greatsword was made from the transmuted white-gold bone, and the blade was pitch-black, without luster, and extremely rough. At a glance, it looked like the most common style of a heavy-backed cleaver.  Lin Sheng reached out to grasp the hilt and lifted it. Buzz. The blade began to tremble violently, emitting a sound like a tuning fork.  "Having fused two fragments, it's starting to reveal its true form, isn't it?" In the dim palace, Lin Sheng gently stroked the weapon fused from the fragments of the Yin Turn Evil Wheel. He could feel that this was not the true form of the Yin Turn Evil Wheel.  "Judging by the gaps in the fluctuation of the aura on this, at least two more fragments are needed to fully reconstruct the Yin Turn Evil Wheel." Lin Sheng lifted the greatsword in front of him with both hands supporting it.  "Just one more fragment, and it feels like it could activate its initial power."  The Yin Turn Evil Wheel, one of the strongest artifacts ever known in the Evil Spirit Realm, was said to grant its holder the power to control the entire Evil Spirit Realm and become the supreme overlord.  Although Lin Sheng did not believe the legend that the holder could dominate everything, he was still greatly coveted by the Yin Turn Evil Wheel, which was said to possess many various Evil Spirit abilities.  He sat in his seat, gently caressing the greatsword in his hand, carefully feeling the mysterious and hidden powerful energy flowing within.  "It's close... so close... The third fragment will soon be found. The secret world where the third fragment lies, I have already predetermined it. Just go and get it."  Lin Sheng's expression was calm, but his heart was full of anticipation.  At this moment, the Centaur King and the Fairy King had already gone to the world of the third fragment, to conquer this most difficult and vast space.  Lin Sheng quietly waited for the good news to arrive. With two high-ranking beings like the Centaur King and the Fairy King, dealing with a secret world should not pose a problem.  Before he could carefully study the fused greatsword in his hands, a messenger officer led a half-bodied Evil Spirit soldier rushing into the hall.  "Your Highness, something has happened!" The messenger officer's face was grave as he handed Lin Sheng a black scroll.  Lin Sheng took the scroll, shook it lightly, and it immediately exploded, turning into countless green light spots.  "Is it the Fairy King's Shadow Recording Technique?" He furrowed his brows slightly. This kind of long-distance shadow recording scroll was very precious and could passively record a lot of key important information. Generally, it would only be activated when the holder was seriously injured, recording the critical moment at that time.  He was unclear about what had happened. But since the shadow recording scroll had been activated, it must mean that a formidable enemy had appeared.  Soon, the light spots from the scroll converged, forming a triangular screen. The screen began to slowly display the scenes that had taken place before.  In a wide hall with white columns, a tall black giant wearing golden bracers was roaring and fighting fiercely with the Fairy King.  The black giant wore a black metal vest with extreme defense, and each punch and kick he threw exploded with tremendous concussive force. The floor of the hall was continuously pitted with holes.  The Fairy King was resisting head-on, clashing, but as time went by, she was slowly losing ground.  On the other side, the Centaur King, with a giant spear in hand, was clashing hard with a white giant with a human upper body and a fish tail.  The Centaur King had already entered a berserk state; this was his giant form when his combat power was fully unleashed. His already large frame, more than twice the size of a human's, had grown to over five meters tall and three meters wide after becoming a giant, resembling a towering mound of flesh.  However, the opponent of the Centaur King was also not to be underestimated.  The white giant with a human upper body and fish tail was also over four meters tall. Every swing of his trident brought fierce wind tornadoes. The gray tornadoes continuously bombarded the Centaur King, disrupting his attacks and defenses, greatly restraining the Centaur King from unleashing his killing power.  "While conquering the secret world you ordered, the two legion commanders discovered this hall of giants. Inside, there are two Giant Kings, who are the two top powerhouses ruling the entire secret world." The messenger, a half-transparent Evil Spirit with a snake's head, now spoke solemnly, adding a chilling atmosphere to the palace.  "Giant Kings?" Lin Sheng gently stroked the hilt of the greatsword, pondering.  "Yes, through translation of the Evil Spirit language there, the natives indeed call them the Twin Giants Kings," the snake-headed Evil Spirit replied.  "So, that place is also part of the Evil Spirit Realm? Including the Twin Kings, they are all Evil Spirits?" Lin Sheng immediately understood.  "Yes."  Lin Sheng fell silent for a moment, then lifted the greatsword and stood up.  He walked out of the palace and arrived at the teleportation gate area in front of the main gate. Most of the teleportation gates had been replaced by Evil Spirits under the command of the Djall Magic Hand.  Only the secret worlds that had not yet been conquered were still guarded by space sorcerers from the Fairy Empire.  Hiss... Just as he stepped onto the space, a slim figure stumbled out from the last teleportation gate. It was the Fairy King, clad in tattered green armor.  As soon as she stepped out of the teleportation gate, her body wavered, nearly collapsing to the ground. Luckily, a space sorcerer nearby quickly supported her.  "Your Majesty!" A group of space sorcerers from the Fairy Empire hurriedly approached and called out anxiously.  The Fairy Empire was different from other Evil Spirit races; they had a high sense of belonging and recognition for their ruler, the Fairy King.  Lin Sheng raised his hand, and a beam of pure white holy power enveloped the Fairy King, beginning to rapidly heal her wounds.  Only then did he notice that the Fairy King's right arm had been cleanly severed, leaving just a bare wound.  "Your Highness... I have failed your trust..." The Fairy King kneeled on one knee towards Lin Sheng with an expressionless face.  Lin Sheng looked at her, silent. Regardless of whether the Fairy King had truly exerted herself, at least her injuries made it impossible for anyone to criticize her, and it was not appropriate to reprimand her further.  After a moment of silence.  Suddenly, the red-haired figure of Tian Gongxia emerged from one of the teleportation gates.  "Come with me." He looked at Tian Gongxia.  "Alright."  The two of them, one after the other, passed by the Fairy King and stepped into the teleportation gate. Following them were also the Evil Spirit King's guards and high-ranking Evil Spirits like Djall Magic Hand.  With the Evil Spirit King personally taking action, these close guards would face unpredictable consequences if they did not follow. Chapter 459: The Chase 1. The Realm of the Giant Evil Spirits.  Ahhhh!!! The Centaur King roared furiously as he smashed his spear against the weapon in the hands of the Merfolk Giant. Behind the Merfolk Giant, an even larger cyclone had condensed, the grey tornado forming a strong pulling force, like fine threads, constantly restraining the Centaur King from all directions.  "Burning Blood Spear!! Kill!" The spear in the Centaur King's hand suddenly transformed from pure black to silver, and the tip of the spear lit up with a sharp and dazzling white light, thrusting forward.  Boom!! This thrust was once again blocked by the Merfolk Giant wielding a trident. The power and speed of the spear were severely interfered with by the tornado, becoming increasingly slow and blunt.  The Centaur King tried to retreat several times, but the gaze of another black giant king not far away made him dare not show any signs of backing down. He remembered that this black giant was previously engaged in a fierce battle with the Fairy King, and unexpectedly, he had now left the battle and come here.  Obviously, the Fairy King was either defeated or had fled. "Damn it!! This damned one-eyed woman!!" He angrily swung the giant spear, his powerful ability as the Centaur King made him stronger and faster the angrier he became.  Therefore, his actual combat strength was considered the best among all Centaur Kings in history. At this moment, his rage was like flames rolling fiercely, and the power and speed of the Centaur King were almost more than double than usual.  He was completely suppressing the Merfolk Giant across from him. But whenever he wanted to buffer time for a big move, he was immediately threatened by the black giant's gaze, preventing him from gathering strength.  This frustrating situation had already lasted for two to three minutes. The Centaur King already felt his rage subsiding. Fury could indeed greatly enhance speed and strength, but the price was the rapid consumption of his physical and mental energy, and it was a proportional consumption.  "No! It can't go on like this! I must find a way to turn things around!" While swinging his giant spear to suppress the opponent, the Centaur King secretly surveyed his surroundings, looking for a chance to escape.  But the evil spirit army he had brought was already mostly wiped out by the barbarians in the Giant King's palace. These elite barbarians were dressed in rough capes and armor, wielding either hammers or giant bone knives in their hands.  Before each swing of their weapons, they would let out a loud shout, unleashing a strange vibrational power. It was the same vibrational power as that of the black giant. This power could penetrate the surface and destroy the internal core, which was very astonishing.  The evil spirits were shaken by this power, their core weaknesses were found, and they were killed one by one. "If this continues, I will die here!" The Centaur King became more and more anxious.  But no matter what he did, the Merfolk Giant on the opposite side stuck to him closely. If he retreated, the opponent advanced. If he advanced, the opponent retreated.  It seemed the two giants were trying to exhaust his strength, aiming to take him down without damage. "Damn it, damn it, damn it!!! Aaahhhhh!!!"  The rage in the Centaur King's heart grew even more intense. But as strong as his fury was, after burning for so long, his body became less and less able to bear it.  "You scum! Do you think you can kill me? Kill the great Centaur King Kurl War Spear??!!" "I will let you know the price of mocking me!!" The Centaur King swung his giant spear with all his might.  The thick war spear whistled through the air, instantly severing all the threads of pulling force emitted by the tornado. He stepped back, gasping for breath, his eyes blood-red, ready to use his last burning blood secret technique.  It was a powerful combat secret technique that required burning one's lifespan to burst forth. It could restore oneself to the best condition in a very short time, and in each attack and defense, it would generate a blood-shielding ability to help resist damage.  But unless it was absolutely necessary, he was reluctant to use this secret technique. Because each use would consume one-third of his lifespan. It was not a fixed amount but a proportional consumption.  As he hesitated, the Merfolk Giant saw a gap when he was distracted and swung the trident forward fiercely, striking like lightning.  Slash!! The Centaur King's chest was unexpectedly slashed open with a large wound. He then realized that his opponent was not someone easy to deal with, but a formidable enemy of the same level as him, one that would require at least a hundred moves to determine a victor.  "Outsider, this is not a place for you to come. Since you have come, rest in peace here, and become a bone of honor under the seats of my brother and me. This is also a glorious end for you." The Merfolk Giant spoke in a particularly awkward style, as if carrying an ancient tone, or as if he hadn't spoken for a long time and suddenly began to use his voice.  The Centaur King breathed deeply, his blood circulating rapidly to desperately eliminate the fatigue and decadence in his body. But each swing of the giant spear brought tremendous strain to his flesh, making it increasingly difficult for him to recover.  "No... How can I fall here!! How can I!!??" The Centaur King finally made up his mind, ready to use the burning blood secret technique, and go crazy one last time.  "I will assist you!!" Just then, the black giant who had been watching the battle also jumped into the fray, with his right fist suddenly expanding in mid-air, bringing up a huge shockwave and smashing towards the Centaur King.  Sssss!! A large number of arm-thick black metal siege crossbows shot out with precise and stable trajectories, carrying a strange twisting halo, and bombarded the Centaur King. His huge body at this moment was essentially a massive target.  At this moment, even if he wanted to burst out with the burning blood secret technique, it was too late. The black giant, the Merfolk Giant, and the huge siege crossbows shooting from all around.  All the attacks converged at this instant, focusing together. The Centaur King needed a moment to adapt to the secret technique's activation.  But now, he didn't even have that moment's time. "No!!" He opened his eyes wide, only to watch helplessly as the black giant's huge fist fell from above.  At this moment, the Merfolk Giant fully blocked his war spear, preventing him from freeing his hands to deal with the strike. "I will die...!"  "I... will die...!!" At this instant, everything seemed to slow down. The flying crossbow bolts. The black giant king's fist. The Merfolk Giant's trident.  And the circles of translucent mysterious spells that emerged around, which were the Giant King's subordinates using spells to bind him. Time seemed to have stopped.  The Centaur King was unable to move, and aside from his thoughts, his body was similarly unable to act. Everything was like an insect frozen in amber.  "Am I going to die?" He watched this strange scene in horror, unwillingness, and anger. Such a scene was rare in his life, and he had heard that at the moment of death, one would encounter incredible things.  Perhaps this moment right now was such a case. What puzzled him, though, was that he seemed to be able to see the surprise in the eyes of the black giant other than himself.  And the twisted and puzzled expression on the face of the Merfolk Giant. "Great Frost Flow, Extreme Cold Sword."  "Do you see? This is one of the supreme mysteries of my swordsmanship, known as the freezing sword intent that can instantly extinguish everything."  "The so-called sword intent is the ability to make people feel the threat of sharpness and the blade even when the sword is not drawn. And my sword intent has been able to, with my will, force living beings into a state of frozen instant extinction."  "When life believes it is dead, it will wither." Chapter 450: Pursuit 2  The Centaur King looked toward the sound, and his pupils suddenly contracted. He saw a red-haired woman standing quietly behind the mermaid giant and the black giant king. She leaned against a palace pillar, quietly watching them. She had no weapon in hand, merely her palm seemingly holding something. Although she held nothing, it gave the impression that she was wielding a sharp sword.  "Hear my intention, and you can feel the terror and shudder. This is the Sword Intent."  The Centaur King watched the red-haired woman as she slowly raised her hand and gently made a downward slash. Subsequently, he saw a clear bloodstain appear on the right shoulder of the black giant king.  Hiss!! A large spray of blood gushed out, scattering on the ground.  "So it's not that time has stopped... but we have stopped..." the black giant king fell to the ground with a thud, his face full of horror and weakness.  "Because you are too weak," said the red-haired woman indifferently.  Boom! Suddenly, the palace door was pushed open heavily. A towering figure clad in white heavy armor strode in, not glancing at the two giant kings or the Centaur King. Instead, he walked straight through them to the highest giant throne and turned around to sit down. Even though his stature did not match the grand giant throne, the figure sitting upon it exuded an indescribable sense of oppression and pressure.  "I will give you only one chance."  "Submit, or die," said the figure on the throne flatly.  "This palace is built on the highest peak of the Sakureimon Mountain Range in this realm of evil spirits, surrounded by icy tundras. A very nice location. It is perfect for our use," said the red-haired woman with a smile.  "What's the use of keeping these two pieces of trash alive? They are useless even if they survive. It's better to kill them cleanly." Upon hearing this, the mermaid giant and the black giant frantically tried to break free from the strange freezing force.  "No... Impossible...!! Want me to submit?! Don't insult me!! I am the Giant King Bo Yinhanerla!!" The black giant's muscles swelled rapidly as he roared furiously. His black fists began to grow countless smoke-like black threads. All the threads wrapped around his fist, quickly forming a layer of black metallic armor.  "Ah ah ah!!" With a punch, he actually broke free from the Sword Intent of Tiangong Xia and turned to smash her behind him. The giant fist shot out like a missile and then hung suspended in the air, less than half a meter from Tiangong Xia's face.  Whoosh!! A strong gust of wind blew Tiangong Xia's hair back and forth. But the fist could not advance any further.  "Good, now you've proven that you're not trash," Tiangong Xia's eyes showed a trace of appreciation. "One who can break free from the lock of my Sword Intent is certainly not a mediocre person! I acknowledge your bravery."  The black giant opened his mouth to roar but could not make any sound. At this distance, he was even deprived of the right to roar.  "Do you feel it?" Tiangong Xia's mouth curved into a sinister smile. "This is my Sword Domain, Silent Clarity."  She stretched out her slender index finger and lightly tapped the black giant's forehead. "Your blood."  "Too noisy."  Zizz... As she tapped her finger, the black giant's blood flow began to slow down drastically, and then slower, and slower. In a matter of seconds, he was forcibly plunged from a state of boiling blood to a state of blood stagnation.  "Do you know what will never make a sound?" Tiangong Xia's hand changed from a finger to a palm, gently caressing the black giant's face. "Only death will always be silent."  "Enough, Tiangong Xia," finally came the indifferent male voice from the throne.  Tiangong Xia took a step back with a smile. "Wasn't I just joking with him? He actually tore off the arm of the fairy princess. I just wanted to teach him a little lesson."  "The arm of the Fairy King can be reattached. It's not a big deal," said Lin Sheng calmly from above.  "Alright, then I'll follow your orders, Holy Emperor." Tiangong Xia smiled again and stepped back, and the oppressive and heavy terrifying pressure around her gradually dissipated as well.  The previously frozen sounds once again returned to the surroundings.  The black giant fell to the ground; although only a little time had passed, it was enough to completely rob the black giant king of his combat power. His entire body's blood was forcibly stagnated, resulting in many negative effects that were hard to describe.  Lin Sheng sat on the giant throne, looking down below.  Two giants, stiff all over, were scared rigid on the spot by Tiangong Xia. As well as the surrounding crowd, which was also shocked.  To be able to come here from the harsh environment outside, they must be beings with strong vitality and strength. This was also why Lin Sheng intended to give the two giant kings a chance. He needed more troops and stronger beings to conquer more realms of evil spirits.  "Big brother!" The mermaid giant saw his brother, the black giant, in a dire situation, and instantly became worried and furious. However, just because his brother could break free from the Sword Intent's constraints did not mean he could do the same. The mermaid giant struggled frantically, trying to break the invisible bonds around him. But his strength was much less than his brother's.  If the black giant's strength was at the peak in terms of power, similar to the power of the three great secret realm enforcers, then he was only equivalent to an ordinary civilian enforcer. Civilian enforcers, who often came up with their own research, were not comparable to the academy's secret realm enforcers, neither in power nor in natural force fields.  And the mermaid giant belonged to this level. This was the lowest level among the enforcers. If not for his brother being decent, Lin Sheng would not bother to recruit such a weak individual.  The mermaid giant's struggles and painful roars brought a sense of tragic bravery to the great hall.  "Tiangong Xia. Disperse," Lin Sheng ordered coldly.  Whoosh. Suddenly, the heavy pressure that had enveloped the giant king abruptly lightened. The two giants first trembled, then simultaneously leaped up and dashed towards the palace door like lightning.  The black giant, still in mid-air, threw a punch back in Lin Sheng's direction. His fist was extremely heavy; as he threw the punch, the air moaned and wailed. The fist stirred a large distortion, like water ripples, flying rapidly towards Lin Sheng.  This distortion was purely the result of his own strength's shockwave. It seemed like a natural response to the punch, but it was actually the full force of the black giant's shockwave ability. If anyone mistook this distortion for a normal aftermath, they would be dead.  Lin Sheng watched as the shockwave distortion approached rapidly. He stopped Tiangong Xia, who was about to intercept, and instead extended his left hand, erecting it in front of him. His palm faced the incoming shockwave distortion directly. Chapter 461: Pursuit 3  Whoosh! With a light sound, the shockwave distortion was forcibly compressed and flattened, trying to break through Lin Sheng's palm. Yet, even though his palm was less than one-tenth the size of it, it was firmly blocked mid-air. Soon, the invisible shock distortion had nowhere to propagate and was forcefully annihilated on Lin Sheng's left palm. The group of shock distortion, just like real residual shockwaves, was naturally and casually dealt with by Lin Sheng.  Seeing this scene, the heart of the dark giant grew cold. Here was another top-tier powerhouse whose depth was completely unfathomable. Understanding what had just happened, even he himself began to doubt whether the punch he had just thrown was really just a residual wave. If it weren't for the significant depletion of shock energy in his body indicating that the punch had indeed been effective, he might now be doubting his life.  "How... How is this possible?!"  The merman giant also witnessed this scene and similarly began to doubt whether his brother had forgotten to use his mana. It was this moment of delay. The centaur king, having regained his senses, had already blocked the entrance to the great hall, cutting off the two giants' path of retreat.  At this point, in the domain of the Heavenly Craft Xiá's sword, aside from the members of the Holy Temple, only these two giant kings had their movement restrictions lifted. However, the many warriors and sorcerers under the other giant kings were still frozen in place, standing there like amber, maintaining their original postures.  "Get back!!" A spear stopped the two giant kings.  The centaur king was now thrilled. Just a second ago, he was prepared to desperately struggle like a dying dog, fighting chaotically. At this moment, with the arrival of the boss and Heavenly Craft Xiá, the situation had instantly reversed. The dying dog was transformed into a powerful being in an instant, blocking the doorway and looking down on the two embarrassed giant kings from a superior position.  "Crazy, huh? Weren't you very arrogant just now? Saying you wanted to beat me to death? Hmm??"  At this moment, the centaur king was completely invigorated. It was only now that he felt how exhilarating it was to have a strong backer. Especially when following a very reliable boss, watching the opponent who could have beaten him into a dying dog, now about to become his victim. This exhilarating feeling was simply indescribable!  The centaur king punched hard on the right cheek of the dark giant king. With a loud bang, the dark giant king was sent flying high, tumbling backward and falling in the center of the great hall. He landed right in front of Lin Sheng.  Seeing that the dark giant king couldn't even put up a decent fight, the centaur king felt a thrilling sensation from his tailbone rushing up his spine and then all the way to the back of his head, as if he was on cloud nine.  "Damn, that's satisfying!!!"  The centaur king laughed loudly, and at that moment, his loyalty to the Holy Emperor soared.  He was laughing in relief, but the two giant kings were in distress and felt like vomiting blood. Just a moment ago, the centaur king, who was defeated by them, was now able to show off in front of them, blatantly slapping their faces. Just looking at the centaur king's ugly, smug face, a surge of malicious anger blasted out from the two giant kings. Just the sight of his face made them want to beat the centaur king to death, not to mention the current reversal of the situation.  "Still not submitting? Are your bones really that tough?" The centaur king sneered with a hehe.  "But it doesn't matter, I, old horse, like guys with tough bones. Hehehehe!"  He snickered, put away his war spear, and walked toward the two giant kings, rubbing his hands in anticipation.  What in the world did this centaur king learn from you, Heavenly Craft Xiá... Lin Sheng looked at Heavenly Craft Xiá speechlessly. In his absence, it was Heavenly Craft Xiá who was coordinating the overall situation. The centaur king only associated with those stronger than himself, which is why he was the most convinced by Heavenly Craft Xiá.  Originally, Lin Sheng had asked Heavenly Craft Xiá to teach some real-world common sense to a few of the legion commanders, as a way to broaden their general knowledge. But now, looking at the results...  Watching the two giant kings struggling on the ground like little wives, frightened and trying to avoid the approaching centaur king, Lin Sheng couldn't help but feel the urge to facepalm. Where has the style of this painting gone??  He came to subjugate two rank-holders, not to watch a live broadcast not suitable for minors.  "Are you going to surrender or not!!?" The centaur king's sleazy and triumphant laughter echoed in the great hall.  "Just kill me! Your father here would rather die than surrender!! ....... No!! No... I surrender! I surrender!!"  The black giant king painfully hugged his brother and desperately retreated backward. If they didn't surrender now, they feared they might be stripped by the centaur king into little lambs. With so many subordinates watching, and with their own numerous children present. If they were really stripped and hanged up for whipping, it would be a tremendous disgrace that would be remembered for ten thousand years even in death!  And it turned out that the centaur king's effect was quite good. Watching the two giant kings glare fiercely at the centaur king, wanting to kill him with their gaze, Lin Sheng couldn't help but contemplate whether to let the centaur king try his hand at specialized interrogation. Perhaps, compared to combat, the realm of punishment might be a better fit for him.  Two tough guys, in order to maintain their image, finally submitted under the humiliation of the centaur king and joined Lin Sheng's forces, becoming two of his great generals under the Dark Spirit King. The strength under the Dark Spirit King's command grew even further, becoming more powerful and expanding.  After subduing the giant kings, Lin Sheng finally found the whereabouts of the third fragment in the giant kings' palace. In the giant's treasure vault, the fragment lay quietly in the form of a crystal ball, having been there for thousands of years. If Lin Sheng hadn't come knocking, the giant kings might never have realized how important this crystal ball was a fragment. Because there were at least a hundred crystal balls identical to this one in the treasure vault. Moreover, these crystal balls were all identical in shape, even the patterns and textures were completely the same. Only the first fragment possessed by Lin Sheng could sense the fluctuations of this fragment, thereby identifying which crystal ball it was.  After entering the treasure vault, Lin Sheng quickly selected a large number of various treasures. He did not pick out this crystal ball alone but concealed it among a large collection of various treasures and took it out together. Gold, crystals, gems, silver, all sorts of rare and exotic treasures, and a variety of strange and curious artifacts. The treasure of the giant kings greatly enriched Lin Sheng's personal treasure trove as the Dark Spirit King and Holy Emperor.  And just as he found the third fragment in the Dark Spirit Realm, ready to integrate it at any time and initially grasp the power of the Yin to Evil Wheel, in reality...  Farudo, who had taken over Miyuki's body and was known as the Magistrate of the Netherworld, a being above the rank-holders, finally set foot on the land of Redon, which belonged to the Heavenly Tower.  And at the same time...  All over the world, all the people of destiny who held the holy artifacts of the heavenly mandate, heard the guidance from the Great Sage of the Great Star Pool. Guiding them to converge in a small city named Descher in Redon, to unite the power of all the holy artifacts and to vanquish the Magistrate of the Netherworld, Farudo.  ............... ............... Chapter 462: Power 1  At a wooden hut in an abandoned manor on the western border, sunlight filtered through a faint black fog, casting strange, twisting lines on the ground.  The wooden door of the hut creaked open. Adolf, looking haggard with a scruffy beard, walked out of the house and looked up at the sky.  "The erosion of the Dust World has reached such a severe level?" He sighed.  Despite the increasing erosion of the Dust World and the Black Tide, it had no effect on those like him, the holders of the fated holy artifacts. Their power was enough to shield the surrounding dust and black fog.  After realizing that he possessed a fated holy artifact and would eventually be sought after by the terrifying enemies of the Dust World, Adolf thought for a long time before finally coming up with a clumsy lie and resolutely leaving his birthplace, Shumingdon. He left behind his deeply benevolent teacher, Lin Sheng, and many companions and elders from the temple who were close to him as family.  Knowing the terrifying strength of the enemy, Adolf knew that the future would have to be faced alone. He couldn't involve others; it was too dangerous for them.  Adolf took out a recently received letter, the delicate handwriting on it clearly documenting the evil deeds of a Netherworld demon officer named Faludo, who slaughtered messengers and froze tens of thousands of people, sinking them to the bottom of the sea.  "Gather everyone's power, to summon the strongest force and rebuild everything? The fated holy artifact... what exactly is it..." With a sigh in his heart, Adolf put away the letter, donned a wide-brimmed round hat, lowered the brim, and quickly left towards the distance.  This journey, whether it led to life or death, had to yield a result. If successful, everything would be restored to its original state. If not, the worst outcome would be his death, without implicating his family and friends. This was the resolution belonging to him, Adolf.  ...  ...  Lin Sheng had never thought he would come to this point.  Sitting in the rough stone hall of the Evil Spirit Palace, there was a cup of hot tea on the table in front of him, emitting a faint white steam.  The stone hall was not large, just the size of a small basketball court, with round entrances and exits at both ends. On the left and right sides were some armors and weapons obtained from the treasury of the Giant King. Above hung a huge crystal chandelier filled with candles.  The floor was carpeted in red, and in the center stood a large statue of him riding a blood demon warhorse.  Lin Sheng gently caressed the crystal ball. The surface of the sphere was smooth and icy, with what seemed like a silver nebula slowly rotating and glowing inside. The entire sphere was silver-blue, and its base was made of an unidentified pale redwood, exuding a refreshing fragrance.  "The evil energy has basically reached a suppressive level by now, and it's not so easy to advance further. My goal is to use evil energy to enhance holy power, to stimulate it. But in fact, now that I have stepped into the rank of a messenger, the role of evil energy is not great."  Lin Sheng pondered the power systems he currently possessed. He had many powers, but they were mixed and impure.  "Evil energy, dragon blood power, holy power, soul power, it's now somewhat affecting my further advancement. If I want to improve the quality and concentration of the energy, I have to make a choice."  Lin Sheng was aware that his body was like a giant compressor; only pure, concentrated single energy could be compressed more quickly to reach a higher quality.  Since he had broken through to the rank of a messenger with the help of holy power, he began to feel that the improvement of his strength and cultivation was slowing down.  To advance and break through the suppressive level of evil energy would require a long accumulation of time. Holy power had just broken through and had not yet stabilized. Dragon blood power was already fixed at such a strength; it depends on opportunities and the purity of the bloodline. His current dragon blood proportion had reached a fairly saturated state. To continue to improve, he could only increase the purity of the bloodline. But purity cannot be increased casually; it also requires compression and purification.  "My power is too mixed inside my body; there is no environment for purification. I must make a decision."  Lin Sheng picked up the hot tea and took a sip. The faint aroma of the tea refreshed his spirit.  "Firstly, evil energy can be given up. I do not have an innate talent for evil energy; learning it was only to broaden my horizons."  He first ruled out evil energy.  "Secondly, dragon blood power, this depends on the bloodline. I initially wanted to use the dragon blood to enhance my physical strength to be able to contain more holy power. Now that I have broken through to the rank of a messenger, theoretically, I can continuously connect with the Sea Gate and use the chaotic soul power of the Lingji Sea to transform it into pure holy power."  "So, this can also be set aside for now."  "Thirdly, chaotic soul power... This is the power I accidentally obtained after connecting with the Lingji Sea. Although it's infinite, it lacks a systematic framework, it's not easy to advance, and there's no clearer direction."  Lin Sheng pondered.  "I won't let go of this for the time being; after all, the essence of holy power is the soul. I should focus on the soul, continuously strengthening and purifying it."  Everything's core is the soul. Understanding this, Lin Sheng quickly cleared up what should be his focus.  "Soul power is my foundation. With soul power, holy power and evil energy are just derivatives."  He drained the tea, stood up, and picked up the crystal ball, walking slowly to the inner hall.  The Evil Spirit Palace was built and perfected by the combined efforts of the craftsmen from all the evil spirits and the Fairy Empire, under the orders of the Demon Hand of Degaal and the Fairy King. Initially, it was the Demon Hand clan that began construction. Later, to flatter Lin Sheng, the higher-ups of the Fairy Empire, apart from the Fairy King, started to work from the people and things around him. This increasingly luxurious and delicate inner palace was one of them.  Power is always fascinating, and that's where the obsession lies.  "Seize power, and everything else will follow."  This phrase flashed through Lin Sheng's mind. He walked under the inner hall's plaque, looked up at the plaque engraved with "Yin Yang Hall," and then strode in.  The guards of the inner hall were two strong and sturdy half-human, half-insect giant evil spirit generals. Their upper bodies were human males, while their lower bodies were like centaurs with huge insect bodies. Dozens of black legs supported them firmly on the ground like a mountain. These powerful warriors with shiny black carapaces kneeled on one knee and silently saluted him as Lin Sheng approached.  Lin Sheng ignored them and looked straight at the amazing giant knife inserted into the ground in the center of the inner hall. After a long absence, the Yin Turn Evil Wheel had undergone some unknown changes. The knife as a whole had shrunk quite a bit and had become much thinner.  "Three pieces... Now, let's see what kind of changes will happen after fusing three pieces..."  Lin Sheng reached out and gently grasped the handle of the giant knife. Then, with the other hand, he lightly pressed the crystal ball on top.  Hiss...  Something amazing happened. The crystal ball, as if liquefied, floated up and merged onto the surface of the giant knife. In just a few seconds, the crystal ball completely disappeared from Lin Sheng's hand. Chapter 463: Power 2  Lin Sheng calmly held the giant blade, quickly absorbing the holy power he had left on it as a precaution. To prevent other creatures from touching this treasure, he had highly concentrated his holy power in advance and attached it to the surface of the giant blade to better isolate its aura and fluctuations. The highly concentrated holy power could also protect the treasure. If anyone tried to approach and take the giant blade, Lin Sheng would detect them immediately and track them down. Unless the other party could dispel the high concentration of holy power he had left on it. But if such an opponent appeared, there would be no need for them to sneak in to steal; wouldn't it be simpler to just come in and take it by force?  Lin Sheng dissipated the holy power attached to the surface. He quietly watched the three fragments merge into one to form the Yin Evil Wheel. Suddenly, there was a crisp snap. The giant blade, held in his hand, suddenly fractured and fell to the ground, starting to melt and collapse. It was like ice cream melting under the sun, except the melting process was accelerated countless times. Lin Sheng didn't even have time to react before he saw the giant blade break and fall to the ground, silently dissolving into a pool of black viscous liquid.  For a moment, he seemed to hear the faint buzzing of dense insects and the rustling of raindrops hitting leaves. The sound quickly transformed into the roar of waves crashing against rocks. It was as if someone was whispering in his ear, as if countless images were flashing before his eyes. A vast amount of knowledge and information, like tangible black smoke, rose from the black viscous liquid at Lin Sheng's feet. His entire being was shrouded and surrounded by this black smoke containing countless sounds, knowledge, and information. Time seemed to slow down at this moment.  A flood of knowledge about evil spirits and supernatural abilities rushed into Lin Sheng's mind. It was a very strange feeling. It wasn't simply cramming a massive amount of knowledge into Lin Sheng's brain, but through a complete scenario evolution, a more vague and general yet complete way, he understood the root of the evil spirits' supernatural abilities.  "Yin turn..." A vague female voice murmured in Lin Sheng's ear. "Yin turn..." "Yin turn..." The voice kept repeating. As if hypnotic, it made Lin Sheng's mind overflow with a deep drowsiness. He slowly closed his eyes, and in the pitch darkness before him, a gigantic gray wheel slowly emerged from the darkness. The wheel, like an enormous gear, had four empty slots on its edge for inlays. Soon, one by one, the inlay objects began to appear. One inlay was a black crystal column. Another was a white bone piece. Another was a crystal ball. And there was one inlay slot that was empty. The wheel creaked and turned slowly but made a strained, faulty creaking noise due to the missing inlay. It seemed that because of the missing inlay, the entire wheel couldn't continue to rotate smoothly.  Lin Sheng watched this wheel, noticing the intricate patterns of flowers, insects, fish, mountains, and rivers on its edge. The surface was crawling with characters that looked like insects. This wheel, rather than being a wheel, was more like a circular mystical treasure. He opened his mouth, wanting to speak. But before he could come to his senses, a small opening suddenly appeared in the center of the wheel, and from it silently flowed three streams of dark red liquid like blood. Amid the sound of rushing water, these blood-like streams quickly approached, swirling around Lin Sheng and then drilling into the center of his chest. A total of three streams of blood left three different fine patterns on Lin Sheng's chest. The three patterns together formed a huge, complex wheel.  Lin Sheng opened his eyes and removed his armor, tearing open his clothes to look at his chest. Indeed, there were three blood-red marks on his chest. Together, the three marks resembled an incomplete puzzle; once fully assembled, they would form a red wheel that covered his chest. At the center of the wheel was a pattern like an eye, which continuously emitted a faint grey glow in all directions like a living thing. Within the glow, numerous symbols and patterns seemed to flow.  Lin Sheng looked at his hands; the giant blade no longer existed there. Nor was there the pool of pitch-black liquid at his feet. The so-called Yin Evil Wheel seemed to have completely transferred to his body. He closed his eyes, feeling the vast amount of information that had just poured into his mind. "So this is the so-called Yin Evil Wheel... Rather than an evil wheel, it's more like a forbidden tome."  The Yin Evil Wheel was crafted jointly by eighty-eight of the most powerful super evil spirits at the zenith of the Evil Spirit world. At that time, evil spirits did not have innate supernatural talents. They were merely creatures with a special body structure and did not have many other differences. But ever since the super evil spirits crafted this artifact, they used it to forcibly elevate the entire race of evil spirits through some mysterious and special methods into a race naturally endowed with powerful supernatural talents. This artifact, rather than being a treasure, is more like the condensed essence that the evil spirits once used to break through their racial limits and elevate their bloodlines. It was the great creation forged by the most powerful evil spirits of the past to break through the limits of their bloodlines and race.  Correspondingly, possessing the Yin Evil Wheel did not mean fully understanding how to unleash all evil spirit supernatural abilities. Instead, one would automatically receive the protection of supernatural abilities bestowed by the eighty-eight super evil spirits. "Eighty-eight protections..." Lin Sheng's eyes widened. He reached out his hand and gently clenched it. He could feel a strange power surrounding his body like a force field. Within this force field, dozens of different auras and forces roamed. These forces were like giant serpents lurking in his shadow, revealing their fangs only when needed.  "Eighty-eight types of protection, eighty-eight types of abilities, can generally be categorized into four types," Lin Sheng began to classify according to the information in his mind. "First, the wheel that enhances one's own existence." "Second, the wheel that weakens the opponent's fate." "Third, the wheel of free movement." "Fourth..." Lin Sheng's brows suddenly furrowed. "The fourth is incomplete... Indeed, the final piece is needed to completely merge and obtain the ultimate complete power."  "Eighty-eight protections, I have already received the first three types, which add up to more than seventy protections. Only a few protections are missing. Looking at it this way, these missing protections are very likely to be the most important ones." Lin Sheng understood in his heart. He looked around and did not immediately try out the power of the protections in this place. Instead, he quickly walked out of the inner hall and exited the Evil Spirit Palace amidst the bowing and saluting evil spirits. Then he stepped into the evil spirit gate that had led him to the black crystal column before.  Hiss... As the world spun and Lin Sheng regained his senses from the teleportation, he saw a pale white flame surging towards him. Before he could react and defend, a layer of gray light naturally rose from his body, firmly blocking the flame's onslaught. Lin Sheng felt his chest getting a little hot and looked down at the torn open collar. The red wheel pattern on his chest had become clearer and more blood-red. Chapter 464: Power 3  "Is this the blessing of the Wheel of Existence?" Lin Sheng pondered thoughtfully. Walking forward, engulfed in flames, the terrifyingly frozen earth fire, equivalent to the strength of five wings, couldn't even touch his skin. He did not use any of his own powers, whether it was demonic energy, holy power, or dragon blood abilities.  It was just the newly acquired protective power that was automatically defending him against everything. Within the thick white pillar of flame, Lin Sheng slowly descended from midair to the ground. "There was a slight deviation in the teleportation just now, and I was directly teleported into the flames."  Stepping out of the fire column, he looked around and stomped on the ground. His body effortlessly leapt up and flew away towards the distance. After running several thousand meters in one direction, Lin Sheng stopped on a slightly elevated hilltop and quietly surveyed the vast terrain around him.  On the flat ground, grey-white earth fires spewed out everywhere. This space was like a severely wounded soldier covered in injury after a great battle, on the verge of death, still struggling desperately.  "Testing the power of the protection here should be fine." Lin Sheng wanted to try out the power of the protection. He stretched out his hand, flicked his index finger towards a spewing earth fire pillar in the distance, and then tried to activate the power of the Wheel of Calamity.  Whoosh! An invisible wave shot out from Lin Sheng's fingertip, hitting the surface of the earth fire pillar with precision. In silence, the earth fire pillar first rapidly became transparent, then its color faded more and more until it completely vanished from its spot, as if it had never existed.  Lin Sheng lowered his finger and quietly waited. After a long time, the earth fire pillar did not reappear. "So, the Wheel of Calamity within the protection is about completely erasing the existence of the opponent from the root?" Lin Sheng pondered.  The artifacts forged by the top evil spirits naturally contained their philosophies. What kind of methods were the ultimate goal of weakening the enemy? In the world of evil spirits, the ultimate evil spirits believed that the answer was to completely annihilate the opponent from the root of the soul.  "So the Wheel of Calamity, which combines dozens of different abilities, ultimately manifests the power that comes together, which is to completely erase the opponent?" Lin Sheng understood a bit more.  "Then there is the Wheel of Enhancement that strengthens one's own existence." He looked down again at the blood wheel pattern on his chest. Then he stretched out both hands again and gently set up a hand seal in front of him, with his fingers crossed like a wheel.  "Open!" His eyes suddenly snapped open, and a massive amount of blood-red light burst forth from his chest, shrouding his entire body. Whoosh!!! A five or six-meter-thick blood-red light surged into the sky, stirring up the clouds above to roll. Large swaths of grey-white clouds were dyed red by the blood light, emitting bursts of thunderous roaring.  Soon, the blinding red light on the ground turned into a huge flame. Within the flame, a clear human figure slowly spread its arms. "For the evil spirits, what kind of power is the best way to enhance oneself?"  "I didn't expect the answer to be this..." Surrounded by the blood light, Lin Sheng's face and figure were no longer visible, only a pair of pale golden eyes swirling with golden light. "Too strong... I am already... Even I am afraid of this kind of me..."  "I'm afraid that I will destroy everything unintentionally." Lin Sheng raised his eyes and looked into the distance, intoxicated by this special state of immense power. With such power, no one could stop him from doing anything. No one!  ...  ...  In reality, at the Redwing Heaven Tower.  "Hahahaha!!!" In the grey-white sky, Farudo, dressed in a black robe with his white hair wildly blowing in the wind, laughed loudly, releasing rings of grey energy shockwaves from his body. The massive shockwaves spread outwards, annihilating everything nearby.  Below, the demonic energy users of the Heaven Tower formed armies, bombarding and shooting round after round. It was as if there was a thick layer of cotton between them and Farudo, not even qualifying to touch him. The cannon shells and demonic spells seemed like weak and powerless insects, constantly trying to break through the layer of grey shockwaves. But each attempt was futile, only to weakly deflect back.  "Do you feel despair?" Farudo laughed loudly. "This is too disappointing... Humans from a thousand years ago were not so insignificant. Back then, heroes emerged in large numbers, and there were countless strong individuals. Even for a powerful underworld priest like myself, caution was necessary."  "But now? Look at you?" Farudo's eyes revealed a hint of boredom. "It's a contradictory feeling... I both hope you can be stronger, to entertain me, and I don't want you to be stronger, to avoid wasting my energy."  "Farudo, do you really have to eradicate my Heaven Tower?" Among the many demonic energy users in the front rows on the ground, a burly old man with white hair and beard, and an eagle perched on his shoulder, stared coldly at Farudo in the sky.  "As a priest of the underworld in charge of curses, instead of serving the Lord of the Underworld properly, you come to the surface. Aren't you afraid of turmoil in the underworld?" The old man's tone was calm, but his knowledge of the underworld was clear.  "Oh?" Farudo was slightly surprised. "It seems there are still people on the surface who remember my existence, Farudo." He looked down at the old man. This was the first time he had faced a human so squarely since leaving Bisha Island.  "A mere human knows about the internal affairs of the great Underworld. It seems that my assessment of the Heaven Tower needs to be adjusted." He began to smile. "What if I destroy this land? We hide in the sanctuary, and after a few decades, we come out again, and everything starts over. But what about you? The underworld's rogue priest Farudo. When you return, what price will you pay to survive this calamity?"  The old man's face was cold, as if the near-extinction of most humans was not a big deal in his eyes. "Really ruthless... Compared to the number of people the sanctuary can accommodate, it's vastly different from the outside world. And you dare to give up everything with one sentence?"  Farudo was also surprised by the other party's decisiveness. "Isn't this the result that Miyue wants? The end of the old era, the beginning of a new one." The old man said coldly.  Beside him, the other demonic energy users of the Heaven Tower were angry, their faces flushed with rage. Clearly, many of them were thinking of this terrifying future. At this moment, looking at Farudo, they all wished they could rush up and fight him to the death. After all, most of the friends and family of the demonic users are in reality, and the sanctuary simply cannot accommodate so many people. So the destruction of reality is equivalent to cutting off their lineage and annihilating their relatives. No one could accept such an outcome.  "Is that so?" Farudo raised an eyebrow, "Since that's the case, let me try and see how many of you are really willing to hide in the sanctuary..." He looked meaningfully at the demonic users behind the old man.  "Since words don't work, let's try. If you want to destroy the Heaven Tower, let's see how much you're willing to pay!!" The old man's eyes turned cold, and a thick ice staff quickly appeared in his hands. "Form up!!" he commanded with his staff.  In an instant, a huge silver-white magic array lit up on the ground, placing Farudo in the sky right in the center of the position. Chapter 465: The Last Fragment 1  In the midst of a melodious harp melody, a bard dressed in a splendid robe, indistinguishable in gender like a butterfly, gently played a poem styled after the Fairy Empire. The bard's voice was also difficult to distinguish between male and female, neutral and soft, winning nods of approval from the legion commanders present.  The poem was a labor of love by the old nobility of the Fairy Empire, moving in song, beautiful in tune, and ornate and philosophical in diction.  "However, praising me in my presence, isn't that a bit too embarrassing?" Lin Sheng sat on the throne of the Demon King, glanced at the Centaur King beside him, and then at the Fairy King to his right.  The Centaur King was lost in the song, nodding his head in rapture. The Fairy King, on the other hand, drank fine wine with her eyes closed and her expression unchanged. But since one of her eyes took up her entire face, it was hard to decipher any expressions.  Deigar Demonhand, in this hall where strength was revered, was seated at a lower position, which made the demonhands of the Demonhand clan feel indignant but that was the reality, his strength was indeed too weak.  The Giant Kings, having newly descended, sat silently at the end of the table, drinking and eating meat without a word.  Suddenly, a heavy sound of footsteps came from outside the hall.  "The Dragon Tomb's Sin Dragon Mother has arrived!" The herald's announcement drifted in at this moment.  "Sin Dragon Mother?" The numerous legion commanders present were all slightly taken aback. They had learned about the existence of the Dragon Tomb from Lin Sheng and Tiangong Xia, but they did not know the specifics and had never seen its powerful members.  And now was the time to meet this unfamiliar new member.  As the footsteps approached rapidly, a woman in a black dress with a seductive figure and blonde hair walked into the hall with ease and a smile.  She stood in the center of the hall amidst the melodious singing and curtsied slightly to Lin Sheng.  "Mighty Demon King, the Sin Dragon Mother brings many dragon souls from the Dragon Tomb to await your orders."  The Sin Dragon Mother's voice was slightly hoarse, melodious and sexy, hinting that she must have been an irresistible top beauty in life. If not for the pallor of death characteristic of ghostly spirits on her face, the legion commanders present, such as the Centaur King and the Giant King, would probably be joining the ranks of those pursuing her.  "I want to marry her!" The Centaur King, upon seeing the Sin Dragon Mother for the first time, was utterly captivated.  He swallowed his saliva uncontrollably, and his blood seemed to boil as it circulated rapidly. His eyes quickly filled with blood, revealing an indescribable desire and anticipation.  "You may," Lin Sheng couldn't help but smile. "If you don't mind that the Sin Dragon Mother's true form is dozens of times larger than you, I think she would be delighted to accept your pursuit. Provided you don't get crushed to death on your wedding night."  "Uh..." The Centaur King was doused with cold water, and the passion in his eyes faded as he awkwardly scratched his head. He was already one of the top powerhouses in controlling blood and energy, stronger than the average legion commander.  If anyone saw him get hot-blooded and looked ready to act impulsively, there was no doubt that it was an act. Or he really intended to do so.  Despite being the powerful Centaur King with a strong natural physique, he was actually the least impulsive of all. So now, he quickly snapped out of his entranced state and returned to normal.  "I better not, then. I'll leave her for a supreme being like you to enjoy."  "Show respect to the strong!" The Sin Dragon Mother, being disrespected and insulted in such a manner, flashed a fierce look in her eyes. A black force field condensed into a line and shot towards the Centaur King.  With a puff, the Centaur King reacted, stomping and shattering the line of black force field.  "How dare you! With the supreme being here, you dare to commit violence in the hall!? Do you even have the supreme being in your eyes! Is your Dragon Tomb planning to rebel??" He immediately stood up and shouted.  The Sin Dragon Mother's cherry lips parted slightly, completely stunned by the Centaur King's shamelessness. She hadn't expected such a seemingly honest and brave man to be so smooth in his trickery. He was quick to put a label on her.  "I was just responding to your disrespect for a stronger being. As the weak, you should learn to be humble!" The Sin Dragon Mother, after all, was an old hand who had lived for thousands of years, and immediately retorted.  "If the supreme being were not here, you would already be dead in the Dragon Tomb and turned into fertilizer!" Her voice was cold and filled with a thick deathly aura.  "Heh, you're not worth my time," the Centaur King was not intimidated.  "You're seeking death!!" The Sin Dragon Mother was immediately provoked and about to take action.  "Silence!" Tiangong Xia, sitting on the side, spoke impatiently. "I can't even hear the music anymore! If you want to fight, take it outside, don't disturb my listening!"  With her words, both the Sin Dragon Mother and the Centaur King had to suppress their anger and remained silent. They both knew Tiangong Xia's strength. Among those present, aside from the supreme Demon King, no one else was a match for Tiangong Xia.  "Alright, take a seat, Sin Dragon Mother," Lin Sheng spoke at the right moment. "Musicians, you may withdraw."  He looked towards the fairy musician next to the stone pillar on the right. The musician immediately signaled for the bard to stop playing and quickly led him away.  Soon, fairy attendants fluttered their wings and flew up to the hall, each carrying trays with fruit and fine wine and other refreshments, placing them on the low tables in front of the legion commanders.  The stone doors of the great hall slowly closed, sealed by a magical formation.  Lin Sheng surveyed the strong figures present.  To his left were Tiangong Xia, the Fairy King, and the Giant King brothers. To his right were the Centaur King, the Sin Dragon Mother, and Deigar Demonhand.  In a blink of an eye, he had subjugated five commander-level powerhouses as his subordinates.  The power of the Demon Palace had expanded at an indescribable rate, quickly becoming a colossal entity.  The legion commanders were commander-level, and below them were the Demon Marshals.  This level of powerhouses included several individuals from the Fairy Emperor's Fairy Empire and a few under the Centaur King's command.  Moreover, the dragon souls in the Dragon Tomb each had the combat power of commander-level, but they had not been completely subjugated by Lin Sheng and only obeyed the Sin Dragon Mother.  The Demon Marshal level, just below the commanders, was equivalent to the pinnacle of six wings. The total number of these figures that the Demon Palace could mobilize was likely to be in the double digits.  The third level was the Demon General level.  There were too many powerhouses at this level. The Demon Lair alone had hundreds, and Lin Sheng had also created many monsters of this level in his previous experiments.  Additionally, there were hundreds more under the Fairy Empire and the Centaur King.  This level was equivalent to a three-winged demon.  As for the ordinary demons, their numbers were in the tens of thousands.  The Demon Palace was now capable of arm-wrestling with the three great secret realms of reality, to see who would emerge victorious.  But this was not enough. What Lin Sheng wanted was far more.  "I am glad that you all could arrive here on time," Lin Sheng opened his arms and spoke loudly. "This is the Demon Palace. The supreme land of the demon world. It is also the foundation from which I will unite all demons in the future."  His voice carried far and wide, rolling and reverberating like thunder inside and outside the hall. Not only the legion commanders inside the hall could hear it, but the demon generals nearby could also hear it clearly.  "This gathering is for the purpose of bestowing upon you a path to even higher power," Lin Sheng hinted. Chapter 466: The Final Fragment 2  "A higher power?" The Mother of Sin Dragons' eyes flickered with intense wariness. Having lived for so many years, she had never seen a fool who would give away power for no reason. Was the King of Evil Spirits a fool? Of course not. Her gaze peripherally swept over the opposing Tian Gongxia. The red-haired woman's face betrayed no emotion, displaying only boredom and disinterest. If the Mother of Sin Dragons felt this way, the rest were even more restless.  The Centaur King didn't care about these twists and turns. He had decided to follow Lin Sheng completely, so as long as it was Lin Sheng's decision, he would certainly comply!  "It seems that our lord despises our weak strength! Hahahaha! But actually, it still depends on who we compare ourselves to. However, since it's a benefit granted by our lord, I, Old Ma, will be the first to unceremoniously accept it!" He laughed heartily, showing his loyalty.  When the boss spoke, how could there be no support? Wouldn't a lack of response be even more embarrassing?  "I look forward to it," the Fairy King replied softly. Her severed arm had been reattached, and it seemed she had recovered without a trace of injury.  "The decision of our lord is our will," proclaimed Dejial Demon Hand overtly with flattery.  The Giant King brothers were silent, showing no expression. They had just been defeated, their treasury plundered, so their mood could only be sour.  Lin Sheng was indifferent. "In fact, I do think your strength is a bit weak," he said calmly. "The times are changing. Power cannot remain stagnant either."  He stretched out his hand, palm facing upwards, slowly releasing a pure white sphere of holy power. Hiss. The sphere emerged from his palm and hovered quietly a few centimeters above it, floating up and down slowly.  "This power is called holy power," Lin Sheng explained. "The quality of holy power is higher than soul power, and it is superior to all the powers you possess. If you do not believe it, you can try it for yourselves."  Lin Sheng gently squeezed the sphere, and it shattered, immediately emitting several rays of holy power that landed precisely in front of the legion commanders. The rays turned back into smaller holy power spheres, floating in front of the commanders.  "You can touch this sphere of holy power with your own power to neutralize it and see whose quality is stronger. If you're sure you want to master this new power, you can come to me later. I will grant you the seed of initiation."  Having said that, he didn't wait for the commanders to ask questions and directly moved on to the second topic.  "We'll not discuss this for now. Next, let's proceed to the formal topic."  Lin Sheng extended his hand, and the Fairy King immediately condensed a blue water sphere that floated to Lin Sheng. With a touch from Lin Sheng, the sphere dispersed and unfolded into a giant transparent polyhedron, several meters in diameter, displayed in front of everyone.  The polyhedron, crystal-clear like a gem, slowly revealed a clear image of a black desert. In the image, the desert stretched endlessly to the horizon. Infinite sand dunes under a scorching and eerie purple sun, and a one-horned camel struggling through the dunes. This was a region so hot that even the air was twisting and steaming.  "This is the Evil Spirit Realm that you will conquer next," Lin Sheng introduced. "Generally, we categorize such small secret worlds to see if it is an Evil Spirit Realm by looking at one key point: whether it has spawned pure soul beings like evil spirits."  He pointed at the one-horned camel in the image. "Every place that naturally spawns soul beings will become one of the subordinate worlds under my Evil Spirit Palace. As for the world you see before you, it's larger than usual. Whether it's an Evil Spirit Realm or not, you will have to inspect and patrol it yourselves."  "Within three days, I want a complete assessment report of this secret world. I need to know how long it will take to completely conquer this small world."  "We will follow your will," the many legion commanders bowed in response. They didn't know why Lin Sheng wanted to conquer so many small Evil Spirit Realms, but since it was the lord's command, they had to fulfill it.  Lin Sheng did not reveal his intention to find the last fragment in this secret world. He did not plan to tell anyone about the matters of the Yin Evil Wheel.  Not letting others know the extent of one's strength was the way to ensure lasting prosperity. If your strength's depth and breadth are unknown, others would not dare to act recklessly, for they might inadvertently clash with your strongest point, which would be a path to their doom.  After that, Lin Sheng inquired one by one about the development of the Evil Spirit Palace. All of these were managed by Dejial Demon Hand. He was akin to the grand steward of the Evil Spirit Palace, representing Lin Sheng's will. Therefore, no one present dared to underestimate him.  Dejial Demon Hand stepped forward to report on the recent developments and changes, and also on the initial exploration of this brand-new Black Desert Evil Spirit Cavern. Upon learning that there were many suspected human tribes and cities living in this desert, the sitting legion commanders became very interested.  The meeting lasted over an hour before it adjourned. The legion commanders returned to their respective territories, beginning preparations to mobilize their troops to conquer the Black Desert.  Lin Sheng, taking advantage of his previous train of thought, returned to the Yin-Yang Hall to organize his current power system. To thoroughly purify himself and achieve the optimal environment for enhancing the quality of his power, he needed a perfect, impurity-free enclosed environment. Among the Eighty-Eight Protections of the Yin Evil Wheel, there was one that could meet Lin Sheng's needs.  The Eighty-Eight Protections, broadly used, could be categorized into four major types of results. However, Lin Sheng could actually use any one of the eighty-eight protections individually. Although he currently lacked some of the potentially most critical protections due to missing fragments, there were still numerous existing protections he could use to achieve his goal.  After dealing with the matters of the Evil Spirit Realm, Lin Sheng used the portal to return to Hengruikala. Having not been back for a long time, he had nearly forgotten the impact of the different flow of time. Sometimes, he would really think that many days had passed, and since he hadn't checked in with his family, he would call home as soon as he returned, only to be told that he had just called the day before.  In reality, Hengruikala remained unchanged, operating smoothly under the shelter of the Sunset Tower, like a large and precise instrument.  Now, Hengruikala had uniquely formed a social system centered around the Holy Temple, with the clergy as the core. The clergy gradually became an emerging profession. They practiced holy power, worked in various industries, used extraordinary powers to heal and help people. The grand and purifying light effects of the holy light, as well as the purifying field's inherent ability to cleanse the spirit and relieve fatigue, gave the Holy Temple and the clergy higher social status, gradually becoming synonymous with positive mainstream forces.  Justice and dignity, but also kindness and the power to heal the body and mind, this was the public's perception of the holy light. Chapter 467: The Final Fragment 3  Lin Sheng calculated the time he had spent in the realm of evil spirits. He had been in the realm of evil spirits for over a month, but when converted, it was less than a week in the outside world. The difference in the flow of time made it hard for him to adapt to the notion of dates.  Walking on the streets of Hengrui Kala, within the city's safe zone, building after building that had once been abandoned and deserted were now rejuvenated due to the influx of a large number of people. The gasoline vehicles that used to crowd the streets had been cleared out and replaced with cleaner electric vehicles. Most of these electric vehicles had been modified into a more practical compact structure to accommodate more people and to alleviate the congested traffic within the limited space of the safe zone. The workshops of Bain University had transformed these vehicles, which were now half the size of ordinary vehicles and could even engage in short bursts of low-altitude flight, greatly easing the traffic pressure in the safe zone.  As Lin Sheng walked down the street, he saw cars driving on the ground and shuttling between buildings in mid-air. This scene, which seemed to belong to a futuristic city, was now clearly presented before his eyes.  "Hengrui Kala is already quite developed, the enhancement of the Twilight Sanctuary had been overlooked due to the interference of the Underworld's Hand. Now, it's time to deal with it," Lin Sheng thought to himself as he strolled leisurely, soon arriving back at the research center and then to the branch of the sanctuary.  The accumulated holy power in the Twilight Sanctuary was immense, and the grand holy power pool had been in a state of overflow for quite some time. The holy power that diffused even caused faint white fluorescence to shimmer in the air around the sanctuary. That was holy crystal. Whenever the sanctuary needed to use holy power, these crystals would spontaneously transform back into pure holy power.  Lin Sheng walked into the sanctuary without disturbing anyone, quietly arriving at the prayer hall. The hall was empty, and the doors were tightly locked. Normally, no one was allowed to enter or leave outside of prayer times.  Lin Sheng approached the prayer podium and slowly closed his eyes.  Hiss... In the darkness before his eyes, a huge map of Hengrui Kala appeared. The map was like a sandbox, gently rotated clockwise by Lin Sheng's will.  Click... A faint noise emanated from the map as the sandbox-like terrain slowly sank and then split in the middle. The entire map of Hengrui Kala was divided into two, and a gray-black stone pillar rose from the split. There was a clear palm print on the black stone pillar.  "Please verify palm print. To initiate the next phase of advancement, the palm print of the person bound to the sanctuary is required," a gentle female voice rang out again.  Lin Sheng stepped forward and lightly pressed his right hand onto the palm print on the stone pillar.  "Palm print confirmation complete. Welcome to the selection interface," the voice announced.  In an instant, a new tree diagram appeared before Lin Sheng's eyes. Starting with the words "Twilight Sanctuary," lines extended upward, forming six different branches.  'Addable divine techniques: 1——Wish Power Sanctuary. (Can absorb the power of living beings' wishes to create illusory lamp spirits.) (Illusory Lamp Spirits: Level 8 energy beings, adept at long-range magical control and attacks.) Holy power required: 50,000. Can be upgraded up to three levels.  2——Crimson Dusk Pool. (Absorbs the power of dusk to taint and transform a special holy power pool. The water can transform ordinary beings into special holy light creatures with a certain chance.) (Holy Light Creatures: Affinity with holy power, possessing strong physiques and regenerative abilities.) Holy power required: 10,000. Can be upgraded up to three levels.  3——Protection Ring. (Uses a large amount of holy crystals to condense into a solid form, creating a special force field that protects all beings within the sanctuary. The force field can protect the followers by reducing spiritual and soul-based attacks.) Holy power required: 100,000. Can be upgraded up to three levels.  4——Holy River Convergence. (The vast holy power is liquefied and taints the land, making the beings born in this land naturally more attuned to holy power and better suited for cultivating holy power.) Holy power required: 1,000,000. Not upgradable.  5——Judgment Light. (Combines the power of dusk with the vast accumulation of the holy power pool, using the holy chant as the activation key, can instantly judge and attack any existence within the sanctuary's range. The might of the Judgment Light corresponds to the amount of holy power accumulated in the pool. The more holy power, the stronger the might.) (Please note that the authorization for Judgment Light can only be given to three individuals. Releasing the Judgment Light once will consume all the stored holy power in the pool. Use with caution.) Holy power required: 1,000,000. Not upgradable.  6——Holy Crystal Pool. (Can increase capacity to 10,000,000. Over a certain period, the holy crystals will spontaneously select individuals with sufficiently pure and strong souls, consuming the holy crystals to transform them into holy spirits.) (Holy Spirits: Strong spiritual lives fused with holy power, retaining all memories and personalities from before, akin to resurrection.) Holy power required: 1,000,000. Not upgradable.'  Lin Sheng noticed at the end of the light screen, there was small text that read, 'These six divine techniques are the final upgradable versions. Once the divine techniques are fully upgraded, the construction of the complete Twilight Sanctuary will be finished. This guide program will self-destruct.'  "Are these the final forms?" Lin Sheng felt a tinge of disappointment. But on second thought, the ritual formation for constructing the sanctuary was actually a product created by the masters from Black Feather City. It wasn't very high-level to begin with. To reach this point was probably already their limit.  He glanced at the grand holy power pool capacity at the bottom. There was precisely one million holy power in total. Without hesitation, he chose the option for the Holy Crystal Pool.  Buzz. It was as if something vibrated in the darkness, then quickly ended. The total amount of holy power instantly dropped to zero. It then quickly rebounded to around 200,000.  "Is this the amount of holy crystals that transformed back?" Lin Sheng guessed.  Two hundred thousand holy power was not a lot, but not a little either. He decided to invest it all into the Protection Ring, upgrading it to level two.  After making his selections, all advancements would be completed in the following days. Lin Sheng exited the operation space. After confirming that both the Hengrui Kala and the Western Lun sanctuaries' headquarters were without issue, he casually returned to the research center. He gave some instructions to the little girl Taozi in the gallery below and then went back through the evil spirit gate to the evil spirit palace.  Now was the critical moment when the last fragment was about to be found, and he needed to stay alert, ready to go in person at any time.  As soon as he stepped into the evil spirit palace, he was immediately presented with military intelligence.  Degar's demonic hand quickly presented the urgent military report. Lin Sheng stood in front of the evil spirit gate, taking the report and scanning it.  'High-level beings have appeared in the Black Desert, the vanguard army has been defeated, and the Centaur King has been seriously injured.'  "Hmm? So soon after entering, they encountered a powerful enemy?" Lin Sheng was somewhat surprised. The strength of the Centaur King was considered average among his forces, stronger than Degar's demonic hand and the Fairy King.  But to be seriously injured right after deployment?  "What's the current situation? Get me in contact with the Centaur King," he casually threw the military report back to Degar's demonic hand.  "The Giant King brothers and Sin Dragon Mother have already gone to support. They should be able to retreat soon," Degar's demonic hand replied.  "Do we know anything about the opponent?" Lin Sheng asked again.  "We've gathered some information," Degar handed over a second report to Lin Sheng.  Lin Sheng took it and after scanning through, he showed a hint of surprise. "Interesting. Quite interesting!" A smile played at the corner of his mouth, unable to hide his cryptic amusement.  Degar quickly said, "The one who defeated the Centaur King is a tall man with a transparent round gem embedded in his chest. He calls himself the Messenger of the Wish Moon Stone, claiming to have received a prophecy to come and exterminate invaders from other realms. After confirming the identities of the Centaur King and the evil spirit army, he immediately launched an attack."  "How did he defeat the Centaur King?" Lin Sheng had a rough guess of the opponent's identity and asked lightly.  "That man's strength is very strong, his martial skills are also very proficient, and most importantly, his resistance is terrifying. Whether it's soul attacks or any other type of elemental magic, none of it works on him. Even if you behead him or take out his heart, it won't kill him. He can recover in an instant. The Centaur King was caught off guard and was seriously injured in a sneak attack," Degar reported.  Lin Sheng nodded. "Tell the Fairy King, the Giant King brothers, and the Sin Dragon Mother to take their forces and enter. I want that man captured alive."  If he wasn't wrong, the last fragment, which seemed to have developed self-awareness, was controlling the powerful being that had been bestowed with power to lie in wait. Because when Lin Sheng sensed it, it also sensed this side and retreated upon contact. At that time, Lin Sheng thought it was a spontaneous energy reaction from the last fragment. He hadn't expected it to be an important manifestation of the last fragment's self-awareness. Chapter 468 Fierce Battle 1  The ancient verses echoed in the sky along with the mysterious melody. At the entrance to the Tower of Heaven in Redon. Huge three-dimensional arrays of white, red, and blue continuously rotated, filled with massive runes and nefarious energies.  Countless energy sources surged from inside the Tower of Heaven, guiding various energy particles from around the world to converge here. Thousands of arrays condensed into a final, immensely large sealing array.  To deal with a powerful being like Farudo, sealing was the best method. The methods Lin Sheng could think of, the Tower of Heaven naturally could too, and they did it even better. They had gathered many blood descendants with sealing blood many years ago.  Now, suddenly using it was an indescribable surprise attack for Farudo. At this moment, his body was suspended in mid-air, his expression solemn as he looked down. The gigantic array with a diameter of thousands of meters perfectly surrounded him at the center.  Outside the array, strands of massive energy, like countless threads, converged and bound around him. Even fragile spider silk, when converged enough, could far exceed steel cables. Let alone the nefarious energy threads condensed by these arrays now.  Countless nefarious energy threads, under the condensation of the Tower of Heaven and guided by the remaining several Archons, faintly revealed translucent angels with double wings on their backs.  "Angels? Heh, it's been many years since I've seen such a scene..." Farudo looked at the scene before him, suddenly feeling somewhat nostalgic.  "But, using angels to seal me? Do you think I'm that simple? A thousand years ago, I could slaughter angels single-handedly, not to mention now!"  Farudo looked down at his feet, already entwined and bound by numerous transparent threads. The threads there were becoming more and more numerous and dense.  "However, to make even this form of mine feel somewhat troubled, you can indeed be proud." He raised his right hand.  "Curse Word·Primordial Stone Power."  "Curse Word·Godspeed."  "Curse Word·Glow of Fear."  "Curse Word·Spiritual Assassination."  "Advanced Enhancement·Ambrose's Divine Tile."  "Advanced Enchantment·Netherworld Light."  His lips moved slightly, and within a mere two seconds, a great number of magic words and spell texts immediately took effect. His body sparked with various energy flows like electricity.  Hiss... At the same time, around him in the void, four slender and sharp spears appeared centered on him.  The spears were translucent, with ribbon-like runes revolving around the tips.  Shick!! In an instant, the four spears disappeared from their original spots, appearing among the crowds at the four directions of the array on the ground.  Boom boom boom boom!!! The crowds exploded into transparent shockwaves in an instant.  "This is an attack targeting the spiritual soul, it can't be blocked, it can't be avoided. One can only endure." Farudo smiled.  As the crowd below dispersed, many people were even dizzy from the spiritual explosion. The operation of the array slowed down for a moment.  "I will intercept his attack. The rest of you, continue!" An elder from the Tower of Heaven gestured and shouted loudly.  He took a step forward, and his upper body clothes suddenly burst, revealing the silver-white close-fitting armor underneath.  "Ice Dragon Armor Technique!"  He spread his arms, and a massive amount of green nefarious energy flashed behind him, and a grey-black vortex suddenly appeared above his head.  The vortex seemed to pour out a vast amount of pale green nefarious energy like sea water. As soon as the nefarious energy fell, it turned into hard cold white ice under some strange power, covering the elder's body.  Soon his entire body grew rough and sharp white ice spikes, all of which together formed his strongest defense, the Ice Dragon Armor Technique!  "Intercept me?" Farudo chuckled.  "If you know that I am an official of the Netherworld's curse words, then you should also know that what I'm best at is not fighting head-on..."  He lifted his head, his white hair rapidly growing longer and denser, weaving into a huge grey-black half-giant in the sky. This grey-black giant had a single horn on its head, muscles twisted like tree roots, and a pair of tiny wings almost growing out of its back. It also held a huge black stone pillar in its hands.  "Netherworld Pillar Bearer. Go, destroy this place!" Farudo said calmly.  Heh... The grey-black giant behind him gently responded and flew forward, its hair breaking and accelerating rapidly, smashing down towards the array on the ground like a meteorite.  But quickly, an Archon from below leaped into the sky, using a delicate and ancient giant tower shield to accurately block the Netherworld Pillar Bearer.  Unconcerned that the summoned creature was blocked, Farudo considered it a minor character he casually called forth. The reason he summoned this minor character was to buy time for his subsequent actions.  "Madoluene, Deep River Fang Bearer, Chief of Ambush, Flowing Shadow Beast, my most loyal first mate. In my name, Farudo, I summon you to descend here!!"  He loudly recited the full name and true name of another powerful being. True names are not so easy to recite. This kind of imprint engraved into the depths of the soul is a unique representation in space and time. When reciting, one must imagine the complete image of the other party, as well as most of the other party's powers, deeds, history, characteristics, etc. Finally, with the other party's permission, the summoning can be completed in the form of a true name.  And that is what Farudo was doing now. Only, what normally would require a lot of preparatory work and a significant consumption of resources and manpower for the ritual, he had drastically reduced and simplified with his powerful curse word ability, eventually forming this easy-to-use verbal summoning.  As Farudo's summoning incantation went on, a two-meter-tall male warrior with thirteen pairs of arms on his back gradually began to appear behind him. The warrior wore rough leather armor, barefoot, and his armor was tattered, as if he had worn it for a long time without repair. Most notably, the man had two faint purple curved and slender blades on his back.  The summoned man seemed mindless, with blood-red eyes. As soon as he appeared, he let out a fierce roar. With a backhand draw of his sword, he slashed downward.  Shick!! Two intersecting X-shaped silver sword lights fell like shooting stars. The sword lights were simple at first, but as the distance grew, they rapidly expanded, replicating and instantly turning into hundreds of blade lights. And each blade light upon landing turned into a tangible silver metallic monster.  These metal monsters had sharp heads like knives, bodies slender like willows, and unmatched speed, like snakes crashing into everyone within the array.  "Kill!!!" A large group of the Tower of Heaven's nefarious energy wielders knew it was a critical moment and resolutely charged forward. The sealing array had lasted so long and had been able to stalemate Farudo until now, which showed it was very effective. Just a bit more effort and perhaps Farudo could be completely sealed back to the Netherworld. Chapter 469: Close Combat 2  Near the battlefield, at the edge of a shallow pit in a clearing, the air imperceptibly twisted. A group of men, women, and children of varying attire appeared simultaneously on this chaotic battlefield. Their clothes were diverse; some looked as if they had just left home without having time to change out of their pajamas, some were dressed in racing suits like those worn for motorcycle racing, complete with helmets. Others appeared bewildered, holding a spatula in hand.  "This is the place..." In the crowd, a young man dressed in a white cloak with a handsome appearance looked up at Farudo in the sky.  "So fast? We ran from the border to the river in an instant?" The person holding the spatula was astonished.  "It's just a teleportation array with fixed points," an elderly voice resounded in everyone's ears.  "Now, Farudo is right ahead. The bearers of the Destiny Holy Artifacts, how you decide and act is all in a moment's thought. Your fate is for you to determine."  "Heh, that sounds nice. You've forcibly brought us here; can we even leave if we don't participate?" A woman in pajamas said coldly.  "Alright, now that we are here, I'm sure everyone understands our purpose. In fact, there are heroic spirits within the Destiny Holy Artifacts themselves. As long as we get close to Farudo and activate the power, then let the heroic spirits take over," said a burly old man wearing sunglasses gravely.  "No matter what, since we have come, it means that you have all made your resolution," Adolf looked at the others and remained silent. He gazed at Farudo in the sky and suddenly felt homesick. The elders in the temple, his praying companions, and the Night King who absolutely didn't want to get out of bed...  "Let's go. How to summon the heroic spirits within us, the Holy Artifacts will tell us the answer," the man with sunglasses said in a deep voice, being the first to head in the direction of Farudo. The rest fell silent and hurriedly followed.  Adolf was somewhat puzzled, though. These people claimed to have Destiny Holy Artifacts on them. But he himself was carrying a Holy Artifact, and logically, he should be able to resonate with them. Yet here, he had not felt the slightest aura from these people, only the presence of Destiny Treasures. Although curious, he figured that no one would joke with their lives so foolishly, so he guessed there might be some method unknown to him that could conceal their presence.  ...  Boom! In the desert sky, thunder rolled like rolling boulders, crushing across the thick clouds overhead.  In the black desert, the atmosphere was oppressive and somber. On the sandy ground, hordes of evil spirits ran or flew, with fairy warriors closely following, all charging towards the desert camp's army.  The desert army was predominantly white, clad in special armor imbued with some kind of extraordinary ability. The evil spirit army was a mixed black and red corps, a hybrid of pure soul life and flesh life, forming a unique and powerful three-dimensional attack pattern. Evil spirits used long-range attacks, while up close, fairy warriors engaged in hand-to-hand combat.  The soldiers in the desert, aside from their armor, were only a little stronger than ordinary people, whether in body or soul, and were very ordinary. Facing the three-dimensional attack, they suffered heavy casualties and were forced to retreat.  Lin Sheng rode on Blood Demon, walking slowly but straight into the battlefield. None of the evil spirits or the opposing army's soldiers could approach within ten meters of him.  On a dune in front, the Giant King brothers were jointly battling the mysterious desert powerhouse. The fight had been going on for a long time. This time, having learned some of the opponent's secrets, the Giant King brothers were much more cautious. The man with the gem embedded in his chest, having reappeared, had several powerful-looking warriors emerge from his army's ranks.  These warriors had small, delicate green wings on their backs, like willow leaves, hanging down when not in use, barely noticeable as part of their bodies.  Lin Sheng quietly watched the battle, with the Fairy King and Sin Dragon Mother standing quietly beside him, both with calm expressions, also observing the Giant King brothers.  In the opposing camp, several strong souls glanced over at Lin Sheng's side and stood off against them. However, as soon as their eyes met Lin Sheng's, they recoiled as if shocked by electricity, not daring to probe further.  "It's too slow," Lin Sheng remarked, looking toward the Sin Dragon Mother.  She immediately understood. As a member of the Fate Corpse Dragon race, skilled in magical rituals and formations, the Sin Dragon Mother had instinctively released a charming spell when she first saw Lin Sheng, which had been unsuccessful but had left a deep impression on him.  The Dragon Mother stepped forward, a purple magic circle appeared under her feet, and in a blink of an eye, she was teleported into the middle of the battlefield. She appeared behind the desert powerhouse, caught him off guard, and lightly touched the back of his head with her finger. A circle of purple light burst open, transforming into complicated array patterns, sealing on the back of the man's head. The man immediately felt dizzy, his eyes rolled back, and he collapsed to the ground.  "Doesn't it seem very easy?" she said with a smile, looking at the Giant King brothers.  Pfft! In an instant, an axe was viciously swung from behind her. The Sin Dragon Mother's slender waist was chopped, and she was knocked over ten meters away into another dune.  "Idiot!" the Black Giant King sneered coldly, raising his fist and rushing towards the desert man who was regaining consciousness. Their colliding fields of force warped the air and crashed into each other, causing a large wave of sand.  Ah!!! The Sin Dragon Mother, humiliated in public and her dress destroyed, furiously burst out of the sand dune, her body swelling and enlarging dramatically. In an instant, a massive dragon over ten meters long stood on all fours and roared ferociously at the desert man.  Buzz! The dragon's body was black, resembling a giant lizard with a pair of wings on its back that seemed to have atrophied into two spine-like protrusions. She opened her mouth to roar, and a large amount of fine gray mist sprayed out. The mist touched the ground, turning the sand into gray stone. On contact with corpses, they too turned into stone sculptures.  Two more people flew up behind the desert man, heading towards the Sin Dragon Mother with a solemn air, their hands emanating a golden glow that neutralized the petrifying breath. Both joined the battle, blocking her.  "With so many strong fighters... it looks like they're well-prepared," Lin Sheng said through his thick visor.  "You go too," he said, turning to Tian Gongxia who had followed him.  "I hope I can swing my sword a few more times," Tian Gongxia licked her lips and strode towards the battlefield. Lin Sheng, however, did not watch the battle but shifted his gaze to the northwest. There, a power wave similar to his own was stealthily observing the battle here.  "The last fragment?" Lin Sheng's lips curled.  "Launch the full assault. Fairy King."  "The battle there hasn't been decided yet. A full assault now might cause friendly fire," the Fairy King advised in a low voice.  "Do as I say," Lin Sheng was unmoved.  Swoosh! Suddenly, a sharp sound exploded behind him. Lin Sheng immediately felt a chill from the back of his heart. His force field was instantly breached, and the assassin's weapon penetrated the gaps in his Dawn Heavy Armor, piercing his skin. Chapter 470: Fierce Battle 3  Thud. The sound of the assassin's sharp blade, as precise as it could be, stabbing at Lin Sheng's back, was akin to chopping wood. Surprisingly, it didn't pierce through. Everything came to a standstill in an instant. The blade was stiffly stuck in the armor's gap, unable to move. At the same time, a massive and extremely dense natural force field suddenly replaced the previously calm and somewhat ordinary force field.  Lin Sheng didn't turn his head; instead, he struck back with a palm. His hand moved incredibly fast; as soon as it was raised, it had already instantly penetrated the assassin's chest. "This time, the assassin's strength is not bad," he murmured as he shook off the corpse, and his white holy power flashed past, instantly purifying the blood and dirt on his hand.  Wooooo! Amid the long sound of the horn, all the armies of the Evil Spirit Palace surged forward. The reserve legion in the rear began to move quietly and swiftly. The army, almost endless at a glance, suddenly engulfed and scattered the opposing desert legion like a tidal wave. Lin Sheng didn’t bother with the outcome; instead, he rode the Blood Demon step by step toward the direction where the aura fluctuations were coming from.  Every step the Blood Demon took seemed slow, but in reality, it was incredibly fast. This strong and burly Evil Spirit powerhouse carried Lin Sheng towards that direction. Soon, he had crossed several sand dunes, leaving everyone behind.  The Blood Demon automatically stopped at the edge of a dark green oasis, looking at the three people standing by the oasis from afar. These were three powerful desert warriors, each with a red gem embedded in their chests. The three of them looked at Lin Sheng solemnly.  This enemy they had been waiting to ambush was dressed in heavy armor, riding a black warhorse that was so strong it didn’t look like a horse at all, and even the horse was draped in thick armor. Before they even got close, they felt a suffocating pressure envelop them.  "Evil demon! It's him!" The only woman among them said coldly. "The Moonstone has lured him here for us! Kill!!" She drew the curved sword from her back, blue electricity flickering and leaping around her body as she charged toward Lin Sheng first.  At the same time, the other two men drew their swords and attacked from two other directions. The three coordinated seamlessly, as if they had been fighting together for many years. Three streaks of purple lightning surged from the three long swords, roaring into three lightning dragons that rushed towards Lin Sheng.  Several robed women quickly emerged from the bushes in the distant oasis. They chanted under their breaths, and a mysterious power fluctuation suddenly descended from midair, instantly suppressing most of the dark rotational force field protecting Lin Sheng.  "Oh?" Lin Sheng raised an eyebrow, "No wonder you dare to lure me out. It turns out there really is a way to suppress the protective force on my body."  He remained on horseback, facing several attacks and suddenly grabbed with his hand. Shiiing! Highly condensed holy power suddenly turned into a three-meter-long giant sword in his hand. Whoosh! The holy power giant sword slashed towards the three people coming at him.  Before the sword even touched their blades, an invisible and terrifying force field firmly suppressed the lightning dragons released by the three. Puff puff puff! The three lightning dragons collapsed in the blink of an eye. The giant sword, with its terrifying force, slammed down in front of the first woman who narrowly dodged.  Boom!!! A ten-meter-long pitch-black crack appeared out of thin air in front of Lin Sheng. He pulled out the giant sword and looked down from a height at the female swordsman who had just dodged by a hair’s breadth.  "What just dodged my attack? What power was that?" "Answer me!" He opened his eyes and swung his sword into the air on his right.  Boom!! An invisible wave was instantly shattered and exploded. The robed figures who were casting spells in the distance suddenly spewed blood from their mouths, fell to the ground weakened, their faces pale as paper.  "Evil demon!! This is the birthplace of the Moonstone, known as the original pool of the Immaculate Land! Regret it, daring to come here alone. Next year on this day will be your death anniversary!!" Another imposing elder emerged from the depths of the oasis.  The elder held a giant war hammer in each hand. Each war hammer was almost as big as an adult. The two war hammers together, just by their appearance, were clearly no ordinary weight. The elder's hair was all braided into tiny braids, with a messy beard draped over his chest, wearing a somewhat ancient and fierce black armor, in sharp contrast to Lin Sheng's pure white armor.  "At such an old age, instead of enjoying peace at home, you come here to seek death." Lin Sheng's eyes flickered with interest as he sized up the elder.  "I am five hundred and four years old this year, and I just had my birthday not long ago. I never expected that at the end of my life, the heavens would bestow upon me a great battle," the elder laughed heartily.  "If you want to kill me, let's see if you have the ability!" Behind him, a tiger's roar sounded, and a huge, majestic pitch-black tiger appeared out of nowhere. The tiger seemed to be already equipped with armor and weapons. He mounted the tiger, wielded the war hammer with a heavy strike.  "My head is here, come and take it!!" With a fierce roar, the elder spurred the tiger to leap forward, jumping high and covering more than ten meters to pounce towards Lin Sheng.  Lin Sheng narrowed his eyes, clearly sensing a strong fragment fluctuation vibrating and spreading from the elder's body.  "Putting all the treasures on this old guy?" He sneered and lifted the sword for a slash!  Whoosh!! Boom!!!!!! The blade brought out a streak of white light, suddenly colliding with the war hammer coming from above. A transparent ripple exploded from between the two, scattering in all directions. Where the ripple passed, the ground's gravel flew, and the shrubs of the oasis were torn and cut apart. It was as though an invisible blade had cut through everything in the blink of an eye.  The strength of this elder was astonishing. To confront Lin Sheng head-on and not be outdone was a shock to Lin Sheng's heart. He had almost given up half of his human bloodline to break through the limit in exchange for the blood of a rock dragon. With the blood of a rock dragon, he was almost as powerful as half a rock dragon. Yet in this situation, this old man could stand against him?  His heart was taken aback, but his hands did not stop. The giant holy sword, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, constantly collided with the war hammer.  The two realized the other was a formidable enemy they had rarely encountered in their lives. The elder, as an undefeated war god in this realm of evil spirits, had been invincible for hundreds of years, with no one ever surpassing him. Whether it was martial arts or physical strength, he had reached the limit of what humans could achieve. But unexpectedly, the man before him could contend with him head-on and even slightly suppress him.  Lin Sheng, with the soul memories of countless fierce battles merged, was extremely experienced in combat and proficient in many sword techniques and killing moves. Because he used to be able to easily resolve battles with other powers, he seldom had the chance to use his exaggerated martial prowess. But now, as his protective forces were suppressed and he temporarily did not want to reveal his trump cards, he wanted to first figure out the details of the opponent. So he only used his physical martial arts.  Unexpectedly, he was blocked by this old man?  The two wielding heavy weapons exchanged blows like lightning. The giant sword and war hammer collided and blocked each other, emitting terrifying shockwaves of destruction. Within a radius of several tens of meters, it had become a death zone. Chapter 471: Conflict 1  Adolf gazed at Farudo, who was continuously sealed in mid-air. A sense of ominous premonition grew heavier in his heart. However, this premonition was not something he could easily discuss with others. At this point, they were bound by the so-called righteousness of the human race. Whether they were willing or not, they were forced to this stage. If he suddenly said he had a bad feeling and wanted to withdraw, no one knew what the outcome would be.  The group quietly approached the sealed battlefield, concealed by the ability of a Destiny Sacred Artifact that provided stealth. From a distance, it didn't seem dangerous. But as they drew closer, they felt the dangers of the battlefield. The chaotic energy fluctuations collided and compressed against each other. The energies of different people contained their wills. Energies determined by different wills, like soldiers, clashed and fought against each other. Standing merely a hundred meters away from the battlefield, they could feel the ground shaking with every intense explosion. The cries of battle and the roars of monsters came in waves, one after another. Just standing at the edge of the battlefield made Adolf's scalp tingle. Not just him, the others who accompanied him also felt weak in the knees, pale-faced. They lived in a peaceful environment without the experience of battlefields, and now they were abruptly facing this supernatural and fierce war.  Looking at the battlefield's edge littered with severed limbs, flesh, and viscera, as well as the carcasses of ferocious, sharp monsters, one of the women in pajamas couldn't help but start retching.  "Alright, let's not delay any longer. We just need to activate the power of the Destiny Sacred Artifact and then converge it together, right?" said the leading old man in a deep voice.  "Yes. After that, the heroic spirits will take over everything," the voice of the Great Sage echoed in everyone's ears again.  "Then, let's begin," the old man turned back and looked at the others.  Everyone heard the voice of the Great Sage and knew what they needed to do next. Adolf stood among the crowd and nodded slightly. Together with everyone, he began to release his internal power. However, as he did so, the sense of foreboding in his heart became even clearer.  ...  "Kill!!" In the black desert.  Two tall figures once again swung their weapons and collided fiercely. The clash of the blades emitted a sharp, piercing sound. The elder, wielding his weapon with overwhelming force, pressed down hard.  Boom!! The black behemoth under the elder couldn't bear the load and let out a piteous cry, its front legs kneeling on the sandy ground.  The elder's expression changed drastically. They had been fighting for at least three hours. Yet, the demon opposite him not only showed no signs of exhaustion, but his strength seemed to be growing stronger, fighting more vigorously as the battle went on. Any wounds inflicted on the opponent would heal in a short time. Moreover, the heavy white armor worn by the adversary was incredibly difficult to penetrate. Even as a War God, he had never seen a fighter maintain such high-intensity combat for so long.  If it were his younger days, perhaps he could have persisted twice as long. But things were different now. He was old.  "What a pity, the power of the Wish Moonstone has suddenly disappeared. Otherwise, my power would be far greater than it is now," he said as he pushed back his opponent and retreated dozens of meters with the giant tiger.  "Wish Moonstone? Where do you think the power of the Wish Moonstone has gone? If not for it, would my strength be limited to this?" Lin Sheng also sneered in response.  "Alright. You should understand by now what the Wish Moonstone has brought you here for," he said with an implication.  The elder was slightly startled and followed Lin Sheng's gaze around him. He saw that many of his companions, who were previously lively and unharmed, were now affected by the aftermath, with heavy casualties. He suddenly had a bad feeling.  "Or do you really think that it wants you to eliminate me? In other words, do you really believe that you people could kill me?" Lin Sheng spoke loudly.  The elder suddenly noticed a detail. On several bodies on the field, the Wish Moonstones on their chests had disappeared, mysteriously missing.  "Could it be...!?" He suddenly thought of the most terrifying possibility.  "You guessed right; it's reclaiming the power it once granted you. If I'm not mistaken, these powers should have already integrated with you. And the only way to take back the power is to kill you," Lin Sheng said with a hint of pity.  The elder also thought of this possibility. However, having possessed the Wish Moonstone for hundreds of years, he did not want to think in that direction.  "Your strength is not bad. Even without the Wish Moonstone, it's extraordinary. Among those at my side, there is only one who can be compared to you," Lin Sheng stated frankly.  So, do you want to come under my command? I will grant you a longer lifespan. In return, you fight for me."  This old man's strength was indeed strong. Among those around Lin Sheng, only Tian Gongxia could be compared to him.  The elder's weapon carried an indescribable enormous impact. This impact was different from the Giant King's vibrational force. He could enhance the power of smashing, hitting, and hammering techniques to the extreme. Moreover, it seemed that the elder had cultivated an ability to resist various energy resistances.  Therefore, this guy was essentially a powerful berserker with advanced magic resistance. His strength was too strong, making the force fields used by the others seem like thin bubbles that would burst upon contact.  "Moreover... I was just playing with you before," Lin Sheng shook his slightly cracked holy light greatsword, condensing and restoring it to its pristine condition.  Scales and sharp spiral horns extended from his body. His figure also rapidly expanded and grew, becoming at least half a size larger than before.  "Now, enjoy the battle!!" With a dragon's roar, he charged towards the elder on his steed, swinging his greatsword like a flash of white light, and struck the elder's shoulder with a thunderous impact.  The speed of this sword strike was so fast that the elder, still reeling from his previous shock, had not had time to react before being hit.  His strength had actually reached a level close to that of Tian Gongxia. Yet even at that level, he was no match for Lin Sheng at this moment. His strength had skyrocketed to an unimaginable level after obtaining the Yin-turning Evil Wheel. Most of the protections from the Eighty-Eight Blessings were suppressed by the Wish Moonstone, but the essential changes and enhancements to Lin Sheng's own being were still present.  The speed and power of this sword strike had reached the limit that the surrounding air could accommodate. When the sword was swung, the excessive speed generated a tremendous thunderous noise, accompanied by flames and lightning from the friction.  Only when the elder was struck by the sword did the sound of Lin Sheng's strike reach his ears.  The elder, along with the giant tiger, burst into a mass of crisp sounds, smashed forcefully into the sand by the greatsword, unable to move.  He couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood, his will to fight already lost due to the Wish Moonstone's sinister intentions. After being struck by this sword, he found it even harder to continue.  "So you're saying, you're not a demon? The Wish Moonstone is?" he asked with a bitter smile, wiping the blood from his mouth.  "Of course, I am the Holy Spirit King. My vast holy power originates from the power to heal and save living beings. How could I possibly be a demon?" Lin Sheng said earnestly. Chapter 472: Conflict 2  "The Holy Spirit King....." The elder still had doubts in his heart. However, the Wish Moonstone Crystal on his chest, which kept trying to break free, forced him to make a choice at this moment. It was a choice between dying in a meaningless battle for the Wish Moonstone or temporarily setting aside his doubts and submitting to the other party. The answer was self-evident.  "Have you made up your mind?" Lin Sheng could already see the elder's decision in his eyes.  "Can you give me some time?" the elder asked with a wry smile.  "Of course. Those who are outstanding and capable deserve preferential treatment," Lin Sheng said with a smile.  There was no longer a reason for the two to fight. The elder no longer had any hostility.  After being healed by Lin Sheng with holy power, the elder experienced the strong healing capabilities of the holy power for himself. His belief in Lin Sheng's claim to be the Holy Spirit King was further solidified.  The elder's name was Ning Jia. He detailed the situation of the desert for Lin Sheng. Long ago, a divine stone known as the Wish Moonstone fell from the sky, teaching countless people a cultivation method called Wish Moon Power.  Lin Sheng inquired carefully about the cultivation method of Wish Moon Power.  He then obtained something called a Wish Moonstone Crystal from Ning Jia. It was the red gemstone embedded in his chest.  As expected, the so-called Wish Moonstone Crystal was actually a part of the Wish Moonstone itself. It was a sub-entity intentionally absorbing the life force cultivated by these people.  Holding the crystal, Lin Sheng had elder Ning Jia lead the way to other places to search for the original landing site of the Wish Moonstone.  At the landing site, Ning Jia finally saw the many Wish Moon Power cultivators who had died without any battle, simply collapsing to the ground.  The Wish Moonstone had not only absorbed their Wish Moonstone Crystals but also their entire life force.  This made Ning Jia truly see the true face of the Wish Moonstone. Under the recovery of Lin Sheng's holy power, he finally resolved to lead the army of the Evil Spirit Palace to turn against and campaign against the Wish Moonstone.  The campaign did not last long.  After Ning Jia defected, under his considerable reputation and connections, and with the continuous appearance of many corpses drained of their Wish Moonstone Crystals, the entire desert secret realm began to become the Evil Spirit Palace's guide at an exaggerated pace.  Although Ning Jia no longer had the Wish Moonstone Crystal, Lin Sheng also bestowed upon him a seed of holy power. His soul was strong and tenacious to the extent that even the Wish Moonstone could not absorb it through the air, and his cultivation of holy power advanced by leaps and bounds.  Moreover, the effect of the holy power nourished his aging body in return.  Although he lost the cultivation he had accumulated for a long time, the characteristics of holy power compensated him in terms of pure strength and physical power.  Thus, his strength did not decline too much. He was still capable of defeating anyone aside from Tian Gong Xia and other ranked envoys. He was even a notch stronger than the Sin Dragon Mother.  After cultivating holy power, he truly became another top powerhouse under Lin Sheng's command.  The Evil Spirit Palace's army no longer had a reason to fight, and most began to withdraw slowly.  With the support of the war god elder Ning Jia, the power of the Black Desert was fully mobilized.  Many who were not qualified to cultivate the Wish Moonstone Crystal, as well as powerhouses like Ning Jia who were too strong to be absorbed by the Wish Moonstone from afar, automatically joined Ning Jia's forces under panic and a shared enemy, becoming a subsidiary force of the Evil Spirit Palace.  They led Lin Sheng directly to the location of the Wish Moonstone in the secret realm of the desert—Black Gold City.  Now their intention to destroy the Wish Moonstone was even stronger than Lin Sheng's.  After all, this was now a matter of life and death for them.  And at this moment in reality, the sealing battle at Redwing had come to a close after several days of stalemate.  Redwing had officially switched its allegiance to the Underworld.  The entrance to Heaven Tower was tightly closed, and the plains outside were a mess of wreckage.  There were no bones to be seen, nor traces of the previous formations.  Everything had turned into a massive change. The land seemed to be completely covered by a thick layer of red soil.  The red soil buried and erased all traces.  Some strong beings of evil power crossed the Black Tide monster tribes to investigate the situation at Heaven Tower, but the maze was sealed, and no fluctuations of aura could enter.  And the unparalleled giant demon Farudo had also disappeared without a trace.  Some speculated that the sealing might have been successful. Others guessed that Farudo might have entered the secret realm.  But no matter what, the world had temporarily calmed down.  ................ ................ Heaven Tower Secret Realm.  In the towering white spires of the forest, inside the Ice and Snow Council Hall, which belonged to the deepest part of Heaven Tower.  The Council Hall had now completely become a dark abyss filled with grey-black smoke and Underworld energy.  Stone pillars rose from the ground, topped with dark red chains, binding one naked, howling person after another.  These living people were all strong beings of evil power who once belonged to Heaven Tower.  They were unwilling to submit to Farudo, and Farudo did not care about these trash, as subduing them would waste his time.  He simply turned them into Underworld pillars to accumulate energy for himself to open the channel to the Underworld.  This war made him realize that attacking a secret realm was somewhat troublesome.  Therefore, he decided to immediately open a channel, bring down a projection of part of his true body, and strengthen himself once more.  But before that, he had to deal with some unexpected little surprises he had caught.  He quickly walked into the rear side of the Council Hall, where there was a small rest area meant for temporary accommodation for those waiting.  Now, it had been transformed by him into a special experimental site.  Six people, six ordinary humans with special powers in their bodies, were captured by him on the edge of the battlefield.  At that time, he had just crushed the entire power of Heaven Tower, and then he encountered this group of sneaky little fellows on the side, who released a faint malice towards him.  To his age, these people indeed could be called little fellows. After all, their ages didn't even amount to a fraction of his.  He was very interested in the strange powers these people possessed.  So after confirming they posed no threat, he easily defeated them all, brought them into Heaven Tower, and left them here.  Farudo activated the Eyes of the Dead. It was a special ability that could, to a certain extent, see through the essence and origins of power, one of the special powers of an Underworld Spell Officer.  The Eyes of the Dead scanned over each person.  Soon, the special power of one of them made him pause slightly.  "What is this? Light? White power?"  Farudo's Eyes of the Dead suddenly stopped on Adolf.  He was attracted by the somewhat dazzling light.  In the gloomy palace, he slowly walked up to this bearer of the Destiny Holy Artifact who had been captured for a long time.  "Tell me, what is this??" He grabbed Adolf's chin and transmitted a stream of Underworld energy to awaken him.  Underworld energy, as a special power only high-ranking beings of the Underworld possessed, had the ability to stimulate potential and temporarily revive. Chapter 473 Conflict 3  Adolf, already seriously injured, was now also starved for a long time, without water for several days. At this point, he was nearly at the end of his tether. He was unclear why in the end, despite all abilities converging, the so-called fated heroic soul still did not appear. But regardless, this was his own choice. He had no regrets.  "Heh..." He forced a faint smile, not wanting to reply at all.  "Admirable spirit," Farudo said with appreciation. "But it's a pity. The stronger a person is, the quicker they tend to die in reality."  "Then... kill me," Adolf said calmly.  He had left in the first place to avoid involving anyone else. Now that everything had reached an outcome he had anticipated, nothing really mattered anymore. He would die. Then all consequences would be borne by him alone, without involving or implicating anyone else.  "Pitiful," Farudo noticed his thoughts. He let go of his grasp, looking at the six fated holy relic holders he had caught.  "Infernal Curse," he raised his right hand. "From order to the chaos of disorder, the shadow of radiance, the land of decay, in the name of Farudo. I hereby summon."  Slowly, a mass of pitch-black hair began to grow in the palm of his hand. The numerous strands of hair, like the deepest black of night, flowed out to cover all the floors around the great hall.  "Infernal master of demonic words, my voice is the voice of the abyss. With flesh and blood as a sacrifice, summon my true form sleeping within the great divine pillar. Let this pact be established."  Farudo lowered his hand, and the hair in his palm was cleanly cut off, scattering on the ground like living creatures, crawling in all directions. He walked slowly towards the six people.  "Evil Soul's Eye." He switched to another type of eye technique. This one was specially used to capture living souls, a special sacrificial eye. It could use the souls captured within it as offerings, amplifying the effect nearly tenfold.  He walked up to the first person, his eyes flashing with triangular pyramid-shaped purple-black patterns, staring at the person's forehead.  Hiss... Soon, a pale, bubble-like blue human figure slowly floated out from the person, then turned into a long thin line, shooting rapidly into Farudo's right eye.  "The first one." He continued towards the second person.  Quickly, another human-shaped soul was slowly drawn out, flying into his right eye and disappearing.  Then the third person.  Xie Qiaoyue leaned against Adolf in a daze, watching Farudo capture souls one by one, her body instantly breaking out in goosebumps, feeling as if she were a lost soul. She too had rushed over because of this summons, but unfortunately was captured before succeeding. Due to a long period without food, she was also at the point of weakness and had no strength to resist.  Quickly, Farudo walked up to her. Those soul-capturing eyes stared straight at her.  Suddenly, he paused slightly, his gaze attracted to Adolf beside her. Seeming hesitant, he still walked over first, standing in front of Adolf. He decided to first absorb this somewhat suspicious fellow to prevent any accidents.  An invisible force of capture began to operate slowly, with Farudo's pupils releasing a strange, eerie force field, enveloping Adolf. This power began to quickly erode Adolf's body, and his soul was drawn out from within.  At that moment.  Shu!! Suddenly, a white light burst forth from Adolf's body.  The light was pure and majestic, with a flash that isolated the soul-capturing power.  Feeling the strength of the capturing force, the white light seemed to be affected, quickly covering Adolf's entire body.  "En!?" Farudo was slightly surprised; was there actually a power that could resist his Evil Soul's Eye?  He operated the Evil Soul's Eye again, increasing the power as he looked towards Adolf.  "Capture!"  The power increased. In an instant, it provoked a reactive stimulation from the white light.  A vague and powerful will, full of defiance, began to slowly awaken from within the light.  "The one who defeated my disciple, is it you?" The will slowly vibrated, expressing consciousness.  "Who are you?" Farudo's gaze sharpened.  The other party was able to demonstrate their own will through pure power. This ability was not something ordinary beings could possess. Clearly, the individual within the white light was no simple character.  "Me? Just a nobody," the consciousness in the white light echoed back. "But since I have awakened. My main body will also sense it."  "So, you can defeat my disciple, but you cannot kill him. A person's life is full of many failures. But as long as he does not die, I can give him another chance."  "Cannot kill him?" Farudo's expression turned into a cold smile.  "This is my advice to you," the consciousness in the white light calmly said. "Other people's lives, even if they fail, will still have many opportunities. But you are different. Since you have encountered me. Then you only have one chance to answer me."  "Very well. Then my answer is." Farudo suddenly stretched out his finger.  Puff.  His fingertip precisely pointed at the center of Adolf's forehead. A surge of dark nether energy rushed in, instantly destroying and mashing Adolf's brain.  "This is my answer." He withdrew his hand. "Capture the soul!"  Suddenly, the invisible soul-capturing force beside him greatly intensified and became stronger. It forcibly began to pull out the pale blue transparent soul from Adolf's body.  As an infernal official of demonic words, Farudo would not care about such a threat. He held no regard for the entire human realm, let alone a mere consciousness hiding within energy.  Accompanied by a piercing scream, the blue soul seemed to be crazily tugged by two forces. The divine light's power was pulling it back into the body, while the Evil Soul's Eye's power was pulling it into the pupil.  "Good! Very good!!" The will within the white light laughed in extreme anger. "We will meet soon."  He gave Farudo a deep look, the divine light's power quickly began to dissipate; this small amount of power was only a part left in Adolf to protect his body, naturally it couldn't withstand Farudo's direct action.  "I will wait for you here."  Farudo smiled, grasping Adolf's soul with one hand, his pupils flashing with deep purple magical array patterns.  ...  ...  Evil Spirit Palace.  Lin Sheng sat on the throne, his hair hanging low, sitting motionless.  Boom!!!  Suddenly, he swept the low table in front of him aside. The violent power of the dragon sent the drinks and cakes placed on top, along with the table, flying and crashing into the palace wall.  A dragon-shaped sculpture carved on the wall had its neck broken and rolled to the ground, scattering debris everywhere.  "Infernal official of demonic words? Farudo??! Heh..."  He stood up, with all his trembling servants kneeling down, he strode towards the inner hall, the Hall of Yin and Yang.  Ever since he had mastered the Yin Evil Wheel, he had been smooth sailing, never encountering any major setbacks. This had somewhat inflated his ego.  But at this moment, that one finger from Farudo made him experience the feeling of defeat he hadn't had for a long time.  It also made him lose a disciple he was very close to forever.  It was his fault. If he hadn't shown up, perhaps Adolf wouldn't have been killed so easily...  Rage boiled in his chest.  Lin Sheng walked into the Hall of Yin and Yang. He started to manipulate the scenery technique set up by the Fairy King. It was a special communication technique that could connect all legion commanders.  He was about to activate the technique with his hand, informing all legion commanders to gather here, ready to officially step into reality.  But a more crazy idea suddenly formed in his mind.  "Protection of Teleportation." He pointed at the ground with his hand. Instantly, a light red vortex door slowly emerged and formed.  Without hesitation, Lin Sheng stepped into it, his figure quickly disappearing into the vortex door. Chapter 475: Rescue 1  Legend has it that this place was born here. History is obliterated here. A huge gray and black vortex eternally rotates in the sky. On the ground, massive dark twisted columns of smoke can be seen everywhere, with faces of agony intermittently visible on the surface, floating up and down within the smoke. These are the countless souls absorbed from other worlds. Among them, some are humans, some are non-humans. But regardless of the race, once their souls arrive here after death, they are destined to become fodder.  Columns of giant black smoke stretch from the earth to the sky, like colossal pillars supporting the heavens and the earth, transforming this entire world into a cavernous space. The Underworld, also known as the Dust World, is a vast world that exists on the reverse side of our world, subsisting for a long time by absorbing numerous souls. To this place, the souls of the world, whether they are good or evil, are considered excellent nourishment for itself.  Columns of pitch-black smoke densely cover the land filled with black cracks. Within one of the thickest smoke columns—Splash! A giant black claw slowly extends from the smoke. The claw has three sharp and thick spikes, followed by a thick and strong gray arm, upper body, and a huge crocodile head. The being that walks out from the smoke column is a towering crocodile man hundreds of meters tall. Its green eyes flicker with a wild and ruthless light, following a faint summons in its consciousness.  It tears open the space in front of it with a swipe of its claw, creating a pitch-black fissure and steps into it slowly. "So soon, Farudo wants to summon more of his essence? Ridiculous, I, Demon Blade Officer Silvis, respond to your request," a vast and indistinct voice reverberates around. Just as it prepares to close the space fissure, a beam of pure white light descends from the sky out of nowhere, accurately landing next to the huge smoke column, right at the edge of the fissure it tore open. The light column, slender and sharp compared to the smoke column, is like a white spike driven into the earth. Although much smaller in volume, its power fluctuations are not weak.  "Is this the Underworld?" As Demon Blade Officer Silvis is taken aback, a deep voice resonates from within the light column. Hiss!!! In an instant, the white light column, like ink dropped into clear water, swiftly spreads out a massive amount of white light patterns. Among the countless light patterns, a knight clad in heavy white armor quietly floats within the light column, slowly rising and falling.  "This place is the Great Divine Pillar, where many of the Underworld's god officials slumber. Who are you?" Demon Blade Officer Silvis, feeling the pure white light's somewhat domineering aura that sweeps through everything, takes the initiative to ask.  "I am the Holy Spirit King!" The pure white knight's body suddenly swells and grows larger, with two sharp spiral horns emerging from his head, and a more terrifying chaotic soul force infinitely mingles with the holy light, spreading outwards in all directions. These holy lights and chaotic soul forces, once entering the Underworld, are like wolves rushing into a flock of sheep, where they meet no resistance in their path of destruction.  Boom!! A massive amount of holy power and chaotic soul force form a formidable force beyond the rank of Emissary, exploding in an instant and radiating to the surrounding hundreds of meters. The area within hundreds of meters is enveloped in white. This causes Demon Blade Officer Silvis, who had somewhat underestimated its size, to immediately become cautious. Instinct tells him that the nature of the opponent's power seems to be very restraining to him. If they really fought, even if he was stronger than his opponent, the outcome might not be optimistic.  "Holy Spirit King? I am the Underworld's vanguard, Demon Blade Officer Silvis!" From within the spatial fissure, the crocodile man steps back out to his original position, looking down from a height at Lin Sheng. Lin Sheng, too, lifts his head to gaze at this towering behemoth. The two have a vast difference in size, yet their auras seem to be evenly matched.  "I have never heard of the title Holy Spirit King, although there is a nearby space where a group claims to be a race of evil spirits." Silvis, having lived a long life, naturally has heard of evil spirits.  "My powers are not yet fully activated, and you, the Demon Speech Officer Farudo of the Underworld, dare to take advantage of my unpreparedness, killing my disciple and seizing his soul!" Lin Sheng coldly says, not directly answering the other's guess.  "Demon Speech Officer Farudo?" Demon Blade Officer Silvis suddenly bursts into laughter. "It seems you are also intending to trouble that fellow. Demon Speech Officer Farudo has quite a few enemies in the Underworld. How about it? Shall we join forces to kill him?"  "Enemy?" Lin Sheng originally thought there would be a great battle upon entering, but he didn't expect to hear such intelligence content right away. Fortunately, they are both top soul force manipulators, and they communicate directly through soul force without worrying about the language barrier. Otherwise, he might really miss important information here.  "That's right," Demon Blade Officer laughs, "otherwise, why do you think so many god officials exist, and yet only he manages to sneak out so quickly? There are not a few god officials inside the Great Divine Pillar that he has offended in the past. It's just that there are too many enemies here, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to mix in. If those god officials knew he sneaked out, they would not let him go easily."  "Is that so?" Lin Sheng's thoughts race in his mind.  "That being said, you should know where Demon Speech Officer Farudo's essence is, right?"  "I don't know. If other god officials could easily find out his essence, Farudo wouldn't have been able to live so well for so many years," Silvis replies with a sneer, "From the fluctuations of your aura, it seems you are not from the human world. We need to find another portal to the human world..."  "I can open a portal to the human world," Lin Sheng states calmly.  "However, since both of us want to kill Farudo, what good plan do you have?"  "There is a plan. Farudo has too many enemies in the Underworld, so he has to find opportunities to escape. This time he found one, so we must strike a fatal blow and completely eradicate his soul. Therefore, the plan cannot be easily told to you," Silvis candidly states.  "I understand," Lin Sheng nods, "But if I help you open a portal to the human world, that should be enough to prove that I am not Farudo's inside man, right?"  "That can work," Demon Blade Officer agrees readily, "As long as you can open the portal to the human world and locate Farudo's essence. I have already pulled in another god official, and we will take action together."  "It would be best to let Farudo completely summon his essence before we act. I want his soul to be annihilated without a trace!" Lin Sheng declares fiercely.  "However, in that case, you must first take us into the human world. Otherwise, if we arrive at the last minute, we won't have enough strength to kill Farudo completely. Even if we can't beat him, as a Demon Speech Officer, his ability to escape is extremely strong. We cannot be the slightest bit negligent," Silvis whispers.  "Okay," Lin Sheng agrees, appearing angry on the surface, but his heart remains undisturbed. This big guy seemingly wants to kill Farudo and also take the opportunity to enter the human world for enjoyment.  What he doesn't realize is that the human world is not actually the most critical threat to the invasion from the Underworld. The most dangerous is actually the Black Tide. The Underworld of the Dust World and the Black Tide are threats of completely different levels. It's just that on the surface, the Underworld's nether energy and death qi look similar to the Black Tide's black qi. But in reality, they are two different types of forces.
