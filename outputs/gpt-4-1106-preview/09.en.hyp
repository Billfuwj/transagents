Chapter 834: Return to the Holy Land (Part Two)  "Vermilion Bird."  Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan was watching Bai Xiaochen and Xiaolong play and frolic. Suddenly, she heard a commotion outside and her eyebrows knitted in slight annoyance: "What's happening outside? Why is there a commotion? You go take a look."  "Yes." Vermilion Bird bowed her fists in acknowledgement, accepted the command, and stepped back. After a while, she pushed open the door of the bamboo house and walked in, hesitating as she spoke: "Queen, there are two people outside, they are here to see you..."  "Looking for me?" Bai Yan raised her eyebrows, "Then I'll go out and take a look, to see who has come to find me."  With that said, she slowly rose from her chair and headed towards the door.  Outside the house, under the blood-red sky, two people were tremblingly crawling over from the front. Perhaps because they had crawled so far, a trail of blood had formed under them, which was particularly glaring in Bai Yan's eyes.  "What are you doing?" Bai Yan frowned and asked in a cold voice.  The second elder's face was pale, and his trembling body was prostrated on the ground, stammering: "Queen, I have come to plead guilty to you. That day, I was too trusting of that imposter, which led the Queen to misunderstand the King. It was all my fault, I am willing to take any punishment or scolding, please punish me."  "No, Queen, it's my fault. I failed to convey the King's orders to you. In fact, that day the King left the palace to lift the seal on the demon realm, and he asked me to come back and inform the Queen. I failed to do so, which gave the villain an opportunity."  Huoyu knelt on the ground, his face covered in tears: "It's all my fault. If the Queen wishes to hit or scold me, I will not utter a word of complaint."  He took the bamboo strip from behind him into his hands, held it with both palms, and presented it in front of Bai Yan, deeply bowing his head, his face resigned to his fate.  Bai Yan's hand slowly grasped the bamboo strip that Huoyu had dragged in front of her. Her expression was indifferent, and her eyes shone with an inscrutable light.  Feeling the bamboo strip leaving his hands, Huoyu's body stiffened. He clenched his teeth tightly, waiting for that powerful strike.  But...  For a long time, there was no pain.  Huoyu looked up in astonishment, only to see the bamboo strip in Bai Yan's hand burst into flames and quickly turned to ash.  "You two have suffered a lot on your way here?"  "Queen... Queen?" Huoyu looked at Bai Yan, puzzled by the meaning of her words.  "If that's the case, then you have already repaid your sins. Get up."  Bai Yan has always been a person of clear principles.  She only targets those who fantasize about harming her.  That day, even she was deceived, so how could she blame the Great Elder and Huoyu? Therefore, she has never resented them...  Huoyu's body was as stiff as iron, unable to believe that Bai Yan would let them off so easily. Before coming here, they had prepared themselves for severe injuries! Now, she hadn't even whipped them once, and had already absolved them of their sins.  Seeing the two still dumbly kneeling on the ground and not moving, Bai Yan's face sank slightly: "What? Are you waiting for me to help you up?"  The woman's sharp voice entered Huoyu's ears, startling him into immediately climbing up from the ground. His trousers were covered in blood, and he could barely stand steady.  Even so, he still stood on the ground, his legs continuously trembling, and he did not kneel down again.  Bai Yan glanced at the two who could hardly support themselves and pointed to the stone seats on the ground: "Sit down and rest for a while, then you can leave the mountain." Chapter 835: Return to the Holy Land (Part Three)  Huoyu was moved to tears, he touched the corner of his eyes where tears had emerged, his pale face was full of gratitude. "Your Highness, the great kindness you have shown to Huoyu, I will never forget it in this lifetime." If the Queen had not forgiven him, the King would not have possibly kept him in the Demon Realm. So, it was her magnanimity that had helped him.  "It is not your fault to begin with, I myself was deceived, how could I blame you?" Bai Yan gave a bitter smile, "Moreover, I know your sincerity towards the Demon Realm, as long as you remain loyal to Emperor Cang, that is enough."  The Second Elder slowly walked to the stone seat and sat down, his gaze full of remorse: "The Queen is not willing to blame us, that is her magnanimity, but I will not forgive my own actions. From now on, I will dedicate all my loyalty to the King and Queen."  Bai Yan sighed softly, "Here are two healing pills for your injuries, your wounds will heal after taking them. Suzaku does not like to be disturbed, you should leave the mountain early."  After giving them the pills, she turned and walked into the bamboo house. Suzaku did not enter the house with her; after seeing the Second Elder taking the pills, she lifted her leg and kicked him fiercely.  The kick flipped the Second Elder to the ground, fortunately, he had already taken the medicine, so he did not suffer much harm.  "Suzaku my lord."  The Second Elder was at a loss, looking pitifully at Suzaku with a hopeful expression.  "Why didn't you come to ask me when that incident happened?" Suzaku gritted her teeth and reprimanded angrily.  The Second Elder shuddered and timidly replied, "It was the King... Oh, no, it was that imposter who did not allow me to tell anyone, including the First Elder and Suzaku my lord, he was afraid the Queen would hear about it."  "Idiot!" Suzaku glared at the Second Elder with rage, "If it wasn't for the Queen who has already forgiven you, I would not want to go against the Queen's wishes, just now, it would not have been just that simple kick! Now that your injuries have mostly healed, get out of here!"  Upon hearing this, the two of them ran swiftly towards the base of the Holy Mountain, disappearing without a trace in an instant.  After they disappeared, Suzaku finally pushed the door and entered, she looked towards Bai Yan, who was smiling, her fiery red eyes showed a touch of grievance: "Your Highness, I just couldn't stand his foolish behavior, you... are you not blaming me?"  Bai Yan shook her head helplessly with a light laugh, "You were just angry, now that you've let out your anger, do you feel better?"  Suzaku immediately nodded, and her gaze became cautious, "Your Highness, since you've returned to the Demon Realm this time, will you... not leave again?"  Upon hearing this, Bai Yan paused and her lips curved into a smile: "Unfortunately, I need to leave the Demon Realm for a while, but I will come back soon."  Suzaku, who was originally disappointed, suddenly beamed with joy upon hearing Bai Yan's words. Her eyebrows and eyes were very beautiful, and her clothing formed from flames was dazzlingly gorgeous.  "Your Highness, I can't leave the Holy Mountain right now, but after you find Xuanwu, remember to bring them all back to me, then, I will be able to leave this place..."  Just like a thousand years ago, to accompany you on the battlefield!  It seemed that recalling the scenes of the past, Suzaku's eyes showed a hint of yearning, as if through the blood-red sky, she saw the glory and passion of those days... Chapter 836: Return to the Holy Land (Part Four) She believed that one day, she would be able to reunite with her brothers, and... the former queen would make a strong return!  "Chen'er, Xiao Long'er, let's go." Bai Yan smiled gently, leading Bai Xiao Chen with one hand and holding Xiao Long'er's little hand with the other, her eyes brimming with laughter.  "Mother, where are we going?" Bai Xiao Chen blinked his bright, innocent eyes curiously, tilting his little head to look at Bai Yan.  "We're going to find your father..." Bai Yan paused for a moment, "Now that the crisis in the Demon Realm has been resolved, I want to make a trip back to the Holy Land."  "Back to the Holy Land?" Bai Xiao Chen's eyes twinkled, "Does that mean we can see Godfather? Chen'er really misses Godfather and Sister Chu."  Bai Yan tapped Bai Xiao Chen's forehead with her finger, her tone filled with indulgence, "How many times have I told you, she is your godfather's sister, if you call her 'sister', wouldn't that make her younger than us by a generation?"  Bai Xiao Chen touched his head with his little hand, his little face looking pitiful, "But... Sister Chu doesn't let Chen'er call her 'auntie', otherwise, she won't take Chen'er to set fires..."  After saying this, Bai Xiao Chen suddenly realized what he had said, his eyes filled with panic as he explained, "Mother, you heard wrong just now, Chen'er didn't want to set fires... Chen'er was just..."  "No need to explain!" Bai Yan scoffed, "I always thought it was Chu Yi Yi who led you astray, but it turns out you have a natural love for setting fires! Very well, I will tell this to your grandmaster. The day his treasure pavilion was burned, you were also partly responsible!"  "Mother..." Bai Xiao Chen called out pitifully, pulling at Bai Yan's sleeve, "Chen'er knows his mistake, can you not tell grandmaster?"  "Hmm..." Bai Yan stroked her chin, "It depends on my mood."  With that said, she led the two adorable children by the hand, laughing lightly as she walked out of the bamboo house.  Although the seals had been lifted, the sky of the Demon Realm still displayed a blood-red hue, as if submerged in a sea of blood, with the color of blood enveloping the entire world...  ...  Inside the main hall, Emperor Cang held his head in his palm, looking down at the person reporting below with a domineering aura that enveloped the entire hall, causing the reporter to sweat profusely and tremble lightly.  Suddenly, a figure in red entered Emperor Cang's vision, and his domineering and cold eyes softened, his robe fluttering as he quickly reached the woman's side and pulled her into his embrace.  "Why are you here? Didn't I tell you to rest well on the Holy Mountain?"  His voice was unprecedentedly gentle, as if the entire world was less important than the woman in his arms.  "I came because there is something I need to tell you, I need to return to the Holy Land for a bit."  "Alright, I will accompany you back later."  Emperor Cang frowned and pondered for a while before finally relaxing, his lips curving into a shallow smile.  "No need." Bai Yan shook her head, "I'll go and come back quickly, you probably still have a lot of things to deal with, you don't need to go out of your way to accompany me back."  At that moment, Bai Yan recalled the words the Saint Lord had previously told her. Now... the difference in strength between her and Emperor Cang was too great, and she must quickly improve her strength in order to fight side by side with him.  And for her, the only way to improve her strength was to return to the Holy Land!  "Are you afraid that I will fight with Chu Yifeng?" Emperor Cang's voice was sour.  Chu Yifeng also held an extraordinary position in Bai Yan's heart. He was the one who appeared by her side the most when she needed help the most, and just that was enough to make him jealous. Chapter 837: Let Her Be the Referee (Part 1)  As soon as Emperor Cang finished speaking, the woman in front of him had already tiptoed up and brought her red lips to his, her arms hooking around his neck. Her kiss was lingering and tender, as if filled with endless affection. After a while, Bai Yan released her arms and gently stroked his head with her slender hand: "Be good, wait for me here, I will be back soon..."  Her tone was like comforting a small animal, yet this feeling irritatingly made his heart go soft. Therefore, he couldn't bear to refuse any longer and softly replied, "Okay, after I deal with the matters of the Demon Realm, I will come to find you."  Bai Yan nodded slightly: "Chen'er, Xiao Long'er, let's return to the Holy Land."  "Daddy," Bai Xiao Chen looked at Bai Yan, then turned his gaze to Emperor Cang. His big eyes were twinkling and bright as stars, "Don't forget what you promised Chen'er. After Chen'er goes back to visit godfather and grandmaster, I will return to the Demon Realm. Then, you must let Chen'er go to that secret realm to cultivate."  Emperor Cang couldn't help but chuckle: "When have I ever broken a promise? When you come back, I will personally take you to the secret realm to cultivate."  "Okay." Bai Xiao Chen smiled cutely, his innocent smile making the sunshine seem even more romantic. "Chen'er will work hard to improve his strength, to be the wings for mother, to shelter her from wind and rain."  His little face was full of determination, and his big eyes were filled with resolve. As long as he could protect his mother, he was not afraid of any dangers in the secret realm!  Bai Yan was about to say something to stop Bai Xiao Chen, but seeing the little guy's excited face, she somehow couldn't bring herself to say it.  Emperor Cang might have sensed Bai Yan's worries, he raised his hand to wrap around her shoulders: "You don't need to worry, I won't let Chen'er be in danger, and besides, he is the crown prince of the Demon Realm, his duty is to protect his mother and sister! It is inevitable."  Bai Yan glared at Emperor Cang: "Where is his sister?"  Emperor Cang smiled faintly, his lips nearing Bai Yan's ear, his voice suggestive: "If you want, we can always have one..."  The most beautiful love words in the world are when I mention our children, and you say, if you want, we can always have them. In that instant, Bai Yan's ears grew a bit hot, she coughed lightly, turned her head away, refusing to look directly into Emperor Cang's desire-filled phoenix eyes.  "It's getting late, I should go." She suddenly remembered something, looked up at Emperor Cang: "Also, I have already forgiven the Second Elder and Huo Yu, you don't have to trouble them anymore."  Emperor Cang's brows furrowed slightly, to be honest, if it wasn't for those two fools, Yan'er would not have run away from home. But... since Yan'er has decided to forgive these two people, then he respects her decision!  "Naughty daddy, goodbye." Bai Xiao Chen waved goodbye to Emperor Cang, following Bai Yan out the door.  "Wait." Suddenly, a voice came from behind, Bai Yan paused, turning her head to look at the silver-haired man who was catching up, and asked, "Emperor Cang, is there anything else?"  "I'll walk you out." Emperor Cang's commanding brows and eyes carried a smile as he walked to Bai Yan's side, firmly holding her hand.  "Okay." This time, Bai Yan did not refuse Emperor Cang, she smiled lightly: "I'm not going to be gone forever, why are you so nervous?"  "The king just wants to cherish every moment I spend with you." She didn't want him to follow her, he respected her choice, but... he just wanted to spend a little more time by her side. Chapter 838: Let Her Be the Judge (Part 2)  Bai Xiaochen walked silently behind the two, pouting discontentedly, her delicate face filled with dejection.  "Why do I feel that ever since mother accepted that bad dad, I've become superfluous?"   Xiaolong'er blinked her big eyes, curiously turning to look at the delicate little figure beside her, "Why?"  "Because usually, mother would hug me, but ever since there was bad dad, if mother hugs me, dad would throw me out..." Bai Xiaochen pursed her small lips, "So, I feel like I'm not bad dad's biological child..."  Mother is dad's true love, while he...  Could it be that he was picked up?  ...  The sanctuary was shrouded in mist, like a fairyland.  The sanctuary was now noisy. Bai Yan had just reached the outskirts of the sanctuary when she saw the crowd surrounding the gates. Her eyes flashed with confusion, and she mumbled to herself in a daze.  "What happened to the sanctuary?"  She had only been away for a short while, so why were there so many people at the sanctuary?  "Miss, aren't you here for the sanctuary's disciple selection? How do you not know what has happened?" A young man, seeing Bai Yan's dazed expression, kindly explained.  "The sanctuary is selecting disciples again?"  Bai Yan's stunning face showed a hint of astonishment. The sanctuary had just sent people out to select disciples, why are they starting again?  Could it be... that something really happened to the sanctuary?  "Mother," Bai Xiaochen yawned, "Xiaochen wants to see godfather and master, shall we go in first?"  "Okay."  Bai Yan, holding Bai Xiaochen with one hand and Xiaolong'er with the other, walked lightly towards the gate of the sanctuary.  However, there were too many people ahead, so she needed to pass through the crowd to reach the sanctuary.  "Make way!"  Suddenly, a hand reached out from the side, intending to push towards Bai Yan.  Bai Yan's gaze narrowed, and she pulled Bai Xiaochen to one side, avoiding the hand.  The owner of the hand, upon seeing this, did not forget to look back and glare at Bai Yan, and scolded coldly: "Didn't you see the young miss of the Fireflame Sect arriving? All of you unrelated people, quickly clear off!"  The Fireflame Sect was a second-tier sect, only second to the Beast Tamer Sect. On this continent, it also held a significant position.  Hence, upon hearing that the young miss of the Fireflame Sect had arrived, the people who were originally crowded in front quickly dispersed, opening up a path.  Under everyone's gaze, a woman in a bright red dress came from behind. A silver snake was coiled around her wrist, and her lips curled into a charming smile as she walked slowly forward.  "The young miss of the Fireflame Sect, Huo Yun, is said to be a beast tamer. Did you see the silver snake on her hand? She tamed it herself."  "Wow, with her talent, even the Beast Tamer Sect would surely take her in as a disciple. It's just a shame Huo Yun is the precious daughter of the Fireflame Sect, she wouldn't become a disciple at the Beast Tamer Sect."  The crowd sighed, with the young miss of the Fireflame Sect attending the sanctuary's recruitment, they probably didn't stand much of a chance.  "Mother, that aunty is so ugly, yet she dares to wear red. Only mother can really pull off such a beautiful color."  In the midst of the silent crowd, a childish voice suddenly rang out, instantly attracting everyone's attention. Chapter 839: Let Her Be the Referee (Part Three)  Bai Xiaochen's chubby little face was full of displeasure, and his eyes were firmly fixed on the silver snake on Huoyun's wrist. At such a young age, his fox-like eyes already displayed a domineering presence. No wonder he had no fondness for Huoyun; first, the guards of the Fire Flame Gate were too arrogant, and moreover, this Huoyun was actually in cahoots with the Snake Tribe!  Because of the relationship between Qingluan and the Qingxue sisters, Bai Xiaochen had no good feelings for anyone from the Snake Tribe! If it weren't for the damned Snake Tribe, his mother wouldn't have suffered so much...  The silver snake felt the pressure Bai Xiaochen was putting on it, its body shrank back, and it dared not stick out its tongue anymore, fear showing in its small eyes.  "How dare you!" The guard of the Fire Flame Gate was suddenly furious; on this continent, there weren't many who dared to be so brazen with his young lady!  However, just as the guard of the Fire Flame Gate was about to lose his temper, Huoyun frowned and stopped him.  "This is a sacred place! Without my orders, no one is allowed to cause trouble!"  Huoyun was not confused; even if she was arrogant outside, she would not dare to cause trouble at the entrance of the sacred place.  As for the child's mother...  She must also be here to attend the enrollment conference. At that time, she would look for her in the venue to settle the account!  "Let's go, my cousin should be here to pick us up."  Huoyun slowly turned her head, at this moment, she did not notice that Bai Yan had already retracted the murderous aura from her body. If it weren't for her stopping the guard, that guard might have already been splattered with blood on the spot...  "Mother." Bai Xiaochen blinked his eyes and turned his head to look at Bai Yan, "Can Chen'er go trouble her?"  Bai Yan's lips lightly lifted, "If others do not offend me, I do not offend others; if others offend you, there's no need to be polite!"  The implication was that if these people offended Bai Xiaochen, however he wanted to handle it, she would not interfere!  At this moment, Huoyun had already walked to the doorway, and soon everyone saw a man coming out to meet her, joyfully walking towards Huoyun.  "Cousin, you're finally here."  Huoyun changed her previous arrogance and shyly lowered her eyes, "Cousin, my father should have told you, I'm here to participate in this disciple selection conference, I hope Cousin Yahan can help me out."  "Haha," Lin Yahan laughed heartily twice, "Don't worry, with my cousin's status, you will surely be able to enter the sacred place successfully. Then, we will be fellow disciples."  Everyone saw Huoyun enter the sacred place with Lin Yahan, their eyes filled with envy.  "So, this Lady Huoyun's cousin is in the sacred place."  "And I also heard that Lin Yahan's master will be one of the referees for this disciple selection."  "That lady's son just offended her, I'm afraid they won't be able to pass this disciple selection smoothly..."  Bai Yan did not speak, silently listening to these people's conversations, but her brows couldn't help but knit together.  Previously, due to cheating incidents, she had asked her master to clean up the sacred place. She didn't expect... that cheating would still occur?  "Chen'er, it seems we have come back at just the right time."  Bai Yan lightly hooked the corner of her lips.  No matter what, she had to inform her master about what happened here, to have him pay more attention to the competition.  She didn't want to see the occurrence of such favoritism and cheating in the sacred place like before!  After saying this, Bai Yan held Bai Xiaochen's and Xiao Long'er's hands and walked through the crowd to the entrance of the sacred place. Chapter 840: Let Her Be the Judge (Part 4)  Before she returned, she had sent a message to her master, so the master had already instructed the gatekeepers and given them her portrait. When the two gatekeepers saw Bai Yan coming, they didn't check her invitation and directly allowed her to enter the holy land.  "This... How come this lady doesn't have an invitation?" "Could it be that she has a backer in the holy land?" "I think it must be so, otherwise, where would she get the courage to confront Lady Huoyun?"  The voices of the crowd discussing did not reach Huoyun, who had walked far away. After moving away from the crowd, Huoyun stopped and bit her lip, saying, "Cousin, did you see the woman with two children just now?"  Lin Yahan was surprised for a moment and asked, "What about her?"  "That woman's son offended me with his cheeky mouth. When it comes to the selection of disciples' competition, I hope... she can be directly eliminated!" Huoyun gritted her teeth, a cold flash in her eyes.  This small matter, for a cousin with an elder as a master, wasn't very difficult...  "Cousin, you can relax. I won't give the chance to advance to someone who has offended you," said Lin Yahan with a smile.  He thought it was a serious matter, but such a small thing was easy for him.  ...  Bai Yan, who had just entered the holy gate, hadn't heard the conversation between Huoyun and Lin Yahan, and the direction she went was different from theirs, heading straight to the holy island. Since she left the holy land, she had entrusted the holy island entirely to several masters to manage, so at this time, the masters must be waiting for her on the holy island...  From a distance, Bai Yan saw three old men drinking tea and chatting. Her expression warmed, and a smile formed on her lips. After coming to this continent, these three masters had given her a lot of warmth and extended a helping hand to her when she was in the most difficult times...  "Disciple?" Ren Yi was the first to see Bai Yan, his eyes lit up, and he immediately stood up, "You're back?"  His words made the grandmaster Zheng Qi and the third master Qiu Shurong come back to their senses, looking at her, a large figure with two small ones approaching them with surprise and delight.  "Right, is this young lady the one you were looking for before?" Qiu Shurong pursed his lips, "However, why didn't you tell us when you left the illusionary mansion? We were still waiting for you... If it weren't for your grandfather telling us, we wouldn't have known you left."  Bai Yan smiled lightly: "Three masters, how are your alchemy skills coming along? Did you remember what I taught you last time?"  "Cough cough!" Zheng Qi coughed twice, feeling guilty as he glanced at Qiu Shurong, then outright sold him out, "We have already succeeded in concocting, only your third master... still can't do it."  "Not bad, your third master is too stupid, he can't even handle such a simple matter, disciple, you should teach him a harsh lesson!"   Qiu Shurong's face turned red with anger, glaring at the two old friends: "You two old things, will you die if you don't sell me out?"  Seeing the third master getting angry and about to fight with the other two old men, Bai Yan said with a smile: "Alright, I'm not here this time to check on your alchemy skills. I have something I want to discuss with you."  "What's the matter?"  For a moment, all three old men turned their attention to Bai Yan.  "The holy realm that the Holy Master mentioned to me before... I want to visit."  The holy realm, it is said that those who enter it have a slim chance of survival! But if one comes out from the holy realm, not only will their level greatly increase, but even their state of mind will undergo a qualitative improvement.  This time, for Emperor Cang and for the demon realm, she was willing to take the risk! Chapter 841: Let Her Be the Judge (Part Five)  "Are you going to the Holy Realm?" Zheng Qi looked at Bai Yan in surprise. After pondering for a while, he said, "I need to discuss this matter with the Holy Master. After all, if something happens to you, not only will the three of us old fellows not be able to live on, but the Holy Land will also suffer a great loss."  "Okay," Bai Yan nodded slightly. "I haven't seen him for a long time. I'll go with you to see him. Besides, there is one more thing I want to know."  Bai Yan paused, then asked, "Why does the Holy Land want to recruit disciples?"  "That's because..." Qiu Shurong sighed helplessly, "Recently, the continent has been somewhat unstable. The three great forces all feel a crisis coming and plan to select individuals with strong talents from the populace to send into the Minor Holy Realm for cultivation."  The Holy Realm is divided into two parts. One is the Minor Holy Realm, which Bai Yan had visited once before. The other is the true Holy Realm, commonly known as the 'Mirror of Nine Deaths and One Life.'  Whether it is the Minor Holy Realm or the true Holy Realm, one can only enter once in their lifetime. Unless absolutely necessary, the Holy Land would not continue to recruit disciples.  "Since the intention is to send him to cultivate in the Minor Holy Realm, then this competition must be fair. There can be no more favoritism or fraud!" Bai Yan said seriously, stroking her chin.  "Speaking of which, I really have to tell you that it's good you came back this time. The Holy Master just said to let you be the judge of this competition."  "Me?" Bai Yan narrowed her eyes. "I don't have time. I need to enter the Holy Realm to cultivate."  "My disciple, it will also take time to open the Holy Realm. You can serve as the judge in the remaining time. Moreover, you will be the only judge for this competition!"  Bai Yan glanced at the few old men: "Why don't you serve as the judge?"  Serve as the judge? That's an annoying affair. They'd be crazy to take on such a thing.  "My disciple, we still have some areas in alchemy that are not yet proficient and need to be reflected upon thoroughly, so we don't have the time."  Ren Yi secretly twitched his mouth corner, his eyes shifted, and he had already thought of an excuse.  "What about Chu Yifeng?"  "Having the young master serve as the judge, do you think those girls would still have the mind to compete? They would probably wish they could devour the young master."  "What about Chu Yiyi? If Chu Yifeng isn't suitable, surely this girl can't be unsuitable?"  "Her? Of course not! With her crazy temperament, she would turn the entire competition into chaos. Maybe if she's in a bad mood, she'd set the arena on fire."  In short, these few old men had one thing to say: this time, Bai Yan must serve as the judge!  Bai Yan held her forehead, suddenly feeling that she had chosen the wrong time to return...  "Can I refuse?" Her tone weakened a bit as she asked.  "No! You cannot refuse. It's decided. You must be the judge for this competition, with the little princess as your assistant! In this Holy Land, probably only you can manage her."  Ren Yi had an expression that said the matter was settled, not allowing Bai Yan to continue to refuse.  "Mother," Bai Xiaochen tugged at Bai Yan's sleeve, his big eyes shining, "Chen'er also wants to be an assistant."  Xiao Long'er looked at Bai Yan and then at Bai Xiaochen, her eyes filled with hopeful light.  She also wanted to help the queen...  "Let's talk about this matter later. I'm going to see the Holy Master and Chu Yiyi first. By the way, is Chu Yifeng in the Holy Land?"  Bai Yan pondered for a while before asking.  The faces of the few old men all stiffened, and they sighed lightly. Chapter 842: Let Her Be the Judge (Part 6)  The young master has always been deeply infatuated with Bai Yan, but Bai Yan has already chosen Emperor Cang. Therefore, not long ago, he had already left the holy land to heal his wounds...  Seeing the expressions of the three elders, Bai Yan already knew the answer. She felt somewhat guilty in her heart. She owed Chu Yifeng too much, too much that she could never repay in her lifetime!  "Let's go," Zheng Qi patted Bai Yan on the shoulder, smiling bitterly, "Although we have always been eagerly hoping that you would accept the young master, we also understand that matters of the heart cannot be forced. The young master has been with you for many years, and you have never accepted him. Emperor Cang appeared for just a short time, and you have already entrusted your heart to him. This proves that the young master is not the one destined for you. No matter what decision you make, we will support you."  "Master..." A warm current flowed through Bai Yan's heart, and a smile appeared on her lips, "You will always be my master, lifetime after lifetime."  "Hahaha!" Zheng Qi laughed heartily, "With your words, what regrets do I have in my old age? Come on, the holy master hasn't seen you for a long time. He was still mentioning earlier that you should come back. I'll take you to see him first!"  ...  Inside the room.  The table was a mess, with Chu Yiyi gnawing on a chicken leg, her mouth greasy, while the man beside her was holding a jar of wine, his handsome face flushed with drunkenness.  "Dad, did you get Bai Yan to come back?" Chu Yiyi casually threw the chicken bone on the ground, her eyes eagerly looking at the wine jar in Chu Ran's hands.  Without any courtesy, Chu Ran slapped Chu Yiyi on the forehead.  "This is a fine wine that Zheng Qi went to great lengths to get. I've already given you a sip; stop thinking about it," Chu Ran glared at her, "As for that girl Bai Yan... Zheng Qi told me that she would be back these days."  "Oh." Chu Yiyi's eyes lit up, and a smile appeared on her cute face, "That's great, I have to write a letter to my brother and ask him to come back too."  Although Bai Yan has already accepted Emperor Cang, Chu Yiyi understood her brother well; he would be satisfied just by looking at her.  As her sister, she had to fulfill her brother's wish.  Just as Chu Ran was about to speak, an elder rushed in from outside, bowed with his fists and said, "Holy Master, Young Princess, Zheng Qi has arrived, and... Miss Bai Yan is also here."  This elder, being close to the holy master, naturally knew of Bai Yan's existence. However, since Bai Changfeng's birthday celebration, everyone knew that Zheng Qi and the other two elders had taken in a disciple, but although they knew, they had never seen Bai Yan. Even if Bai Yan stood in front of them, they wouldn't recognize her as the owner of the holy island, the disciple of the three elders.  "What? She's back? So soon?" Chu Ran stood up in a panic, he looked at the messy table, quickly waved his hand, and put all the dishes and wine into his storage bag, then immediately put on a clean robe.  He also didn't forget to take a pill to remove the smell of alcohol from his breath.  Chu Yiyi watched, dumbfounded, with her face still dirty, the food in her mouth not yet swallowed, and her dress grimy.  "She has a cleanliness issue!" Seeing Chu Yiyi's dazed look, Chu Ran quietly reminded her, implying that she should hurry up and change her clothes.  But it was too late...  Just as Chu Yiyi stood up from the table, Zheng Qi had already led Bai Yan inside at a leisurely pace.  At first glance, what caught Bai Yan's eyes was the dirty little face of Chu Yiyi.  Immediately, her brows furrowed.  "Yiyi, your room is a mess, and now you come to defile the holy master's room?" Bai Yan glanced at Chu Yiyi, and after smelling the alcohol on her breath, she asked with a stern face, "Have you been drinking? Have you forgotten about the time when you got drunk and almost set fire to my holy island?"  "It's not like that, it was dad..." Chu Yiyi was on the verge of tears.  But before she could finish, Chu Ran at the side quickly coughed twice, interrupting what she was about to blurt out. Chapter 843: The Father Who Tricks His Daughter  "Yiyi, I have warned you before that as a girl, you should be dignified. Not only do you eat meat with big bites, but you also drink heavily! What kind of behavior is this?" Chu Ran spoke righteously and sternly, his face serious as he scolded.  Chu Yiyi was dumbfounded and weakly said, "I just drank a..."  "What? You actually drank a whole pot?" Chu Ran pointed at Chu Yiyi angrily, his voice harsh, "You drank a whole pot of alcohol and you still dare to speak up? You have been so presumptuous while I was not paying attention! Especially coming to my room to drink, filling it with the smell of alcohol! How can I sleep tonight?"  Chu Yiyi's eyes widened, she couldn't believe what she was seeing as she looked at the stern-faced Chu Ran, suddenly feeling an urge to cry. She had only taken one sip, why was her father framing her?  "Baiyan, what business do you have looking for me?"  Chu Ran's gaze shifted to Baiyan, his previously stern expression softened somewhat. That girl, ever since he had planned to arrange a marriage for his son, had been avoiding him. She must have something important to discuss if she came to find him; she wouldn't come without a significant reason.  "Lord, you once said that with my achievements in the minor holy realm, I would be able to enter the true holy realm. I was in a hurry to leave the holy land at the time, so I didn't choose to step into the holy realm. May I know if I can still go now?" Baiyan's brow was slightly furrowed.  In fact, she had spent two of the four years in the holy land within the minor holy realm, and her performance there had surpassed the limits, earning her the qualification to go to the true holy realm. However, she had been unable to let go of her concerns for Bai Xiao, which was why she left the holy land to go to the Bai family...  Now, if she still had the opportunity, she would definitely go to the holy realm to improve her strength.  Chu Ran was surprised for a moment, frowning, "You want to enter the holy realm?"  "That's right." Baiyan's tone was firm and unchanging.  Chu Ran sighed softly, "Bai girl, I did say that you could go to the true holy realm, but you have experienced the dangers of the minor holy realm. In the true holy realm, the dangers you will face are hundreds of times greater!"  "However, precisely because the holy realm is dangerous, it is the best way for you to improve your strength," Chu Ran looked up at Baiyan, speaking earnestly, "Moreover, time within the holy realm passes extremely slowly, which means, if you spend one year in the holy realm, only one month passes on the outside!"  Baiyan was silent for a moment, continuing to listen to Chu Ran's explanation.  "I want to know if you really want to go to the holy realm, are you not afraid of the dangers?" Chu Ran relaxed his frown, speaking to Baiyan with a very gentle tone and demeanor.  "Confirmed!" Baiyan's eyes shone with unwavering determination.  "Good, I respect your choice, but opening the holy realm takes a lot of time, I have to make preparations," Chu Ran chuckled softly, walked up to Baiyan, and gently patted her shoulder, his tone one of regret, "It's a pity, I always saw you as my daughter-in-law, and now, you have married someone else... However, if you cannot be my daughter-in-law, you are still my daughter!"  "Lord..." Baiyan looked up, gazing at the man standing in front of her.  Chu Ran laughed lightly, "There's no need for sentimental words. If my daughter could give me as much peace of mind as you do, I would be completely satisfied."  Chu Yiyi felt like crying without tears. Was she really that disdained? Indeed, the children of others are always better, while she is merely an existence to be belittled... Chapter 844: Framing (Part 1)  "Cough cough!" Zheng Qi coughed dryly twice and smiled indifferently, "Your Holiness, I have another matter I would like to report to you."  "What is it?"  "For this competition, I would like to recommend Yan'er to serve as the referee. What do you think of this proposal, Your Holiness?"  Zheng Qi's words made Chu Ran ponder for a moment. He turned his head to look at Bai Yan and asked, "Little Bai, what do you think of your master's suggestion? Can you accept it?"  "How long does it take to open the Holy Realm? And how many days will the competition last?"  Bai Yan gently stroked her chin, a deep thought passing through her eyes.  "It takes just over a month to open the Holy Realm, and the competition will surely end within this month."  "Alright," Bai Yan's eyes flashed lightly a few times, and she lifted her lips into a smile, "then I accept the task of being the referee."  "Haha."  Chu Ran laughed heartily, he patted Bai Yan's shoulder again: "With you serving as the referee, I feel relieved. Yi Yi, follow Little Bai and gain some experience, listen to her advice on everything, do you understand?"  Chu Yiyi felt wronged; she seemed to still be preoccupied with the matter of being framed by her own father just now. She wanted to say a few words, but Chu Ran's warning gaze had already swept over.  The implication was that if she dared to betray his trust, she would be finished!  Perhaps Chu Ran's gaze was too terrifying, Chu Yiyi shuddered and dared not speak out about what had just happened.  "Cough cough!" Zheng Qi coughed dryly twice more and cleared his throat, continuing, "Since we have said what needed to be said, I have something to discuss with Yan'er. Your Holiness, we take our leave."  He cupped his fists and then pulled Bai Yan towards the door.  After a while, they had already disappeared from the room.  Watching the two leave, Chu Ran quietly heaved a sigh of relief, his hand slowly stroking his chest, his expression becoming more relaxed.  Then, he waved his hand, and the feast that had been withdrawn earlier reappeared on the table.  "Yiyi, let's continue."  He laughed loudly and waved his sleeve to take his seat.  Chu Yiyi pouted her lips: "Forget it, I'm not going to take the blame for you, I'm going to find Bai Yan."  "Wait," seeing that Chu Yiyi was about to leave, Chu Ran frowned, "Regarding the matter just now, if you dare to speak out, I will marry you off in the next few days!"  Chu Yiyi shuddered and dashed out of the room without looking back; of course, she naturally didn't have the courage to betray her own father...  ...  These days, the Holy Land was somewhat noisy due to the presence of candidates, but to prevent these candidates from affecting the disciples of the Holy Land, they could only stay in a small courtyard outside the gate, not allowed to step out without orders from the Holy Land.  At this moment, in a small house within the courtyard, a woman in a red dress paced back and forth anxiously, her palms gently rubbing together, her beautiful face showing a hint of anxiety.  Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and as she turned her head, she saw a handsome man enter from outside. Her eyes lit up, and she quickly went to greet him.  "Cousin, what did your master say? Did he agree to help us?"  Lin Yah Han sighed helplessly with a wry smile, "Cousin, I'm afraid my master won't be able to help you this time..."  The joy on Huo Yun's face stiffened, and she looked blankly at the handsome face of the man in front of her, "Why? Your master has high authority in the Holy Land, why can't he help us? Is it that he doesn't want to help me?" Chapter 845: Framing (Part 2)  "Cousin, you've misunderstood. It's not that my master won't help you, it's just that this incident happened suddenly, and the Holy Land has chosen another referee. This referee is quite mysterious, and I've spent half a day trying but still haven't been able to find out who she is." Lin Yahan's face showed a trace of bitterness, thinking that what was believed to be a sure thing turned out to have such an unexpected change.  Hearing this, Huoyun lowered her head, her complexion slightly pale. In fact, only she knew that her talent had been exaggerated by the Huoyan Sect and couldn't compare with the genius disciples of other sects! Even her silver snake pet wasn't subdued by her but was tamed by an elder in the sect and given to her, and it was publicized that she personally subdued it. Also, because she wore accessories that concealed her strength and rarely showed her face in public, those people didn't know her true strength...  If nobody helped her, her chances of getting through this competition were slim! More importantly, she wanted to use the elder's hand to get rid of that woman! Thinking of Bai Xiaochen's defiance against her, Huoyun gritted her teeth in hatred, so she absolutely couldn't give that kid's mother a chance!  "Cousin, can you help me find out who the referee is? As long as I know who she is, I'm confident that I can get her to help me." Huoyun clenched her fists tightly, raised her head, and looked at Lin Yahan with pleading eyes.  Seeing his cousin's pitiful look, Lin Yahan's heart softened, but ultimately he could only shake his head helplessly. "The Holy Land is extremely secretive about that referee, and even my master doesn't know who is coming. All I know... is that the Holy Land's little princess will also attend the competition, serving as the deputy to that referee."  Huoyun stiffened. Even the princess of the Holy Land only qualified as a deputy, so who on earth was that referee?  "However, cousin, you don't have to worry. In addition to the referee and the little princess, some disciples from the Holy Land will come to assist them. It just so happens that one of those disciples has some connections with me, and I can use her to ensure your selection." Lin Yahan lifted the corner of his mouth, revealing a smile of certainty: "After all, with such a grand competition, the referee cannot oversee everything. At that time, I will have someone secretly meddle, which will allow you to win successfully."  Huoyun finally let out a sigh of relief. She raised her fist and playfully punched Lin Yahan's chest: "Cousin, you have considered everything for me, why didn't you tell me earlier? You made me worry so much. By the way, have you found out the identity of that woman?"  The girl's soft fist landed on his chest, and as he saw her snow-white neck, his eyes gradually moved down, noticing the surging waves, an unusual restlessness surged in Lin Yahan's heart.  He swallowed with difficulty, his mouth dry, and said, "I've already sent people to investigate. Cousin, you just wait for the news peacefully, I won't let you down."  "As for my cousin, I am naturally at ease," Huoyun shyly lowered her head, her neckline hanging very low, the red making her neck seem even whiter, her face showing shyness, "but at that time, I still hope cousin can help them to be eliminated. I don't want to see those people at the venue anymore."  "Hahaha!" Lin Yahan laughed twice and raised his hand to pinch Huoyun's palm: "Cousin, since the people coming to compete this time are all invited by the Holy Land, I can't directly eliminate that woman, but..." Chapter 846: Framing (Three)  He narrowed his eyes slightly, a cold gleam flashing through them, and silently smiled, "I have a way to make her fall from grace. Once she falls from grace, she will definitely stay away from the holy land and will no longer be able to compete with you for it!"  It was just a woman. As a disciple of the holy land, wouldn't it be easy to deal with her? As long as it would make his cousin happy, what did it matter if he abused his power? Anyway, no one above would care about these trivial matters...  ...  Three days flashed by, and those who came to participate in the competition arrived from various powers. Now, they gathered within the venue.  Huoyun stood out as the most splendid among a group of guards. She no longer displayed the shyness she had in front of Lin Yahhan, instead exuding a cold and noble aura. With a frosty face, she looked coldly at the noisy crowd in front of her, gradually revealing a trace of impatience in her brows.  However, as her gaze swept around, she still had not seen Bai Yan's figure, and her brows involuntarily knitted together.  "Miss!" Suddenly, a maid cautiously said, "That woman has arrived."  Huoyun's eyes swept across, following the maid's gaze, and immediately saw three figures, one big and two small, slowly walking from behind the crowd.  Under the noon sunlight, the woman in a red dress seemed to be gliding on the breeze with her graceful steps. Her beauty was stunning, and even the phrase "surpassing all in splendor" was very fitting to describe her.  On the left hand of the woman was a little boy, carved in pink jade, wearing a purple brocade robe, which brought out his domineering presence and nobility. It was hard to imagine that this little boy with a tender face already possessed such a powerful aura.  On her right hand was a cute and tender little girl, with a delicate and laughing figure, her little face bearing a sweet and naive smile, her eyes curved like crescents. Anyone who saw such a sweet and lovely little girl couldn't help but feel a softness in their heart.  "This woman has finally come!" Huoyun's eyes darkened a few times, "Do you still remember what I instructed you before?"  The maid hurriedly nodded, "I clearly remember the instructions of the miss."  "Good!" Huoyun sneered, "Cousin was right, we should make this woman... fall from grace!"  Just as Bai Yan was leading the two children towards the high platform, an abrupt, mocking voice came through, causing her steps to suddenly stop.  "Nowadays, people are truly shameless to the extreme. Without any real talent or learning, they dare to participate in the competition! They even think of bribing the judges' subordinates. Do you think that by bribing others, you can be safely selected?"  Bai Yan's brows slightly furrowed. She let go of Bai Xiaochen and Xiaolong'er's hands, turned her head slightly, and her gaze swept across Huoyun's face, landing on the maid who had just spoken mockingly.  "Did you just... say that about me?"  The maid sneered repeatedly, "I haven't wronged you. I personally witnessed those things. I saw you trying to bribe a disciple of the holy land. What do you think the holy land is? As a disciple of the holy land, could they be tempted by you?"  "Xiaoling!" Before Bai Yan could speak, Huoyun had already furrowed her brows and asked indifferently, "What do you mean by what you just said?"  The maid known as Xiaoling turned her head back and respectfully saluted Huoyun, "Miss, previously I inadvertently saw this lady... she... she met with a disciple of the holy land and attempted to use her body to seduce him, with the purpose of being selected. I truly did not wish for the miss to compete with such a person, so I took the liberty to expose her." Chapter 847: Framed (Part 4)  These words had been rehearsed by Huo Yun and Xiao Ling several times, and they naturally remembered everything that was supposed to be said. Moreover, with her disdainful expression, she managed to make everyone believe her words.  "What?" Huo Yun's eyes widened in shock as she incredulously covered her red lips. Her body trembled slightly, and she looked at Bai Yan with undisguised disgust in her eyes. "You... you actually did such a thing, the sect you belong to must be shamed by you!"  The crowd was in an uproar, and everyone looked at Bai Yan with disdain. Even more, the people who were standing next to her a moment ago quickly pushed her away, fearing that they would be tainted by this woman.  Xiao Long'er was so angry that her little face turned red. She wanted to step forward and tear this woman's hateful mouth, but a hand stretched out beside her and tightly held her back.  "Your Majesty..." She turned her head, looking at Bai Yan with a wronged expression, not forgetting to glare fiercely at Huo Yun and her servant.  This time, Bai Xiao Chen did not have the same impulse as Xiao Long'er. His little mouth curved into a sly arc, his big eyes twinkling: "Xiao Long'er, just wait and watch the good show."  These people wanted to frame his mother? But before they did this, did they even inquire about his mother's identity?  "You just said that I bribed a disciple of the holy land? I wonder where that disciple is, can you call him out?" Bai Yan's lips curled slightly, a smile playing on her lips, her gaze half-mocking as she looked at Huo Yun.  Huo Yun gave her servant girl a look, and the servant girl immediately stepped forward, cleared her throat, and said, "Young Master Liu, could you please come out and testify? Such a woman, if she enters the holy land, would surely tarnish such a sacred place."  The moment the words fell, not far from the high platform, a man in a green robe slowly walked out. He had one hand behind his back and smiled as he walked towards the crowd.  "Originally, I, Liu Han, did not want to talk too much about this matter, as it is too disgraceful," said Liu Han with a smile on his face, speaking righteously, "but... since Miss Huo Yun's servant girl has spoken, then I, Liu Han, must come out to testify!"  Liu Han's gaze slowly turned to Bai Yan, he frowned lightly, and said with deep significance, "Miss, I know that you are not very talented and are anxious, and for the sake of being selected, you resorted to this. However, I, Liu Han, have always acted uprightly and sat straight, and it's impossible for me to sell out my own conscience! Please leave on your own accord to avoid me having to take action to expel you!"  The smile on his face had disappeared just now, and he was very serious, even his expression was extremely solemn.  "Uncle." Suddenly, a milky voice came, causing Liu Han's frown to deepen, and he looked down at the little bun who walked up to him.  "Uncle, did your mother never teach you that children who lie will end up in a terrible situation?" Liu Han's face changed, and he said coldly, "No wonder the mother has such a character, this child is also so rude. Indeed, like mother, like child."  Bai Xiao Chen smiled with his eyes narrowed, but his large fox-like eyes shone with a trace of cold light.  "Uncle, Chen'er is just telling you that children who lie will end up in a terrible situation. If uncle didn't lie, then Chen'er's words are not aimed at you. Are you afraid, uncle?" Bai Xiao Chen's little face shone brilliantly, "Also, you slander Chen'er's mother, and Chen'er still politely calls you uncle. In the end, who is the one lacking manners?" Chapter 848: Framed (Part 5)  At this moment, the crowd was extremely quiet, so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. These people would never doubt the disciples of the Holy Land, but this child had always been very polite, yet he claimed he had no manners! This point made some people, overflowing with maternal love, take Bai Xiaochen's side.  After Bai Xiaochen dropped these words, he turned and walked over to Bai Yan's side. He raised his tender little face, his big eyes shining with bright light.  "Mother, Chen'er has already warned him, but it seems like he doesn't listen to Chen'er's words, so Mother doesn't need to be polite to him..."  Bai Yan touched Bai Xiaochen's head, then turned her gaze to Liu Han: "I'll give you one more chance, are you sure everything you just said is true?"  Liu Han's face changed slightly. What does this woman mean?  However, thinking of the recent unrest in the Holy Land, Liu Han gritted his teeth: "I, Liu Han, never lie!"  Over the years, Liu Han had not received a small amount of bribes. He had been lucky to escape the purges before, and now that the Holy Land had started purging again, he had to plan for himself.  The reason why he agreed to Lin Yahao was not because he had taken bribes from Lin Yahao, but rather, he foolishly thought that this incident could prove his innocence.  Look, such a beautiful woman was sent before him, and he was able to refuse without a change in expression. How could he, a person of such integrity, possibly take other bribes?  He believed that the other elders, once they saw this, would all praise him, and perhaps at that time, it might even make him...  "Good, very good. I've already given you a chance, and you still persist, so..." Bai Yan narrowed her eyes, a cold smile playing on her lips, "Whatever the consequences, they are what you've brought upon yourself!"  Seeing Bai Yan's cold and stern demeanor, Liu Han's face paused, and for some reason, he felt an inexplicable unease rising within him.  This feeling made his heart uncontrollably start to beat faster.  "Liu Han, under the core disciple Qinghong, in charge of managing the weapons needed for this competition..." Bai Yan smiled faintly, "So when I wanted to bribe you before, was it to let you allocate the best weapon to me?"  Liu Han nodded blankly: "Yes, you not only asked me to allocate excellent weapons to you, but also to tamper with other weapons. I couldn't possibly do such a thing that would betray the Holy Land!"  Everyone who entered the Holy Land was not allowed to carry weapons. Even the weapons needed for the competition were issued by the Holy Land to ensure fairness.  However...  Bai Yan abruptly chuckled: "You just said that my strength is poor, but have you forgotten a saying? In the face of absolute strength, even divine weapons don't count for much."  Divine weapons are indeed very powerful, but for example, if a person who has just become a martial artist fights against a high-ranking strong person, even if she has a divine weapon, how could it unleash the power of a divine weapon?  So, while weapons are important, true strength is even more important!  Liu Han was dumbfounded, and he even forgot to ask Bai Yan how she knew he was in charge of managing the weapons. After all, only the core members of the Holy Land knew about this; others only knew that he was also involved in this competition.  "Qinghong hasn't arrived yet? Go get him to see me right now!" Bai Yan's mouth curved into a cold smile as she spoke in a cold voice.  This competition, besides Chu Yiyi, Zheng Qi also asked two core disciples to come and assist, and this Liu Han was one of Qinghong's subordinates!  And what she did not expect was that Liu Han would treat her as a competing disciple and... even frame her. Chapter 849: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part 1)  At that moment... Outside the crowd, a delicate voice came from behind, causing the originally noisy people to suddenly fall silent.  "What are you all gathered here for?"  Behind the crowd, a girl in a yellow dress frowned, her tone quite impatient.  As soon as she appeared, the people who had been surrounding the area dispersed to both sides.  The disciples of the Holy Land had not seen Bai Yan before, but there was no one who did not know about the little princess called the witch. So, seeing her appear, Liu Han no longer confronted Bai Yan, and his handsome face lifted into a smile.  "Little princess, Brother Qinghong, Brother Changling, have you all arrived? When does the competition start?"  "Now."  Chu Yiyi playfully raised her eyebrows, her smiling eyes turning towards Bai Yan.  She was about to walk towards Bai Yan when Liu Han's voice rang out again from the side.  "Little princess, are we not waiting for the referee?"  Chu Yiyi paused in her steps, her head turning in confusion, her frown deepening: "Hasn't she already arrived? Who else do you want to wait for?"  These people are really strange; Bai Yan was clearly already here, who else were they waiting for?  "..."  Liu Han's eyes widened. The referee had already arrived, so why hadn't he received the message?  Chu Yiyi seemed not to notice Liu Han's shocked gaze, she turned around again and walked cheerfully towards Bai Yan, with a brilliant smile on her lovely face.  "Bai Yan, I'm late, can the competition start now?"  Liu Han was still searching the crowd for the mysterious referee when he suddenly saw Chu Yiyi approaching Bai Yan, and hearing her words, he instantly thought of a possibility.  This possibility made his body stiffen, his face turned pale in an instant, and his tightly clenched fist trembled slightly, his eyes wide open in disbelief.  "Brother Qinghong, this woman... this woman is..."  The young man who came with Chu Yiyi glanced at Liu Han, clearly not understanding why he was so agitated, but still nodded slightly: "She is the referee, what, you didn't know?"  His voice was neither light nor heavy, but it stood out so strikingly in the quiet venue, like a heavy bomb, smashing hard into everyone's hearts.  Huoyun's body swayed a few times, and she needed the support of her maid to avoid falling to the ground.  But...  Her fingertips, pale as death, pinched tightly into the palm of her hand, using pain to numb herself.  This woman was not a disciple participating in the competition, but... the mysterious referee brought in by the Holy Land this time?  Hadn't her cousin said that he had seen all the high-ranking disciples of the Holy Land, so why had he not seen this woman?  "Wait."  As Chu Yiyi was about to pull Bai Yan into the referee's seat, she raised her hand, stopping her action, her eyes faintly sweeping towards Liu Han, a cold smile rippling on her lips.  "You just said, my talent is low?"  These words made Chu Yiyi, who was clueless, freeze, her bright and wide eyes in shock, her gaze slowly turning to Liu Han.  Bai Yan's talent is low? Then in this world, could there still be a genius?  Bai Yan continued to approach Liu Han two steps closer: "You said, in order to succeed in being selected in this competition, I did not hesitate to bribe you, is that correct?"  Chu Yiyi's eyes were already wide as copper bells, she had only been late for a moment, how did such a big event occur? Chapter 850: She is the Mysterious Judge (Part Two)  "I..." Liu Han was forced to retreat two steps, with cold sweat breaking out on his forehead, and his legs were trembling, nearly kneeling down in fright.  Before Liu Han could find a suitable excuse, Chu Yiyi's voice, furious and thunderous, rang out. This time, it directly caused Liu Han to kneel on the ground, the smell of urine spreading throughout the entire venue.  "Liu Han, you have a lot of nerve. Bai Yan only agreed with difficulty to serve as the judge this time, and you dare to slander him! Besides, with Bai Yan's talent, all of you together are no match for her! And you still dare to criticize her talent as low? Who gave you the courage?"  Bai... Bai Yan? Liu Han hadn't thought it through earlier, but now, hearing Chu Yiyi's words, he suddenly realized that this name was very familiar, as if he had heard it somewhere.  Immediately, his gaze slowly fell on the little bun beside Bai Yan, his eyes suddenly widened, filled with fear and panic.  Not long ago, he had heard rumors that the owner of the Holy Island was none other than the granddaughter of Bai Changfeng, the head of the Medicine Sect, Bai Yan, and that she always had an extremely cute son by her side!  However, he had only heard of her existence and had never really seen her, so for a moment, he did not associate this woman with Bai Yan...  If she really was Bai Yan, then the comments he made earlier were so ridiculous!  Liu Han was trembling all over, burying his head tightly on the ground, not daring to say a single word.  The crowd was also silent, but instead of looking at Bai Yan as before, their eyes, filled with contempt and ridicule, were now all focused on Liu Han.  This girl's status in the Holy Land was obviously very high, otherwise, the little princess wouldn't be willing to be her assistant. And Liu Han, just an inner disciple, not even core, dared to claim that she bribed him with her beauty to be selected for the Holy Land?  Ridiculous, too ridiculous!  "Little princess, I know I was wrong, I really know I was wrong," Liu Han said, kowtowing fiercely, tears streaming down his face, "It was Lin Yah Han who made me do this. I am just an assistant, the real culprit is him."  "Lin Yah Han?" Chu Yiyi frowned, her fingers lightly touching her chin, "And who is this Lin Yah Han?"  "He... He is also an inner disciple of the Holy Land, from the same master as me."  "Oh, then have him expelled from the Holy Land along with you, our Holy Land does not need such people."  Chu Yiyi waved her hand, deciding the fate of these two men.  After dropping these words, she turned towards Bai Yan with a smile, and gently blinked: "Bai Yan, what do you think of how I dealt with it?"  "Do as you see fit."  "No, that won't do," Chu Yiyi pouted, "My dad told me to follow you and learn well, and also to listen to you in everything. If my dad finds out I made a decision on my own, he will definitely beat me."  In fact, the meaning of Chu Yiyi's words was very clear. She, the little princess of the Holy Land, had to listen to Bai Yan, so how could these mere disciples dare to trouble her? Believe it or not, she would tell her father, and then it wouldn't be as simple as just being expelled from the Holy Land for losing strength.  In the crowd, Lin Yah Han, who had always been watching the situation, saw that things were not going well and turned to run away. Before he could escape, he was blocked by a group of people, and one of them struck his chest with a palm, sending him flying in front of Bai Yan and Chu Yiyi. Chapter 851: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part Three)  Chu Yiyi stood with her hands on her hips, looking down disdainfully at Lin Yah Han who was lying on the ground, smiling sinisterly: "Previously, Bai Yan had Elder Zheng Qi cleanse the holy land once, but I didn't expect such vermin to still exist. Our holy land's competitions are extremely fair, and I will not allow any favoritism or cheating!"  "Sister Chu," Bai Xiaochen stepped forward, his eyes twinkling with a bright smile, "this Lin Yah Han, he is that bad auntie's cousin, and... before, that bad auntie and Chen'er had caused a dispute outside the gates of the holy land, Chen'er suspects that everything was instigated by her."  He lifted his little chin, pointing towards Huoyun, his delicate and youthful face showing a hint of dominance.  Huoyun's face turned deathly pale as she took two steps back, terror in her eyes. She quickly sought help with a pleading look towards Lin Yah Han, her eyes brimming with tears.  "No, this has nothing to do with my cousin," Lin Yah Han gritted his teeth and said, "My cousin is innocent, it was all my own doing, I conspired with her maidservant! I just wanted to stand up for my cousin, I didn't expect... I hope the little princess can give me another chance."  Being exposed, the greatest punishment for him would be to leave the holy land. However, if his cousin's actions were revealed, even if the holy land did nothing to her, her father in the Huoyan Sect would not let her off easily!  Offending the holy land would mean the end of the Huoyan Sect for good!  Thump! The maidservant also knelt down, knocking her forehead hard, her forehead bruised and blood seeping out, trickling down to the ground.  "All of these matters were indeed communicated between the young master and me, it has nothing to do with the young lady, please let her go, she is innocent..."  Her eyes were filled with tears, her face pale, yet she made a resolute choice as if she was ready to face death.  If she took all the blame upon herself, at most she would die, but if the young lady got into trouble as well, then her brother in the Huoyan Sect would not escape death either...  Therefore, she could not let the young lady be implicated.  Seeing these two people taking all the blame onto themselves, Huoyun quietly breathed a sigh of relief. She bit her lip, stepped forward, and knelt toward Bai Yan, bowing her head with tears in her eyes.  "Lady, I know you have a deep misunderstanding of me, indeed this time I failed to discipline my maidservant properly, and my cousin... acted out of deep love for me and committed such an act, but I, Huoyun, have always acted uprightly and will never admit to things I haven't done! I hope Lady Bai won't let your son frame me..."  Her words were earnest, her eyes full of pleading, as if she truly were wronged.  Chu Yiyi turned her head to look at Bai Yan, to tell the truth, she trusted Bai Xiaochen more than this woman.  "Do you want to stay and continue the competition?" Bai Yan's lips curved into a smile, looking at the girl kneeling before her, "Is that so?"  Huoyun's face turned white, her cousin had been caught, and continuing to stay, the outcome of this competition was predictable.  But now that things had come to this, she could not back down.  "Yes."  "Hmm," Bai Yan nodded lightly, "Take off the jade pendant from your neck, and I'll allow you to continue competing."  What? Huoyun's eyes widened, her face turning as white as snow, panic flashing in her eyes.  How... how could she know?  "Lady Bai, this is something my mother left for me before she passed away," Huoyun lowered her head, concealing the panic in her eyes, and bit her lip, "She once told me not to take off the jade pendant, otherwise it would be disrespectful to her, surely Lady Bai wouldn't... want to force me?" Chapter 852: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part Four)  Even if the disciples of the Holy Land cheat in secret, they dare not take any action in public. Moreover, now that they are in front of a crowd, this woman could not possibly force her to take off the jade pendant. Therefore, this is why Huo Yun dared to ignore it.  Unfortunately, she forgot that the person in front of her, one is the little princess of the Holy Land, and the other... is someone even the little princess has to obey.  As a result, when Huo Yun's words fell, Chu Yiyi stepped forward, raised her hand, and viciously tore off the jade pendant from her neck, and slammed it onto the ground with a bang.  "Bai Yan told you to take off the jade pendant, so just take it off. Why the nonsense?" she glared at Huo Yun fiercely and said unhappily.  Everyone was shocked by Chu Yiyi's actions and looked at Huo Yun with sympathy.  But due to Chu Yiyi's identity, no one dared to express their dissatisfaction.  However...  Huo Yun had already said that the jade pendant was a keepsake left to her by her mother, and for her, it was a remembrance. Yet, the little princess of the Holy Land was so domineering, directly smashing her jade pendant.  Looking at Huo Yun's face, it turned pale, clearly heartbroken.  In fact, the paleness of Huo Yun's face was not because of heartbreak, but because she was frightened. She stared blankly at the jade pendant on the ground, a hint of panic emerging in her gaze.  It's over, this time, everything is over for her...  "Eh, that's not right. I heard that the young miss of the Huo Yan Sect, Huo Yun, has already reached the King stage. Besides the three major powers, she is the most talented person in the world. Why does her current strength show that she is only at the intermediate Earth stage?"  The Earth stage talent is not considered high, but it's not low either. In the past, the Crown Prince of Liu Huo Country, Nangong Yi, broke through to the Earth stage and was already considered a genius.  But...  After all, Nangong Yi is just the Crown Prince of Liu Huo Country, a royal child, and his cultivation resources cannot be compared to those of a second-tier sect. Therefore, Huo Yun's talent is no longer considered a genius.  Moreover, the Huo Yan Sect went to great lengths to promote Huo Yun's talent, even calling her a supreme genius.  A young genius who breaks through to the King stage is indeed a genius, but what a pity...  This genius is fake!  "Yiyi," Bai Yan slightly lifted her lips, "As far as I know, those who enter the Holy Land to participate in the competition must at least have the strength of the high-level Earth stage! She hasn't even reached this threshold, I wonder how she entered the Holy Land?"  It's true that Zheng Qi sent invitations to various sects, but to successfully enter the Holy Land, one must pass a selection. Only those whose strength reaches the minimum target are qualified to hold an invitation to enter the Holy Land.  How did someone who hasn't reached the minimum target enter the Holy Land? This question is worth pondering for everyone.  "Qinghong, what's going on here?"  Seeing Bai Yan questioning her, Chu Yiyi threw the question to the two people following her, her eyes widened, hands on her hips, and she asked in a commanding tone.  Qinghong touched the cold sweat on his forehead: "The one who went to various powers for selection was Elder Lin You."  "Lin You? Who is he?" Chu Yiyi asked angrily.  "He is..." Qinghong glanced at Lin Yahan kneeling on the ground, "He is this Lin Yahan's master."  The crowd was in an uproar, and the eyes that had been gathered on Huo Yun now fell on Lin Yahan...  Lin Yahan trembled all over, he understood, this time, both he and his master could not escape their fate! Chapter 853: She is the Mysterious Referee (Part 5)  "Let him roll over to see me!" Chu Yiyi frowned, her expression showing a hint of displeasure. Just as the person beside her was about to carry out the order, she quickly spoke up, "Wait, don't let him come to see me. I don't want to see him. Just send him directly to Elder Zheng Qi and let them deal with him."  "Yes, Young Princess." The guard took the order and left, and her words had essentially sealed the fate of Lin Yahan and his disciple...  "You," Chu Yiyi pointed to another guard standing by and lifted her snow-white chin, "Take Liu Han and Lin Yahan down together to wait for punishment! A few of you dared to engage in favoritism and fraud, and even plotted against Bai Yan, thinking you could get away with it? Dream on."  Lin Yahan's body weakened, and he collapsed to the ground. He closed his eyes slightly, then slowly opened them again, his gaze falling on the pale face of Huoyun, and he let out a helpless wry smile.  It seemed that this time, he couldn't help his cousin anymore.  "Young Princess, Miss Bai Yan."  Liu Han approached in panic, thumping down on his knees again in front of them, knocking his head hard on the ground.  He was so forceful that he didn't even realize his head was bleeding.  "I know I was wrong, I truly know I was wrong, please spare me this once, I will never dare again."  "Spare you?" Bai Yan chuckled coldly, her indifferent eyes staring at the young man kneeling on the ground, her face expressionless, "If I were not the referee of this competition, would your schemes have succeeded?"  Liu Han was stunned; indeed, if Bai Yan were not the referee but just an ordinary disciple, perhaps she would have been driven out of the holy land and her reputation would have been ruined...  "So, if it were someone else, you know what the outcome would be without me saying so," Bai Yan's foot harshly stepped on Liu Han's head, pinning it to the ground, her voice cold, "And precisely because of people like you who engage in favoritism and fraud, who knows how many excellent disciples the holy land may have lost without our knowledge. How can people like you be spared?"  Whether it's the Illusionary Mansion, Medicine Sect, or this Holy Land, they are all her home.  She would not allow anyone to bully others on her turf, nor would she tolerate the loss of talent in the Holy Land due to these people's actions.  Today, she intended to make an example of him, to restore peace to the Holy Land from now on!  Bang!  Bai Yan kicked Liu Han's head, and in an instant, Liu Han's body flew out and hit a pillar. He spat out fresh blood, his face deathly pale, completely drained of color.  His eyes widened in terror, watching as the red robe fluttered into his view, yet he was powerless to resist.  Pfft!  Bai Yan's fingers hooked Liu Han's arm, twisted it forcefully, and everyone heard the crisp sound of bones cracking. He spat out another mouthful of bright red blood, and immediately, a heart-wrenching scream echoed through the sky, chilling to the bone.  "In our Holy Land, we have always been fair and just, and we will not tolerate any favoritism or fraud!" Bai Yan's indifferent gaze swept over the people present, her voice calm, "If I ever hear of such things again, the outcome will be the same as his."  Bai Yan retracted her stance, and from within her sleeve, a sword light shot out, heading straight for Liu Han's dantian. In an instant, his dantian burst, and his body collapsed to the ground in an embarrassing manner.  Previously, even though the three masters had cleansed the Holy Land, unfortunately, the threat was not enough, merely expelling the violators. Therefore, there were still people willing to take the risk! For some wealth and treasures, they did not hesitate to commit acts of favoritism and fraud again.
