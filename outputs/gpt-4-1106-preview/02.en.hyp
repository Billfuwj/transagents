Chapter 70: The Master of Donglai Cave (Part 8)  This was precisely the question that Song Fu and the others wanted to ask. However, someone else had beaten them to it. They looked at each other, totally clueless as to what had happened and unable to provide an answer. Miao Yi immediately took to the air and flew towards the source of the loud noise, with Yan Xiu and the other two quickly following suit. Song Fu and his group exchanged glances and also followed to see what had actually happened.  Upon arriving at the mountain gate, under the moonlight, they saw that the stone archway engraved with the words "Donglai Cave" had been shattered to pieces on the ground, shocking everyone present. Someone had actually destroyed the mountain gate of Donglai Cave.  Miao Yi suddenly turned around, his face twisted in a ferocious expression, and sneered at Song Fu and the others, saying, "Very well! I've only just arrived today, and it seems someone can’t wait to challenge my authority! Good!"  Song Fu and the others were stunned. They understood the implication of his words, but they definitely weren't the culprits, as they had just been sitting together, discussing how to deal with Miao Yi when they heard the strange noise and ran out.  The group initially suspected it might have been Miao Yi's doing, but seeing his reaction, they felt that Miao Yi had no reason to smash his own mountain gate. After all, Miao Yi was the master of Donglai Cave, and having his signboard smashed on his first day in office would be an embarrassing matter.  This incident needed to be clarified, otherwise, if the blame was pinned on them and they couldn't bear the responsibility, Song Fu stepped forward with a serious face and said with a fist salute, "Master, this was certainly not our doing!"  The others also followed suit with a fist salute, seemingly treating Miao Yi as the master of the cave for the first time.  "Preposterous!" Miao Yi glared at Song Fu and said sharply, "I just assigned you to guard the mountain gate today. How could you not know if someone destroyed it? Could it be that you intentionally let it happen?"  Song Fu was at a loss for words; he hadn't been there at all. Now, he couldn't say that he didn't take Miao Yi's position as cave master seriously, so he could only 'honestly' reply with a fist salute, "Master, you may not know the situation since you've just arrived. The menial workers from Donglai City haven't been dispatched yet, and we all have to fend for ourselves for food. In order to fill our stomachs, I temporarily left for a bit, and I didn't expect such a thing to happen."  Wang Zifa and the others also stepped up one by one, affirming with a fist salute, "Master, we can vouch that Brother Song Fu was just having a meal with us."  Miao Yi pointed at the fallen archway and said sharply, "Are you saying it fell down on its own? Don't tell me it was blown over by the wind!"  Song Fu felt like he had a bitter taste in his mouth and, unable to argue, raised his hand and said, "Master, I swear on the ancestors of my Blue Jade Gate, this was absolutely not our doing. If there is a half-truth in what I say, may I, Song Fu, meet a terrible end!"  Miao Yi's eyes flickered as he scanned the group, his tone dark as he said, "Could it be that someone came to cause trouble in my Donglai Cave?"  Everyone was alarmed at the thought, quickly looking around.  "What are you waiting for here? Do you want to get your throats slit in your sleep? Spread out and search!" Miao Yi ordered angrily.  "Yes!" Yan Xiu and the other two men responded with a fist salute and quickly dispersed into the surrounding woods.  "Hmm?" Miao Yi snorted heavily through his nose, his gaze fixed on Song Fu and the others as if questioning why they weren't searching if they weren't the culprits. Did they know something?  At this time, it was important to show that they had nothing to do with the situation. Song Fu immediately turned his head and shouted, "Why are you not following the master's orders to search?"  The group saluted Miao Yi with a fist and also dispersed.  However, Song Fu was stopped by Miao Yi, "Song Fu, come with me!"  Song Fu paused and, with a fist salute, followed behind Miao Yi.  After everyone left, a figure like a shadow in the water appeared in the original spot. It was none other than the extraordinary figure of Old Bai. Old Bai looked at the fallen stone gate archway, slightly shook his head, and chuckled, "Life is like a game of chess, and a hot-blooded man should not only have the courage of a mere brute. I've always been worried that you're too kind-hearted and easy to suffer losses... A man should have his own methods when he strides across the world; a mere brute cannot ascend to heaven. Now I'm quite relieved."  With that, his figure wavered like ripples on water, quietly disappearing without a trace.  In the Great Hall of Donglai, candles flickered. Song Fu stood behind Miao Yi, one in front and one behind, inside the hall. The outside charcoal seemed to sense something and sneezed.  Miao Yi stared at his throne with no expression, his hands behind his back, facing away from Song Fu and not saying a word.  The atmosphere between the two was a bit tense. After waiting for a while, Song Fu couldn't help but ask, "Master, what do you wish to see me for?"  Miao Yi's tone was dark as he said, "Song Fu, do you know your crime?"  Song Fu's mouth curled into a sneer, and he glanced at the wine and food on the side table, replying indifferently, "This matter has nothing to do with us. What crime does Song Fu have?"  "I'm not asking about that!" Miao Yi suddenly turned around, staring at him, and asked coldly, word by word, "I ordered you to guard the mountain gate, why did you leave your post without permission? Do you not take my orders as cave master seriously?"  Song Fu thought to himself, what do you think? I never took it seriously to begin with.  Of course, he wouldn't say that aloud, "Song Fu has already reported to the master. It was truly unavoidable. I only left temporarily to eat, and I didn't wish for such a thing to happen."  Miao Yi asked, "Do you think the head of the house and the mountain master will believe your explanation after I report this incident?"  Song Fu chuckled and said, "People have two sides to their mouths. If the master insists on framing me, then please do as you wish. But don't forget, master, that I also have a mouth to defend myself, and I'm not mute."  Miao Yi snickered, "It seems you truly refuse to repent!"  As soon as he said this, Yan Xiu, Dan Biao Yi, and Qiu Shaoqun appeared at the door, coming in together and saluting Miao Yi, "Master, we haven't found any suspicious persons for the time being."  Miao Yi replied, "The suspicious person is right in front of us. What do you mean by saying you haven't found anyone?"  Dan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun seemed to have received a signal and quickly closed the hall door.  Song Fu was startled by the noise, quickly turned around, and saw Yan Xiu's furious axe strikes coming towards him.  Song Fu quickly drew his sword, a flash of cold light leaving the sheath, and swiftly parried the blows.  Dan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun also thrust their spears almost instantaneously, joining forces to attack Song Fu.  Yan Xiu and Song Fu were on par with each other in terms of cultivation, and with Dan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun joining in, Song Fu's situation immediately became precarious.  "You shameless traitors! How dare you plot to harm..."   Surrounded and unable to break free, Song Fu managed to hold his sword and fiercely confront Yan Xiu, his angry roar not yet finished when he was brutally pierced by the thrusting spears, breaking through his magical defenses and stabbing deep into his chest.  Song Fu's eyes were wide open as he struggled to look back at Miao Yi, his lips quivering, his eyes filled with indescribable rage.  He finally understood that it was a trap, the collapse of the mountain gate archway was not only meant to frame him but also to lure his fellow disciples away to prevent him from joining forces to resist. The main goal was to take his life. Chapter 71: Lord of the Eastern Cave (9)  Now is the time to kill, when else to wait! Yan Xiu's hand rose and the blade fell without mercy. With an axe, he 'pu' chopped off his head. Shan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun also pulled their guns from Song Fu's body at the same time.  The three, still somewhat shaken, retracted their hands and immediately turned to look at Miao Yi. Miao Yi did not intervene; instead, he cast a spell to protect the table of wine and dishes on the low table from being affected by the mana of the fight.  Now, having released his mana, he spread his five fingers and sucked a cup of wine into his hand, picked up the cup and drank it in one gulp, and said indifferently, "The show is complete."  The three bowed their hands and quickly flashed out behind the hall, disappearing.  Miao Yi then walked to the entrance of the great hall, opened the door, stepped over the threshold, and stretched out his hand to stroke the mane of Hei Tan, looking at the moonlight outside.  His gaze was cold, but the images in his mind were of himself leading the second child by the hand and carrying the third child, who was scared and crying, on his back, facing a group of adults who bullied their way to his door. In his helpless grief and indignation, he stabbed a knife into his own thigh, and blood gushed out...  "Second, third, I'm sorry, brother should not have sent you into such danger, it's all brother's fault, you must take good care of yourselves, brother's abilities are limited now, just give brother a little more time..."  Miao Yi murmured to himself.  A weak light flashed across the dark green bead around his neck.  Hei Tan shook his head and sneezed...  The sound of fighting and Song Fu's last cries of despair drew his fellow disciples back.  Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, two white lotus third-grade experts, were the first to fly over, with Shang Youlai, Hou Sheng, Wang Xiuqin, and Nan Sisi arriving one after another.  Yan Xiu, Shan Biao Yi, and Qiu Shaoqun were the last to arrive, apparently also drawn by the commotion.  A group of people wanted to enter the great hall to see what had happened but were blocked outside the great hall by Miao Yi, who was standing with his spear across the horse.  Miao Yi sat astride the dragon colt, holding a silver spear, standing upright on the steps at the entrance of the great hall, looking down at everyone from a high position.  Outside the great hall, the night sky hung low, and the stars and moon twinkled.  Inside the hall, behind Miao Yi, the bright candles flickered, creating a visual discrepancy in the light and shadow that made it a bit difficult to see Miao Yi's expression, adding a bit of mystery and a bit of majesty, while also conveying a murderous aura emanating from Miao Yi.  The disciples of the Blue Jade Sect looked at each other, and in the end, it was Wang Zifa who stepped forward and asked, "Lord, we seemed to have heard the sound of fighting just now, as well as Brother Song Fu's cries for help. May I ask if Brother Song Fu is inside the great hall?"  "He is! However, he is already decapitated!" Miao Yi did not hide anything, lifted the hand that was hanging by his thigh, holding someone's hair bun, and a head was lifted in his hand and thrown towards the crowd, casually tossing it to them.  The crowd, taken aback, instinctively stepped back to avoid it, only to see a fine head rolling and stopping at their feet.  On closer inspection, whose could it be if not Song Fu's?  The three behind them, Yan Xiu and the others, quietly exchanged glances, while everyone else was greatly shocked.  Wang Zifa suddenly pointed his finger at Miao Yi on the steps and shouted angrily, "Did you kill Brother Song Fu?"  Miao Yi, looking down from above, without any emotional color, said coldly, "I ordered him to guard the mountain gate, but he dared to leave his post and let someone destroy my Eastern Cave's mountain gate. I asked him if he knew his crime, not only did he not know his crime, he even dared to speak insolently to the lord of this cave. Such a reckless and ignorant man, treating the lord's orders as child's play, shouldn't the lord of this cave kill him?"  As soon as these words came out, Wang Zifa and the others immediately unsheathed their swords and pointed them at Miao Yi, with Wang Zifa asking loudly, "How dare you kill a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect!"  "How bold!" Miao Yi shouted angrily, warning, "I don't care which sect's disciples you are, since you've joined my Eastern Cave, you should forget the concept of sects and abide by the rules. Do you Blue Jade Sect want to challenge the million-strong army under the command of Lord Chenlu? Acting recklessly without knowing your own strength!"  His spear pointed downward, "Song Fu is not the first third-grade white lotus cultivator to die by my hand, nor will he be the last! Yan Xiu, Shan Biao Yi, Qiu Shaoqun!"  Behind everyone, Yan Xiu and the other two immediately revealed their weapons and responded in unison, "Present!"  "If anyone dares to commit insubordination!" Miao Yi, from his high position, pointed his spear at Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, "These two are for me to deal with, the other four are for you to resolve!"  "Orders received!" Shan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun, along with Yan Xiu, who was holding a pair of axes, shouted angrily, "Kill anyone who dares to commit insubordination!"  This was what they had agreed upon. Anyway, Song Fu, that troublemaker, Miao Yi had already made up his mind to kill him to set an example, no matter what.  As for the remaining Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, these two third-grade white lotus cultivators, Miao Yi did not have the confidence to kill them, but with Hei Tan's speed, it was no problem to entangle these two.  The other four second-grade white lotus cultivators, with Yan Xiu, a third-grade white lotus cultivator leading Shan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun, were enough to deal with them.  Once the fight really started, Yan Xiu and the other two would immediately join Miao Yi to deal with Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao after defeating the four, so there was a great chance of victory.  The disciples of the Blue Jade Sect looked at Miao Yi, who stood with his spear across the horse on the steps in front of them, and then turned their heads to look at Yan Xiu and the other three, who were eyeing them with hostility, and immediately fell into a dilemma.  During the battle at the Floating Light Cave years ago, as bystanders, everyone saw that Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao joining forces might not be able to defeat Miao Yi. If the battle dragged on, the other four second-grade white lotus cultivators facing Yan Xiu, a third-grade white lotus cultivator, with two others attacking, had a high probability of failure. They had no chance of winning this battle.  Moreover, they did not know that Song Fu's death was the result of Yan Xiu and the others working together. They were secretly alarmed at how quickly Miao Yi was able to kill Song Fu and could not help but feel uneasy.  "Miao Yi is here, who dares to fight me!" Miao Yi shouted again with his spear.  "You killed our Blue Jade Sect disciple, and the Blue Jade Sect will demand an explanation from you."  Wang Zifa said this, but he had already put down his sword and did not dare to act rashly. The others also slowly lowered their swords.  Seeing that he had suppressed the situation, Miao Yi snorted coldly, "I don't care about the Blue Jade Sect's affairs, I only care about the affairs of the Eastern Cave. If you don't feel comfortable staying in my Eastern Cave, feel free to leave, I won't stop you. If you want to stay and obey my orders, I won't mistreat you. From today onwards, any member of the Eastern Cave who obeys my orders, third-grade white lotus cultivators can receive three beads the size of rice grains each year, second-grade white lotus cultivators can receive two beads, and those who don't obey my orders won't even think about getting one, get lost at once!"  As soon as these words came out, everyone was surprised and stunned, including Yan Xiu and the other two, because Miao Yi had not previously mentioned this to them.  Everyone quickly calculated in their minds. The Eastern Cave controls about 120,000 believers, and can harvest about 120 beads of wish power each year, submitting 80% and keeping 20%, which is 24 beads. Now there are three third-grade white lotus cultivators, which would take up nine beads, and six second-grade white lotus cultivators would take up twelve beads. The 24 beads would already account for twenty-one beads. Could it be that the lord of this cave, having worked so hard to climb to this position, is willing to leave only three beads for himself? Chapter 72: The Cave Master from the East (10)  The disciples of the Blue Jade Sect were fawning over Yang Qing, but what for? Wasn't it for the Wish-Granting Pearls? The matter concerning Song Fu was instantly thrown to the back of their minds; what was more important was to clarify whether the words of this Cave Master were true.  After hesitating for a moment, Wang Zifa clasped his hands together and asked, "Cave Master, you can't be joking with us, can you? Are you aware that by doing this, you will be left with only three Wish-Granting Pearls? If we..."  Before he could finish his sentence, he swallowed his words, and even swallowed his saliva deeply, as everyone's eyes widened at Miao Yi, or more precisely, at what was in Miao Yi's hand.  A Wish-Granting Pearl the size of an ordinary pearl, translucent and emitting a hazy white halo, was particularly eye-catching in the night, held between Miao Yi's fingers, captivating everyone’s souls and making their eyes shine.  None of them was blind, and their eyesight far exceeded that of ordinary people. This was actually a Wish-Granting Pearl that had accumulated the wishes of ten thousand people over a year!  "Wish-Granting Pearls? Three, two, it doesn't really matter." Miao Yi flipped his finger, and the Wish-Granting Pearl was already stored inside his storage ring. Looking down at the people standing below, he said, "If you are willing to sincerely follow my orders, I have ways to obtain more. By then, the amount you receive each year will probably exceed what I have promised. Those who work for me and make achievements, I, the Cave Master, will not be stingy with rewards!"  Everyone was excited, their eyes shining!   If there were doubts at the beginning, they vanished when they saw the Cave Master casually take out a pearl-sized Wish-Granting Pearl. Their hearts beat faster at the sight. Such high-level Wish-Granting Pearls were not something that small towns could produce. Yang Qing, generous as he might be, probably wouldn't just reward the Cave Master with one. It seemed likely that the Cave Master truly had other sources for Wish-Granting Pearls.  Logically speaking, in a small cave dwelling like the one in Dong Lai, no matter what rank of cultivation the disciples held, if they had a bad relationship with the Cave Master, they would be content with receiving one pearl each year, and they had no say in the matter. Yan Xiu was an example of this during his time in the Fuguang Cave.  Now, if according to what Miao Yi said, the supply of Wish-Granting Pearls was to be doubled or tripled, then a third-rank White Lotus cultivator could condense a hundred years of practice into the span of three hundred years, and a second-rank White Lotus cultivator could make a hundred years of practice equivalent to two hundred years. What did this mean? It meant significantly shortening the time of cultivation, allowing them to quickly improve their cultivation level and strength.  Some even started to harbor malicious thoughts, wondering if it would be worth risking their lives to snatch the Wish-Granting Pearl from Miao Yi's hand.  But on second thought, they realized it was not appropriate. Individually, they might not be Miao Yi's match, and if they joined forces, who would the snatched item belong to?  Even if one person managed to get it, the pearl would only be equivalent to ten rice-sized pearls, which according to Miao Yi's promise, would only take a little over three years to obtain.  For a cultivator, a mere three years was not a long time in the grand scheme of a cultivating career. If they robbed him this time, what would they do after three years? Wouldn't they be cutting off their own wealth?  Suppressing the impractical thoughts of loss outweighing gain, Wang Zifa braced himself and asked respectfully with clasped hands, "Does the Cave Master's word count?"  Miao Yi looked down and asked, "You group of Blue Jade Sect disciples are all in this together. If I didn't keep my word, do you think that would benefit me in any way?"  Wang Zifa and Zhu Tian exchanged glances, then turned back to their fellow disciples, who were looking at them expectantly, and nodded.  Swish! Everyone sheathed their swords, stood in two neat rows, and shouted in unison, "We are willing to follow the Cave Master's orders!"  Miao Yi sat up straight, feeling that the situation in front of him was finally like being in charge of his own house, and this Dong Lai Cave truly felt like his own territory!  But empty words were easy to shout, and Miao Yi was not so easily appeased. He said, "It's not enough to just say it, you need to show real action."  After exchanging glances, the group once again led by Wang Zifa clasped their hands and asked for instructions, "Please give us your orders, Cave Master!"  Miao Yi indifferently said, "Song Fu has defied his superiors and disregarded the orders of Dong Lai Cave!"  Everyone understood his meaning; this was a call for them to take a stand on the matter. It was clear that benefits weren't so easily obtained.  Wang Zifa sighed and said, "Actually, we also feel that Brother Song's actions were inappropriate. We have advised him many times in private, but Brother Song wouldn't listen, and we could do nothing about it. After all, he is our senior brother. There are laws for countries, rules for mountains, and the Cave Master is just in carrying out the law, we have no objections!"  The others followed suit, bowing and clasping their hands, responding, "The Cave Master is just in carrying out the law, we have no objections!"  Yan Xiu and two others twitched their faces, looking at each other with a bit of hatred. These animals didn't seem so easy to talk to when they were bullying the three of them before. Now, they were all too obedient, pushing all the blame onto Song Fu's head.  The three looked at Miao Yi with a hint of awe in their eyes, seeing in this Cave Master the ability to turn the tide and change the weather with a flick of the wrist, and quickly changing the entire Dong Lai Cave, no wonder the mansion master Yang Qing would go against public opinion and let him be stationed in Dong Lai Cave!  "Although Song Fu is despicable and deserves to be killed, he is, after all, a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect. Now, during the cooperation between Nanxuan Prefecture and the Blue Jade Sect, it is not worth ruining the relationship between the two over one Song Fu. This matter will inevitably have to be reported and explained to the higher-ups," Miao Yi said.  He paused, sweeping his gaze over the crowd, and slowly added, "My word alone might cause doubts in the Blue Jade Sect. If you, as his fellow disciples, are willing to testify, it would naturally dispel the doubts of the Blue Jade Sect. I wonder if you are willing to write down your testimonies and report them to the mountain master along with me?"  Yan Xiu and the others couldn't help but curl their mouths in a suppressed smile, thinking that the Cave Master was quite ruthless with his tactics.  Wang Zifa and the others' expressions twitched, realizing what it meant to be a hypocrite; this fellow had killed someone from the Blue Jade Sect and didn't want to take responsibility, yet he wanted the people of the Blue Jade Sect to say that their disciple deserved to die. Aren't you unafraid of us, the Blue Jade Sect, and don't take us into account?  Seeing that they were silent, Miao Yi sighed, "If you don't want to write, I won't force you. But there's something you need to think clearly about. Once the Blue Jade Sect comes down to investigate this matter and finds out that you can get two or three Wish-Granting Pearls each year, I'm afraid no one will pursue my responsibility. After all, the face of the Wish-Granting Pearls is bigger than the face of the Cave Master. If someone else were the Cave Master of Dong Lai, they wouldn't be as generous as me. Maybe some of your fellow disciples will try to get you transferred away and then come to serve me. By then, I won't be able to stop them. What do you think?"  His words hit everyone's soft spot. What Miao Yi was talking about was not a possibility, but a certainty. There would definitely be people trying to replace them, and the disciples of the Blue Jade Sect who were assigned to the lowest level were originally those without much background, who couldn't withstand a little manipulation from more connected fellow disciples.  Nan Sisi, who was somewhat pretty, couldn't help but mutter in a low voice, "Brother Wang, Brother Song did not obey the Cave Master's orders, causing the sect's gate to be destroyed, indeed he cannot shirk his responsibility."  "That's right..." Several people responded in a low voice, not daring to be too obvious, but the meaning was clear, hoping that Brother Wang would understand.  Wang Zifa of course understood everyone's thoughts. No one wanted the benefits to be taken by someone else. But if they really did this, it would be deceiving their own sect. Once they boarded Miao Yi's pirate ship, there was no getting off, and they would have to work for him like cattle and horses. Chapter 73: The Lord of the Eastern Grotto (Part 11)  However, the temptation of the Wish-Power Beads turned out to be the greatest. Why else would everyone willingly come and bow their heads under someone else's control? Wasn't it all for the Wish-Power Beads! Under the muttering of his fellow sect brothers and sisters, Wang Zifa gritted his teeth and took it as a step down, sighing and saying, "I am acting in response to the opinions of my fellow sect brothers and sisters. This is not a decision I made alone."  "Of course!"  "Of course!"  Everyone nodded in agreement, acknowledging the difficulty of their senior brother's position. In such matters, it's tough for one person to take all the responsibility. Everyone must share it. Otherwise, there's no telling if someone might become discontent in the future and spill the beans. Only if everyone shares the responsibility will it be secure.  After reaching a consensus, everyone bowed their hands and said, "We are willing to follow the Lord's orders!"  Witnessing the earth-shattering changes, the three people, including Yan Xiu, looked at the Lord with utmost admiration. He had managed to get so many disciples of the Blue Jade Sect onto the same boat, and they couldn't help but admire him.  However, thinking back, they realized they weren't any better off. It was they themselves who had killed Song Fu. If the matter were to be revealed, they wouldn't be able to escape the consequences either. It seemed that everyone was on the Lord's boat, and no one could get off.  "Good!" Miao Yi's silver spear flashed in his hand, withdrawing into his storage ring. He dismounted his steed, stood with his hands behind his back on the steps, and put on a smiling face, saying, "There's still time. You might as well write down your statements now. If there are no issues after I review them, I'll have someone send them to Zhenhai Mountain to inform the Mountain Lord."  Everyone was speechless, realizing that this Lord didn't even want to give them a chance to regret, not even trusting them overnight.  What else could be done in such a situation? They could only nod and agree.  Miao Yi immediately raised his hand and said, "Yan Xiu, distribute the jade slips to everyone."  Yan Xiu obeyed the order, quickly ran into the hall, took out a stack of jade slips, and handed them out to everyone one by one.  So, a group of people stood under the steps of the grand hall, each casting spells to write their statements.  Some, after starting to write, felt awkward, wondering if it was really appropriate to do this to their deceased fellow sect brother...  After someone had finished writing, they stepped up the steps and presented their statement to Miao Yi for inspection.  Miao Yi looked it over and nodded slightly, saying, "Very good!"  Some who handed theirs over were met with Miao Yi frowning and saying, "The way you've written this, it seems like Song Fu's crimes do not warrant death. Isn't this a bit too lightly worded?"  The person apologized with a smile, "I'll rewrite it, I'll rewrite it."  After reviewing another one, Miao Yi shook his head and said, "This is written too excessively. Just stick to the facts. This makes it seem like the crime is so heinous that even I would want to kill him again... This mainly makes it hard for your Blue Jade Sect to save face. Lighten it up a bit."  The three, including Yan Xiu, also wrote their statements.  After everyone's statements were written and collected by Miao Yi, Miao Yi also wrote a memorial stating that Song Fu disobeyed orders, deserted his post, leading to the destruction of the sect's gate, and even dared to talk back to the Lord. He claimed that the execution was to set an example and maintain discipline.  He wrote his statement more modestly than everyone else because he felt it was necessary to show the magnanimity of the Lord. After all, with so many people speaking ill of Song Fu, the Lord's voice was just one among many.  After signing his legal seal on the document, he took the memorial, along with the one modified and copied by Yan Xiu from the East City Lord's memorial, in his hand, and looked up and shouted, "Dan Biayi!"  Dan Biayi immediately stepped forward with a salute and said, "At your service!"  "Set off immediately, deliver these items to Zhenhai Mountain overnight, and report to the Mountain Lord without error!" Miao Yi handed over the documents.  "Yes!" Dan Biayi accepted the order and quickly departed.  One wonders what expression Qin Weiwei, who had always been worried about Miao Yi's competence, would have upon seeing these memorials.  The group watched as Dan Biayi disappeared, thinking that he truly wouldn't even wait overnight.  After the official business was done, Miao Yi breathed a sigh of relief and said to Yan Xiu, "Inform the City Lord of Donglai to come see me tomorrow morning. Have him bring over the people that need to be sent. We can't affect everyone's normal lives or hinder their cultivation."  This was met with everyone's approval, and the group immediately saluted, "The Lord is wise!"  "Don't celebrate too soon." Miao Yi glanced over the Blue Jade Sect disciples, "Don't think I'm unaware of the scheming you all did with Song Fu. Song Fu failed to protect the sect's gate, causing its collapse, and you all share in the blame. I don't want to see the reputation of my East Grotto being tarnished when people arrive tomorrow. You all must work overnight to quarry stones and rebuild the archway to make amends. Do not take this lightly; it must be well constructed and imposing!"  Now no one opposed, and they could only agree. Those guarding the sect's gate tonight had plenty of company.  Miao Yi waved his hand to dismiss everyone, then turned to Qiu Shaoqun and said, "Clean up the grand hall."  Yan Xiu then led Miao Yi to the private cultivation and sleeping quarters of the Lord in the rear hall. Black Charcoal, unconcerned with any rules, also followed along.  Along the way, Yan Xiu couldn't help but ask in a low voice, "Lord, isn't it too much to release so many Wish-Power Beads to everyone every year?"  He considered himself a close confidant and showed concern for the Lord.  Miao Yi raised his eyebrows and said, "Why do you think I asked Dan Biayi to send the items overnight? It's to establish the facts first. When the time comes, if I don't give it to them, what can they do? They wouldn't dare to face the Blue Jade Sect's pursuit of their responsibility, let them try to turn against me!"  "......" Yan Xiu was dumbfounded.  "Don't overthink it. I was just saying. As long as we collect enough Wish-Power Beads every year, I will keep my word."  Patting Black Charcoal beside him, Miao Yi sighed, "After going out and handling affairs, I've come to understand the truth in the saying 'A horse that never grazes at night will not get fat.' It's not enough for us to stay here and receive a fixed income. We need to find other ways to increase our revenue."  He wasn't speaking idly; he truly felt that way. Not to mention the Wish-Power Beads gifted by the charming proprietress, he also gained a little by killing Mo Shengtu and Zhang Shucheng, and he even snatched one from Huang Baolong. He was eager and itchy to organize and do something bigger with the people in East Grotto, as one's personal strength is never enough.  Black Charcoal felt a bit unwilling as it was stopped at the courtyard between the front and rear halls. The front was where Lord Miao's sleeping and cultivation areas were, and it indeed wasn't convenient for such a large creature to enter. It had no choice but to lie down at the doorway, exuding laziness.  However, the courtyard here was serene, with ancient trees, potted plants, cool pavilions, small lofts, flower gardens, and ponds, making it an elegantly high-class environment, far better than lying outside.  Stepping into his private space, Miao Yi couldn't help but click his tongue in appreciation. He discovered that the treatment of a Lord was indeed extraordinary. Beneath his feet was a thick carpet, surrounded by various exquisite furnishings. Luxury and elegance were integrated, a sight he had never seen before, and today was truly an eye-opening experience.  Yan Xiu's thoughts, however, were not on the surroundings but rather on the alternate income sources mentioned by the Lord. He was also curious about where the Lord got the Wish-Power Bead that accumulated the wishes of ten thousand people over a year, and he tried to ask, "What is the Lord's plan for seeking alternative ways to increase income?"  Miao Yi laughed and said, "The best way, of course, is to do like the mansion owner and take over the entire region of Nanxuan."  Yan Xiu was shocked and waved his hands repeatedly, saying, "That's not possible. Our strength is not yet sufficient to swallow the surrounding territories." Chapter 74: Master of the Donglai Cave (Part 12)  "Of course I know that. If we go to snatch someone else's territory now, I'm afraid we might not only fail to grab their territory but instead provoke them to snatch ours," Miao Yi said with a hint of self-mockery, shaking his head. He then turned around and sat down on a thick, carved, furry couch, asking, "What do you think about us taking a trip to the Starry Sea?"  "Starry Sea?" Yan Xiu suddenly widened his eyes, as he was the one who had told Miao Yi about this place.  "What are we going to do at the Starry Sea? That place is within the demon nation of the Demon Saint Ji Huan. The Starry Sea is a place where groups of demons run rampant. Almost every human cultivator who has intruded there has never returned."  "Didn't you say that demon pills of no grade can be exchanged for a Thousand People's Wish Pearl?" Miao Yi asked.  Indeed, this was what Yan Xiu had told him after witnessing the great battle between Yang Qing and Lu Yu.  Demon pills and Yin pills can be refined into magical treasures, which are also the source of power in magical treasures. However, after all, a magical treasure is a magical treasure. Since one cannot cultivate it, each use reduces the contained energy a bit. The more powerful the use, the more energy is consumed, and naturally, it needs energy replenishment.  Therefore, low-grade demon pills and the like have become the best source of energy replenishment for magical treasures. If there's a market, there is value, whether exchanging for money or Wish Pearls.  Yan Xiu said with a pounding heart, "Master, the alternative plan you mentioned, it wouldn’t be to go hunting in the Starry Sea, would it?"  "Hehe, I was just saying that casually. Look how nervous you are; I'm just joking," Miao Yi dismissed it with a laugh.  After letting Yan Xiu leave, Miao Yi went into his cultivation chamber to check it out.  This was an underground space, not small, with thick polished stone slabs on the floor and walls, and a copper lamp providing moderate brightness.  In front of a stone couch for quiet meditation, there were also three large baths made of jade stones, with carved animal heads spewing water. One pool drew mountain springs, another drew hot springs, and the two springs met in another pool, mixing to create a pool of water with a suitable temperature, a good place for a bath.  Miao Yi stripped off his clothes and soaked in the pool water, humming comfortably...  The next morning, Miao Yi, accompanied by a group from Donglai Cave, went to inspect the newly constructed mountain gate archway.  Miao Yi was immediately pleased. He had vaguely heard the sounds of chiseling and hammering throughout the previous night. Six cultivators had worked together to rush the job, and the archway they had built was indeed extraordinary.  The main archway was over three zhang tall and carved with lifelike birds and beasts, with auspicious clouds coiling around. The words 'Donglai Cave' were prominently inscribed, and below it, there were stone carvings of coiling dragons and crouching tigers guarding each side.  The whole mountain gate archway was impressive and eye-catching. Miao Yi nodded in approval, "Not bad, not bad. It's even more imposing than the mountain gate archway of Nanxuan Mansion. It seems that even if the people of Donglai Cave don't cultivate, they could be good stonemasons when pulled out."  Seeing him pleased and fearing that he would deliberately make things difficult, the disciples of Lan Yu Sect, who had been apprehensive, breathed a sigh of relief. They had racked their brains over the archway the night before.  Hearing the master's words, everyone laughed heartily, and the atmosphere among them became much more harmonious in an instant.  However, Miao Yi then pointed to their blue clothes, "These clothes of yours, how come they look so glaring to me? People who don't know any better might think Donglai Cave belongs to Lan Yu Sect. I don't mind if you wear them back at Lan Yu Sect, but while you're at Donglai Cave, you should uniform the color of the clothes.  Yan Xiu, later go to the city and find a tailor to change everyone's clothes to black."  "Yes!" Yan Xiu bowed and took the command.  The disciples of Lan Yu Sect looked at each other.  Miao Yi didn't care whether they were willing or not; he continued to admire the archway with his hands behind his back.  While everyone was admiring the archway, Yan Xiu suddenly pointed towards the mountain road by the lakeside, "Master, it looks like the Lord of Donglai City has arrived."  Everyone looked and saw a procession winding along the lakeside mountain path, with many palanquins, as well as horses and carts, appearing to bring a lot of things.  Miao Yi glanced casually, but his gaze lingered on the large lake at the foot of the mountain, saying, "Yan Xiu, later have someone put more fish and shrimp in the lake to breed."  Yan Xiu took the command, knowing that this was probably for the preparation of Black Charcoal. Unlike other dragon colts, that creature liked eating fresh fish and shrimp and enjoyed playing in the water. With such a big lake here, it had become Black Charcoal's paradise.  "Prince Fa, arrange someone to guard the gate. From now on, you'll be in charge of arranging the personnel for this area of the mountain gate. If it gets smashed again, I'll hold you accountable! Everyone else, back to the main hall."  Miao Yi waved his hand and turned to leave. The Lord of Donglai City was not worth everyone standing here to welcome.  Prince Fa wouldn't be so blind as to arrange Yan Xiu and other confidants of the master to guard the mountain gate. He left his fellow disciple, Shang Youlai, on duty.  Not long after the others returned to the Donglai Main Hall, the fat and big-eared Lord of Donglai City, Xu Xinyang, had already arrived at the mountain gate, dismounted from his horse, and politely requested Shang Youlai to announce his arrival.  There was no need for any announcement; the master already knew they had come. Shang Youlai let them in.  No one dared to ride horses in anymore, and the mounts were all left outside. Only the large quantity of goods pulled by horses and carts followed Xu Xinyang and stopped at the plaza outside the main hall.  Sixteen palanquins carried by bearers were gently set down, and no one dared to neglect them, as the palanquins contained maids to be presented to the immortals.  It is an old rule that one cultivator would have two maids. The rules of the cultivation world would not allocate more, and if every cultivator wanted more, given their ability to come and go without a trace, the secular women would not be enough to spoil. This would affect the believers, and affecting the believers would lead to a loss of willing power, so naturally, it needs to be regulated.  Other people, without permission, were not allowed to enter the main hall. Only Xu Xinyang, who wiped his sweat and wore official robes, cautiously carried a box up the steps.  It was not that he was afraid of what the immortals would do to him, but every time the master of Donglai Cave was replaced, it was also the most insecure time for his position as the city lord. If the master took a dislike to him, it was possible that he would be replaced.  Inside the main hall, Yan Xiu and others stood to the left and right. Xu Xinyang, who entered carrying the box, did not dare to look up directly. He walked to his spot, immediately set down the heavy box, knelt down, and bowed his head, saying, "Lord of Donglai City, Xu Xinyang, pays respects to the Master!"  Seated above, Miao Yi smiled and said, "Lord Xu, we meet again."  Hearing this, Lord Xu was stunned, looked up, and recognized the person. He suddenly realized that this was the immortal who had saved Mrs. Ji. He did not expect him to be the newly appointed master of Donglai Cave. The new master looked so young!  "Stand up and talk," Miao Yi said with a casual wave of his hand.  Lord Xu immediately got up, took out a small box from his sleeve, and together with the large box, he held them up and presented them, "Master, this is a little token of appreciation from the people of Donglai City. I hope the Master will accept it."  Having had the experience with Chief Huang before, Miao Yi knew what was inside without looking. He nodded slightly to Yan Xiu, who immediately went to take the items. Chapter 75: Qian'er and Xue'er  Miao Yi did not make things difficult for the city lord. After conversing for a while, he found that the city lord was quite familiar with the livelihood of Donglai City. Thus, he encouraged him a bit and let him step down. The two parties did not have much common language to continue the conversation.  After the relieved City Lord Xu left with his people, Miao Yi asked Yan Xiu to bring over the gift to open it. Indeed, inside the small box was a grain-of-rice-sized pearl radiating a soft halo. Miao Yi, without any politeness, directly put it into his storage bag.  Inside the box was five thousand gold crystals, which was not a small sum at all. It was the hard-earned wealth of the people of Donglai City. For Miao Yi, who came from a common background, there was some reluctance at the bottom of his heart to accept such things, but he had no choice. The entire Donglai Cave was not just for him alone; so many of his subordinates relied on the believers from Donglai City for support.  However, Miao Yi did not keep any for himself. He had Yan Xiu distribute a portion of the gold crystals, giving two hundred to each person of the Third Rank White Lotus and one hundred to those of the Second Rank. The rest was kept for the cave's expenses and handed over to Yan Xiu for safekeeping.  Yan Xiu was in a good mood, as he had not enjoyed this kind of treatment as a trusted member of the management when he was in Fuguang Cave.  Afterward, everyone left the great hall and came to the plaza, where sixteen beautiful young girls stood in a row, trembling with fear. They were all young and waited for the immortals to choose. The two leading girls were even more stunning, standing gracefully with their heads bowed, like two shy and budding flowers, refreshing and pleasing to the eye. The only flaw seemed to be their age; their bodies were not yet fully developed, lacking in some curves here and there, and not quite sensual, but they had a different charm, and perhaps some people liked this kind.  Led by Miao Yi, everyone looked over the girls. Miao Yi was also a bit restless, curious about what kind of maid Yan Xiu had personally selected for him. Yan Xiu, standing next to Miao Yi, beckoned to the two girls at the front and said, "You two come here; this is the Cave Master you will be serving!"  The two girls glanced at Yan Xiu, then quickly looked at Miao Yi, lowered their heads, and carefully stepped forward. They both bowed and said with voices as clear as orioles, "Zhao Qian'er, Liu Xue, greet the Cave Master!"  The other maids could not help but sneak a glance, all with a hint of envy. Although they were all maids to immortals, anyone with a brain knew that being the maid of the master of the place was different from being the maid of someone else.  "Lift your heads," Yan Xiu ordered the two to lift their heads for Miao Yi's appreciation, while explaining to Miao Yi, "Both of them are fifteen years old. This one is slightly older, named Zhao Qian'er, skilled in dancing. That one is named Liu Xue, skilled in playing musical instruments. Both have qualifications for cultivation. I wonder if the Cave Master is satisfied?"  One for dance and one for music? Miao Yi glanced at Yan Xiu a bit more. He was no longer the ignorant man he used to be. Finding a maid who was young, beautiful, skilled, and with cultivation qualifications was not easy, and Yan Xiu obviously put a lot of effort into it.  Seeing that he did not respond, Yan Xiu tentatively asked, "If the Cave Master is not satisfied, we can change them!"  Miao Yi pondered for a moment. Although any normal man liked beautiful women, he had made up his mind that regardless of the conditions, he would not indulge in female company until he found his second and third brothers. What if, at this very moment, they were suffering while he, as the eldest brother, was enjoying himself...  Still, he nodded and said, "No need to change, let them stay!" Having two people to serve him could reduce some distractions and be conducive to his cultivation.  After the Cave Master finished choosing, it was the turn of the others to choose. Even Shang Youlai, who guarded the mountain gate, was called over.  After everyone had chosen, two maids were left. Yan Xiu said to Qiu Shaogun, "Take these two back to help Dan Biao."  Qiu Shaogun nodded.  However, at this point, everyone realized that two maids seemed to be missing. Miao Yi was also a bit surprised. This was arranged by Yan Xiu himself with Donglai City; how could he have overlooked himself? He asked, "Where are your maids?"  Perhaps others had not noticed, but Miao Yi instantly felt a sense of unusual loneliness flash through Yan Xiu's eyes.  Yan Xiu forced a smile and bowed slightly, saying, "Yan Xiu is old and used to being alone."  Wang Zifa and others immediately joked with him, "Not old, not old, still fit for romance."  Nan Sisi and Wang Xiuqin also smiled, and everyone seemed to be in a good mood today, having received benefits.  Yan Xiu smiled awkwardly with embarrassment and pleaded with everyone with a clasped hands gesture.  That woman who could not bear the humiliation, who took up arms and rode into battle, seeking to earn the first merit to wash away the disgrace, was ultimately beheaded...  Suddenly, that image flashed through Miao Yi's mind. He silently stared at Yan Xiu for a while, then slowly turned his head away, saying nothing more.  But he understood what Yan Xiu had done. To tell the truth, because of Luo Zhen's death, he had some complaints about Yan Xiu in his heart, but today it seemed he understood that some things in the heart of this old man accustomed to flattery and fawning might be difficult to erase.  Qiu Shaogun, also a demoted soldier from Fuguang Cave, glanced thoughtfully at Yan Xiu, remaining silent...  After everyone had taken their maids and left, Yan Xiu also called two maids to follow behind Miao Yi.  The well-fed Heichan still lay dozing at the back hall's doorway, his sleek snake tail occasionally flicking the ground, living quite leisurely, which was also this creature's old habit.  Hearing the movement, he only opened his eyes to look. Seeing that it was Miao Yi returning, he sneezed and then closed his eyes again.  The group stood still in the courtyard. Zhao Qian'er and Liu Xue carefully surveyed their new surroundings, curious and nervous as newcomers.  Miao Yi turned around and said, "Yan Xiu, these two have just arrived and are not familiar with the situation. Help them get settled with what needs to be done. I'm going to take Zhu Tianbiao for an inspection of the territory."  This was also something every new Cave Master should do. It was not possible to rule over a place without being familiar with one's own territory. The time needed at the beginning still had to be spent.  Hearing that he was going out, Heichan's eyes opened wide, his ears perked up, and he half-raised his head to look.  Yan Xiu quickly stopped Miao Yi, who was about to leave, and pointed to the two girls, reminding him, "Cave Master, you haven't given them names yet."  Miao Yi was taken aback, "Don't they already have names?"  Yan Xiu smiled and said, "Those were their former secular names. Now that they belong to the Cave Master, they are supposed to be given new names by the Cave Master, signifying a transcendent new beginning. This is the usual practice for everyone."  "Oh, I see!" Miao Yi scratched his head. Although he had learned some culture from Old Bai, his knowledge was limited, and naming was not his forte. In the end, he could only laugh and say, "Zhao Qian'er, Liu Xue, from now on you will be called Qian'er and Xue'er!"  He chose names that were convenient. Yan Xiu was taken aback but had nothing more to say. He turned to the two maids and reminded them, "Haven't you thanked the Cave Master for the names?"  The two girls quickly bowed and expressed their gratitude, "Qian'er, Xue'er, thank the Cave Master for the names!" Chapter 76: Qin Weiwei in Disarray (Part 1)  Miao Yi waved his hand, not saying much, and did not pay much attention to the two maidservants, directly leaving them to Yan Xiu's supervision, before turning and striding away. Outside the grand hall, Zhu Tianbiao, who had been notified in advance, was already waiting in a change of clothes.  As soon as Miao Yi came out, Heitan rushed from behind, bit onto Miao Yi's clothes, and tugged without letting go. Zhu Tianbiao frowned upon seeing this, feeling that Heitan, this beast, was a bit too much. This was the grand hall of Donglai Cave where discussions were held, but the creature treated it as if it were a horse pen, running in and out. The misbehavior of the creature was due to the indulgence of its master, a few harsh whips would have made it behave.  However, Miao Yi wouldn't bear to whip it. Not to mention that it had saved his life, being able to run faster than others was an advantage, and it could also be used for miscellaneous tasks like catching fish. Only those who have used it know its benefits. He turned back and patted Heitan's head, "I have matters to attend to and can't take you with me. Go play in the lake by yourself, there's fish and shrimp to eat." He raised his hand and pointed in the direction of the lake.  Heitan let go of his mouth, shook its head and sneezed noisily, then sprinted wildly across the plaza, running off.  Zhu Tianbiao, who inwardly resented Heitan's lack of discipline, still complimented on the surface, "The Cave Master's mount even has some intelligence, it understands when spoken to directly, unlike our mounts. It's all due to the Cave Master's excellent training."  Miao Yi chuckled, knowing these were just pleasantries. He was aware that Heitan's temperament was not pleasing to outsiders; for example, Qin Weiwei wanted it dead. However, occasionally enjoying the feeling of being flattered wasn't too bad, even though this flattery wasn't particularly good.  Outside the mountain gate, there were two fine horses left by the Lord of Donglai City. Riding the Dragon Colt into the city would be too conspicuous, preventing him from seeing the things he wanted to see. Miao Yi also wanted to assess Xu Xinyang, the city lord's capabilities. If he was not up to par and delayed the submission of the Wish Power Pearls, his position as cave master might not last long, and if necessary, a change of city lord would be needed, regardless of the gifts sent.  Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao left the mountain gate and sped away on their horses...  At Zhenhai Mountain, Qin Weiwei, who was sitting in meditation in the quiet room, slowly finished her practice and pressed her palms on her dantian. A six-petaled lotus flower shimmered on her forehead, lifelike. As she opened her eyes, the waiting maidservants, Hongmian and Lüliu, bowed joyfully, "Congratulations to the Mountain Master for advancing to a higher level of cultivation."  Qin Weiwei withdrew her magic power and exhaled the Wish Power Pearl she had in her mouth, "It's only a breakthrough to the sixth rank of the White Lotus."  Though she said so, the uncontrollable joy on her face revealed her true feelings. The two maids smiled silently and reached out to help her loosen her clothes.  As her clothes fell aside, her voluptuous body with jade-like skin was soon exposed in the quiet room, so enticing that even women would probably have their hearts racing at the sight. Her flawless jade feet slowly stepped into the warm water pool, and she sat down, the water just covering her full, blushing chest, which was very tempting.  Hongmian and Lüliu helped her untie her hair, and together they began to wash her slowly. As Hongmian's hands passed over Qin Weiwei's full chest with a white towel, she chuckled, "The Mountain Master truly has a good figure; it's a pity not to find a dual cultivation partner with such a fine body."  "That's for sure," Lüliu giggled in agreement, "It’s truly a waste!"  Qin Weiwei's face blushed, and she scolded, "You two shameless girls!" She immediately set about dealing with them. The bathhouse splashed with water as the two girls dared not fight back, only continuously begging for mercy.  After the playful scuffle, Hongmian said seriously, "Mountain Master, I have a secret to tell you. The Lord of the Mansion called the two of us aside to ask some questions."  Curious, Qin Weiwei extended her arms for them to dry as she asked, "What did the Lord of the Mansion ask you?"  Lüliu giggled softly, "The Lord asked us if you had any man in mind, saying if there was one, to tell him immediately, and he would arrange things for you in secret."  Qin Weiwei's face turned red again, and she spat, "My father is so improper! With so many important matters to attend to, he's fussing over such trivia. Next time he asks, you tell him I'm not looking; I'm fine on my own!"  Hongmian laughed, "We dare not speak to the Lord of the Mansion like that; he might think we're the instigators. It's better to wait until you find a man you like, then we'll give him the reply."  "I'm not looking!" Qin Weiwei scoffed, "What's so good about men? Not a single one is decent." She looked around and added, "You two are lucky to be with me. If you were with a man, look at how they treat their maidservants; they are said to be maids, but in the end, they all become concubines. Just thinking about it makes me sick!"  Lüliu quietly stuck out her tongue, not daring to reply, as this included a rebuke of the Lord of the Mansion as well. Hongmian suggested, "Then Mountain Master should wait a little longer. We'll keep an eye out for you and see if there's a man of suitable status who doesn't sleep with his maids."  "Shameless, are you two in heat? One day I'll send you off to be concubines!" Qin Weiwei threatened coldly, then changed the subject, "Is there nothing else going on outside?"  When the real issue was brought up, Hongmian became serious, "Nothing much. It's just that Donglai Cave sent a message overnight, and the messenger is still waiting inside the mountain, awaiting the Mountain Master's instructions for a reply."  "Donglai Cave? That guy just left, and he's already sent a message? Isn't he taking me lightly?" Thinking of Miao Yi, Qin Weiwei was displeased and turned around, "Bring me the message."  "Yes!" Lüliu quickly got up from the bath, dried off, put on a long robe to cover herself, and left swiftly.  She returned soon after with a sealed box containing the message, opened it on the spot, and placed it beside the pool.  Qin Weiwei pulled her black hair to one side, resting on her snow-white shoulder, and leaned back against the edge, reaching into the box...  Why were there so many messages? Did that guy write a lengthy poem or article? She took out a jade slip, infused it with magic power to read it, and quickly moved on to the next one after finishing the first.  She was fine until she read them, but then she was stunned, her expression becoming more and more disordered. After reading them all, she thought she had read it wrong and went through all the messages again, carefully this time.  Still unsure after a second read-through, she meticulously checked again for any trickery. Finally, she placed the jade slips on the edge, Qin Weiwei frowned tightly, her eyes flashing with confusion and puzzlement, and she muttered, "What is this guy up to..."  Hongmian and Lüliu, not daring to disturb the Mountain Master's official duties, noticed something was off with Qin Weiwei. They didn't know what Miao Yi, the Cave Master, had written to put the Mountain Master in such a state, but they didn't see her getting angry either.  Hongmian and Lüliu exchanged glances, noting the substantial number of jade slips and messages. A single report from Donglai Cave was equivalent to all the reports sent by the various cave masters of Zhenhai Mountain. Chapter 77: Qin Weiwei in Disarray (Part 2)  After waiting for a long while and seeing that Qin Weiwei did not respond as she was lost in thought, Hongmian tentatively asked in a soft voice, "Mountain Master, has something happened at Donglai Cave?"  "......"  Qin Weiwei, who had come back to her senses, still had somewhat chaotic thoughts and didn't know what to say. She slightly lifted her hand and said, "You two take a look and help me analyze what exactly is going on with Donglai Cave."  Because of their status as maidservants, such matters were not something they dared to look into without the Mountain Master's command. Due to Qin Weiwei's discomposed appearance, both maidservants were also very curious about what was written on the jade slip. Now that the Mountain Master had commanded, they eagerly took the jade slip to examine it.  They were oblivious at first, but after reading it, both women were also thrown into disarray.  After examining the jade slip back and forth and exchanging it between themselves, they clearly shared Qin Weiwei's doubts, worrying whether it was a forgery, and checked it again and again.  However, the ten memorials were clearly written by ten different people with different magical powers, and the magical signature seal that was applied was impossible to fake, as unique as each person's fingerprint.  In the end, holding the jade slip, Lüliu said in a daze, "That Miao Cave Master is so amazing! He subdued the entire Donglai Cave faction overnight!"  Qin Weiwei, who was thinking, couldn't help but roll her eyes upon hearing this and sarcastically said, "With his level of cultivation, do you think that's possible?"  Hongmian muttered, "It is a bit strange!"  Both maidservants had been by Qin Weiwei's side for a long time and were also aware of the current situation in Nanxuan Prefecture.  For the Prefecture Master Yang Qing, bringing Lan Yumen under his jurisdiction was like harboring a wolf in one's home. In fact, Yang Qing was not in a hurry to rebel at first and wanted to slowly accumulate strength, but the former Prefecture Master Lu Yu could not watch Yang Qing grow stronger. Lu Yu issued a decree to transfer Yang Qing to his side for an appointment, intending to undermine him.  Yang Qing knew that once he went to Lu Yu's side, Lu Yu would no longer give him a chance to stand out.  It was precisely because of Lu Yu's actions that Yang Qing was forced to make a decisive decision, agreeing to cooperate with Lan Yumen and in one fell swoop, killing Lu Yu and taking over Nanxuan Prefecture.  Yang Qing and Lan Yumen indeed both benefited, but some matters were clear to both sides.  Lan Yumen knew that Yang Qing was not someone who would be content with being subordinate and would definitely find a way to cut off Lan Yumen's influence over Nanxuan. And Yang Qing also knew that although Lan Yumen currently did not dare to act rashly, once they took advantage of this entry and gradually established connections up and down, they would definitely find a way to replace him, Yang Qing.  Yang Qing dared to rebel also because over the years, he had cultivated some connections within the system, and there were people beside the Palace Master who would speak for him. Otherwise, even if Yang Qing took over Nanxuan, without the recognition from the Palace Master's side, Nanxuan would not be his share, and he might even have to bear the crime of rebellion.  Lan Yumen dared not act rashly, lacking exactly this kind of connection, and did not dare to confront the vast systemic power.  But if the relationships were straightened out, the people under Lan Yumen's influence in Nanxuan Prefecture were more numerous than Yang Qing's people. Once they made a move against Yang Qing, it would be difficult for him to resist.  Both sides understood that the cooperation was temporary, at most another fifty years. It was likely that they would turn against each other, depending on who had the upper hand at that time. It was either the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind over the east.  Because Yang Qing lacked people, although all the major positions in the vast Nanxuan Prefecture were controlled by his own people, the more numerous secondary positions were almost all occupied by people from Lan Yumen.  Not only other factions but Zhenhai Mountain itself was currently facing this situation. Qin Weiwei was also facing covert non-compliance from the people of Lan Yumen below her. However, because Qin Weiwei was Yang Qing's goddaughter, the disciples of Lan Yumen directly under her jurisdiction did not dare to openly oppose her, and currently had to give Yang Qing some face.  But the Cave Masters under Qin Weiwei did not have this privilege. The memorials they sent were all complaining to Qin Weiwei, saying that the people from Lan Yumen were secretly non-compliant and that things were difficult to handle.  The nine Cave Masters below her all sent memorials of grievances, yet the one with the weakest strength sent the only piece of good news.  The Cave Master with only a White Lotus first-grade cultivation level had just taken office when he killed a disciple of Lan Yumen with a White Lotus third-grade cultivation level. This matter could have caused a storm between Lan Yumen and Yang Qing.  But what happened? Lan Yumen unanimously accused the person named Song Fu of deserving his punishment, listing the numerous misdeeds of Song Fu. With unanimous condemnation, they fully supported the actions of the Cave Master, and Lan Yumen probably had to suppress their objections.  Seeing this good news, Qin Weiwei was not the least bit happy but full of doubts instead. That bastard had just arrived, and overnight, he managed to manage the entire Donglai Cave so tightly?  Especially the disciples of Lan Yumen closely rallying around Miao Cave Master... What a joke? It was nauseating to even think about.  What was this all about? Was it slapping the faces of the other nine Cave Masters, or slapping her face, Mountain Master Qin Weiwei? Were they all not as capable as Miao Cave Master? Was it foolish of her, Qin Weiwei, to not want Miao Cave Master to take up the post in Donglai Cave initially?  But to say it was all a sham, the testimonies of these people could not be faked!  Could it be that the person named Song Fu was truly so detestable?  But how detestable must one be to make all the disciples of Lan Yumen feel displeased?  Qin Weiwei shook her head slightly, feeling that it was not right. Even if Song Fu was extremely detestable, it was impossible for all the disciples of Lan Yumen to submit memorials condemning him and expressing support for Miao Cave Master.  That bastard had just arrived, and with such a low level of cultivation, where did he get such great prestige?  To say it was some kind of overwhelming aura that subdued others, Qin Weiwei would not believe it even if she were beaten to death.  Hongmian and Lüliu also furrowed their brows tightly, looking utterly puzzled.  "No need to wash, change my clothes, and summon that messenger to see me!"  Qin Weiwei stood up from the water with a splash, and with a spell, a mist burst from the mutton fat jade bottle, instantly drying the droplets of water on her body.  The two maidservants immediately helped her put on her clothes and shoes, and her hair was quickly done up, with six white jade hairpins arranged in the shape of a butterfly securing the bun at the back of her head.  In the grand hall of Zhenhai Mountain, the cold-faced Mountain Master Qin Weiwei sat high above.  The single messenger, Dan Biao Yi, was questioned until he was trembling with fear, but no matter how Qin Weiwei asked, he insisted that it was because Song Fu did not obey the Cave Master's orders, which led to the destruction of the mountain gate, and he was disrespectful to the Cave Master, leading to his execution as a warning to others.  Regarding Miao Yi's possibility of killing a White Lotus third-grade cultivator, Qin Weiwei did not need to have much doubt. The battle at Fuguang Cave had been witnessed, and she had also heard of Miao Yi's deeds in eliminating ghost cultivators. Two White Lotus third-grade cultivators had died, and it was that man who had completed the task and returned alone, so it was entirely possible for Miao Yi to kill Song Fu.  But she was not a fool. Was it so simple to get all the disciples of Donglai Cave from Lan Yumen to submit memorials together to help Miao Yi escape responsibility?  "Dan Biao Yi, are you sure you're not hiding anything from me?" Qin Weiwei stared down and snorted coldly.  People at the bottom were not clear about the struggles at the top. Dan Biao Yi only knew that he had personally participated in the killing of Song Fu. Once he admitted it, not only would the people from Donglai Cave not tolerate him, but Lan Yumen's people would also seek revenge on him. Moreover, it was related to the acquisition of merit beads in multiples.  So he could not tell the truth even if he died. Dan Biao Yi adamantly maintained that this was the case, leaving Qin Weiwei somewhat helpless. She vaguely felt that Donglai Cave had indeed been managed by that bastard into a solid unit overnight.  It couldn't be said that the bastard was just born lucky, happening to encounter a large group of people dead set on loyalty, right? That would be closer to deceiving ghosts! Chapter 78: Qin Weiwei in Disarray (Part Three)  "Go ahead and leave!" Qin Weiwei said with a cold face, dismissing Shan Biaoyi. After Shan Biaoyi had left, Hongmian, who was beside her, asked, "Mountain Master, should we report this matter to the Mansion Master?"  "How can I report it when the situation isn't clear yet?" Qin Weiwei shook her head and rejected the idea, then immediately sent Lüliu to randomly summon a Blue Jade Sect disciple.  Shortly after, a Blue Jade Sect disciple entered the hall to pay respects to the Mountain Master, and Qin Weiwei asked, "Do you recognize your fellow sect member, Song Fu?"  "Song Fu?" The newcomer was startled, not knowing what had happened, but still nodded and said, "I know him."  Qin Weiwei then asked, "What is Song Fu's character like?"  The person paused again, unsure why the Mountain Master was asking this, but nonetheless replied with a bow, "Junior Brother Song is honest and simple-natured, respects his teachers and values the Way, and his character is impeccable!"  Regardless of what had happened to Song Fu, or whether he got along with him, when facing outsiders, it was natural for sect members to stand up for each other. In unclear situations, saying good things was definitely correct.  After Qin Weiwei waved him away, pointing to the departing figure outside the door, she said to Hongmian and Lüliu standing by her side, "Did you see that? That is what fellow sect brothers should say, unlike the people from Donglai Cave, which is completely unreasonable!"  Hongmian asked, "Mountain Master, what do you plan to do?"  Qin Weiwei suddenly stood up and said, "Hearing is false, seeing is believing. I will go to Donglai Cave myself to see if the followers there really support our great Miao Cave Master as they claim! If he dares to cause me any trouble and disrupt the current situation, I will not spare him!"  Lüliu tentatively asked, "What if they are truly supportive?"  Qin Weiwei firmly insisted, "That's impossible. There must be something fishy going on. If they were truly supportive, I would let him take my place as Mountain Master. If he really has the ability, let him deal with those Blue Jade Sect disciples at Zhenhai Mountain, that would also ease the Mansion Master's mind!"  Hongmian and Lüliu exchanged glances and stuck out their tongues, knowing the Mountain Master was just speaking angrily and not to take it seriously. However, it seemed a bit... to immediately check on him after he had just taken office.  Not long after, Shan Biaoyi, who had received a reply, could finally return to Donglai Cave. However, he couldn't relax and was instead on tenterhooks the whole way because the Mountain Master Qin Weiwei was coming along with several people!  The Cave Master had just taken office and had already managed to summon the Mountain Master. Ah... Shan Biaoyi sighed in his heart, praying for divine protection along the way, hoping that the Cave Master had arranged everything well and wouldn't reveal any flaws.  It's difficult to disembark once you board a ship of thieves! Although there might be holes everywhere and water leaking, those who are on the ship must unite and row forward desperately. If they don't row forward, they will drown; rowing forward there might be a glimmer of survival.  Miao Yi didn't understand the entanglement between Yang Qing above and the Blue Jade Sect, and that's just how it is for those at the bottom. Besides, he had only recently surrendered to Yang Qing and did not know much insider information.  From his point of view, he was the legitimate Cave Master of Donglai Cave, and the people of Donglai Cave naturally had to listen to him. If they didn't obey, he naturally had to deal with it immediately. Why would he drag it out? Quickly and firmly taking control of the entire Donglai Cave was the sensible thing to do, otherwise, what would be the point of being the Cave Master?  He had no idea that his swift actions in taking control of the entire Donglai Cave had caused anxiety above. However, not knowing had its benefits, at least for now he was spared from worry.  At that moment, Miao Yi, dressed in fine clothes, was leisurely strolling down the streets of Donglai City. Zhu Tianbiao was still a silent type, not speaking unless spoken to, and his occasional attempt at flattery was not impressive. He only knew to follow behind with a treasured sword in hand, like a guard.  Miao Yi had taken him out precisely for protection. Having a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator with him would provide a shield in case of any trouble.  Ahead by the roadside was a festively decorated building with a large crowd gathered around. It seemed that a well-to-do young lady from some family was throwing an embroidered ball, attracting the attention of Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao as they passed by, but they did not linger.  The young lady in the building held the embroidered ball, her shy eyes scanning the crowd for her ideal gentleman. Her gaze quickly locked onto Miao Yi as he passed by. Miao Yi might not be a paragon of men, but as a young man who had just ascended to the position of Cave Master, he was riding high on success. Coupled with the aura of a cultivator, his presence was not something ordinary folk could match.  Moreover, with a guard following him, it was clear he was someone of status. The young lady, biting her lip, threw the embroidered ball with force and accuracy, showing her prowess as someone who dared to throw the ball, perhaps having practiced a bit, lest she accidentally hit an unsuitable old man and cause a great deal of trouble.  As the ball flew out, the crowd below reached up to grab it, but it flew over their heads. Miao Yi, walking ahead, didn't even look as he flicked his hand and the incoming embroidered ball flew back to the building.  Zhu Tianbiao simply turned his head to look and silently followed behind Miao Yi, brushing past the crowd without a word. The young lady holding the returned embroidered ball was dumbstruck, watching the two men walk away calmly. Biting her lip, she felt a great loss of face; it was unheard of for a thrown embroidered ball to be thrown back.  The crowd below was also stunned, craning their necks to watch the two men walk away, then turned back and started to shout, "Miss, throw again, throw again..."  But the young lady bit her lip, turned her head, and disappeared inside the building...  In Donglai City, there was a river that ran across, and Zhu Tianbiao, after inquiring about the boat fare from the boatman, boarded a black-canopied boat with Miao Yi. The boatman rowed, taking the two of them along the river.  Miao Yi stood at the bow with his hands behind his back, while Zhu Tianbiao held his sword at the rear. Not far from the departure, a sound of horse hooves was heard on the shore. Looking back, they saw the young lady who had thrown the embroidered ball, leading several strong men galloping toward them.  "Stop right there!" shouted the young lady, pointing at Miao Yi who was standing at the bow of the boat.  Miao Yi looked around and, taking advantage of the moment when no one was paying attention, displayed the lotus phantom on his forehead to the other party, hoping they would back off upon seeing it. Unexpectedly, the other party continued to chase after him fearlessly, not afraid of immortals? Miao Yi was surprised and then realized that he had used Ling Yin Mud on his forehead, making it invisible to the other party.  He had become addicted to using this substance because his cultivation was a bit low, and being a Cave Master, he was afraid of being looked down upon, so he simply hid the lotus phantom on his forehead, so as not to be laughed at by others.  He then secretly signaled Zhu Tianbiao with a mental message. Zhu Tianbiao suddenly turned back and stared coldly at the young lady, revealing the lotus phantom on his forehead. The sight shocked the young lady and her companions, causing them to halt their horses and not dare to act rashly.  The young lady woke from her dream, understanding why the other party had disregarded her. She felt the vast difference between them and bit her lip in frustration...  For Miao Yi, this was just a minor interlude. Chapter 79: Qin Weiwei in Disarray (Part 4)  On both banks of the small river, green willows swayed gently. Occasionally, one could see women squatting by the riverside washing clothes and vegetables. There were also buildings of the pleasure quarters, where girls clad in bright dresses waved handkerchiefs and cooed in soft, charming voices from the balconies, trying to attract tourists passing by on the boats at the front.  Further ahead, along the riverbank, young noblemen recited poetry and composed verses in hopes of drawing the attention of groups of young women out for a spring outing. The women, blushing, sneak glances at the young lords standing at the prow of the canopy boats with an impressive demeanor.  On the flower boats brushing past the canopy boats, heavily made-up madams loudly invited the noblemen at the front of the boats to come aboard for a drink. In the taverns, wealthy patrons called out to friends, exchanging punches and toasting with hearty drinks.  On the shore, peddlers and porters bustled back and forth, and children chased and played with each other. Living by the water is human nature; traveling by boat, one could truly witness the prosperity of Donglai City.  Although the people of this world have to dedicate three hours each day to contribute their spiritual energy and pay taxes, they do so in exchange for the protection of cultivators, who eliminate demons and drive away ghosts and spirits to ensure peace in the region.  The Six Saints of Heaven and Earth also rely on the cultivators scattered across various regions to accumulate spiritual energy bit by bit. Otherwise, even with their great power, they would not be able to manage such a vast area.  It is precisely because of these cultivators that the officialdom and the powerful do not dare to oppress the believers too much and disrupt the collection of spiritual energy. The cultivators would be the first to not let them off the hook.  Although cultivators do not often appear openly, they undoubtedly stabilize the world's order.  Of course, not everyone living along the riverbanks has to contribute three hours of spiritual energy daily like ordinary people. Those with power and influence can find someone to complete the task on their behalf at places like the "Benevolent Wishes Bureau" or even hire others to do it for them.  Thus, those who should toil still toil, and those who should indulge in luxury remain unaffected. Some are busy while others are idle; such is the rule of life in this world.  Regardless, for Miao Yi, who stood at the prow inspecting his territory, seeing his followers live and work in peace allowed him to temporarily set aside the worry of not being able to successfully hand in the spiritual energy beads at the end of the year...  As night fell, Shan Biao Yi's heart was in turmoil as he galloped under the stars and moon.  Seeing that they were about to reach Donglai Cave, Shan Biao Yi braced himself to speed up and run ahead, falling slightly behind Qin Weiwei. He clenched his fists and said, "Mountain Master, I will immediately go ahead to the cave dwelling to inform them, so they can welcome the Mountain Master's divine presence."  In reality, he wanted to signal everyone, so the cave master and the others could mentally prepare themselves.  Qin Weiwei looked back at him, snorted coldly, and said, "No need."  Then she ordered the people following her at high speed, "Keep an eye on him and don't give him the chance to signal ahead. I want to see what kind of tricks Donglai Cave is playing!"  Shan Biao Yi's heart skipped a beat as two cultivators of the White Lotus Third Grade quickly caught up and flanked him on both sides.  The group of five, under the moonlight, burst through the gates of Donglai Cave at a speed as fast as lightning.  The gatekeeper, Shang Youlai, suddenly emerged from the shadows, blocking the way at the gate with a spear pointed forward and shouted loudly, "Dismount!"  The booming voice echoed, serving as a warning to others in the cave dwelling.  As soon as the alarm was raised, people from their respective practice residences quickly appeared and rushed towards 'Wolong Valley.' Six figures, armed and riding six steeds, sped towards the scene to prepare for any emergency.  Qin Weiwei, however, would not do something as brash as charging through the gate and breaking the rules. She had already motioned for her followers to stop, and the five of them quickly steadied their steeds, halting in front of the gate. Anyone else would have been thrown off instantly.  On the other side of the gate, another six fierce steeds quickly assembled and charged forward.  Qin Weiwei was somewhat surprised, not expecting such a quick response from Donglai Cave. This efficiency was exceptional.  This was because Miao Yi had previously warned that if the gate was smashed again, they would have to settle accounts with the prince. Miao Yi had also said that those who disobeyed would not receive a single spiritual energy bead and would even be driven away!  Where could one find such generous treatment in any other cave dwelling? Besides, everyone's weaknesses were in Miao Yi's grasp, and everyone was eager to work hard to avoid Miao Yi's questioning.  Upon recognizing Mountain Master Qin Weiwei, the gatekeeper Shang Youlai immediately shut his mouth and saluted with a fist.  The emergency responders, including Yan Xiu and others who had hurriedly come to prevent any unforeseen incidents, looked at each other in bewilderment. They quickly dismounted and walked quickly to the gate, greeting her with clasped fists.  Many glanced towards Shan Biao Yi, who had accompanied Qin Weiwei, seemingly questioning why there was no advance notice of the Mountain Master's arrival.  Some even secretly transmitted messages to Shan Biao Yi inquiring about the situation. However, Shan Biao Yi was in a difficult position, as the two people on either side of him were prepared to prevent him from sending any messages, casting spells to interfere in front of him.  Qin Weiwei looked up at the archway of the mountain gate and snorted, "This archway is even more imposing than that of Nanxuan Prefecture!"  The crowd sensed the ill intent in her arrival; nobody knew what to say.  After scanning the crowd, Qin Weiwei led her followers directly into the cave dwelling and dismounted outside the main hall. Shan Biao Yi, held captive, followed Qin Weiwei into the main hall.  There was no one in the main hall, so Qin Weiwei proceeded directly to the courtyard where the cave master resided. In the courtyard, Black Charcoal lay lazily by someone's door, casually wagging its tail, which occasionally tapped lightly on the ground. Upon seeing Qin Weiwei, Black Charcoal's eyes widened in alarm and it sprang up, seemingly unsure where to hide.  With no other choice, Black Charcoal leaped dozens of meters high and landed outside the courtyard, hastily fleeing.  That beast! Qin Weiwei was both amused and annoyed. Was she that frightening? Although she disliked Black Charcoal, she wouldn't go so far as to storm into her subordinate's home in the middle of the night and slaughter her subordinate's mount. If she were to commit such a petty act, she couldn't afford to lose face.  There was no sign of Miao Yi outside, and she barged into Miao Yi's private chambers and meditation room without notice, only to find them empty.  Upon exiting the chambers and looking around, Qin Weiwei noticed a brightly lit room to the side. She immediately went over and kicked the door open with a 'bang.'  Inside, two beautiful maids dressed in revealing clothes screamed in fright, hugging each other and trembling at the sight of Qin Weiwei who had barged in.  Obviously, the maids living in the cave master's rear quarters were Miao Yi's personal attendants.  Qin Weiwei glanced at her own maid, Hong Mian, who had followed her, with a mocking look in her eyes, as if to say, "Look, all men are the same."  Hong Mian smiled without a word. This time, only she had come along; Lü Liu had not.  After searching the room and finding no sign of Miao Yi, Qin Weiwei stared coldly at the two trembling maids and asked, "Where has your cave master gone?"  The two maids shook their heads silently.  "Hmph!" Qin Weiwei disdainfully left the two maids alone, walked out, and led her people back to the main hall. She went straight to the high seat and sat where Miao Yi would normally sit, looking out at the door and shouting, "Yan Xiu!"  Yan Xiu, who had been waiting obediently outside the main hall, immediately ran in, bowing and scraping. Chapter 80: Drag Him Out and Behead Him  Qin Weiwei asked, "Where has Miao Yi gone?"  Yan Xiu apologetically said, "The cave master has gone to inspect the territory."  Qin Weiwei was taken aback, realizing that the guy was really confident about his home affairs, daring to leave the cave dwelling to inspect the territory shortly after arriving.  She asked again, "When will he come back?"  "This..." Yan Xiu shook his head, "I also don't know when the cave master will return."  Qin Weiwei coldly snorted, "Then immediately find him and bring him back to me."  Yan Xiu looked like he was about to cry, "Mountain Master, the Donglai Cave territory is so vast..."  He dared not finish his sentence, implying that with such a large area, where could they possibly go to find him?  Qin Weiwei thought about it and realized that it was indeed a bit difficult for them, so she didn't dwell on it and started to call in people one by one to ask about the killing of Song Fu and the matter of everyone submitting letters of condemnation.  "Did Miao Yi use any means to threaten you?"  "Why would Mountain Master think so? The cave master definitely did not threaten us. It's just that Song Fu really didn't know the immensity of heaven and earth. Although he was from the same sect, I really couldn't stand it..."  Even if Qin Weiwei sealed the mouth of Dan Biaoyi, it was useless. No matter how she beat around the bush or how she threatened and tempted, it was useless. Everyone stubbornly refused to say anything else, only talking about Song Fu's faults, resolutely defending Miao, the great cave master, making Qin Weiwei so angry that her teeth itched. If only all of Zhenhai Mountain were like this, but unfortunately, there was only one Donglai Cave.  There was obviously something fishy going on, but these people, whether it was Yan Xiu, whom she had personally sent, or the people from the Blue Jade Sect, were all as tight-lipped as can be, refusing to give in.  Qin Weiwei planned to settle accounts with Miao Yi when he returned.  However, after waiting for three days without seeing Miao Yi return, she had no idea when that guy would come back.  What left her speechless was that even though the cave master was not there, a group of subordinates still managed the affairs of Donglai Cave in an orderly manner.  The disciples of the Blue Jade Sect, who were reported by other cave masters to be unwilling to guard the mountain gate and do chores, were nowhere to be seen in Donglai Cave. Instead, it was Miao Yi's trusted subordinates like Yan Xiu who didn't have to do these things, and all the disciples of the Blue Jade Sect were loyally performing their duties.  Moreover, people like Wang Zifa were obviously very polite to Yan Xiu, which showed what their attitude towards the great cave master Miao would be.  Look at the great cave master Miao, who in just one night managed Donglai Cave so well, holding high prestige in the eyes of his subordinates.  The people she personally appointed couldn't manage the affairs of the caves properly, each one coming to her to complain, while the person she was reluctant to appoint managed everything perfectly. Who was being slapped in the face?  Qin Weiwei could barely hold back her frustration, wondering if she was judging a gentleman's belly with the heart of a villain?  Now, being in a time of trouble, she couldn't possibly stay here forever, who knows when Miao Yi would come back.  After waiting for three more days, she finally left with her people, not knowing what she intended to do, but she took Dan Biaoyi with her.  This left Yan Xiu and the others who were at the mountain gate to send her off feeling very anxious, each of them signaling to Dan Biaoyi with their eyes, "You must hold on!"  Everyone knew clearly that once Dan Biaoyi couldn't hold on and spilled everything, whether they could get the wish-granting beads from Cave Master Miao was secondary. The key point was that the people from the Blue Jade Sect would not let them off.  Yan Xiu and the others had killed disciples of the Blue Jade Sect.  And the people from the Blue Jade Sect were equivalent to committing an act of betrayal against their sect.  Now that they had caused such a commotion, the people from the Blue Jade Sect were very afraid and regretful, regretting why they had boarded the thief's ship in the first place, causing them to face Qin Weiwei's promise of great rewards and still not dare to leave the ship. They had to desperately paddle the leaking ship that was about to sink without turning back to shore.  Qin Weiwei, noticing everyone's expressions out of the corner of her eye, kept a cold face, becoming even more certain that there was something fishy going on.  Her maid, Hong Mian, glanced at her mistress and couldn't help but suppress a laugh, thinking that regardless of whether there was any trickery, being able to stick together like this clearly showed that the cave master Miao had indeed managed to get these people to obey him thoroughly. No wonder others dared to leave the cave's affairs to run around elsewhere. If other cave masters had this ability, the affairs of Zhenhai Mountain would be easy to handle.  It's just that she didn't know if what the mountain master said about giving up her position to Cave Master Miao if he truly won the support of his subordinates was true...  Qin Weiwei obviously saw what she was thinking and glared at her fiercely, could a rhetorical question also be taken seriously?  Qin Weiwei, who hurried back to Zhenhai Mountain, did not rest. After asking if there were any urgent matters, she took Dan Biaoyi and went straight to Nanxuan Prefecture.  Yang Qing, who had handpicked a trusted subordinate, had killed a disciple of the Blue Jade Sect shortly after taking office. This matter could not be concealed and would inevitably be exposed. Whether or not the Blue Jade Sect would react, they would at least inquire about it, and Qin Weiwei had to personally report the details to ensure Yang Qing was prepared.  Dan Biaoyi was somewhat panicked upon learning that they were going to Nanxuan Prefecture again. Was it necessary for the situation to escalate like this?  The lower ranks did not know the high-level affairs, which involved complex behind-the-scenes struggles. If they had known, they might not have dared to act as they did.  After arriving at Nanxuan Prefecture, Qin Weiwei did not need to be announced to see Yang Qing.  Following behind Qingju, she came to the pavilion on the highest peak of the back mountain and saw Yang Qing, who was meditating.  "Qin Weiwei pays respects to the Prefecture Master!" Qin Weiwei, dressed in white like snow, saluted.  In the presence of others, Qin Weiwei always maintained the etiquette of a superior and subordinate with Yang Qing, only calling him 'father' in very private situations.  Yang Qing slowly ended his meditation and opened his eyes, exhaling a wish-granting bead the size of a quail egg from his mouth, smiling and asking, "Why has Weiwei come?"  He rose and sat down by a small table on the side, stretching out his hand to indicate for her to sit and talk, "What's the matter?"  Qin Weiwei sat down on the chair on the other side of the small table, "Prefecture Master, the cave master of Donglai Cave you personally appointed seems to have caused you trouble."  Yang Qing uttered an 'oh' and frowned slightly, "Miao Yi? What trouble has he caused?"  "Prefecture Master, please see for yourself." Qin Weiwei placed the box carrying the memorial tablets she brought with her in front of him.  After Yang Qing opened and looked through it, he was also confused.  Under the gaze of Qingmei and Qingju exchanging glances, Yang Qing quickly rechecked the jade tablets one by one.  He was a person capable of handling matters and did not react as dramatically as Qin Weiwei did at first, only expressing some curiosity by asking, "Weiwei, what's this situation about?"  "I also don't know what happened. To verify this, I specifically made a trip to Donglai Cave, only to find that Miao Yi had gone out to inspect his territory..."  Qin Weiwei detailed the situation she had witnessed at that time.  After Yang Qing listened, he tapped his fingers lightly on the table, pondered for a long time, shook his head as he couldn't figure it out, and eventually said, "Call over the person you brought, I'll ask him myself."  Dan Biaoyi was quickly summoned, and being face to face with a high-ranking person like Yang Qing for the first time, coupled with the guilt in his heart, made him extremely nervous.  However, he did manage one thing: no matter how Yang Qing asked, he just repeated the same old story.  Yang Qing did not ask as evasively as Qin Weiwei did. He got up, walked slowly to the railing of the pavilion, gazing at the distant mountainscape, his hands slowly clasped behind his back, his expression emotionless, and calmly said, "Drag him out, behead him!"  Qingmei and Qingju moved instantly, simultaneously seizing Dan Biaoyi's shoulders, restraining him from moving, and directly dragged him out. Chapter 81: Captured  This is no joke; both Qingmei and Qingju possess the cultivation of the White Lotus Seventh Rank. When the two of them take action together, even Dan Biao Yi, who is merely at the White Lotus Second Rank, doesn't stand a chance to resist. He was captured without the opportunity to fight back, resistance was futile.  Qin Weiwei glanced at Dan Biao Yi being dragged away without uttering a word. After all, Miao Yi was appointed by Yang Qing, and she had to give face to Yang Qing if not to Miao Yi. It wouldn't be good to recklessly kill Miao Yi's subordinates without any evidence. However, Yang Qing could do it, and if he did, nobody could say anything about it.  Dan Biao Yi was stunned and only after regaining a bit of his clarity did he realize he had been forcibly dragged outside of the pavilion, which scared him to the point of losing his soul. He knew that Yang Qing might be trying to scare him, mainly wanting to pry out the inside information, but he also knew that once Yang Qing had spoken, if he couldn't give a satisfactory answer, Yang Qing wouldn't change his statement for a small fry like him. To kill him would mean nothing to the other party.  "Master of the house, I was wrong, I'll speak, please give me another chance, master of the house, I'll speak, I'll speak..." Dan Biao Yi, dragged outside the pavilion, struggled and screamed for mercy, his complexion turning pale with fright.  Yang Qing, leaning on the railing and gazing at the distant mountains, didn't turn his head, just lightly raised his hand from behind.  Qingmei and Qingju looked at each other and both released Dan Biao Yi.  Dan Biao Yi, still in a state of shock, stumbled back into the pavilion, knelt down with a thud behind Yang Qing, his face ashen as he said, "Master of the house, I'll speak!"  Yang Qing, with his back turned, calmly asked, "Why did the people of the Lan Jade Sect all submit a joint memorial to condemn Song Fu?"  "It was... It was forced by Cave Master Miao!" Dan Biao Yi managed to say these words with great difficulty. If Miao Yi remained the Cave Master of the Donglai Cave after this incident, he knew that he would no longer be welcome there.  Qingmei and Qingju listened intently.  Qin Weiwei's gaze flickered, wondering if the mystery was finally about to be unraveled. Anyone could guess that the people of the Lan Jade Sect were definitely under some kind of pressure; it was just unknown what means Miao Yi had used to exert such pressure.  "Explain the cause and effect clearly!" Yang Qing said without the slightest ripple in his tone.  Despite facing away from Dan Biao Yi and speaking calmly, he exerted immense pressure on Dan Biao Yi, who understood that if the listener detected anything amiss, the other party could decide his life or death in an instant, and he wouldn't have the slightest chance to resist.  "Reporting to the master of the house, indeed, it was the people of the Lan Jade Sect who were rude first. Before Cave Master Miao arrived at the Donglai Cave, the disciples of the Lan Jade Sect did not obey the temporary leadership, instead, they were defiant and confrontational everywhere. With their overwhelming numbers, we were powerless against them. On the day that Cave Master Miao took office and arrived at the mountain gate of Donglai Cave, he found no one guarding it and with a roar..."  Dan Biao Yi recounted the whole story honestly and in detail. From when Yan Xiu and three others rushed to the mountain gate upon hearing the news, to Miao Yi scolding the lack of guards at the Donglai Cave's gate, and to Yan Xiu complaining about the Lan Jade Sect's misdeeds.  Song Fu and others from the Lan Jade Sect arrived late and even ridiculed Miao Yi with their words. Hearing this, Yang Qing, with his back to everyone, slightly narrowed his eyes, a cold light flashing through. Miao Yi was the person he had sent, and everyone knew that Miao Yi was his confidant. Even his confidant, upon taking office, was treated with such contempt by the Lan Jade Sect, which indicated the situation elsewhere.  "What did your cave master do at that time?" Yang Qing asked indifferently.  Dan Biao Yi immediately continued, "At that time, the cave master didn't say a second word, directly ordering his subordinates to rush to Zhenhai Mountain to report to the mountain master, claiming that the Lan Jade Sect had rebelled. This frightened the Lan Jade Sect disciples, and they reluctantly paid their respects to Cave Master Miao. However, Cave Master Miao showed no courtesy, and on the spot ordered Song Fu, who was at the cultivation of White Lotus Third Rank, to guard the mountain gate. Regardless of whether Song Fu agreed, he directly charged at them with his dragon steed!"  Yang Qing, standing with his hands behind his back, showed a hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth. He could imagine how domineering and aggressive Miao Yi was at that time, giving no quarter and not taking the Lan Jade Sect's people seriously at all. That was indeed like the confidant he, Yang Qing, had personally appointed to go, which made him proud.  "And after that? How did you end up killing Song Fu?" Yang Qing asked.  "Actually, Song Fu wasn't killed by the cave master, but by me, Yan Xiu, and Qiu Shaoqun working together..." Having said this much, Dan Biao Yi naturally wouldn't keep hiding the details, and continued to narrate. He mentioned that Miao Yi gathered the three of them to discuss the matter, predicting that Song Fu would act contrary to the orders and not guard the mountain gate. Thus, he instructed Qiu Shaoqun to secretly smash their own mountain gate, planning to take the opportunity to deal with Song Fu. At the time, everyone thought it was a serious matter and feared it would cause trouble, but Miao Yi insisted on using Song Fu as an example.  Afterwards, Qiu Shaoqun smashed the mountain gate, causing a commotion. Miao Yi seized the opportunity to lash out, and while searching for the enemy, he dispersed the Lan Jade Sect disciples. Then he summoned Song Fu to the Donglai Main Hall to be questioned. Song Fu refused to admit any wrongdoing, and the already prepared Yan Xiu, Dan Biao Yi, and Qiu Shaoqun had secretly returned. Following Miao Yi's command, the three joined forces and killed Song Fu inside the main hall.  Subsequently, Miao Yi intimidated and lured the Lan Jade Sect disciples, forcing everyone to write a memorial and pressuring the Lan Jade Sect disciples to rebuild the mountain gate overnight. He also spoke about how everyone was afraid afterward and banded together to deal with Qin Weiwei, revealing everything thoroughly.  After finishing, Dan Biao Yi bowed his head and said, "That's all there is to the events."  Qingmei and Qingju exchanged looks, realizing they had underestimated Cave Master Miao. Describing him as both intelligent and brave was not an exaggeration. In just a few hours after arriving at Donglai Cave, he had managed to get the entire place under control with his thunderous methods. Truly impressive.  Qin Weiwei bit her red lips slightly, the mystery now unveiled. She felt as if now that she knew, she almost wished she hadn't found out. Having heard about that young man's display of power made it seem as if he was the only capable person in the entire Zhenhai Mountain, which annoyed her greatly.  After mulling it over for a while with his eyes closed, Yang Qing slowly turned around and looked at the kneeling Dan Biao Yi, saying, "Get up!"  "Thank you, Cave Master!" Dan Biao Yi stood up with a bitter expression, unsure of what his fate would be.  However, Yang Qing didn't make things difficult for him. Instead, he said, "Don't let anyone know about what you said today. Pretend nothing has happened, and no one will hold you accountable. If anything else happens in Donglai Cave in the future, I grant you the right to report directly to the Zhenhai Mountain Master in secret. Do you understand what I mean?"  Dan Biao Yi was stunned, then his face showed joy as he understood Yang Qing's meaning. He was being told that he wouldn't disclose the matter, and that he had been personally designated as an inside man for Donglai Cave, indicating that he had caught Yang Qing's eye. It was unexpected that what seemed like a bad situation had turned into a good one.  "Your subordinate understands, your subordinate will obey!" Dan Biao Yi said with joyful fists clasped.  This sequence of fear, terror, and then joy was too much of a contrast, almost too much for him to adapt to. Chapter 82: The Wise Cave Master  "Reward him!" Yang Qing nodded with a smile. Qing Mei immediately took out a grain of rice-sized pearl that emitted a soft halo from the storage ring and rewarded it to Dan Biao Yi.  "Thank you, Cave Master, thank you for the reward!" An overjoyed Dan Biao Yi thanked him repeatedly.  "Dismissed!" Yang Qing waved his hand.  After Dan Biao Yi had gone far down the mountain, Yang Qing chuckled twice and shook his head, "He just took office and secretly smashed his own sect's gate. This kid really dared to do it. It's a loss he came up with such an idea. Ah! With both wisdom and courage, he can be of great use. If he becomes the master of a mountain, he can solve many troubles for me. It's just that his cultivation is a bit too low. To be a cave master is already a stretch, promoting him further would be too much. I had previously sent him, a White Lotus first rank, to preside over the Dong Lai Cave just to see how many in Nan Xuan Prefecture would listen to my words, to see if I could make a decisive impact. It wasn't out of impetuousness, but to see who would step out to stop it. I was worried about whether it was right or wrong to actually put him in Dong Lai Cave. But now it seems that the kid is quite capable, and I was worrying too much."  Qing Mei and Qing Ju looked at each other and both saw Yang Qing's increasing appreciation for Miao Yi. They knew that as soon as the time was right, he would surely be reused. As maids, the two of them also understood that they should not be too distant towards that Cave Master Miao in the future.  But Qin Weiwei pouted, seemingly a bit displeased.  Little did she know, Yang Qing had already smiled and directly called out to her, asking, "Weiwei, the Dong Lai Cave Master I personally appointed for you didn’t disappoint, right?"  His words were laced with teasing as he obviously knew about the friction between his daughter and Miao Yi.  However, Qin Weiwei did not like hearing this. She stood up, walked over to him, and said unpleasantly, "He's having fun now. I want to see if he can still be as carefree when it's time to fulfill his promises to his subordinates with the Wish Fulfilling Pearls!"  Yang Qing laughed heartily, shook his head at her, and said, "You! You! The person I appointed for you, you just look down on him, don’t you? It’s just that he killed your mount, and you’re stuck on that. Have you thought about it? Those people are all being blackmailed by him, even betraying their own sect. Even if he doesn’t fulfill his promises afterward, what can they do to him?"  "......" Qin Weiwei suddenly realized and was speechless!  Yang Qing sat back down in his chair and sighed, "If Nan Xuan Prefecture had a few more talents like that kid, Blue Jade Sect wouldn't be a concern, and the affairs of Nan Xuan Prefecture would be easier to handle."  Qin Weiwei frowned and said, "Lord Prefecture, after this incident, don't you think that kid is too scheming?"  Yang Qing shook his head lightly, "If he were really scheming, he wouldn’t have confronted you directly as soon as he took office. He would have communicated with you first, arranged everything behind the scenes, and then made his move after avoiding taking responsibility. The way he did it shows that he thinks what he did is justified, which is why he went out to patrol like nothing happened after the deed."  Qin Weiwei was still unhappy and muttered, "No matter how I see it, I just think that guy is a bit despicable and shameless. It's just because you appreciate him; you find him agreeable."  Yang Qing chuckled helplessly, "Whether you find him disagreeable or whether I appreciate him, that’s not important. In the battle at Fuguang Cave, he dared to face a powerful enemy and fought to the death without retreating with only White Lotus first rank cultivation – a tiger general is no more than this. I sent him to Changfeng Territory to eliminate ghosts, and both White Lotus third rank cultivators under Xiong Xiao died, only he came back alive and completed the task. I sent him to preside over the Dong Lai Cave, and within the jurisdiction of Zheng Hai Mountain, among all the cave masters and even the entire Nan Xuan Prefecture, only he swiftly stabilized Dong Lai Cave with thunderous methods. The other mountain masters and cave masters, however, feared the power of the Blue Jade Sect and only knew how to complain, unable to come up with a viable response. Is this how they handle things for me? In short, Miao Yi has never let me down, doesn’t this prove his capability? Weiwei, as a leader, sometimes you can’t only consider your own preferences. You need to learn to appreciate the strengths of your subordinates. There is no perfect person in this world, knowing how to make use of people is what a leader should do!"  Qin Weiwei remained silent. She knew that what Yang Qing said was right, but she couldn’t deny her dislike for Miao Yi. In short, she just found the guy unpleasant!  A father knows his daughter best! Seeing her reaction, Yang Qing shook his head, knowing that it would be hard to change his daughter's mindset in a short time. Such things can’t be forced...  At the docks of Dong Lai City by the sea, there was an endless view of the blue ocean, with vast skies and soaring seagulls overhead.  After spending a few days walking around, Miao Yi quietly returned to see Ji Xiufang once before coming to this place where he had originally landed from across the sea.  The dock was still bustling, with various seafood being unloaded from fishing boats and sailboats arriving from afar docking at the shore.  After asking around for information, Miao Yi got back on his horse with Zhu Tianbiao and left.  After a few days of patrolling, Miao Yi had a rough understanding of the situation in Dong Lai City. As the two left the dock, Miao Yi said with a smile, "That Xu Xinyan turns out to be a decent city master, it seems there's no need for a replacement."  Zhu Tianbiao immediately flattered, "Cave Master is wise!"  "......" Miao Yi was speechless and rolled his eyes. What does this have to do with me being wise or not? The city master was chosen by someone else, what does it have to do with me? He couldn’t even flatter properly.  The two rode along the coastline. Miao Yi had lived on an island for ten years and was quite familiar with the sea, able to discern the depth from the color of the water.  When they reached an area with towering rocks, both of them stopped. Miao Yi dismounted and leaped onto the rocks to survey the terrain.  Zhu Tianbiao came next to him and asked, "What is the Cave Master looking at?"  Miao Yi asked in return, "Have you heard that there is a type of sailing ship in the cultivation world that can travel far across the sea without human power?"  "Yes," Zhu Tianbiao explained. "For cultivators who have reached the Red Lotus realm and can fly, it's not necessary, but it's used by those below Red Lotus."  "Is it difficult to build?"  "Not difficult! Actually, it doesn't look much different from normal sea ships, except that there's a spiral paddle crafted by artisans at the stern, connected to a transmission device to drive it forward. If possible, a magical treasure is used to power it; otherwise, the power of a dragon horse running on a wheel at the stern is used to drive it. Its speed is much faster than that of ordinary human-powered ships. Cave Master, why do you ask?"  Ignoring the question, Miao Yi pointed to the spot and said, "Right here. Excavate a small dock and build a sea ship exclusively for our Dong Lai Cave's use. Later on, have Yan Xiu contact the local workers in Dong Lai City to construct it."  Zhu Tianbiao saluted, "Cave Master is wise!"  "I mean..." Miao Yi was about to ask why he was being praised as wise without even asking what his intentions were, as if his mind wasn't quite right. However, realizing that he and Zhu Tianbiao had no common language and that it would be like playing the lute to a cow, he decided not to waste his breath. He took out a silver spear and marked the rocks, then waved his hand, "We've been out for a few days, have seen almost everything, let's go back." Chapter 83: The Bottomless Pit (Part 1)  It was clear that Wang Zifa took good care of fellow sect members, with four second-grade White Lotus disciples taking turns guarding the gate. Today, it was Nan Sisi on duty, and Miao Yi dismounted from his horse under the mountain gate archway, along with Zhu Tianbiao.  "The Cave Master, you've returned, everyone has been anxiously waiting for your return," Nan Sisi took the reins handed over by the two, turned her head, and immediately used magic to shout, "The Cave Master is back."  Miao Yi glanced at Nan Sisi a few more times, smiling as he entered the mountain gate. He certainly did not think everyone would miss him so much, guessing that Nan Sisi was just flattering him.  Before he even reached the main hall, he saw members of his cave sweeping in from all sides, greeting him with, "The Cave Master has returned."  Miao Yi nodded, leading the group into the main hall. After sitting alone in the high seat, he asked, "Nothing happened while I was away, right?"  "Something happened!" Several people almost said in unison, concern written on their faces.  "Something happened? Everyone seems fine, what could have happened?" Miao Yi looked to Yan Xiu below for answers, as he was the one he trusted the most.  Yan Xiu was quite calm, cupping his hands and saying, "Cave Master, on the second day after you left, Mountain Master Qin Weiwei led people here, pressing for the truth about Song Fuzhi's death."  At the mention of that woman, Miao Yi's face darkened. It wasn't that he was worried about Song Fuzhi's death being exposed, but that he had just taken office, and that woman came to check immediately afterward. What did it mean? And he had even sent a report to her immediately. It was clear she didn't trust him.  Miao Yi's gaze swept over everyone, and he couldn't help but coldly snort, "That wench didn't deliberately cause trouble, did she?"  "......" The crowd, initially worried, suddenly fell silent, their eyes wide as they looked at him, each of them giving a thumbs-up in their hearts. The Cave Master was bold to curse the foster daughter of the Prefecture Chief and the Mountain Master of Zhenhai Mountain in public!  "Cough, cough!" Miao Yi coughed twice, realizing he had misspoken, and with a change of face, he asked, "The Mountain Master didn't say anything, right?"  Wang Zifa and others exchanged glances secretly. It seemed that the relationship between the Cave Master and Prefecture Chief Yang Qing was not as everyone imagined, and in fact, he appeared to hold a deep grudge, even cursing Yang Qing's daughter as a wench.  The people of Lan Yu Sect had joined Yang Qing's command, each with their own mission, and they couldn't fully obey Yang Qing. These people, now grasped by Miao Yi, were worried about how to deal with their own sect in the future. Now it seemed that Cave Master Miao could be secretly won over to Lan Yu Sect's side. If Yang Qing's trusted followers could be turned into Lan Yu Sect's hidden spies placed by Yang Qing's side, it could be reported to the sect, and maybe even considered a merit.  Yan Xiu, not considering so much, replied, "The Mountain Master didn't really say anything, just kept pressing for the truth behind our petition."  Just this? Miao Yi thought it was a bigger issue. As long as he could control the mouths of the people on Lan Yu Sect's side, even if Qin Weiwei knew the truth, so what? He didn't believe Yang Qing would depose him right after supporting him, as that would be like slapping his own face and admitting to poor judgment.  He disbelieved that Yang Qing would do something to harm his own authority. Besides, he hadn't done anything wrong, had he? Dong Lai Cave was his domain, and what was wrong with him organizing Dong Lai Cave? Yang Qing assigned him to Dong Lai Cave, so he should be supportive, not pull his legs.  Miao Yi nonchalantly asked, "None of you have said anything wrong, have you?"  Everyone immediately responded in a jumble, "We've kept our lips sealed, but the key issue is that Dan Biaoyi was taken away by the Mountain Master, and we don't know if Dan Biaoyi can withstand it."  Miao Yi laughed and said, "Don't worry about this matter. I believe Dan Biaoyi won't talk nonsense."  He didn't say what he was thinking: Dan Biaoyi was part of the murder of Song Fuzhi, so it would be strange if Dan Biaoyi easily spoke up.  In fact, Yan Xiu and Qiu Shaogun, who seemed relatively calm, also thought this way.  As soon as this conversation ended, a faint sound of galloping hooves could be heard from outside.  After waiting for a while, they saw the just-mentioned Dan Biaoyi briskly enter the main hall, energetically salute everyone, and then bow in the middle to say, "Cave Master!"  Before Dan Biaoyi could speak, everyone had already crowded around, bombarding him with questions about whether he had said anything when taken away by the Mountain Master.  With Yang Qing's words as a foundation, Dan Biaoyi naturally assured everyone that he had definitely not betrayed anyone.  With that assurance, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, patting his shoulder and saying he was reliable.  Miao Yi, sitting high above, was also pleased with Dan Biaoyi's words. He crossed his legs and felt secretly proud, thinking that Dong Lai Cave was entirely under his control.  "Don't celebrate too early, do you all know Zheng Jinlong?" Dan Biaoyi looked around and asked.  Wang Zifa nodded and said, "Of course, he's our senior brother, who joined the sect even before Song Fuzhi."  Everyone was curious why he mentioned Zheng Jinlong, and Dan Biaoyi pointed outside, saying, "He came with me and is now waiting outside for the Cave Master's summons!"  Everyone had a bad feeling, and Wang Zifa immediately asked, "Why has Senior Brother Zheng come here?"  Dan Biaoyi sighed, "Although I withstood the questioning, the petition we made was passed to Lan Yu Sect for scrutiny, and it seems a senior from our sect who coordinates affairs in Nan Xuan Prefecture personally spoke to the Prefecture Chief, stating that Song Fuzhi deserved death for his disrespect, requesting the Prefecture Chief to allow Lan Yu Sect to send another person to fill Song Fuzhi's vacancy to atone for the crime. Thus, Zheng Jinlong came with me. Gentlemen, to put it bluntly, our sect seems suspicious of this matter, and Zheng Jinlong has been indirectly questioning me along the way. It's best to be prepared."  After saying this, he cupped his fists to Miao Yi and said, "I deliberately left Zheng Jinlong outside so I could report to you in advance, hoping the Cave Master can prepare early."  Miao Yi nodded, looking at the crowd and asking, "What do you think about this?"  After exchanging glances, Wang Zifa spoke seriously, "Cave Master, Senior Brother Zheng's arrival is probably as Dan Biaoyi said, to probe the truth behind Senior Brother Song's death."  Miao Yi sneered, "Your Lan Yu Sect is really never-ending, wanting to probe our reality. If he doesn't behave when he comes, you all go together and take him down. We have the advantage of numbers and don't have to fear him. By the way, how strong is his cultivation?"  The crowd's expressions changed dramatically, and Wang Zifa hurriedly waved his hands, saying, "No! Cave Master, if we kill Senior Brother Zheng, then the trouble will be huge. It's easy to kill Senior Brother Zheng, but what after that? If our sect sends another disciple with Blue Lotus cultivation, what will we do?"  Yan Xiu, Qiu Shaogun, and Dan Biaoyi glanced at each other, their expressions twitching slightly. The Cave Master was actually discussing the murder of a Lan Yu Sect disciple with a group of Lan Yu Sect disciples, and he was serious about it. What kind of situation was this? Lan Yu Sect had really taken in a good group of disciples. Chapter 84: The Bottomless Pit (Part 2)  Miao Yi said casually, "Neither left nor right is possible, so what do you suggest we do?"  Wang Zifa clasped his hands in salute and said, "Cave Master, I do have a method to bring Brother Zheng over to our side, but it requires your help with one thing."  Is he planning to drag our fellow sect brother into the mud? Miao Yi muttered in his heart and asked, "Speak up and let's hear it."  Wang Zifa responded, "Cave Master, Brother Zheng is also a cultivator of the Third Rank of White Lotus. If... if the Cave Master can allow Brother Zheng to enjoy the same treatment as us in the distribution of the Wish Power Beads, I have a way to persuade Brother Zheng."  Many furrowed their brows and quickly observed Miao Yi's reaction, as this request seemed a bit excessive. Everyone was already going to divide the Wish Power Beads, leaving only three for the Cave Master. If Zheng Jinlong were to also receive three, wouldn't that leave the Cave Master with nothing?  As expected, Miao Yi's expression darkened, and he leaned forward slightly, "Wang Zifa, are you joking? If you take all the Wish Power Beads, then what am I, the Cave Master, working for?  I'll tell you, at the end of the year when we harvest the Wish Power Beads, there will be twenty-four beads. Your side will only get fourteen; that's already the limit I can offer. How to divide them is your business. As for your Brother Zheng, if you can pacify him, then pacify him; if not, just get rid of him. I hate it when people set their sights on me."  He was not afraid of any Brother Zheng or crooked brothers. With so many people under him, a Third Rank White Lotus cultivator would still be at his mercy when on his territory, so why would he need to compromise?  "Cave Master, please don't misunderstand, that's not what I meant," Wang Zifa hurriedly waved his hands.  Miao Yi snorted coldly, "Then what do you mean?"  Everyone looked at Wang Zifa with a listening ear as he tentatively asked, "Didn't the Cave Master mention there are other sources of Wish Power Beads? My suggestion is that we first allocate three beads from my fellow junior brothers and sisters to give to Brother Zheng. When there are other sources of Wish Power Beads, it won't be too late for the Cave Master to make it up to them."  Upon hearing this, Hou Sheng, Shang Youlai, and Wang Xiuqin's expressions changed dramatically. It goes without saying that the beads would definitely not be allocated to Brother Zhu Tianbiao, who was of the Third Rank White Lotus cultivation. It would certainly be their misfortune as junior brothers and sisters of the Second Rank White Lotus.  The most crucial point was that the Cave Master's so-called other sources of Wish Power Beads were only lip service, and no one had ever seen them. Naturally, it was most prudent to secure the benefits that could be obtained first. Who knew what the future would hold?  However, since Wang Zifa had spoken, their reluctance could only be kept in their hearts without daring to speak out.  Nan Sisi, who was guarding the mountain gate outside, was unaware of the situation inside the hall. Otherwise, she would certainly not be pleased either.  "So that's it!" Miao Yi tapped his fingers on the armrest and pondered for a while before slowly nodding, "I can agree to your request. However, when it's time to earn other sources of Wish Power Beads, you can't back down. You must accompany me!"  Yan Xiu's heart suddenly skipped a beat, and something flashed through his mind. Could it be that the Cave Master really intended to go hunting in the Starry Sea?  Wang Zifa immediately nodded and smiled, "Of course, we will all follow the Cave Master's orders and accompany you."  He didn't make an absolute commitment; the premise was that they would go wherever the Cave Master could go, following him!  Miao Yi smiled and looked at the other disciples of the Blue Jade Sect, asking, "Do you have any objections?"  Wang Zifa immediately turned his cold gaze toward his fellow junior brothers and sisters. Although Hou Sheng and the others were somewhat reluctant, they still forced a smile and nodded.  "Good!" Miao Yi clapped his hand on the armrest, "This matter is settled then. That Zheng Jinlong will be left to you fellow sect members to deal with.  Shan Biaoyi, let him in!"  Shan Biaoyi took the order and went out. After a while, he brought in a plump man in blue clothes with a gentle smile on his face, looking younger than Song Fu.  Wang Zifa and the others clasped their hands and called him Brother.  The newcomer greeted everyone with a salute and finally stood firm, smiling and saluting to Miao Yi who was in the high seat, "Subordinate Zheng Jinlong has been ordered to come to Donglai Cave to serve, and greets the Cave Master!"  This person seemed much more sensible than Song Fu, at least more palatable to Miao Yi. He gestured with his hand, "No need for formalities."  After a few exchanges of pleasantries, as everyone was dispersing from the council hall, Miao Yi suddenly called out, "Shan Biaoyi."  Shan Biaoyi, who had reached the door, turned around and walked back, "Does the Cave Master have any orders?"  Miao Yi, slowly descending from his seat, looked at him with a half-smiling expression, "Did he really not say anything? Did that... Mountain Master just let you come back?"  Shan Biaoyi's heart skipped a beat. Thinking that he hadn’t revealed any flaws, he said with a surprised face, "I was part of the group that killed Song Fu. It wouldn't benefit me to speak out. Is the Cave Master doubting me?"  "No, just asking casually," Miao Yi laughed and patted his shoulder before turning to greet Yan Xiu and walking towards the inner hall.  In the backyard, full and satisfied, Heitan lay by the door flicking its tail and dozing off. Miao Yi entered the yard and it just opened its eyes for a glance. Safe – it wasn't that woman who had wielded a knife at its backside, so it continued to doze off.  Yan Xiu, who followed, tried to ask, "Cave Master, are you suspecting that Shan Biaoyi has revealed the truth?"  "No, I just feel that Qin Weiwei, that wretched woman, wouldn't be so easy to talk to. That woman has been trying to find fault with me," Miao Yi waved his hand, "Even if he did speak, it doesn't matter."  Hearing that the Cave Master had returned, Qian'er and Xue'er, who were waiting in the yard, also bowed their heads slightly and followed behind the two men.  As soon as Miao Yi entered the room and sat down, the two maids immediately offered fragrant tea and then stood silently to the left and right. Miao Yi just glanced at them and gestured for them to leave; he didn't have much trust in them at the moment.  After the two left, Miao Yi spoke to Yan Xiu, "I've marked a spot by the sea. Later, contact Donglai City and organize some laborers..."  He talked about building a wharf and ships, and Yan Xiu immediately became a bit alarmed, "Cave Master, you're not really thinking of going hunting in the Starry Sea, are you?"  "You think too much. It's for cultivation."  "Cultivation?"  "The laborer's wages can't be shortchanged. You handle this matter; it's decided. I'm going out for a few days, I'll go wash."  Miao Yi left after dropping the words.  Yan Xiu could only clasp his hands in agreement, turn around and leave the hall. Seeing Qian'er and Xue'er outside, he casually mentioned, "The Cave Master is going to bathe."  As he passed by them, he paused for a moment and reminded, "In all of Donglai City, not everyone has the chance to be the Cave Master's maids. Maids who can't gain the Cave Master's trust can't stay here for long..." Chapter 85: The Bottomless Pit (Part 3)  Inside the quiet chamber, Miao Yi had just stripped off his clothes and soaked into the temperature-appropriate pool. He closed his eyes and enjoyed it for a while until he heard footsteps and opened his eyes again to look towards the doorway of the stone chamber. Who was intruding here?  The answer was revealed as the somewhat anxious Qian'er and Xue'er entered. They had removed their outer garments, wearing only a tube top on the upper body and short bloomers made of caged fabric below. The crystal-clear lustrous shoulders, the delicate and fair collarbones, the limbs like pink lotus roots, and the exquisite curves of their waists were all exposed to the air.  The two girls, like bashful flower buds, dressed in minimal clothing, walked in with blushing faces, holding bathing supplies. Miao Yi's mouth fell open, and he was speechless for a while. Suddenly thinking of something, his face flushed red, and he quickly grabbed a piece of clothing from the shore, pressed it into the water, and covered his groin area, anxiously saying, "What are you two doing here?"  "We are here to serve the cave master with his bath!" both girls said with flushed faces.  Miao Yi clutched at his lower body and quickly shook his head, saying, "No need, no need, I can do it myself."  "This is what we should do," the two maidservants remembered the words of Yan Xiu from before. They set down their things with a firm attitude, stretched out their fair legs, and stepped into the pool, not caring whether Miao Yi agreed or not. One helped Miao Yi untie his hair, while the other scooped water to wet his shoulders.  Miao Yi was extremely embarrassed, even a little angry out of shame, but some things are a man's nature. Once the two girls entered the water, how could the thin, semi-transparent short gauze clothes withstand the flirtatious spring water? Soaked and revealing, along with the virgin body fragrance, made Miao Yi's heartbeat accelerate in an instant. He didn't dare to look any further, and he wanted to send the girls away, but the words got stuck in his throat.  He also didn't dare to stare any longer at the two girls' partially concealed bodies, so he closed his eyes and clutched his groin tightly, letting the girls' soft hands touch his body. The sensation of their fingertips gliding over his skin made him shiver uncontrollably.   However, he gradually adapted to it, and after adapting, he felt indescribably comfortable, except that his hands kept clutching his groin area tightly. It is known that before Donglai City selected these girls to be offered to the immortals, they specifically hired people to train them, naturally to please the immortals, so the skills of serving people were practiced over and over again. Donglai City would not dare to offer anything less...  The environment of a cave mansion that sits in control of an area will never be too bad. Amidst the dreamlike green mountains, between the mountain paths and rocky trails, there are flying birds and animals, a group of people, passing strange peaks, observing the forest sea, listening to the sound of spring water ding dong.  Wang Zifa and a group of junior brothers and sisters led Senior Brother Zheng to appreciate the scenery of Donglai Cave and get familiar with the environment of Donglai Cave, all showing great respect to their senior brother.  "The Six Saints dominate the world, and the various cave mansions under their jurisdiction also occupy the lands blessed with natural spirit and beauty. It's a great place!" A few of them entered a mountain pavilion, and as they listened to the junior brothers and sisters' introduction, Zheng Jinlong sincerely sighed at the surrounding scenery, which was no less than that of the grand Lan Yu Sect.  He always had a gentle smile on his face, and no one could tell anything from the expression of their senior brother.  Standing beside him, Wang Zifa smiled and said, "Now, our Lan Yu Sect has also entered the fray, there is much to be done!"  Zheng Jinlong 'oh'ed, and asked, "Do you still have the sect in your eyes?"  As soon as these words came out, everyone's smiles stiffened, and the atmosphere instantly became awkward, thinking that what was expected to come had finally arrived.  "Senior brother's words make us feel apprehensive..."   Before Wang Zifa could finish, Zheng Jinlong suddenly turned around and interrupted, still smiling, but his tone already carried a chilling coldness, "Apprehensive? Do you think your courage is not big enough?"  Everyone's eyes fell on Wang Zifa's face because he had said he had a way to deal with it.  Wang Zifa looked surprised and said, "What does senior brother mean?"  Zheng Jinlong smiled and said, "Junior brother, are you pretending to be confused with me? The death of Junior Brother Song, don't you think you owe the sect an explanation?"  Wang Zifa's expression became serious, and he said in a deep voice, "Junior Brother Song almost ruined the good things of our Lan Yu Sect, Song Fu deserved to die! Given another chance, we would still do the same!"  Zheng Jinlong was taken aback, his gaze flickering before he spoke slowly, "Could there be some hidden details? I would like to hear more about it."  Wang Zifa whispered, "Senior brother, even if the sect doesn't say it, everyone knows it in their heart. How can our Lan Yu Sect be content with being inferior to others? Sooner or later, we will have to replace Yang Qing. Do you agree or not?"  Zheng Jinlong neither agreed nor disagreed, did not say yes, and did not say no, but asked back, "What does this have to do with the death of Junior Brother Song?"  "Of course, it's related."  Wang Zifa asked, "What do you think of Miao Yi, senior brother?"  Zheng Jinlong couldn't guess what he meant, and after a bit of thought, he pondered and said, "I'm not clear about the other aspects, I only know his cultivation is weak and not presentable, and if not for Yang Qing's favor, he would not have today. It's not too much to say he's Yang Qing's confidant. Is this satisfactory to junior brother?"  "Senior brother's insight is profound!" Wang Zifa clasped his fists, "As senior brother said! But senior brother only knows one part and not the other. The relationship between Miao Yi and Yang Qing is not as close as outsiders see. We once heard him slip up and curse Qin Weiwei as a 'cheap woman'!"  Zheng Jinlong naturally knew that Qin Weiwei was Yang Qing's adopted daughter, and Miao Yi dared to scold the lord's daughter as a cheap woman? It was somewhat strange and he said, "Is there such a thing? But what does this have to do with Junior Brother Song's death?"  Wang Zifa immediately whispered into his ear, exaggerating and modifying the facts a bit as he murmured a few words.  Zheng Jinlong was shocked, "Three beads? Where did he get so many power beads to distribute to us?"  "I saw him with my own eyes holding a power bead that gathered the wishes of ten thousand people in one year..." Wang Zifa continued to mutter a few words.  "Does he have another source for the power beads?" Zheng Jinlong's eyes lit up.  Wang Zifa sighed, "Now senior brother should understand our difficulty. To say something unpleasant, although your status in the sect is higher than ours, once this news goes back to the sect, the small Donglai Cave will definitely become highly sought after, and those elders will surely send their own trusted relatives to replace us. Our defeat is a small matter, but if the news is exposed, once Miao Yi is called back by Yang Qing, our efforts to find the source of the power beads for the sect would be in vain. This is the sect's loss, so Song Fu deserved to die!"  Zheng Jinlong didn't believe these guys wanted to find out the source of the power beads for the sect. They probably wanted to find out for themselves, at least by getting Miao Yi out of Donglai Cave, the three power beads a year would definitely be missed, and if someone else became the cave master, they certainly wouldn't be as generous.   However, with so many benefits, he himself was also tempted. His junior brothers told him this news because they wanted him to share a piece of the pie and weather the storm together.   Yet, the matter had already aroused the suspicion of the sect, otherwise, they wouldn't have sent him. Zheng Jinlong frowned and said, "Junior brother, I can understand your painstaking efforts for the sect, but you should know that not giving a reasonable explanation to the sect will not pass muster, how should I teach me?" Chapter 86: The Bottomless Pit (Part Four)  Wang Zifa knew that he had also been tempted and felt a secret joy in his heart, but he feigned surprise on the surface and said, "Brother, did you not understand the meaning in my words earlier?"  Zheng Jinlong was stunned for a moment and pondered, but still did not understand and asked, "Please explain it to me, junior brother."  Wang Zifa spoke in a low voice, "As brother mentioned, Miao Yi is Yang Qing's confidant, but in fact, from the moment Miao Yi called Qin Weiwei a 'cheap woman,' it's clear that things are not as they seem. This surrendered soldier, Miao Yi, obviously holds considerable dissatisfaction with Yang Qing. Remember, he initially preferred death over surrender and only submitted to Yang Qing under duress. Our Lan Yu Sect has a lot of potential in this situation. If we can turn Yang Qing's confidant into a spy we plant by Yang Qing's side... Brother, explaining it this way to our superiors should alleviate some of the sect's suspicions."  "..." Zheng Jinlong fell silent. If he really did this, he would become entangled with these people, and if anything went wrong, not only would they not be able to escape, but neither would he himself.  After returning to his own cultivation estate, Zheng Jinlong was very hesitant and conflicted. On one hand, there were the terrible consequences of angering his sect, and on the other, the immense temptation of benefits. But in the end, he couldn't give up the benefits that might come his way. After a few days of observation and consideration, coupled with the continuous encouragement and temptation from Wang Zifa and others, Zheng Jinlong gritted his teeth and wrote a secret memorial.  The secret memorial also listed and fabricated a bunch of arrogant and domineering deeds by Song Fu, saying that Song Fu did not care about the big picture at all and indeed deserved to die. However, after Miao Yi killed Song Fu, Wang Zifa and others were also very angry and almost couldn't resist having a fight with Miao Yi.  But just then, Wang Zifa and others accidentally learned that Miao Yi was only superficially obedient to Yang Qing, and in fact, he was very dissatisfied with Yang Qing, even secretly cursing Yang Qing's foster daughter as a 'cheap woman.' Wang Zifa and others were also considering the bigger picture, feeling that it was not yet time for Lan Yu Sect to fall out with Yang Qing over a Song Fu. Since Song Fu was dead and nothing could be done about it, they decided to go with the flow. Thus, Wang Zifa and others decided to hold back on this matter, first protecting Miao Yi, winning his gratitude, and striving to develop Miao Yi, the confidant, into a spy to be placed by Yang Qing's side, to be used when Lan Yu Sect needed him.  Moreover, Miao Yi's cultivation was low, making him easy to control. Controlling Miao Yi was akin to controlling Dong Lai Cave, and if Miao Yi were to be driven out of Dong Lai Cave for this matter, and Yang Qing appointed someone with a higher cultivation level to take over, it would not be convenient for Lan Yu Sect to control Dong Lai Cave.  Zheng Jinlong finally said that he also felt that Wang Zifa and others indeed had the best intentions, and asked the sect to consider it carefully!  In the courtyard, Zheng Jinlong hesitated as he stuffed the secret memorial into the leg canister of a grey hawk, still undecided. In the end, he clenched his teeth and threw the grey hawk into the air. The grey hawk messenger quickly flapped its wings and flew into the distance...  There's a saying that even heroes find it hard to overcome the allure of a beautiful woman, which might be somewhat exaggerated. However, after bathing with the two maidservants once, Miao Yi at least no longer treated the two with complete indifference as mere helpers. Although Miao Yi controlled himself and did not cross the final line, the two did have skin-to-skin contact in the most private situation. Seeing the two maidservants after such intimate contact, his feelings were no longer the same. Subconsciously, he regarded them as his own people, and his commands became more casual.  Qian'er and Xue'er, facing their master, the head of the cave, no longer felt as nervous as before, even finding it funny when they thought back to the first time they helped the master bathe, how even the mighty cave master was more shy and nervous than them. It turns out that immortals could also be shy!  After entering the backyard of Dong Lai Grand Hall, Yan Xiu smiled slightly. In the pavilion, Xue'er played the zither with her ten fingers, and amidst the beautiful sound of the zither, Qian'er danced gracefully like a fairy, while Miao Yi held a teacup and enjoyed the performance, living a good life.  Seeing Yan Xiu come in, Miao Yi gestured with his hand, and Qian'er and Xue'er both stopped.  Yan Xiu, who entered the pavilion, glanced at the two and asked with a smile, "Cave Master, are these two still satisfactory? If not, I can ask the city lord of Dong Lai to replace them with two others."  This was still based on the reason of being followers; other people did not enjoy such good treatment. Once chosen, they could not be switched at will, and no cultivator could treat all the women in the world as their own to use freely. If that were the case, wouldn't that lead to chaos in the world? However, the cave master did have some special treatment.  Only those within the system under the Six Saints could enjoy the treatment of being assigned maidservants. Cultivators outside the system did not have such privileges. Other cultivators could visit brothels without problems, but if they dared to mess with followers and disrupt the balance of procreation, the cultivators within the system would immediately mobilize troops to encircle and pursue them. They needed to maintain their special rights!  This was also one of the reasons why everyone wanted to enter the system; the enjoyment of various rights was incomparable to that of the scattered cultivators.  Upon hearing Yan Xiu's words, Qian'er and Xue'er immediately looked nervously at Miao Yi. Before they were about to become the maidservants of an immortal, Dong Lai City had put a lot of effort into training them, providing good food and care, and no one dared to offend them, for they were soon to become the maidservants of an immortal, and offending them might lead to future retribution.  But once they were sent back, they would fall from heaven to earth. Without the backing of an immortal, no one would take them seriously, and the consequences of being returned were imaginable; it certainly meant that they had not served the immortal well, naturally angering those who had put in a lot of effort.  Miao Yi could not stand the two girls' sorrowful gazes and, thinking of the intimate skin contact in the water, coughed dryly and said, "It's alright, they are quite handy to use, no need to change."  He did not want the embarrassing details of his bathing to be spread.  This meant that the two girls had passed the probation period and obtained official recognition. Their status changed instantly; they officially became the close people of the cave master, not just anyone could offend them, and even Yan Xiu immediately bowed to the two, saying, "Great auntie, little auntie!"  Even an immortal addressing them with respect, the two girls' eyes lit up with joy, understanding that the cave master had officially acknowledged the two of them. From then on, their status would be higher than many others, at least higher than the other maidservants who were also selected to serve the immortals, because they were the cave master's maidservants.  Before coming, the two girls did not know that they would be serving the cave master. Not everyone had such luck; at least out of a hundred thousand people, only two would emerge.  Excited and well-behaved, the two girls looked at Miao Yi with a different gaze and gently moved to stand behind him, one on each side.  Miao Yi no longer avoided the two and knew that once he had chosen them, he had to start involving them in some matters. In the future, they would serve him as Qing Mei and Qing Ju served Yang Qing, otherwise, if they knew nothing, what could they do?  "Any reaction from Zheng Jinlong's side?" Miao Yi asked.  Yan Xiu replied, "So far, there has been no response. Zheng Jinlong has been holed up in his cultivation estate and has not come out. Wang Zifa and the others are very anxious, constantly urging." Chapter 87: The Bottomless Pit (Part 5)  As the two were discussing, Zheng Jinlong, who was anxiously waiting for news in the courtyard, stopped in his tracks and looked towards the black dot approaching from the sky, stretching out his arm to receive it. The messenger hawk he had sent out two days ago had finally returned, landing on his arm with a swoosh. He eagerly took out a narrow jade strip from the hawk’s leg cylinder and poured his mana into it to read the message. It read: Prince Fa and the others are well-intentioned, cooperate with them!  This was the reply from the Blue Jade Sect. Zheng Jinlong immediately breathed a sigh of relief. Not knowing the stance of his sect, he didn’t dare to openly express his position to Prince Fa and the others, for fear of being implicated if the Blue Jade Sect decided to investigate the matter thoroughly, something he wouldn’t be able to withstand.  Having fooled his sect, Zheng Jinlong gained confidence, quickly put the hawk back into the aerie, and turned to go back inside. He took off his blue clothes and changed into a set of black attire. The master of Donglai Cave disliked the clothes of the Blue Jade Sect and insisted on unifying the attire of Donglai Cave.  When Zheng Jinlong, now dressed in black, stepped out of the courtyard, Prince Fa and the others appeared from nowhere and repeated their old tune: "Senior Brother, have you made your decision?" They were also anxious. If Zheng Jinlong really refused to cooperate, then they would have no choice but to follow Miao Yi's plan to join forces and deal with Zheng Jinlong.  Although they knew this was a temporary solution, they had no other choice and could only take it one step at a time.  "Seeing that you are all dedicated to the sect, I have racked my brains for you this time!" Zheng Jinlong sighed and handed the recently received jade strip secret message to them.  After taking turns injecting mana to read the message, each of them was overjoyed. At the signal of Prince Fa, they stood in a row and bowed their hands together: "Thank you, Senior Brother!"  "It's been a few days since we’ve seen the cave master, and we don’t know if there are any tasks from him!" After Zheng Jinlong said this, everyone knew he had decided to share in the spoils and wanted to reassure the cave master.  Everyone immediately flattered and accompanied him.  Miao Yi, who had been notified, came to the front hall from the rear hall with Qian'er and Xue'er. Miao Yi sat down in the high seat, while Qian'er and Xue'er stood nervously to the left and right of his position. Yan Xiu, who had come out with them, stood at his own place below.  "Announce their arrival!" Miao Yi said indifferently.  Just now, Yan Xiu had explained the rules to the two girls. As the younger aunt, Xue'er's body trembled slightly, and she immediately stepped to the door of the hall. Gathering her courage, she called out to the people waiting below the high steps outside: "The cave master invites you to enter the hall for a meeting!"  Her voice was not soft, but one could clearly hear the tremble in it, showing her nervousness. It was understandable for her to be nervous facing a group of immortals and showing such authority for the first time.  As Zheng Jinlong and the others entered the hall, Miao Yi saw the black clothes on him and understood Zheng Jinlong's attitude. A smile flashed in his eyes, knowing that this fellow had also been dragged into the water.  Looking at Prince Fa, who understood the implication, he immediately sent a message: “It’s settled!”  "Greetings to the cave master!" Everyone bowed their hands together.  Now that everyone was gathered, there was no fear of being short-handed in a fight. Even if they encountered a Fourth Grade White Lotus cultivator, they could put up a fight. Miao Yi smiled and said, "No need for such formalities!"  Qian'er and Xue'er couldn't help but steal a glance at Miao Yi, realizing how imposing the cave master was, commanding so many immortals with his word.  In fact, there were only nine people below, plus one guarding the mountain gate outside, making a total of ten subordinates. Donglai Cave couldn't afford to support too many people.  But for the two girls who had just arrived, even one immortal was a lofty existence in their eyes, let alone ten. It was already a lot for them, as they had never seen so many once-revered immortals appear before them all at once.  If they knew that their master had the lowest cultivation among all the immortals present, one could only wonder what they would think.  After the nine people lined up in two rows, Zheng Jinlong stepped forward again and bowed: "Subordinate Zheng Jinlong is new here, and has yet to achieve any merit for Donglai Cave. I wonder if the cave master has any tasks for me."  This was to show his willingness to accept orders.  Miao Yi looked amused: "Newcomers should always show some initiative. How about guarding the mountain gate for a day?"  The people below were startled. Asking a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator to guard the gate again? Was this a repeat of the previous tactic? Did the cave master not understand the implication and wanted to harm Zheng Jinlong?  Zheng Jinlong was also startled. He had only been politely expressing his willingness on the surface, not expecting the other party to take it seriously. He had only just realized that, although this fellow had a low cultivation, he had the ability to kill a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator.  However, he quickly saw the cave master's intention. It was to see if he was truly willing to accept an assignment. The cave master didn’t trust mere words; he wanted to see real action.  "Your subordinate obeys!" Zheng Jinlong accepted with a fist salute.  With his agreement, Miao Yi didn't want to beat around the bush. To him, this was his territory, and the matter was simple.  "Now that everyone is almost here, let me introduce you to two people," Miao Yi said, raising his hand to point to the two maidservants, "This is Qian'er, and this is Xue'er!"  The crowd looked at each other and then bowed their hands in turn: "Greetings to the elder aunt, greetings to the younger aunt!"  Qian'er and Xue'er, both nervous, bowed in response.  After some exchanges and everyone dispersed, Zheng Jinlong went to replace the guard at the mountain gate. The current guard, Wang Xiuqin, was terrified. How could she dare to have Senior Brother guard the mountain gate?  After hearing it was the mountain master's intention, Wang Xiuqin relented but whispered a reminder: "Senior Brother, you know about Brother Song's incident; please be extra cautious."  Zheng Jinlong nodded, appearing indifferent on the surface but actually on high alert, still a bit worried that the cave master might play dirty tricks.  The incident with Song Fu being attacked at the mountain gate was not a secret. Everyone guessed that Miao Yi was behind it, looking for an excuse to act out.  Therefore, Zheng Jinlong decided to guard the mountain gate at all costs today, not going anywhere else to avoid capsizing in a gutter...  The news of Zheng Jinlong's submission spread quickly to Zhenhai Mountain. Qin Weiwei, dressed in white clothes like snow, lay on a couch in the loft, looking at the secret report in her hand with disgust. That guy had managed to deal with the person sent by the Blue Jade Sect to investigate. Was the Blue Jade Sect useless?  After Song Fu's death, Yang Qing also knew he couldn’t hide it. It made no sense to hide such matters, so he called the person in charge from the Blue Jade Sect stationed there to show them a pile of petitions.  The person from the Blue Jade Sect didn't say a word and directly condemned Song Fu's death, but then asked Yang Qing to make arrangements for another person to go and redeem himself.  Everyone knew that redeeming himself was a pretense, and the real aim was to investigate the true facts. However, Yang Qing agreed on the spot.  Later, when Qin Weiwei asked Yang Qing why he had agreed, what if the truth was found out?  Yang Qing said if the truth came out, it came out. At that time, he would directly express his stance to protect that kid. He wanted to see the attitude of the Blue Jade Sect, to test their bottom line. Secondly, he wanted to send some trouble to that kid to see if he could handle it and not disappoint him!  The secret report was quickly forwarded to Nanxuan Prefecture.  In the same mountain pavilion, Yang Qing, who received the secret report, chuckled lightly: "Another one has been swallowed up. That kid really has turned Donglai Cave into a bottomless pit, swallowing up whoever comes! It seems the Blue Jade Sect is nothing special after all, unable to handle even a small cave master under me, haha!"  Qingmei and Qingju, standing beside him, exchanged a glance. That kid had once again not disappointed the prefecture master. It was obvious that the prefecture master was increasingly appreciating him, especially since he had dealt with the Blue Jade Sect in a way that pleased the prefecture master. Chapter 88: Incubating the Nether Eggs (Part 1)  Having settled Zheng Jinlong's matter and effectively dealt with the Lan Yu Sect, Miao Yi no longer had concerns to worry about and could finally concentrate on his cultivation. However, before that, there was still one thing he needed to do. He had just taken over Donglai Cave and had been too busy to tidy it up. Now that he had time, he decided to try to incubate the mantis eggs he had obtained with Old Bai in the Myriad Dust of the Mortal World.  On a day when the sky was just beginning to light up, Miao Yi instructed Qian'er and Xue'er to guard outside and not allow anyone to disturb him. He then secluded himself in the quiet room to prepare, as Old Bai had mentioned that the secret method must not be divulged to others. Upon taking out the large chunk of insect eggs, the temperature in the room seemed to drop slightly, and holding the eggs felt like holding blocks of ice. Miao Yi clicked his tongue, "Indeed, these are freakish!"  Carefully, he peeled the insect eggs one by one from the mucous membrane, and a hundred quail-sized, black insect eggs were laid out on a jade plate. He then took out a small knife, held the blade in his left palm, and pulled with his right hand. His palm was instantly bleeding profusely.  With his bloodied palm, he quickly turned and caressed each insect egg, as Old Bai had instructed him to coat every single egg with his own blood, leaving no area untouched. By enveloping the eggs in his vital blood, he created a barrier between yin and yang and also allowed the nether embryos within the eggs to feel his presence from the start of their nurturing.  After some effort, he made sure each egg turned a blackish-red color without any mistakes. He then undid his bound hair and, with a bit of bravery, plucked hairs from his head. According to Old Bai’s secret method, the hairs had to be complete, without any breaks, and still have their roots, as if to hatch the nether eggs, the connection must not be broken.  He plucked over a hundred hairs, and after careful selection, discarded the ones without roots. He had to pluck several times from his head before he gathered a hundred intact hairs with roots. He dipped the roots of these hairs into the blood on his left palm, holding the tips in his hand.  With a spell, the hundred hairs immediately stiffened like bristles and spread out like a porcupine. Holding the hairs above the jade plate, he directed them at each of the insect eggs in the plate and stabbed down.  The surface of the insect eggs was not hard but was exceptionally tough and smooth. It took some effort to pierce the surface with the bloodied hair roots and insert them into the eggs. This method, as Old Bai said, was known as "the slender thread connecting the two realms of yin and yang."  Yin referred to the nether eggs, and yang referred to Miao Yi. His hair was the thread that linked the two, ensuring that the hatched nether mantis would be in tune with his mind and submit to his control.  The reason Miao Yi went through the ordeal of plucking hair and shedding blood was in the hope that one day he could control the terrifying nether mantis. Although he did not know how formidable the nether mantis was, he could feel, even as a cultivator, that he was utterly powerless against it.  Almost instantly as the hundred hairs were inserted into the nether eggs, an intense bone-chilling coldness traveled up the hairs, not simply cold, but an illusionary sensation that seemed to momentarily transport him into the netherworld, making his soul tremble.  This eerie sensation instantly plunged Miao Yi into a state of dazed confusion, and gradually, his soul seemed to drift aimlessly in the eternal darkness of the netherworld. If it were anyone else, this state would indicate a loss of soul, leading to severe problems.  Fortunately, the 'Starfire Jue' he cultivated played a significant role at the crucial moment. When the coldness eroded his cultivated source of law within his body, it reflexively circulated on its own, spreading a warm sensation throughout his body that instantly expelled the coldness with the swiftness of lightning, not allowing any violation, extremely domineering.  Miao Yi shivered violently and quickly awoke from his dazed state, only to find that the surface of the hundred hairs had formed a layer of frost. "Goodness, these nether eggs are really bizarre to have caused my spirit to waver!" he exclaimed in amazement.  Now, he was even more eager to see what would hatch from these eggs. After steadying his mind, he carefully recalled and pondered the mental method taught by Old Bai. Grasping the hundred hairs, he silently channeled his magical power through the hairs into the hundred nether eggs, applying the secret method within.  In less than half an hour, Miao Yi opened his eyes and ceased channeling his magical power, releasing the handful of hair. Under the influence of his technique, the hundred hairs that had previously lost their frost once again quickly spread frost from the roots.  He did not know if this method would be effective, but he had followed Old Bai's instructions. He summoned a stalk of Starlight Immortal Grass from his storage ring, pursed his lips, and blew a wisp of star cloud onto the cut on his left palm. The blurry wound immediately healed at a visible rate.  After fully recovering, Miao Yi looked at the immortal grass in his hand and couldn't help but shake his head in wonder. He was indeed lucky; the nether mantis he encountered in the Myriad Dust of the Mortal World had a stalk of Starlight Immortal Grass attached to it. Without this immortal grass, incubating the nether eggs would have been troublesome.  The reason was simple: according to the secret method taught by Old Bai, the nether eggs had to be coated with one's fresh blood every day for eighty-one days, without missing a single day, or else all efforts would be wasted. That meant he had to make eighty-one cuts on himself and bleed every day continuously for eighty-one days. Without the fortune of finding this immortal grass, it would have been unbearable for cultivators, let alone ordinary people, to make cuts and bleed every day!  After washing the blood from his hands in the flowing hot spring pool, Miao Yi turned and carried the jade plate out of the quiet room. Qian'er and Xue'er, who were guarding outside, were curious about the items he was holding. What were these black and red things covered in white fluff on the plate?  Regardless of what they were, Xue'er took the initiative to help Miao Yi carry them. Perhaps accustomed to giving them orders, he handed it over to her without a second thought. Just as he was about to give them instructions, he noticed Xue'er's face turn pale instantly. She trembled while holding the jade plate, which slipped uncontrollably from her hands.  Fortunately, Miao Yi reacted quickly, catching the jade plate and grabbing Xue'er's arm as she was about to collapse. He then realized his oversight; the items in the jade plate had a heavy yin presence, which nearly affected him, and was too much for ordinary people to bear.  However, the technique he cultivated was highly effective against yin energy. He quickly cast a spell into Xue'er's body, sweeping away the invading yin energy in an instant. Xue'er, whose eyes had rolled back, finally came around, but the yin energy had already damaged her vitality in just a moment, leaving her standing weakly with a pale complexion. Chapter 89: Hatching the Underworld Egg (Part 2)  "Sorry, I forgot that you are mortals and cannot touch this thing." Miao Yi asked, "Xue'er, are you okay?"  Qian'er and Xue'er looked at the jade plate with awe, realizing it was something mortals couldn't touch. Xue'er shook her head and quickly apologized, "It's all the servant's fault, I almost smashed the cave master's item."  "It's okay." Miao Yi laughed and said, "I have something to assign you to do, follow me!" The two followed him out of the hall, only to see that it was already sunny outside. As soon as the thing in the jade plate was exposed to the sunlight, the frost-covered fur immediately emitted strands of black smoke, the frost disappeared, and the fur instantly returned to its original color.  Frost exposed to sunlight couldn't possibly melt so quickly, let alone emit black smoke. Obviously, the frost covering the fur was not a natural phenomenon but a manifestation of extremely yin energy.   The sight of the frost suddenly turning into hairs and emitting black smoke shocked Qian'er and Xue'er again because they didn't feel the immortal qi, but instead, they felt a kind of evil qi. The black coal that was dozing off with its snake tail at the entrance suddenly sneezed, raised its head, and opened its eyes wide to look at the thing in Miao Yi's hand, as if it sensed something.  However, seeing that Miao Yi was leading the two maidservants up to the 'Observatory,' and it didn't affect itself, it continued to sleep, as lazy as ever. The Observatory is actually a high platform convenient for stargazing. Miao Yi placed the jade plate on the ground of the Observatory. According to Old Bai, once it started, it couldn't touch the ground before hatching; it had to be isolated from the ground, and placing it on the Observatory was just right.  Under the scorching sun, Miao Yi squatted and observed for a while. The breeze was blowing the strands of hair inserted into the underworld egg. He didn't know whether what Old Bai said about letting the underworld fetus gradually become accustomed to the world of the living through these strands of hair was true or false.  "Qian'er, Xue'er!" Miao Yi stood up.  "Here!" The two girls responded in unison.  Miao Yi pointed to the thing in the jade plate and said, "Starting today, I'm going to enter closed-door cultivation. You two will take turns guarding under the Observatory. Don't let anyone come up and touch this thing, and you also must not touch it, and especially do not let it contact the ground under the Observatory. Every day before the sunset, or during cloudy and rainy days when the sun isn't visible, remember to come to the quiet room to call me. Also, before sunrise every day, you need to come to the quiet room to inform me!"  "The servant has remembered!" The two maids nodded in agreement.  The three of them descended from the Observatory and came to the pavilion. Miao Yi called the two to sit down with him and then asked, "Do you two know how to sew?"  The two nodded again and said, "Yes."  "Sew me a close-fitting vest..." Miao Yi began to gesture the style of the garment he wanted them to sew. After understanding his instructions, the two girls quickly went to fetch needle and thread, and fabric. Upon returning, Qian'er sat aside to cut the fabric, while Xue'er used a comb to tidy up Miao Yi's hair, which had become disheveled from plucking hairs before, and tied it neatly.  Just then, Yan Xiu entered the yard, found Miao Yi, and reported that he had already contacted Donglai City and that the construction of the dock and the ship would start that day.  "Don't shortchange the craftsmen's wages," Miao Yi reminded him.  This was not the first time he had mentioned this, and Yan Xiu naturally said that he would take care of it. Noticing Xue'er's pale complexion, he couldn't help but ask, "The little auntie doesn't seem to look very well. Is she sick?"  Xue'er quickly shook her head, still frightened by the earlier experience.  Miao Yi looked back at Xue'er, who still had a somewhat pale face, knowing that she was slightly injured earlier but that it wasn't a big problem.  He then said to Yan Xiu, "Speaking of them, I was just looking for you."  Yan Xiu asked, "What does the cave master need?"  "Do they both have the qualifications for cultivation?" Miao Yi asked.  As soon as this was said, Yan Xiu immediately guessed what Miao Yi was about to say, "Does the cave master want them to cultivate?"  Qian'er and Xue'er immediately glanced covertly at Miao Yi. It wasn't their first day here, and over the days, they had heard people talking about cultivation, vaguely understanding what it meant. They couldn't help but tense up and perked up their ears.  "Exactly!" Miao Yi nodded. He had this intention, feeling that the two weak girls by his side couldn't really do much, especially for those in cultivation, such maids were a bit troublesome for him. Going to the back mountain to fetch someone to see him took a long time, climbing up and down the mountain, they would be exhausted and their complexion would change. It wasn't a long-term solution. Just like Yang Qing, having two cultivator maidservants made things much more convenient, and they could also be used as personal guards.  Especially just now, when Xue'er almost had an accident upon touching the jade plate, he took the matter seriously.  "Where can I get a set of cultivation techniques for them?" Miao Yi asked.  Yan Xiu pondered for a moment and said, "Complete cultivation techniques are the lifeblood of each sect and will not be shared. Moreover, to control their disciples, they teach in stages, so it's probably very difficult to obtain them. If there is a chance to go to Liuyun Sha Hai (Flowing Clouds Sand Sea), that place is a lawless area, where many hermit cultivators who have no place in the Six Sacred Realms reside, and it's mixed with demons and ghosts. It's quite normal for some to engage in dark and underhanded dealings. There is a possibility to spend a lot of money to buy them, but no one can guarantee the completeness of the cultivation methods that have not been practiced. It may lead to deviation and possession by demons if not careful. After all, most cultivators memorize their techniques by heart, and even if they carry them, they make them understandable only to themselves to prevent the leakage of their cultivation methods."  "Liuyun Sha Hai..." Miao Yi muttered to himself, thinking of the enchanting woman he met at Miaofa Temple.  Shaking off the shadow of the proprietress's smiles and frowns from his mind, he shook his head and said, "That place is too far away, who would go there to take risks? Besides, like you said, it's not safe, is there no other way?"  Yan Xiu shook his head and said, "It's difficult! To suppress the number of cultivators in the world, such private trafficking of cultivation techniques is severely cracked down upon! Only in a place like Liuyun Sha Hai might such a thing occur."  He didn't say who was suppressing and cracking down, but Miao Yi understood that he was referring to the Six Saints. The Six Saints didn't want to see too many people sharing the world's spiritual power. Once cultivators became rampant, everyone would want to gain spiritual power, which would inevitably lead to chaos and pose a serious threat to the current rules. The Six Saints would not allow anyone to threaten them.  Miao Yi frowned and asked, "Where did the maidservants by the mansion master get their cultivation techniques?"  "Of course, the mansion master taught his own cultivation techniques. It should usually be like this," Yan Xiu said.  Saying this, Yan Xiu wondered, "Mountain Lord, why don't you pass on your own cultivation techniques to them? You can teach them step by step according to their ability to understand."  This sounded nice, but what he meant was for Miao Yi to teach the two maidservants gradually, like other sects do, which also allowed controlling them.
