Chapter 437: Hitting a Wall  At this moment, as the Blue Silver Golden Light Array was activated, the flames suddenly dimmed, sucked and guided downward. However, the Fire Calabash was clearly not so easy to deal with; it forcefully sucked upwards, snatching away a portion of the flames and then, with a "whoosh," shot to the side, breaking out of the range of the Blue Silver Golden Light Array.  These rapid changes were dizzying.  Tough to deal with, this person!  Must take her down quickly, otherwise the enforcers will arrive.  The Fire Calabash spewed flames downward, and the woman reappeared, her eyes filled with murderous intent, "What are you doing?"  As she spoke, a flash of golden light under her feet, a circle of beautiful patterns quietly emerged, and the woman's body instantly stiffened.  Tang Wulin's Blue Silver Grass wound upwards opportunely, Ye Xinglan's Stargod Sword pointed directly at the opponent's chest, and Xie Xie had already silently reached behind her, with the Light Dragon Dagger poised at her neck.  Everything was a set up!  Is there anything better than Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Chains for dealing with a single opponent?  The absolute establishment of the Starlight Chains was a heaven-defying existence!  Just as everyone breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had taken down the opponent, an unexpected change occurred!  The Stargod Sword had reached her front, and the sharp edge of the Light Dragon Dagger had also reached her neck. Under the threat to her life, the woman's eyes suddenly brightened.  A loud phoenix cry sounded from her body, followed by a burst of soul power from within her body, unparalleled in strength.  As if stimulated, under her clothes, circles of fiery red light shone, resembling rings but appearing to be inside the clothes, located at her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, knees, and other places.  In the next instant, these fiery red lights appeared, and a formidable soul power burst forth from the woman.  Many times stronger than before, the soul power rose and transformed into a huge ring of fire that surged out. The Fire Calabash in the air displayed a layer of fine golden patterns, and the originally one-foot-tall Fire Calabash shot up to two feet, growing several sizes larger.  The powerful fire element fluctuation burst out instantly, the violent impact forcibly sent Tang Wulin and the others flying, and the flames burned their soul power like a bone-chewing maggot.  The phoenix cry became louder and louder, and the woman exuded an authoritative aura. Immediately after, pieces of dark red armor rapidly appeared, covering her entire body.  A phoenix helmet covered her head, and the dark red armor extended to both sides, with an elegant streamline shape that extended downwards and curved, outlining the female form. Her shoulders were wrapped in soft lines, covering her entire arms.  The dark red flame patterns spread across the armor, and on the breastplate, there was a golden-red phoenix design. The armor was not particularly magnificent, but with it on, the woman's presence had risen several levels.  "Battle Armor!" Tang Wulin blurted out, his face filled with a bitter smile.  Yes, this was battle armor! Judging from its complexity and energy fluctuations, it should be one-word battle armor, and the rings that appeared on the woman's body were storage tools for the battle armor.  One-word battle armor could not be integrated into the body of the armor master.  Even so, this was a complete set of one-word battle armor! Meaning, the woman, who originally had a five-ring cultivation, had her strength directly elevated to the level of a seven-ring Soul Saint.  Yan Feng was very angry at this moment. She had been in a particularly good mood today, very happy. She had gone to the Spirit Transmission Pagoda just to register, to officially become a one-word battle armor master.  Battle armor masters were top existences that any organization would be willing to support. Just now, during the contract signing, the Spirit Transmission Pagoda promised her a series of welfare policies. At twenty-seven, she was one of the youngest battle armor masters in Spirit City, with a limitless future.  The Spirit Transmission Pagoda had agreed to assist her with a substantial amount of resources in the future to help her make a breakthrough to a two-word battle armor master. Once she became a two-word battle armor master, that would be a true battle armor master, with a place on the entire continent.  But who would have thought that just as she was happily leaving the Spirit Transmission Pagoda, she was attacked by this group of young kids.  Moreover, their abilities were quite strong. If she hadn't used her battle armor, she might have really been caught off guard.  She had no idea Tang Wulin and the others had no malicious intent. The Stargod Sword and the Light Dragon Dagger made her feel the threat of death.  At that moment, the voice of Wutian sounded in the ears of Tang Wulin and his group of six, "You just need to defeat her, and you will be considered to have passed this city."  Tang Wulin's mouth twitched, Teacher Wutian, you also have a dark side! This is a complete one-word battle armor master, equivalent to the power of a seven-ring Soul Saint level expert, can we really win against her?  Without waiting for more thoughts, Yan Feng had already made her move. Her powerful soul power surged instantly, and with a point of her right hand at Tang Wulin, the Fire Calabash above her head immediately spouted a line of fire that reached Tang Wulin in an instant.  At this point, they could only give it a try; explanations were undoubtedly useless.  From the look in her eyes, it was clear she had been angered.  They were not in the right in this situation! First deal with it.  Tang Wulin took a deep breath, the three purple soul rings on his body suddenly disappeared, and golden light rings emerged. The rings blossomed, his right arm swelled, and golden dragon scales spread. At the same time, dazzling star lines quickly condensed in his right hand, and the battle armor gauntlet appeared.  Facing a true battle armor master, how could he not give it his all?  "Battle Armor?" Yan Feng was also startled when she saw the battle armor on Tang Wulin's right hand.  The words 'impossible' flashed through her mind!  How old was he? Moreover, she clearly saw that Tang Wulin's battle armor emerged directly from his body, could it be that he had two-word battle armor?  Although it was just a piece of armor, having battle armor at such a young age was simply unimaginable. When she first had her piece of armor, she was already twenty-one, and that was considered a prodigy.  She had been practicing hard over the years and finally became a true one-word battle armor master.  But how old were these kids in front of her?  As Tang Wulin activated his power, the others also moved quickly.  Xu Lizhi had already retreated far away, without saying more, one bun after another flew out from his hands, Light and Nimble Steamed Buns, Bloodthirsty Red Bean Buns, one for each person.  Tang Wulin's left hand was behind him, already catching the two buns that came his way, without hesitation, he stuffed them into his mouth.  They had to fight quickly.  Even if it was just one-word battle armor, once the full set was assembled, it also had the ability to help the soul master quickly recover soul power.  If they fought a protracted battle with her, they would not stand a chance.  With a stomp on the ground, a thunderous noise erupted, and Tang Wulin shot forward like an arrow, his right arm shielding his front, the blood in his body boiling and the aura of the Golden Dragon King surging out. His eyes turned completely golden, and the blood energy radiating from his body was fierce.  His right hand, the Golden Dragon Claw, blocked in front of him, bracing against the opponent's flames, pushing forward against them head-on.  As the team leader, and also as a power-type battle soul master, he absolutely could not retreat now. Only by blocking the front could his companions have a chance.  Under the stimulation of the Bloodthirsty Red Bean Bun, his own soul power and blood energy instantly peaked, and his whole body's skin showed faint golden scales, especially on the right hand, right arm, and right chest, where the scales were particularly dazzling.  He had twin martial souls?  Yan Feng was stunned.  "Hmph!" She did not dodge, and the Fire Calabash above her head suddenly started spinning, the original line of fire turned into a large swath of flames that swept over Tang Wulin's head, covering his companions and blocking the others.  She wanted to isolate Tang Wulin and deal with this obviously leading little guy first.  The Golden Dragon Claw reached her in a flash, and Yan Feng's right hand also came up, clenched into a fist, and met it head-on.  Just as the two were about to collide, the dragon roar inside Tang Wulin suddenly intensified, and a huge golden dragon head, over two feet in diameter, appeared without warning, directly swallowing Yan Feng's right arm.  Golden Dragon Shock!  After eating the Red Jade Shrimp that day, although Tang Wulin's blood energy had not broken through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, it had greatly improved, allowing him to control the Golden Dragon Shock more skillfully.  Yan Feng was also startled, only feeling a great force coming head-on, and then, the punch she threw out, the flames were devoured as if by a giant clamp, and the Golden Dragon Claw grasped her right hand.  As the Golden Dragon Claw exerted force, Yan Feng's one-word battle armor lit up, all the flame patterns on it came alive, especially the fire phoenix on her chest, which actually moved and turned into a phoenix flame shadow rushing straight at Tang Wulin's chest.  This is... Chapter 438: Big Sister, I Think This Is a Misunderstanding  At this moment, the calabash on her head was also free to act. With a flash of her soul rings, Yan Feng spat out a golden-red fireball that seemed almost solid, shooting straight towards Tang Wulin's chest. This was battle armor! Defensive and offensive integrated battle armor!  Tang Wulin could clearly feel his own Golden Dragon Claw's powerful strength and characteristics being dispersed and neutralized in every corner of the opponent's battle armor upon contact, making it impossible to even activate its smashing properties. Then came the opponent's powerful counterattack.  No matter how strong Tang Wulin was, with the support of Golden Dragon Terrifying Roar and the gauntlet battle armor, he was at most equivalent to a four-ringed Soul Ancestor. However, his opponent was a genuine one-word battle armor master!  He exerted force in his right arm, trying to fling the opponent away. In terms of strength, Tang Wulin was quite confident in himself. At the same time, a Blue Silver Grass emerged from under him, pushing against the ground to abruptly change his direction, attempting to dodge the phoenix and the fireball. But both attacks were actually able to change direction, following his movements and continuing to pursue him.  Just then, an ice spear silently arrived, striking right on the fire phoenix, which exploded instantly. The powerful explosion sent Tang Wulin flying backward.  The difference in soul power was too great! Even with the support of the Bloodthirsty Dou Sha Bao, Tang Wulin felt as if his insides were burning after the blast. Crossing sword silks formed a net, blocking the pursuing golden-red fireball, which exploded again, and Ye Xinglan's muffled groan followed.  In terms of actual combat experience and fighting skills, Tang Wulin and his team were not weaker than Yan Feng, but the problem was the huge gap in soul power levels. With her one-word battle armor, her defense was something Tang Wulin and his team currently found very difficult to break through.  Xie Xie silently appeared behind Yan Feng, his Light Dragon Dagger and Shadow Dragon Dagger striking simultaneously at Yan Feng's shoulders. But the battle armor covering her entire body flashed, and in the next instant, a fiery red light burst forth, repelling him.  Unable to break through the defense, how could they continue to fight? Yan Feng quickly took control of the situation.  At that moment, a sense of threat suddenly came over her. Without any warning, an additional dazzling light sphere appeared in her field of vision, presenting four colors: blue, red, yellow, and green. The four-colored halo flowed around the fist-sized light sphere, which was rapidly approaching her.  Yan Feng did not dare to be negligent. Her fourth soul ring lit up, and the calabash on her head suddenly swelled a bit before a series of golden-red fireballs were ejected. These fireballs, like a barrage of cannonballs, immediately blocked the path of the four-colored light sphere.  A violent roaring sound ensued, and for a moment, the air was filled with an intense elemental storm.  Tang Wulin had already landed, running his Xuan Tian Gong to calm the burning sensation within his body. His physique was robust, and he was not injured. But this battle, it really couldn't continue! Now it was all up to Gu Yue.  It turned out that the defensive power of the one-word battle armor could truly withstand the test. The elemental storm raged for a good five or six seconds before gradually subsiding, and Yan Feng still stood there, unmoved. The golden-red flame light flowed on her battle armor, not dimming in the slightest, and the calabash above her head was once again aimed at Tang Wulin.  "Big Sister, I think, I think this is a misunderstanding," Tang Wulin said with a wry smile.  At that moment, a piercing alarm sounded, and not far away, three figures were rapidly approaching. They were three mechas, but unlike the purple-ranked mechas in Tian Dou City, these three were all yellow and did not have any purple-ranked mechas.  "Cease fire!" A synthesized voice shouted.  Yan Feng, who was about to make a move, had to stop, the mouth of the calabash pointing upwards as she let out a cold snort and glared angrily at Tang Wulin.  Then she suddenly realized with surprise that the boy who had previously taken the initiative to attack her now had a face full of sorrow and anger.  The three mechas descended from the sky, their huge ten-meter-tall bodies instantly separating the two parties.  "Wow!" Cries suddenly rang out as Xu Xiaoyan, holding onto Ye Xinglan beside her, began to cry loudly.  Xie Xie lowered his head, filled with a sense of loss, while Ye Xinglan looked a bit dazed. Xu Lizhi crouched on the ground, Gu Yue was expressionless, but a hint of a smile flashed in her eyes.  Tang Wulin stood tall, pulling Gu Yue behind him, his face showing even more intense sorrow and anger.  "Enforcer, you've arrived just in time; please save us. If you had come a moment later, we would have been burned to death by her."  "What?" Yan Feng was still not able to react for a moment. It was clear that they were the ones who had attacked first!  The voice from inside the mecha said, "What exactly happened here? Why did you attack these young people, one-word battle armor master?"  Yan Feng, who had only recently registered as a one-word battle armor master at the Spirit Pagoda, was not recognized by the enforcers. However, there was a clear sense of vigilance when they mentioned the words "one-word battle armor master."  Although they had three mechas, just yellow-ranked mechas plus their cultivation, they were definitely not a match for a one-word battle armor master.  "Don't listen to them blaming others first; they were clearly the ones who attacked me first," Yan Feng said angrily.  Tang Wulin blinked his beautiful big eyes, looking terrified as he said: "You, what are you saying? We attacked you? You're a one-word battle armor master! We're just a few small soul masters. Uncle Enforcer, I'm fourteen years old this year, and my youngest companion is only thirteen. Do you think we would dare to take on a one-word battle armor master?"  Yan Feng was almost driven mad with anger, her body trembling slightly as she said: "You're slandering me! Clearly, you were the one who attacked me first. At that time, you didn't even know I was a one-word battle armor master. We don't even know each other."  Without any hesitation, Tang Wulin said: "We don't know each other; why would we attack you? I clearly heard you say you had just become a one-word battle armor master and wanted to find someone to test your skills. Then when you saw us, you suddenly slapped me, and we had to defend ourselves. My teacher taught us that the greater the power, the greater the responsibility, but as a one-word battle armor master, you bully us children instead. How can you have the audacity to reverse right and wrong?"  Xu Xiaoyan cried even louder, nearly hanging on Ye Xinglan. Ye Xinglan turned her head away.  Xie Xie sighed deeply. After spending a long time with Tang Wulin, his acting skills had also improved significantly.  With both parties sticking to their own story, the enforcers were also a bit stunned, but without a doubt, all three of them subconsciously leaned towards Tang Wulin and his team. This was the advantage of being young; no matter how you looked at it, they didn't seem like they would provoke a one-word battle armor master.  "You all come back with us to the Spirit Pagoda to retrieve the surveillance footage and then determine who is right and wrong," the lead enforcer said in a deep voice.  "Okay!"  Tang Wulin agreed without hesitation.  Grinding her teeth, Yan Feng said: "You little scoundrel, when the evidence is laid out in front of us, I want to see how you can still confuse right and wrong."  She was really furious!  The three mechas turned around, forming a triangular formation to enclose Yan Feng in the middle. "Let's go. Please retract your battle armor."  This was clearly to guard against her suddenly fleeing!  Yan Feng was furious and shouted: "Are you blind? Can't even distinguish right from wrong? What if I don't retract it?"  The lights on the three mechas flashed simultaneously, and three soul-guided cannons were already aimed at her.  "Uncle Enforcer, you see, she is so arrogant and domineering," Tang Wulin said as he stepped back, as if afraid of being affected by any aftermath.  Yan Feng couldn't take it anymore and roared, "I'll burn you to death!" With a shake of her body, she lunged towards Tang Wulin's direction. The three mechas weren't for show, as the three soul-guided cannons fired without hesitation, and three bursts of soul-guided cannonballs exploded forth. Chapter 439: So Handsome That It Makes One's Heart Race  These enforcement officers of the Spirit Transmission Tower were well-trained. Faced with a strong opponent, they employed the most secure method. The three cannonballs were not fired at Yan Feng, but instead blasted into the air. When the three cannonballs collided with each other, they immediately unleashed a fierce energy storm.  Although Yan Feng was wearing her battle armor, she was still thrown off balance by the intense energy impact. The three mechas quickly surged forth, simultaneously taking to the air, and their soul-guided cannons fired relentlessly at her without regard for energy consumption.  Faced with a one-word battle armor master, how could they dare to hold back! Moreover, the leading enforcement officer had already called for reinforcements; they just needed to hold on for a while.  Only now did Tang Wulin and the others realize the strength of these enforcers. Back when they were in Sky Dou City, if they hadn't led the enforcers away from the start, preventing them from coordinating with each other, things would have been really difficult.   The three mechas worked together seamlessly, and the soul-guided cannons erupted wildly, forming a crossfire that covered the area without gaps.  Even though Yan Feng was very strong, her main combat power was still in her martial soul, the Fire Gourd, and her one-word battle armor had just been completed. The coordination between her martial soul and battle armor was not yet perfect, and she was actually suppressed for a moment.  Tang Wulin wouldn't let go of such a good opportunity. He took his companions and turned to run, shouting, "Everyone be careful not to get hit. Let's move further away. Enforcement Uncle, good luck!"  Xie Xie was the fastest, shooting up like a wisp of green smoke and jumping directly onto the soul-guided automobile parked not far away. The others hurriedly got into the car, and even Xu Lizhi became agile at this moment.  Stepping the accelerator to the floor, the soul-guided car emitted a piercing roar and instantly sped off.  At this time, the three enforcers' attention was all on Yan Feng. The sound of the soul-guided cannons was much louder than the car starting up, and they had no idea that Tang Wulin and the six of them had already run away. Yan Feng, too, was surrounded by energy light and didn't notice either.  Without Tang Wulin needing to say anything, Xie Xie was already weaving through the streets, speeding up the car.   "We've hit a snag; our luck is too bad. Aren't battle armor masters supposed to be extremely rare? How did we pick one that's a battle armor master?" Xu Xiaoyan's face was devoid of tears.  Tang Wulin gave a wry smile and said, "It looks like we need to change our approach. This method is too uncertain, and it also offends people. Not a good idea at all! If we continue like this, I'm afraid we'll be listed as the most unwelcome people by the Spirit Transmission Tower."  Gu Yue said, "That won't happen, not with me here."  Xie Xie exclaimed, "Boss, you're getting more and more impressive. That acting skill! Incredible."  Tang Wulin said irritably, "You think I wanted to do that? With the strength of that battle armor master, a few mechas definitely couldn't deal with her. If we hadn't said that at the time, once we were caught in the Spirit Transmission Tower, even if we could find a way to escape later, it would definitely delay a lot of time. We'll find a way to apologize to them later."  At the Spirit Transmission Tower.  "Slap!" Yan Feng slapped her hand on the metal table in front of her, sparks flying, "Now you all understand, right? Those little rascals are just swindlers, was it they who attacked me first?"  Looking at the surveillance screen displaying the footage, the enforcers were speechless.  Yan Feng had just managed to break out from the encirclement of the three mechas and discovered that Tang Wulin and his group had disappeared. In her anger, she wanted to chase after them, but at that moment, the enforcers' reinforcements had arrived, and three purple mechas surrounded her.  Even though a one-word battle armor master is strong, faced with six mechas, Yan Feng also had no solution. She could break through, but if she did so, today's incident would be confirmed! Therefore, she chose to surrender and was brought back to watch the video.  "Sorry, Miss Yan Feng, we have also investigated your identity. We are really sorry for before, we didn't expect these children to be so cunning at such a young age."  Yan Feng angrily said, "What are you waiting for now? Why aren't you quickly going to capture them and bring them back?"  The leading middle-aged enforcer had some difficulty saying, "I'm afraid that's not possible. Although our Spirit Transmission Tower has an exalted status, after all, it is not a federal enforcement institution. If we were to send a large number of people to search for them, it would be easy to touch the bottom line of the federal government. That would be very unfavorable for us. We have already reported the situation to the government side, and they can only pursue it. Moreover, to be honest, we have limited evidence for this matter, and most importantly, you have not suffered any injuries. Even if we catch them, we can't punish them much; at most, it would be considered provoking trouble, and they would be detained for a few days by the law enforcement authorities."  Yan Feng had calmed down a bit by now. Yes! She had not been injured, so it was really hard to convict them. They said they were thirteen or fourteen years old, which is true. Under eighteen, they would be protected by the Juvenile Protection Law, and it would be difficult to even capture them, and in the end, it would just be calling the parents to pay a fine and take them back for strict discipline.  Those little rascals, too hateful!  "Miss Yan Feng, please calm down. We apologize first for this matter."  The enforcers stood up and bowed slightly to her.  Yan Feng, seeing them like this, had most of her anger dissipate and waved her hand, saying, "Forget it. Just don't let me run into them again. If there's nothing else, I'm leaving."  The enforcers escorted her out of the Spirit Transmission Tower respectfully. As a battle armor master who had joined the Spirit Transmission Tower, the enforcers still respected her very much. Who knows, maybe one day she would become their superior!  After leaving the Spirit Transmission Tower, Yan Feng looked around, trying to find Tang Wulin and his group, but there was no trace of them. At that moment, her gaze suddenly stopped, falling in one direction. It was on a man who appeared to be about her age, with a tall figure dressed in white. His clothing was somewhat retro, with a white robe and long hair draped behind his head.  He exuded a cool and detached aura.  Yan Feng's martial soul was of the fire attribute, and her temper was also related to this aspect. When she saw the man, she suddenly found that the anger in her heart unexplainably subsided.  He was so handsome!  She instinctively swallowed and no girl disliked handsome guys, especially those with good stature and appearance.  Moreover, just at a glance, Yan Feng was surprised to find that she couldn't see through this person's cultivation level. But she could be certain that he was definitely a soul master.  A soul master stronger than me? It seems to be of the ice attribute.  As a fire attribute soul master, she had the clearest perception of ice attributes.  He's walking towards me?  Yan Feng's heartbeat began to quicken.  Initially, she was a bit unsure, but soon she realized that the man was walking directly toward her, not quickly, but very steadily. His gaze also followed her.  What clear eyes! So handsome!  From the man's eyes, Yan Feng quickly saw her own reflection, but she suddenly noticed that her image did not seem too good. Earlier, in the fight, her clothes and hair had become somewhat disheveled.  She hurriedly tried to tidy herself up, and although she felt that she was doing it as inconspicuously as possible, she still felt a bit of heat on her face.  "Hello," said the cool voice.  Yan Feng's heart skipped a beat, even the voice was so pleasant to hear, though a bit cold, but piercing to the heart!  "You, hello!" Yan Feng looked at the handsome guy close at hand, and her voice trembled a bit.  "My name is Wu Zhangkong."  The man in white nodded to her.  "Oh, my name is Yan Feng."  She instinctively gave her own name.  "I'm really sorry. Those children today, they are my disciples. They are undergoing a test, which is an end-of-term exam at the academy. So they were looking for people to spar with everywhere, without any malice. I apologize to you on their behalf."  Wu Zhangkong bowed slightly to her as a gesture.  "Oh, oh, it's okay," Yan Feng's heartbeat quickened, but the next moment, her heartbeat suddenly stopped for a second, and her pupils dilated as her voice went up by an octave, "What did you say? Those few, those... are your disciples?"  "Yes," said Wu Zhangkong.  Yan Feng's breathing became hurried, "And you taught them to attack me out of the blue?"  Wu Zhangkong was still just as cool, "Although that's not the case, I am their teacher, and it's not unreasonable for you to place the blame on me."  "You..." Yan Feng suddenly found that she was somewhat unable to say angry words.  Wu Zhangkong nodded to her again, "I apologize once again, goodbye."  With that, he turned and walked away.  "Hey!" Yan Feng called out.  Wu Zhangkong stopped and turned back, "Is there something else?"  Yan Feng said, "So you're just going to end it with an apology?"  Wu Zhangkong replied, "What else would you like?" Chapter 440: Invite Me To Dinner  Yan Feng said, "If you want to apologize sincerely, you should at least invite me to a meal, right?" When she uttered these words, she felt embarrassed for herself.  However, she was already in her twenties this year, and she had been working hard on her cultivation without having had a boyfriend. She had always thought that love at first sight was something that only happened in novels, but today she found herself embarrassingly discovering that, even though it was their first meeting, she had fallen for this cold-looking guy. He was so handsome! Never mind the rest, being handsome was enough!  "Okay," Wu Zhangkong nodded. "What do you want to eat?"  "You decide," Yan Feng said cheerfully.  A thoughtful look flashed in Wu Zhangkong's eyes, and after a moment, he said, "Come with me." He then turned and walked down the steps.  His figure was also so handsome—super handsome! Yan Feng secretly patted her chest, her pretty face turning slightly red as she quickly followed him.  Suddenly, she felt that those few little guys weren't so annoying anymore. After all, they had such a handsome teacher.  She forgave them!  This was fate!  Wu Zhangkong walked unhurriedly, with Yan Feng silently following behind him. She didn't speak to him anymore because she found that just by walking after him and watching him, it was like she was appreciating a beautiful scene.  His figure became clearer and clearer in her heart.  He indeed attracted attention, as almost every passing female, regardless of age, would subconsciously glance at him.  As a five-ringed Soul King, Yan Feng had excellent hearing, and she heard countless lovestruck voices exclaiming, "He's so handsome!" Of course, the number of times she had said it in her heart was the most.  Because she had been following him and watching him all the time!  Turning into an alley, Wu Zhangkong stopped in front of a small restaurant with a front that was less than four meters wide. Through the window, one could see inside—it had only four tables. It was nearing noon now, and the fragrance of stir-fried dishes wafted out.  Wu Zhangkong just stood there in front of the small restaurant, standing quietly, his gaze contemplative and somewhat lost. From the side, Yan Feng could clearly see that his cold eyes seemed to soften a bit.  "Ah, Zhangkong, you're here! Come on in." A man who appeared to be in his fifties, with short hair and a plump figure, came out.  He obviously recognized Wu Zhangkong and was very familiar with him. He hugged Wu Zhangkong's shoulders and ushered him inside.  If Tang Wulin and the others saw this scene, they would be so surprised that their jaws would drop. Wu Zhangkong, a man with a strong sense of cleanliness, did not get angry at all from the man's touch but instead nodded to him warmly and walked in.  Yan Feng followed him into the small restaurant.  The restaurant was really small, and the sanitary conditions were just so-so. It was a typical fly restaurant.  If it were any other man who brought her to this place, she would give him zero points in an instant. This was too stingy.  But since it was Wu Zhangkong who brought her here, her evaluation was that it was characteristic! A handsome guy is just different.  Yes, the world is just so unfair!  "Zhangkong, it's been a long time since I've seen you. How have you been?" The fat owner led him to a table by the bed.  Wu Zhangkong sat down on the inside as if he knew the place well, "I'm fine."  "This is your friend?" The fat owner finally noticed Yan Feng.  Yan Feng could not be considered beautiful, but she had a certain charm and was at the prime age of a woman, full of vitality.  "Hello," Yan Feng smiled at the fat owner and sat down across from Wu Zhangkong.  The fat owner opened his mouth, clearly a bit surprised.  "The usual," Wu Zhangkong nodded to him.  The fat owner reacted, smiled, and said, "Okay, the usual. I'll get it ready for you. That's great, Zhangkong, that's so good of you." As he spoke, he immediately rushed to the back to get busy.  With the fat owner gone, the warmth on Wu Zhangkong's face returned to coldness, and Yan Feng sat across from him. Now she could seriously look at him from the front.  His eyelashes were really long! And his eyes were so beautiful. His nose was straight, and his lips were just the right thickness.  What would it feel like if he kissed me... Ah, what am I thinking!  For no reason, Yan Feng's face turned red again.  "Do you come here often?" Yan Feng asked.  Wu Zhangkong's cold eyes seemed to focus for the first time, glancing at her, "I used to come often."  Yan Feng said, "No wonder the owner knows you."  "Mm."  Yan Feng asked, "Do you usually stay in Tianling City?"  Wu Zhangkong shook his head.  Yan Feng asked, "Then where are you?"  "Shrek," Wu Zhangkong replied.  Yan Feng asked, "How old are you this year?"  Wu Zhangkong paused for a moment and shook his head, not saying anything.  Yan Feng said, "Then let me guess, is it okay? Twenty-seven?"  Wu Zhangkong didn't make a sound.  "That's not right! Then twenty-six? It can't be twenty-eight, right?"  Wu Zhangkong's brow furrowed slightly, "Thirty-three."  "Thirty-three?" Yan Feng looked at him in surprise, "Then you really don't look it, your skin is so well-maintained. If it weren't for your mature aura, I would have thought you were just over twenty. I'm about to be twenty-seven, so you're over six years older than me."  "Mm."  Yan Feng said, "Are you always so concise when you talk?"  "Mm."  Yan Feng asked, "What's with those disciples of yours? What kind of assessment are they taking?"  Wu Zhangkong replied, "End-of-term exams."  Yan Feng snorted, "That leader kid is really not a good thing. He attacked me and then played the victim, acting so convincingly. Did you teach him that?"  Wu Zhangkong said somewhat helplessly, "That wasn't me."  Yan Feng asked, "Then who taught him?"  Wu Zhangkong's mouth twitched slightly, and Yan Feng's heart stirred, seeing Wu Zhangkong's more normal expression for the first time.  "He has a unique talent," Wu Zhangkong said helplessly.  Yan Feng said, "You should be careful when choosing disciples. It's like a young tree; as a teacher, you must ensure it grows straight and doesn't take a wrong path."  Wu Zhangkong replied, "He won't. He has a good nature."  Yan Feng pursed her lips, "I don't think so. Let's not talk about him. Let's talk about you. Are you a teacher at an academy? Which one?"  At this moment, the fat owner came up again, the dishes were ready.  Several small dishes, each with a generous portion. They were caramelized greens, fish-flavored shredded pork, Kung Pao chicken, and a pot of tofu soup.  Three dishes and one soup, with two bowls of rice.  Yan Feng was actually a bit hungry because she was so excited that she hadn't eaten breakfast.  Despite the small size of the restaurant, the dishes were full of color, aroma, and taste, making one's mouth water.  "Go ahead, don't be shy."  She picked up her bowl and started eating, adding a chopstick of fish-flavored shredded pork to her mouth, and soon her eyes widened.  "It's so delicious. I really didn't expect such a small restaurant to make such tasty food, much better than many big hotels. Really good."  Wu Zhangkong also picked up his bowl, but he ate much slower, his gaze drifting over the four dishes as if he was savoring something or feeling something.  Picking up a piece of caramelized greens, he tasted it as if reflecting on something.  While eating, Yan Feng asked, "You still haven't answered, which academy are you from?"  "Shrek," Wu Zhangkong replied indifferently.  "Shrek Academy? Ah! Shrek Academy?" Yan Feng almost dropped her bowl.  She widened her eyes at Wu Zhangkong, her voice rising a few notches, "You, you're a teacher at Shrek Academy?"  "What's wrong?" Wu Zhangkong glanced at her.  Yan Feng's expression changed slightly, "Nothing, nothing." But in her heart, she exclaimed, "Perfect!" Chapter 441: Yan Feng and Heavenly Ice  "How handsome, and he's a teacher at Shrek Academy, that's simply impeccable perfection! I really yearn for Shrek Academy! I tried to get in once but failed. It's such a pity, otherwise, I might have been able to learn from you," said Wu Zhangkong indifferently, "You wouldn't have been able to. When you were in school, I was still a student. You couldn't have been my student by age."  Yan Feng was frustrated, "Do you even know how to chat? Is this how you talk to girls?"  Wu Zhangkong remained silent, quietly eating his meal.  Yan Feng pouted, this guy!  Not long after, she couldn't help but speak again, "Since you're a teacher at Shrek Academy, you must be a Battle Armor Master, right? One-word or two-word?"  Wu Zhangkong replied, "Two-word."  Yan Feng's eyes widened in amazement, a thirty-three-year-old two-word Battle Armor Master, that's incredible! No wonder she couldn't see through his cultivation.  "I've just become a one-word Battle Armor Master and named my battle armor 'Feng.' A one-word Battle Armor Master can only use one word to name their armor. What about you? How did you name your two-word battle armor? It's frustrating to say, my martial soul is the Fire Gourd. Usually, people name their armor after their martial soul or their spirit. How should I name mine? I can't just call it Gourd, so I used my own name. What are your two words?"  Wu Zhangkong said, "Heavenly Ice."  Yan Feng commented, "That sounds nice. Why did you name it that? Your martial soul is ice attribute, right? That's why you named it so."  Wu Zhangkong looked up at her, "Heaven is part of my martial soul's name, and Ice is my wife's name. We shouldn't talk while eating, let's eat."  His wife's name? His wife's name! Yan Feng was stunned. She should have thought of this earlier; with his qualities, how could he not have a woman?  A huge sense of loss made her appetite vanish.  For the rest of the meal, they ate in silence, with Wu Zhangkong not eating much. His mind was in a completely different world.  ...  "Wow, Zhangkong, I love the candied yellow vegetables from this place. It's hard to imagine that eggs can be made so delicious. I'll learn how to make it well and cook it for you at home, okay?"  "Hey, save some tofu for me! I heard eating tofu is good for the skin. Although my skin is a bit better than yours, I still need to work hard."  "The fish-flavored shredded pork is really appetizing, can I have another half bowl of rice? Do you think I'll get fat?"  "Look at you, so clumsy, you've got rice on your face. Ugh, I'm not going to kiss it off for you, hey, don't rub against me!"  ...  After leaving the small restaurant, it was midday.  Yan Feng smiled at Wu Zhangkong, "Thank you for the lunch."  Wu Zhangkong shook his head, "I'm leaving."  "Can I have your soul communicator number? I'm going to the Spirit Pagoda later to have them cancel the report they filed at the government office for your disciples today. I'll let you know once it's done."  Wu Zhangkong hesitated for a moment but eventually recited a string of numbers.  "Can I look for you at Shrek Academy to have a meal together?" Yan Feng asked with a smile.  Wu Zhangkong glanced at her, "I'm leaving, goodbye." After saying that, he turned and left.  Yan Feng watched his retreating figure disappear before she withdrew her gaze and sighed, "All the good men are already taken. When will I find a good man like that? It seems Tianling City is too secluded, I should also go to Shrek City, now that I'm a one-word Battle Armor Master. There should be opportunities for me to seek development there. I'll have the Spirit Pagoda transfer me."  The soul-guided car sped on the highway, heading straight for the next city.  Their mission in Tianling City was considered a failure; they had to change their route and pass through another city.  After much deliberation, they couldn't think of a faster way than to attract soul masters to act and then trouble the enforcers at the Spirit Pagoda.  So, they had to take the old path.  Luck wouldn't always be bad; it fluctuates. In the following cities, they did not encounter any more difficulties and completed the exam tasks quite smoothly.  They had successfully impersonated inspectors and had passed through several cities. Soon, they had completed over half of their tasks.  "It's the fourth day. We need to speed up. Let's complete two more today, another two tomorrow, and then we'll reach Ming City the day after tomorrow. In Ming City, we don't even need to find the Spirit Pagoda to easily locate powerful soul masters. After all, it's the headquarters of the Federation. When we get there, we need to be more discreet," Tang Wulin said as he looked at the map and spoke to his companions.  As they journeyed, they went from initial tension to relaxation. Indeed, reading thousands of books and traveling thousands of miles was meaningful. During the process of completing the exam tasks, they encountered troubles but managed to solve them all. The most troublesome was the encounter with Yan Feng. However, that battle allowed them to fully realize how powerful a Battle Armor Master could be.  As students of Shrek Academy, even in a six-on-one situation, they had a chance of victory against a five-ring Soul King, let alone a six-ring Soul Emperor. But facing a beginning armor master was completely out of their league, as they couldn't even break through the defense.  "Wulin, I know a place in Ming City that's suitable for us to complete our final exam," Ye Xinglan suddenly said.  "Oh? What place?" Tang Wulin asked curiously.  Ye Xinglan said, "Ming City used to have an academy that was a significant competitor of our Shrek Academy ten thousand years ago. To this day, they are still one of the top academies on the continent, although they can't compare to our Shrek anymore. But in the Federation, they are still a leading academy. Why don't we go there and challenge them?"  Hearing her suggestion, Gu Yue immediately reacted, "You're talking about the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, right? That's also an academy with over ten thousand years of heritage."  "Yes," Ye Xinglan's eyes shone with excitement, "I've long heard about the grudges between there and our academy. I think, if we can complete the last battle of our final exam there, it would be the most valuable."  Tang Wulin's eyes lit up, "That makes sense, I think we can do it."  "That's settled then," Ye Xinglan clenched her fists firmly.  "Stop talking about that, let's deal with the problem in front of us first," Xie Xie's somewhat unstable voice rang out.  Everyone looked through the windshield forward, and they were stunned.  In the distance, over twenty mechas were lined up in a row, including five purple mechas and fifteen yellow mechas, blocking the highway.  There were no soul-guided cars stopped on the road, apparently, they had just landed.  The emblems on the chests of these mechas indicated that they were from the Spirit Pagoda.  After completing five exams, they had finally been tracked down by the Spirit Pagoda.  "Wulin, what do we do?" Xie Xie stepped on the brakes to slow down, urgently asking Tang Wulin.  Tang Wulin's eyes narrowed slightly, and those familiar with him knew that this was a sign he was about to explode.  "Stop the car!" Tang Wulin shouted, his left elbow striking out forcefully, and with a "bang," the entire car door flew off.  He grabbed the roof of the car and flipped out.  His actions told his companions what to do; he would never surrender without a fight.  Even if they were caught, it wouldn't be a big problem—just paying a fine and apologizing. But they might also be sent back to Shrek Academy, which would be a huge embarrassment. And then, it would be difficult to complete the final exam.  In the history of Shrek Academy, there had never been a case where a class leader was eliminated. Tang Wulin did not want to be the first, nor did he want his companions to be disqualified with him.  Xie Xie stomped on the brake and turned the steering wheel sharply. The soul-guided car immediately crashed towards the guardrail.  All of them were formidable soul masters, and even Xu Lizhi had Tang Sect's protective techniques. When the car crashed into the guardrail, they had already scattered and escaped.  Gu Yue held onto Xu Xiaoyan and shouted, "Blizzard."  Xu Xiaoyan's martial soul was activated as they rushed out of the car, and her third soul ring lit up instantly. Supported by Gu Yue's Elemental Tide, the blizzard quickly spread out from her body.  There were forests and fields on both sides of the highway.  Tang Wulin shouted, "Into the woods, quick!" He shouted to his companions, but he himself did not move.  The soul-guided mechas had already taken off when they saw them change direction, with soul-guided cannons aimed at their direction, rapidly approaching. Chapter 442: The Almighty Gu Yue  Mech armor flight, though it has an acceleration process, is extremely rapid and cannot be compared to their current speed. Only by threading through the forest would there be a sliver of chance. Moreover, Tang Wulin had another reliance; these mech armors belonged to Spirit Pagoda, not the official authorities. Spirit Pagoda mech armors would not dare to kill recklessly, as the Federation's order could not be disrupted.  Therefore, Tang Wulin determined that these mech armors' purpose was to capture them, not to kill them. With such a judgment, he had some confidence in leading his companions to escape.  As expected, those mech armors flying in the air all withdrew their soul-guided cannons and flew toward them with bare hands. Leading the way were five purple mech armors, zooming towards them like bolts of lightning.  Tang Wulin tapped his toes on the ground, leaping into the air. Golden light flickered as his Golden Dragon Body burst forth, his body expanding and scales emerging. His right arm suddenly swelled, and his battle armor gauntlet appeared.  In an instant, he elevated himself to his strongest combat state. With the sound of dragon roars inside him, Tang Wulin took a deep breath, circled his hands in front of him, placed his left hand on the battle armor on his right forearm, and, with a fierce shout, unleashed a claw strike into the void. His blood qi ran in reverse, Golden Dragon Shocking Heaven, Golden Dragon Fright Claw!  He channeled all his soul power through his hands into his right Golden Dragon Claw, driving his Golden Dragon Fright Claw with the Golden Dragon Shocking Heaven. Before this final exam, he had not dared to do so, as his right Golden Dragon Claw would feel overwhelmed, but with the continuous increase in blood qi after coming out this time, although he had not broken through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, his body's tolerance had clearly become much stronger.  Five splendid claw shadows swept out in the air, cold and sharp. The edges emitted a dark golden luster, while the back of the blades was brilliant gold, faintly showing dragon scale patterns.  At the moment of being unleashed, these claw shadows were only five feet long, but they swelled rapidly in the wind. In a blink of an eye, they turned into several tens of meters in size. Although they became more illusory as they grew larger, they managed to block the way of the five purple mech armors.  The five purple mech armors were also startled by this scene. A soul master's attack range was proportional to their strength. They naturally took Tang Wulin's golden light aura for soul rings, but since when were there golden soul rings? Moreover, with such a large control range of the claw shadow, their first reaction was to activate their protective shields to the maximum and defend with all their might.  "Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom—" Five thunderous booms exploded in the air, and the five mech armors were blasted flying backward. The mech armor that bore the brunt of the core power of the Golden Dragon Fright Claw had its protective shield filled with cracks and was almost shattered.  From a distance, this scene was absolutely shocking. Facing twenty mech armors, that small figure soared into the sky, and with one claw strike, five purple mech armors were swept away. What a domineering presence!  Although the fifteen yellow mech armors closely followed, seeing the five purple mech armors blasted away by Tang Wulin, they hesitated and didn't dare to charge directly. The power that could blast away purple mech armors could very likely tear apart their own mech armors!  Tang Wulin landed with a thud, touched the ground with his toes, and flew backward, vanishing into the blizzard that had already formed behind him.  A soft little hand swiftly grasped his, and they sprinted away. The blizzard unleashed jointly by Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan was beyond an ordinary thousand-year soul ring ability, especially when only aiming to block the line of sight and detection without considering the attack power. In just a short while, it had already covered hundreds of square meters, with the blizzard raging in the air. A tornado whirled out, carrying snowflakes and greatly obstructing the mech pilots' vision.  Tang Wulin's strike not only blocked their pursuit but also had a considerable deterrent effect. Those purple-ranked mech pilots had no confidence they could come out unscathed in a one-on-one situation.  Therefore, they didn't dare to scatter to search but had to gather together, using the radar attached to the mech armors to search. However, the method to counter mech radar was something Shrek Academy had taught very early on. The energy fluctuations in the blizzard were chaotic, making it almost impossible for the radar to function effectively.  Tang Wulin was pulled forward as they ran. Suddenly, he felt empty space beneath his feet, and his body sank downwards. While he was shocked, he found his footing again, then realized it had gone dark before his eyes. The light had suddenly disappeared.  Then, a ball of golden light lit up, and he could see the situation clearly. It was a small space, surrounded by dirt, and all his companions were here, with Gu Yue being the one who had pulled his hand. The golden light was coming from her hand.  She let go of Tang Wulin's hand, didn't speak, and the light in her eyes shone. Elemental Tide and Elemental Control, two big soul skills, were released at the same time. Suddenly, Tang Wulin felt the ground beneath him slowly sinking, and even more incredibly, the dirt above closed by itself, as if it was continuously swallowing them up.  The other companions looked at Gu Yue with awe, even the haughty Ye Xinglan had brilliance in her beautiful eyes at this moment. The control of earth elements at this moment was simply a divine skill! The earth elements below were undoubtedly the richest, and Gu Yue, with her cultivation, controlled the dirt, plunging them deeper down. The dirt could block most scans, and the further away from the surface, the less likely they were to be detected.  They were naturally safe as well. They say there is no road in the sky and no door to the earth, but Gu Yue had opened this door for them. Those mech pilots from Spirit Pagoda could never dream that they could escape underground, and there was no way to pursue them unless they used soul-guided cannons to bombard the area immediately, but these mech pilots belonged to Spirit Pagoda, and Tang Wulin and his companions hadn't committed any grave crimes, at most they were only causing trouble, so how could they mobilize such a large operation!  After a good ten minutes, Gu Yue, with sweat on her forehead, stopped controlling the earth elements. "Everyone, control your breathing. The air underground is thin," Tang Wulin said to his companions. They couldn't escape the pursuit only to suffocate underground.  "No problem," Gu Yue said. She flicked her left hand, and a ball of water floated in mid-air. She gently rubbed her right hand on the water ball, and it gradually shrank, making the air in this underground space much more comfortable.  "The teacher taught me a method to separate water elements, which can create the oxygen we need. There won't be a problem for a short time."  "Gu Yue, you're simply all-capable!" Xu Xiaoyan exclaimed in admiration.  Gu Yue smiled slightly, "Let's not talk about this, they probably can't find us now. We'll go out later. But what do we do next? Spirit Pagoda is searching for us, and all the cities with Spirit Pagoda branches must have received the message and will be on high alert. Our previous method won't work. We need to change."  Tang Wulin's eyes narrowed slightly, "The cities we're going to next are all big cities. Big cities will certainly have soul master academies. There won't be a lack of soul masters with higher cultivation than us. We can do this..."  His train of thought was still the one that had surfaced because of the proposal of the Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. Since the Spirit Pagoda's route was no longer viable, they would do it this way.  An entire hour later, Gu Yue finally controlled the dirt to push them back to the surface. Sure enough, the mech armors had disappeared without a trace.  However, to their frustration, the car was also smashed and couldn't be driven.  Tang Wulin had already checked the map before. From where they were to the next city was less than two hundred kilometers. With no other options, there was only one option: run!  With Gu Yue's wind element control and Xu Lizhi's Lightening Small Bun, Tang Wulin carried a bit of Xu Lizhi, and Ye Xinglan helped Xu Xiaoyan. The six of them could only rely on their legs, following a small road near the highway towards the next city. Chapter 443: Crashing the Party!  Two hundred kilometers was nothing for someone with a strong body like Tang Wulin, but Xu Lizhi suffered quite a bit. Even with the support of his recovery big meat buns and agile xiao long bao, after two hundred kilometers, he felt like he had lost a circle of weight.  "Spirit Pagoda!" Xu Lizhi swung his fists viciously.  "What do you want to do?" Gu Yue asked softly.  Xu Lizhi glanced at her, "I will never sell buns to them again!"  Ye Xinglan said disdainfully, "Look at your ambition."  Tang Wulin pondered, "The original plan for today was to run to two cities, but now it seems we can only cover one city. Let's rest for a while, and this afternoon we will go find the academy."  They stayed at a small hotel, and being soul masters, they recovered quickly. Tang Wulin also took the opportunity to inquire about the location of the soul master academy.  The city they were currently in was called Tianding City, which was about two thousand kilometers away from Mingdu, and they would pass through several other cities in between. Without a car and no money to buy one, they decided to continue on the soul-guided train heading west after completing their mission.  Tianding City indeed had a soul master academy, which Tang Wulin found out after some inquiries was quite famous and called Tianding Starry Sky Academy.  This was a special soul master academy that only recruited soul masters with flying-type martial souls.  It also had an advanced academy that trained high-level soul masters, mecha masters, and battle armor masters.  As for training battle armor masters, everyone agreed there was no need to take it too seriously.  The average graduation age for the advanced academy was between twenty-two to twenty-five years old. Even in Shrek Academy, students who could complete one-word battle armor at this age were few and far between, let alone other academies.  "That's the one!" Tang Wulin decided. While the others were resting, he was not tired and rented a soul-guided communication device at the hotel, dialing a number.  "Master uncle," Tang Wulin greeted respectfully.  "Wulin, how is the final exam going? Is everything smooth?" Zhentai's gentle voice came through.  Tang Wulin replied, "Not very smooth, there's a little trouble. It's like this, I need to earn some more money to continue with the later exams. I am in Tianding City now, and because I don't have a blacksmith badge, I can't take on forging tasks. Could you please speak to the local blacksmith association on my behalf, so I can take on a fusion forging or spirit forging task, and also borrow a pair of forging hammers? After completing the task, I will directly exchange it for some travel expenses."  Zhenhai was somewhat speechless, "You really have it tough. Just go over there, you don't need to forge anything, your forging level combined with your age, could cause some unnecessary trouble. I will ask Tianding Blacksmith Association to give you some money to spend."  "Then thank you, master uncle." Tang Wulin secretly gave a thumbs up – having such a master uncle was indeed great!  Zhenhai chuckled, "No need to thank me, we're family. Whenever you have time, come over to the headquarters to play."  "Definitely," Tang Wulin said without hesitation, not to mention the help that the godly blacksmith's guidance would bring to his future forging, but the delicious food at master uncle’s place was irresistible!  After a trip to the Blacksmith Association, by the time his partners were rested in the afternoon, Tang Wulin had already returned from the Blacksmith Association, bringing back one million federal coins.  "Let's buy another car," Xie Xie suggested.  "What does everyone think?" Tang Wulin looked to his companions.  Ye Xinglan said, "Having a car is indeed more convenient. Although it's not as fast as the soul-guided train, it's much more convenient within the city. With the navigation system, it can save us a lot of time."  "Then buy it!"  With similar spending as last time, they bought another car of similar size.  Following the address Tang Wulin had found, the team headed straight for Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy.  The Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was located in the southwest corner of Tianding City. The academy had been established for nearly two thousand years. Although it was not as ancient as Shrek Academy, which dated back to ancient times, it was also considered to have a long history.  Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy had trained many talents and had a close cooperation with the military. In the early years when the military recruited soul-guided masters, they preferred those with flying capabilities.  Soul-guided masters could fly with the help of soul-guided devices, but those who could fly inherently had much better control in aerial combat. Even if their martial souls were not very strong, their combat effectiveness could be enhanced by soul-guided devices. At that time, the appearance of soul-guided devices greatly narrowed the gap between ordinary soul masters and genius soul masters.  With the emergence of mechas, the strength of soul masters could not even determine the outcome of a battle for a long time.  It was only after the appearance of battle armor that the strong soul masters regained their advantage.  Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was a college that focused on training soul-guided masters, especially flying soul-guided masters. Therefore, the mecha masters they trained were very famous in the federation and were scarce talents in various military regions.  With the support of the military, Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy developed very quickly. Besides those ancient top-tier academies, they were also considered to be among the best of the second-tier academies.  A regular soul-guided car stopped in an alley not far from Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy.  Six people got out of the car, all dressed in green sportswear. Green was always a very eye-catching color.  Leading them was Tang Wulin, who had just purchased the sportswear. Green represented the color of Shrek.  The main entrance of Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was very cool, made of metal, over twenty meters high and forty meters wide, allowing even mechas to pass through easily.  The walls were tall, and looking at the covered area, it was quite impressive. A large area in the southwest of Tianding City belonged to them.  Tang Wulin led his companions to the main entrance and gave Xie Xie a look.  Xie Xie's mouth twitched slightly, taking out something - two long bamboo poles supporting a banner.  The banner unfolded, about ten meters wide, white with a dozen green characters written on it, which were not very well written but still legible to anyone who saw it.  He and Xu Lizhi held one end each, raising the banner, sticking the bamboo poles into the ground.  The entrance of Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was bustling with activity. As soon as they raised this banner, it immediately attracted the attention of many passersby.  A passerby read aloud subconsciously, "We come from Shrek Academy and challenge your academy's strongest team under twenty years old."  Is this a challenge to the academy? Yes, this was the method Tang Wulin came up with: simple, crude, direct, and time-saving.  There were guards at the gate of the Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy. It was still early, and the students had just begun to enter the school gate. Many people stopped and watched curiously when they saw this scene. Some were surprised, some frowned, some were angry, and some were curious.  Soon, the front of the academy was crowded with people.  Shrek Academy? The most attractive thing to them was undoubtedly the three words "Shrek." For any student, these three words had an extraordinary meaning - that was the stuff of legends! Students from Shrek Academy have come to our academy for a challenge?  Challenge the strongest team under twenty years old? Judging by their age, they seemed to be around fifteen years old.  Tang Wulin stood at the forefront expressionlessly. He believed that such a straightforward challenge could not be refused by the Tianding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy. If they refused, the reputation of the academy would plummet, and the psychological blow to the students would undoubtedly be huge.  "Are you really from Shrek Academy?" A seventeen or eighteen-year-old youth approached Tang Wulin and asked in a deep voice.  Tang Wulin nodded, "Hello, we are from Shrek, and we hope to have a match with your academy for the purpose of exchange and learning."  The youth asked, "How can you prove that you are from Shrek?"  Tang Wulin smiled faintly, a flash of gold in his eyes as a golden ring of light rose abruptly from under his feet.  The golden light was dazzling, causing a burst of exclamations.  Gold? What was the situation with a golden soul ring? Even the strongest soul beasts were orange in the legends, right? Do golden soul rings really exist? It seemed like in the legends, the soul rings of gods were golden!  Little did they know that Tang Wulin's was not a normal soul ring, but a blood essence soul ring.  Tang Wulin knew his own difficulties – how could he prove his identity? There was no way to prove it, okay? All the things that could prove his identity had been taken away by the academy.  The reason he didn't release three purple soul rings was that the golden soul ring would be more shocking, and it was important to suppress the opponent first.  The young man also showed a shocked expression, involuntarily stepping back two steps. Chapter 444: The Predestined Starry Sky Soul Master Academy  At this moment, the gates of the Predestined Starry Sky Soul Master Academy opened, and several people came out. They all appeared to be over forty years old. The one in the lead was tall and burly, with some grizzled short hair standing upright, looking very spirited.  Tang Wulin had not retracted his blood soul ring, and as he emerged, he naturally saw them too. A flash of surprise passed through his eyes, and he stepped forward, then stopped.  "Shrek Academy? Are you from the outer or inner court?" asked the middle-aged man.  Tang Wulin replied, "Outer court, first grade, class leader, Tang Wulin."  Formal challenges were different from looking for a cheap fight at the Spirit Pagoda.  "Class leader?" The middle-aged man's surprise was obviously stronger than when he first saw the golden soul ring on Tang Wulin.  "Put away your banners, please come in." With that, the middle-aged man stepped aside.  Tang Wulin waved his hand, and Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi immediately packed up the banners. This was an admission threshold; once admitted, that was it. It wasn't appropriate to fight outside the door; challenging someone required giving the other party some face.  "Go to class, don't hang around here anymore." The middle-aged man waved his hand authoritatively, and he obviously had a lot of clout within the academy. The students of the Predestined Starry Sky Soul Master Academy immediately scattered like birds and beasts, each heading into the academy.  Tang Wulin and the other five followed into the academy. The academy, with its long history, not only occupied a vast area but also had an elegant environment, with many sculptures lining the roads.  The middle-aged man said, "I am the director of the educational department of the Predestined Soul Master Academy, Li Zhi Long. Our academy has a long history and is the leading advanced soul master academy in Predestined City, mainly teaching flying soul masters, soul engineers, and mecha masters. There is also a specialized postgraduate college for training battle armor masters. Are you here representing Shrek Academy?"  Hearing him mention Shrek Academy, Tang Wulin suddenly had a thought and honestly said, "We are not representing the academy. To be honest, Director Li, we represent ourselves. This is a trial from the academy, requiring us to find opponents stronger than us to battle in various major cities. They also took away all our identity proofs and equipment. We had no choice but to come here with this strategy, please forgive us. But we chose the Predestined Soul Master Academy because we know, this is the best academy in Predestined City, even the entire northwest."  Gu Yue and Ye Xinglan looked at Tang Wulin with a strange gaze. When did he become so straightforward? Had he changed?  But what surprised them even more came next. After hearing Tang Wulin's words, Director Li Zhi Long laughed heartily, "Truly, the young calf is not afraid of the tiger. Worthy of being a little monster cultivated by our Shrek Academy. You did not directly attack our school, which has already given us face. I remember, back in our batch, there was a senior who went alone to the military station for a school mission, causing a huge commotion."  Our Shrek Academy? These words left everyone stunned.  Tang Wulin was also surprised and asked, "You studied at Shrek Academy before?"  Li Zhi Long smiled and said, "Yes! I am probably about fifteen batches older than you. Unfortunately, I only barely graduated from the outer court."  Although he said it was barely, his expression was not of someone who barely managed; it was filled with pride. Being able to graduate from Shrek Academy was his life's proudest achievement.  Tang Wulin also smiled, "Then we should call you senior. Hello, senior. We are really sorry for this inconvenience. If it's not suitable, we'll leave and think of another way to complete our final exam."  Li Zhi Long waved his hand and said, "What are you talking about! You've already come. And after what you've done at the school gate, if there wasn’t some result, I wouldn't be able to explain it to the students. I will find you opponents, as you said, the strongest team under twenty years old. I also want to see how much difference there is between our students and you. Speaking of which, it has been many years since I've been back to Shrek. I really miss the Spirit Ice Plaza! Back when I was at the academy, my greatest hope was to be able to study by the Sea God Lake and enter the inner court. Unfortunately, I never managed to do that."  His eyes were filled with nostalgia as if lost in memories, and Tang Wulin also had a smile on his face.  The reason he told the truth was that he observed and analyzed the situation. When he first saw Li Zhi Long, although the director seemed very authoritative, his gaze towards them clearly carried a bit of closeness. Furthermore, the changes in Li Zhi Long's eyes during their conversation and his expression when mentioning Shrek made Tang Wulin guess some things. That's why he told the truth, and indeed, it touched the director.  The main teaching building of the Predestined Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was very impressive, nearly a hundred meters tall. From the outside, it was hard to see how many floors there were, as it was a huge domed structure. The majesty of it was almost comparable to the main teaching building of Shrek Academy, only slightly smaller in area.  Li Zhi Long first took them to a rest room, then asked, "You're only comparing soul master abilities, right? Do you use mechas?"  Tang Wulin hurriedly shook his head and said, "No, do you think the academy would let us bring mechas out?"  "Good, rest for a while, have some water, I'll go arrange things. We'll catch up later."  "When did you become so honest?" As soon as Li Zhi Long left, Xie Xie couldn't help but ask curiously.  Gu Yue said from the side, "He must have noticed something. This Director Li has a connection with our academy. That's why he told the truth, right?" She didn't understand at first, but later, as she listened to their conversation, she gradually figured it out.  Tang Wulin smiled without saying a word, just pointing to his own head.  "Cut..." Ye Xinglan snorted disdainfully.  Tang Wulin said, "Let's get ready, everyone. I think the exchange match later won't be easy. Although Director Li is our senior and supported our final exam, he now represents the Predestined Starry Sky Soul Master Academy. He will definitely choose the best students to compete with us. The soul masters here specialize in flying, which can be troublesome. Everything will proceed according to the plan we have discussed."  Everyone nodded.  Tang Wulin closed his eyes to rest. It wasn't long before Li Zhi Long returned.  "Do you need to adjust your state?" he asked as he entered the room.  Tang Wulin stood up and said, "Senior, no need. We still have to go to the next city, so it's better to finish the fight quickly and continue with the exam."  Li Zhi Long smiled and said, "As a class leader, are you afraid of being eliminated?"  Tang Wulin shook his head and said, "I'm not worried about that, but I hope to earn more points and then share them with my classmates. I hope every student in our class can stay in the end."  Li Zhi Long was visibly moved and said, "Good! You are a qualified class leader. In that case, follow me."  To the surprise of Tang Wulin and the others, there were no elevators inside the tall teaching building, only spiral staircases going up, explained Li Zhi Long, to constantly exercise the students' physical fitness.  Following the staircase all the way to the top floor, they reached the highest point, with a ceiling height of over thirty meters, housed in a vast domed structure.  Through a corridor, they entered a large hall.  The hall was massive, but what was even more surprising was that it was an open-air hall, without a dome, directly under the sky.  "This is the academy's observatory, also an important practical training ground. With a diameter of three hundred meters, since our academy specializes in flying soul masters, there is no height restriction here," Li Zhi Long explained.  Tang Wulin commented, "It is truly magnificent. To be able to gaze at the starry sky here at night must be very beautiful." Chapter 445: Observatory  Li Zhilong smiled and said, "It's not difficult to see the stars. You'll be able to see them in a bit. Our observatory has some peculiar features. Whether it's day or night, once activated, it can bring us closer to space and allow us to directly observe the stars at a closer distance. The large soul-guiding array of the observatory draws the power of the stars from space into the observatory, providing the purest energy to help our students cultivate. Only particularly outstanding disciples are allowed to come here to cultivate at specific times. Usually, it's mostly the graduate class students here. They refine their bodies with the power of the stars, tempering their own battle armor."  The surprise in Tang Wulin's eyes was genuine this time. He had not expected the Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy to have such an extraordinary place. It seemed that today's match would not be easy to play! But wait, star power? Starlight?  He subconsciously turned his head to glance at Xu Xiaoyan, not far from him, but to his helplessness, he saw a look of bewilderment in Xu Xiaoyan's eyes.  "Please wait here for a moment and feel the environment. Our students will arrive soon."  Around the observatory was a thirty-meter high wall, and upon closer inspection, one could see that the wall was constructed with many rare metals, forming intricate patterns and designs.  Having heard Li Zhilong's introduction and observing and feeling the surroundings, one could discover the huge potential energy contained within the observatory.  Soul-guiding arrays have been used among the common folk for many years, but humanity has never stopped developing them for thousands of years. More and more large and complex soul-guiding arrays have been designed and produced, each with different functions. The military controls the largest number of large soul-guiding arrays, which are used in national defense facilities.  And the soul-guiding array in front of them was the most complex and massive one Tang Wulin had ever seen. He wondered if Shrek Academy had one. They must have, after all, Shrek was the number one academy on the continent!  Feeling everything around them, soon, a group of people appeared before them.   The uniforms of the Tian Ding Soul Master Academy were black, with star-shaped embroidery on the chest. Silver stars represented cultivation level, with each additional one indicating a higher level of soul power. At the graduate level, the silver star would turn into a gold star. Therefore, the strength of the students here could be understood by counting the stars on their uniforms.  The six students who came were all adorned with silver stars, glittering with silver light, four males and two females. Upon their arrival, their gaze first fell on Tang Wulin's group of six, carrying a hint of curiosity. These six people appeared to be between eighteen and twenty years old.  With a glance, Tang Wulin could discern their strengths and weaknesses.   The strongest among them had forty-six silver stars. The other five also had over forty stars, exactly meeting their standard for confrontation.  Coming from Shrek Academy, they didn't really care much about opponents who were a level higher than themselves.   But what Tang Wulin cared about was this observatory. Without a doubt, Li Zhilong's decision to have them compete here was not without reason.  Li Zhilong smiled and said, "Let me introduce you to each other. These six are talented students from Shrek Academy. And our six here are the most outstanding students below the postgraduate level. How about this, introduce yourselves to each other."  Tang Wulin nodded, and saluted the six people opposite: "I am the captain, Tang Wulin, an offensive control system battle soul master."  A tall young man on the other side stepped forward with a smile: "Hello, welcome to Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy. I am the captain, Xiao Tian. Coincidentally, just like you, I am also an offensive control system battle soul master."  Their eyes met, and although both were smiling, they were also scrutinizing each other.   Due to age, Xiao Tian's figure was obviously taller and leaner than Tang Wulin's, but he didn't see any emotions in Tang Wulin's eyes.  Gu Yue was the second to speak, "Gu Yue, offensive system battle soul master." A simple introduction.  The second person on the other side was a skinny male student who looked very ordinary and had nothing remarkable about him, but he had the second-highest number of silver stars after Gu Tianming, at the forty-fourth level.  "Ye Zishu, agile attack system battle soul master."  "Xie Xie, agile attack system battle soul master."  The third person on the other side was tall and burly, the strongest-looking of all six.  "Gu Tianming, agile attack system battle soul master." He's an agile attack system? Not an offensive system? With that physique.  "Ye Xinglan, offensive system battle soul master."  The fourth person from Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was a medium-built but very handsome young man. With a slight smile, his voice instantly left a deep impression on Tang Wulin and his team, melodious and pleasant, "Zhang Xinjie, control system battle soul master."  "Xu Xiaoyan, control system battle soul master." Xu Xiaoyan still had a look of confusion in her eyes, speaking subconsciously.  The fifth person from Tian Ding Starry Sky was a beautiful girl, petite and exquisite, giggling, "I am Li Yaoyao, offensive system battle soul master."  "Xu Lizhi, food system tool soul master." The fat guy.  The last student from Tian Ding was also a female, with good looks and figure, appearing soft and delicate. "My name is Han Yushang, control system battle soul master." Another control system?  After hearing the other side's introductions, Tang Wulin couldn't help but be on guard.   Captain Xiao Tian was an offensive system battle soul master, and then there were two additional control systems, pure control system battle soul masters.   It's important to note that there were only six people in total! Half of them were control systems, what's the situation?  Moreover, according to the characteristics of Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy, these six people were also flying soul masters, fighting in their own special field, all above level forty. This battle was definitely not going to be easy.  Tang Wulin looked at Gu Yue beside him, Gu Yue felt his gaze and turned her head towards him, their eyes met, and they nodded imperceptibly to each other.  "Alright, the teacher responsible for controlling the observatory has also arrived, and the observatory barrier will be opened shortly. This is a sparring match, so stop at the right moment," Li Zhilong said with a smile.  He had always been proud of being a graduate from Shrek Academy, but he hoped even more that the students he trained could defeat the students from Shrek Academy!  Although Tang Wulin and his team were young, the identity of Tang Wulin as the class leader could, in some sense, represent Shrek Academy.  Winning this match would be a matter of pride for Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy, even though there was a slight age mismatch.   Which academy has ever defeated a younger team from Shrek Academy?  Both sides retreated, creating distance, which was the rule for the match. Before the start of the battle, they had to be at least one hundred meters apart.  As they retreated, Tang Wulin's eyes gradually brightened.  Those who knew him were aware that the greater the pressure, the stronger his fighting spirit, and the more he could be stimulated to tap into his potential.  The six opponents in front of him were strong, but could they be stronger than the top five young talents of that year?  Having defeated even the martial soul fusion skills, Tang Wulin was confident that even in a specific place, they could still crush their opponents.  This was the undefeated belief of Shrek.  They represented not only themselves but also the glory of Shrek!  In a triangular formation, Tang Wulin was at the front, with Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan following, and Gu Yue, Xu Xiaoyan, and Xu Lizhi at the back.  The six opponents did not seem to have any intention of forming a formation, still lined up in a row.  Six against six, the team battle tested not only individual strength but also the cooperation between them.  "Ready!" Li Zhilong acted as the referee for the match.  "Buzz—" The humming sound rang out, and the walls surrounding the entire observatory lit up. The magnificent patterns on the walls seemed to come to life under the halo of light, rising into the air and turning into beams of light that converged at one point before forming a giant pillar of light shooting into the sky.  What an observatory.  Tang Wulin's heart moved as he felt the energy fluctuations within the observatory.  In the next moment, the sky began to darken, all the golden light disappeared in a short time, the walls remained magnificent, but the day had turned into an endless starry sky, with twinkling stars as if they were within reach.  A peculiar and pure energy descended from the sky, bathing the entire observatory.  Tang Wulin clearly saw that the six opponents had faint golden halos appearing on their bodies, and their aura was slightly enhanced. Although not significant, it was undoubtedly a boost in this environment.  "Huh?" A soft exclamation came from behind.  Tang Wulin turned around and immediately saw a surprising scene.  A dazzling golden light lit up behind him; the golden light was in the form of a mist, the golden mist rising, even making those close by unable to see her face.  "Xiaoyan."  Tang Wulin called out softly. Chapter 446: I'm Fine, Wonderfully Fine  "I'm okay. I'm really fine, this feeling, it's so wonderful!" Xu Xiaoyan's voice was a bit shaky, but it was clearly a shake of excitement.  The referee for this match, Li Zhilong, was also a bit surprised. He was the most familiar with the Starwatch Platform, where students could absorb star power to refine their bodies, but it was only effective for soul masters with flying martial souls.  It could be said that the Starwatch Platform was the foundation of the Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy. Fighting here, one’s own soul power would have an enhancement, and the recovery speed would also be much stronger than in the outside world.  But what was the situation with that girl from Shrek Academy? Was that her martial soul?  Different students have different degrees of perception and absorption of star power. The more in tune with the star power, the stronger the star power fluctuations that would appear on their bodies on the Starwatch Platform. The faint golden aura that Tang Wulin had seen before was such an example. Even within the Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy, only a very few students could manifest star power in this way, which was generally not visible on the surface of ordinary students; the faint golden mist was a manifestation of this.  The golden mist that appeared on Xu Xiaoyan's body was already near materialization, so even Li Zhilong, who was very familiar with this place, couldn't understand the changes that appeared on her body.  "Begin!"  With a loud shout from Li Zhilong, the match between the six students from the first class of the first grade of Shrek Academy and the strongest team under twenty years old from Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy began.  On the Shrek Academy side, three figures shot out like lightning, with incredibly fast speeds.  Tang Wulin made the biggest move, stomping his left foot on the ground, and his body shot out like a cannonball, so fast that it was breathtaking. In the instant he dashed out, his martial soul was also released, with three circles of purple soul rings shining brilliantly, and strands of Blue Silver Grass swarmed out.  However, it was already very difficult for people to recognize that this was Blue Silver Grass. The translucent blue vines had faint golden lines inside, and if one looked closely, they could see faint scale-like patterns on the surface of the Blue Silver Grass.  Naturally, the ones who rushed out with him were Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan. Xie Xie was light in shape, not as violent as Tang Wulin, but his speed was not slow at all.  Ye Xinglan was just fast, so fast that it was hard to see clearly. All three of them had three soul rings shining, like three sharp arrows, charging straight at their opponents.  The reaction of the six students from Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy was unanimous; they jumped up and took off into the air at the same time.  Xiao Tian Tian bent forward slightly, and a layer of dark red light suddenly burst out from his body, even his eyes turned dark red. A pair of wings like bat wings opened behind him, and with a strong flap, he shot up into the sky. His four soul rings, all purple, flashed with light, an imposing aura.  When he released his martial soul, his originally slender body also began to expand, becoming more burly.  What kind of martial soul was this? Tang Wulin didn't recognize it at first glance.  Beside Xiao Tian Tian, Ye Zishu was the most peculiar. He clasped his hands in front of him, a yellow light shone, and it turned out to be a long bamboo pole. Then, the light of the second soul ring among his four soul rings flickered, the bamboo gently swayed, and countless bamboo leaves fluttered up, condensing into two wings behind him. He propped the bamboo pole on the ground, bounced his body up, and flew up as well. His flight seemed light and airy, the whole person had a strange sense of lightness, like dandelion seeds rising, not like pure flight.  Gu Tianming's mouth let out an eagle cry, a pair of wings spread out, and his hair also noticeably grew feathers. With a flap of his wings, he rushed fiercely into the sky.  His martial soul, the Skyreaching War Eagle!  Zhang Xining also had a pair of wings, but compared to Gu Tianming, his wings were much smaller and more agile. The wings were white, and with a gentle flap, he fluttered into the air, dodging behind Gu Tianming, like a startled little bird.  The most astonishing to Tang Wulin was Li Yaoyao. The next moment after the petite and exquisite beauty rose into the air, a strong flame suddenly burst out from her body. Immediately afterward, her whole skin turned dark, and her arms each condensed into a mass of stone-like shapes. Flames jetted out, propelling her upward at great speed. The six of them flew up together, but her speed was the fastest.  What kind of martial soul was this?  As expected of the Flying Martial Soul Academy, it was truly eye-opening.  The last, Han Yushang, was relatively normal, with a pair of colorful butterfly wings spreading out from her back. The butterfly wings fluttered lightly, and she rose into the air as if weightless.  Indeed, all six could fly!  A hundred-meter distance for a soul master above three rings was just a matter of a few breaths. When Tang Wulin and his group had charged out fifty meters, suddenly, Tang Wulin jumped up, then landed on his feet, and with the momentum, he forcefully flung a Blue Silver Grass trailing behind him.  A figure, pulled by the Blue Silver Grass, shot up into the air like a cannonball, smashing toward the six from Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy, who had already flown to at least thirty meters in the air.  Not only did he stop. Ye Xinglan and Xie Xie also stopped at the same time, leaped up, and jumped towards Tang Wulin's direction. Tang Wulin opened his arms, hugged their waists, and started spinning in place.  After spinning rapidly for three rounds, he suddenly flung them out, and both Xie Xie and Ye Xinglan rose into the air.  None of them were flying soul masters, and they couldn't stop the others from taking off from a hundred meters away. What they could do was intercept in the air before the opponents flew to a completely unreachable height.  The first to be flung into the air by Tang Wulin was Xu Lizhi. His body was plump, and at this moment, his body curled into a ball, like a meatball cannonball, aiming directly at the direction of Gu Tianming, the Skyreaching War Eagle, and Zhang Xining, whom he was protecting.  Control-type soul masters would always be more troublesome than assault-type soul masters, something Tang Wulin firmly believed in, so the first he wanted to deal with was the opponent's control-type soul master.  Xie Xie was flung up, aiming at the Butterfly Winged Han Yushang, while Ye Xinglan's target was the opponent's team captain, the strongest Xiao Tian Tian.  The three flew in three different directions, and just this alone showed how powerful Tang Wulin's strength was and how strong his control was.  If you look closely, you will find that although the three of them flew up, there was a Blue Silver Grass wrapped around each of their waists.  Tang Wulin's current position was right in the center of the Starwatch Platform.  A bunch of fireballs rose into the air, each with a diameter of more than a foot, carrying dazzling tails, pressing towards Ye Zishu and Li Yaoyao.  Tang Wulin's plan was simple, to intercept the opponents in the shortest time possible, while Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan provided long-range support from the ground, and he himself was ready to dispatch and burst forth at any moment.  He didn't expect to completely solve the opponents in the first moment, but at least to take down a part of them.  Then it would come down to attrition.  Although flying soul masters have a certain advantage over ordinary soul masters, the soul power consumption of flying in the air is far greater than that of soul masters standing on the ground.  Therefore, Tang Wulin was not afraid of the opponents flying to a very high place and not coming down.  The first to engage in battle was Xu Lizhi's side. He was the first to be flung out by Tang Wulin, and with the help of momentum and Tang Wulin's strong arm strength, he was definitely much faster than relying on his wings to fly.  Gu Tianming had just flown to the specified height, and a huge meatball from the opposite side was already rushing towards him.  The first soul ring on Zhang Xining, who was behind him, shone, and a clear and loud scream rang out. His voice was indeed pleasant, melodious, and lingering.  His martial soul was the Hundred Spirits Bird. Although he was a flying type soul master, he relied on sound to control his enemies.  His first soul skill was deceleration. To weaken the opponent.  However, his deceleration ability had no direct effect on Xu Lizhi.  Xu Lizhi did not fly over by his own power! He was flung over by Tang Wulin.  Gu Tianming was still pondering at this moment, thinking that this chubby guy was a food-type tool soul master, so was he being flung out as cannon fodder?  As an excellent student of Tian Ding Starry Sky Soul Master Academy, his reaction was also quick. The first soul ring on his body lit up, and his wings slapped forward fiercely, dozens of eagle feathers turned into arrows, shooting towards Xu Lizhi.  In aerial combat, being able to attack from a distance is very important because it's easy for both sides to maintain distance.  The eagle feathers broke through the air, making a series of "pu pu" sounds.  Unfortunately, what Gu Tianming didn't know was that the person he was facing came from the Tang Sect. What was the essence of the Tang Sect when it was first established? Hidden weapons!  In mid-air, the originally coiled Xu Lizhi suddenly stretched out his body, circling his hands in front of him, his face still wearing a simple and honest smile, his pair of plump hands shining with a jade-like luster. Those eagle feathers seemed to enter a vortex, converging inward, and were directly caught in his hands. Chapter 447: The Gap  Xu Lizhi pushed his hands forward, shifting from Capturing Dragon to Controlling Crane, and dozens of tough and sharp eagle feathers shot out. Supported by his rich soul power and amplified by the Tang Sect's hidden weapon technique, the Heavenly Maiden Scattering Blossoms, they flew towards the Bailing Bird Soul Master Zhang Xining even faster than before.  Meanwhile, he had already reached Gu Tianming. Seeing the huge body before him, Gu Tianming could no longer take care of Zhang Xining. The second soul ring on his body flashed, and a pair of eagle wings suddenly doubled in size, trying to block the eagle feathers while closing inward. Eagle Wing Strike! The second soul skill.  Unexpectedly, the fat man smiled and waved at him. The body that was supposed to hit him suddenly paused in mid-air. Following that, a burst of cold light shot out from his hands. The cold light, spreading like a peacock's tail feathers, bypassed Gu Tianming and went straight for Zhang Xining behind him.  This was the fat man's real killer move. The previous eagle feathers were just an unexpected bonus.  Before the eagle wings could hit him, the fat man suddenly shot backwards, his smile unchanged, still waving at Gu Tianming.  Not good!  By the time Gu Tianming thought of rescuing Zhang Xining, it was already too late. Most of the eagle feathers were blocked by him, but some still flew towards Zhang Xining.  Zhang Xining was a pure control system Soul Master, specifically a sound control type. His frontal combat ability was almost zero, but his control ability was the strongest among everyone.  Facing the eagle feathers, he desperately flapped his wings to dodge but was still scratched by a few, leaving wounds.  Just when he thought he had avoided them, a large bunch of cold light had already appeared in front of him. There had to be hundreds of steel needles covering all his possible escape routes, each needle imbued with robust soul power.  There was no escape!  This...  A sigh sounded in his ear, and then, amidst a series of "ding ding" sounds, he fell from the sky.  "Zhang Xining, out."  The voice of Li Zhilong was filled with helplessness, but he had to save him!  It was just an encounter, and in the absence of a flying type Soul Master on the other side, one of their important control system battle Soul Masters was already out.  Shrek Academy, truly a monster academy.  Zhang Xining's face was flushed red. His heart was filled with unwillingness, but this was a competition, a battlefield, and feeling indignant wouldn't change the outcome.  As the fat man descended from the sky and was about to crash into Tang Wulin, Tang Wulin also circled his hands, Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, skillfully dissipating the force and placing him beside his body.  The fat man raised his hand, and a big healing meat bun was already handed over to him. Tang Wulin bit into it, swallowing it in two or three bites.  At the same time, Xie Xie, who had ascended into the sky, had already reached near Han Yu Chang, the butterfly Soul Master. Agility beats control, and once close, there was almost no chance of turning the tables.  But Han Yu Chang was unusually calm. The second soul ring on her body flashed, but there were no changes to her body. Instead, she seemed to pull on something in front of her with both hands, and then gently clapped her wings.  At that moment, Xie Xie felt as if the world in front of him suddenly turned black and white, and then something seemed to break. Han Yu Chang seemed to be right in front of him. His Light Dragon Dagger swung out, but hit nothing, and everything turned to naught. A slight pain on his shoulder, and his body began to fall through the air.  To the others, it seemed that Xie Xie had suddenly initiated an attack on thin air, and then Han Yu Chang flapped her butterfly wings, pointed her toe on his shoulder, and flew into the air.  This was...  A chill ran through Tang Wulin's heart, mental control system!  Xie Xie's attack couldn't possibly have such a huge deviation. The only possibility for this situation was that he was bewildered by Han Yu Chang.  This Han Yu Chang was not only a flying type martial soul but also a mental control type martial soul.  As Xie Xie fell from the sky, a dazzling cluster of fire suddenly erupted. It wasn't Gu Yue's fireball, but rather Li Yaoyao, who had ascended the fastest before. It was unclear which soul ring on her body was flashing, but her whole body curled up in the air, then plummeted like a meteorite, heading straight for Xie Xie with incredible speed and momentum.  What kind of martial soul was this? A meteorite?  Although Xie Xie was an agility-type Soul Master, he was falling from the sky and was in an unavoidable situation. Agility-type usually came with weaker defenses.  He had just started to fall when Li Yaoyao smashed through one of Gu Yue's fireballs and flew towards him. Obviously, her coordination with Han Yu Chang was not just a day or two's work.  His waist tightened, and Xie Xie's body flew sideways, pulled by Tang Wulin's Blue Silver Grass. He was pulled horizontally into the air, avoiding Li Yaoyao's impact.  But Li Yaoyao didn't stop her momentum. Instead, she bravely descended, like a meteor chasing the moon, targeting Tang Wulin.  It was clear to them that the core of these six people from Shrek Academy was Tang Wulin.  Force attack control system.  Tang Wulin, as if he didn't see Li Yaoyao, pulled his right hand, entangling the Blue Silver Grass around Xie Xie's waist, and shook it with force.  Xie Xie's falling momentum stopped abruptly, and as he ascended again, he was sent back into the air, still targeting the butterfly Soul Master Han Yu Chang.  Ye Xinglan and Xiao Tianxian also met in the air. Ye Xinglan, with her sword as one, turned into a cold star and went straight for Xiao Tianxian.  Xiao Tianxian's body surged with starlight, his burly body suddenly spread his wings to the maximum, and both hands slapped towards Ye Xinglan. A dazzling dark red light ball suddenly appeared in the air, blocking Ye Xinglan's path.  The Sword God Star shone, turning into streams of golden light, like countless stars suddenly blooming. A layer of pale golden halo emerged on Ye Xinglan's body, and the celestial stars seemed to brighten at that moment.  The dark red light ball shattered, and the sword's edge was instantly in front of Xiao Tianxian.  Xiao Tianxian was shocked. He never expected that Ye Xinglan could also launch attacks with the power of the stars, and clearly, she was more in tune with it than him.  The third soul ring on his body flickered, and suddenly a pair of horns grew on his head. A dark red electric net burst out from his body as the center, and his entire body seemed to become a huge electric ball in an instant.  "Ding!" The Sword God was deflected, and Ye Xinglan, without leverage in the void, seemed about to fall.  But at that moment, she raised the Sword God in her hand, and the third soul ring glimmered.  A bright light suddenly rose, and her body instantly negated gravity, turning into a star that shot into the sky.  This...  Li Zhilong was also somewhat stunned. He could see that Ye Xinglan's martial soul must also be related to stars. If not, she wouldn't be able to borrow the starlight so smoothly.  A bad premonition followed.  As Tang Wulin shook the Blue Silver Grass to help Xie Xie ascend, the meteorite that Li Yaoyao had transformed into had already arrived. The roaring momentum, the solid exterior, and the blazing flames all highlighted the explosive attack power.  Facing such a meteorite, Tang Wulin raised his right hand, golden scales surged, and the Golden Dragon Claw appeared.  He clenched his fist, his blood qi running counter to the surge within him. In an instant, a layer of golden light also rose from his body.  This wasn't borrowing the power of starlight; it was the visualization of his own blood qi swelling to the extreme.  "Boom—"  Tang Wulin stood in place, unmovable, and the meteorite that Li Yaoyao had become came to a halt in front of his fist.  In that instant, time on the entire Star Observation Platform seemed to have stopped. Chapter 448: At this moment, the stars shine brilliantly. Li Yaoyao's attack is known for its strength, and her martial soul is the peculiar meteorite. In fact, she cannot fly, but she can use the tail flame jet capability of her martial soul to rise into the sky and then fall to smash her opponents. All her soul skills also amplify her own abilities when using this attack method. With her current strength at the four-ring level, her full-force collision can reach a force of over 3000 kilograms. Moreover, even if she doesn't crush her opponent with one strike, she can immediately rise into the sky and attack again, which is the most terrifying aspect. She herself has the defensive power of a meteorite layer, which is also quite formidable. She is known as the killer move in their small team, called omnipresent on the battlefield. She can even change her direction in mid-air during the collision.  The ability to change direction did not work on Tang Wulin, because he didn't dodge at all. After such a violent collision, both of them were at a standstill. What was going on?  Li Zhilong moved and was already nearby, ready to rescue either side if there was a problem. But in the next moment, his pupils shrank violently. Starting from the center of Tang Wulin's Golden Dragon Claw on the transformed meteorite of Li Yaoyao, fine cracks appeared, and then they rapidly spread, reaching every corner of the meteorite in the blink of an eye. The next instant, the meteorite burst apart with a boom, and Li Yaoyao let out a delicate cry, her body collapsing softly from within the meteorite. A Blue Silver Grass swiftly wrapped around her, binding her tightly.  Li Yaoyao's face was pale at this moment, her whole body was in unspeakable pain due to the intense shock from before, but the shock in her heart was far greater than the physical shock she endured. How is it possible, he blocked my full-force strike with just one hand!  Tang Wulin shook his right hand, his whole right arm feeling a bit numb and sore. The impact of that strike was really not light. Hmm, just this much. The second one!  The second person from the Skyreach Academy for Star Luo Soul Masters is out. Tang Wulin looked up at the sky, where Ye Xinglan's third soul skill, the Falling Sword Star, had already descended from above. Under the illumination of the starry sky around the observatory, her Falling Sword Star truly looked like a meteor chasing the moon, and since Tang Wulin had known her, this was definitely the strongest Falling Sword Star that Ye Xinglan had ever used. The power of the stars is really useful. Of course, it helps our side.  The fourth soul ring ascended, and Xiao Tianxian suddenly became still, and his face could no longer be seen clearly. All that could be seen was a pair of blood-colored eyes. A pitch-black aura rose around his body; with a fierce motion of his hands in mid-air, a layer of black airflow suddenly burst forth, turning into a vortex in the sky. The Falling Sword Star collided with the vortex, which trembled violently for a moment, and the next instant, Xiao Tianxian disappeared. Ye Xinglan disappeared at the same time.  What happened? Is it a spatial ability? No, that's not right! There are no fluctuations of spatial elemental attributes.  The next moment, Tang Wulin was shocked as a flash of dark red light appeared, and Xiao Tianxian re-emerged in mid-air, but Ye Xinglan did not reappear with him. What soul skill is this?  Xiao Tianxian spread his wings and descended from the sky, his wings opened wide, and his body rapidly changed shape in mid-air, plunging straight towards Gu Yue. At the same time, he clapped his hands in the void, and a mass of dark red light suddenly appeared in front of Tang Wulin, like a black hole, trying to engulf him.  Countless green shadows fell from the sky, which were pieces of bamboo leaves. The bamboo leaves changed and flipped in the air, like arrows, covering the whole field and also hiding Ye Zhiqiu's figure. Hidden among the large bamboo leaves, seven leaves turned golden, absorbing the starlight in the air. His martial soul was called the Seven Crafts Star Bamboo, with each soul ring adding a new variation. Flight was one of them. The current Seven Star Bamboo leaves are his strongest attack method, the fourth soul skill.  After the fight had started for a while, they already had two people out, and although the six members of Shrek Academy were not as advanced in their cultivation as their opponents, each one of them had a solid foundation and exceptional combat power. If they didn't erupt now, they wouldn't stand a chance at all. So, as Xiao Tianxian erupted, he did too.  On the other side, the Skyreach War Eagle Gu Tianming also spread his wings and charged at Xie Xie in the air, standing in front of the Butterfly Soul Master Han Yushang. Han Yushang's fourth soul ring lit up, and her butterfly wings suddenly doubled in size, flapping towards Tang Wulin's direction in mid-air. The Butterfly Wings, that was the name of her fourth soul skill.  Tang Wulin felt as if a sea of spirit had appeared in front of him, madly assaulting his brain. This wasn't control; it was a strong spiritual shock. He immediately judged that Han Yushang's spiritual power must have also reached the level of the Spiritual Sea, the same realm as Gu Yue.  Tang Wulin's own spiritual power had not improved since it reached the edge of the Spiritual Sea realm. The Spiritual Sea realm was a huge threshold in the spiritual level, and he had been diligently practicing the Purple Demon Eyes, waiting for the opportunity to break through. In his opinion, at the latest when he broke through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, he would also be able to break through the Spiritual Sea realm.  At this time, the strong spiritual fluctuations that assaulted him like waves caused him a splitting headache, and Xiao Tianxian's attack had also appeared in front of him. Tang Wulin's body glowed with a golden halo, and his Golden Dragon Body was released. His entire body was enveloped in a layer of golden light, with golden scales emerging in large areas, covering him. His whole body was shrouded in golden patterns, and his blood and qi surged. He himself suddenly crouched down, hugging his knees and curling up.  Xie Xie's figure in the air suddenly became illusory, and his Light Dragon Dagger was suddenly thrown out, carrying a blinding light blade, flying straight towards the Skyreach War Eagle Gu Tianming, while his own body changed continuously in the void, giving a sense of walking on air.  Gu Tianming felt as if his opponent had suddenly become countless figures, elusive. The wings vibrated, and a large number of eagle feathers flew out, but whenever the eagle feathers seemed about to hit the target, they were always dodged by the opponent through the gaps. In an instant, Xie Xie reached him. The Light Dragon Blade was blocked by Gu Tianming's wings, and the next moment Xie Xie was already in front of him, a golden light suddenly burrowed out from under his armpit, and Gu Tianming felt his body tighten, tightly bound.  Xie Xie's Light Dragon Dagger swung back, blocking his wing attack, and taking advantage of this strike, he leapt into the air, standing upside down, the Light Dragon Dagger tracing a series of light shadows, and his body flashing continuously in the void. The golden light that entangled Gu Tianming quickly spread upwards, and facing Xie Xie's lightning-fast attack, Gu Tianming couldn't take care of it. Xie Xie's attack was too fast and ghostly, always appearing in the most difficult places for him to defend. He felt out of breath.  Finally, the golden light wrapped around one of his wings, and Xie Xie's body spun in the air, the Light Dragon Storm suppressed Gu Tianming from the sky.  After Han Yushang fanned out the butterfly wings towards Tang Wulin, she turned to help Gu Tianming, but Gu Tianming had already been suppressed by Xie Xie, and she was about to launch a mental attack on Xie Xie as well. Suddenly, a strong sense of crisis emerged in her mind, and her body sank sharply. An invisible sharpness swept past her side.  Han Yushang was shocked. "Don't move!" A big hand had already wrapped around her waist from behind, and a cold breath was placed on her neck. "Your spiritual power is strong, and I'm not sure if I can block it when you launch a mental attack on me. But what I can be sure of is that even if I can't block it, I can definitely leave some marks on your neck or accidentally on your face. So, slowly descend." Han Yushang had never been so close to someone before, her pretty face turned red, and in her anger and frustration, she could only flap her wings and slowly descend.  Xie Xie, with his own power, defeated two more people. On the other side, Tang Wulin curled up, enduring the attack. The bamboo leaves fell from the sky, covering Tang Wulin, Gu Yue, Xu Lizhi, and Xu Xiaoyan, who had not moved from a distance but was shrouded in strong golden light.  The seven golden bamboo leaves hidden among the many bamboo leaves each found their targets. Gu Yue remained calm, and a strong wind rose around her body, preventing the nearby bamboo leaves from approaching her. The next instant, a flash of silver light, and she avoided Xiao Tianxian's pounce, appearing next to Xu Xiaoyan.  As for Xu Lizhi, he was next to Tang Wulin, so she didn't need to worry about him. Just as Gu Yue was about to release her own skills to protect Xu Xiaoyan, she suddenly felt a wave of energy fluctuations and looked back in surprise when she heard Xu Xiaoyan's gentle voice. "Stars, shine brilliantly!" Chapter 449: Mutation of the Stars  With the dazzling Starwheel Ice Staff held high above her head, in the next instant, myriad beams of starlight suddenly burst forth. The intense starlight, reflecting off the stars in the sky, instantly filled the entire observatory. All the bamboo leaves disappeared without a trace under the brilliant starlight, leaving only seven golden bamboo leaves frozen in mid-air, unable to move.  It was not just the bamboo leaves; under the envelopment of the starlight, Xiao Tian Tian who leapt into the air, Ye Zi Shu the Seven Treasures Bamboo soul master who was still in the air, Gu Tian Ming the Sky-reaching War Eagle who had lost his fighting ability under the entwinement of golden words, and Han Yu Chang the Butterfly soul master who was being suppressed by Xie Xie's shadow clone and descending, their bodies all turned golden under the starlight.  Those in the air, in the next instant, descended from the sky like free-falling. Those already on the ground, completely lost their ability to move. In this instant, the whole world seemed to turn golden.  Xu Xiao Yan's entire body was enveloped in starlight, as if a goddess had descended, with specks of golden starlight weaving dazzling brilliance on her. On her forehead, a pattern appeared out of nowhere, identical to the starwheel at the top of her Starwheel Ice Staff.  With her starlight's resplendent release, it seemed as if the light itself became softer, as if finding its master. The patterns of the entire observatory's array lit up, the stars in the sky became bright again, and countless starlights crazily converged towards her body.  Xu Xiao Yan's body lightly floated up, with specks of starlight rapidly gathering towards her. At this moment, Tang Wu Lin had already stood up again, watching this scene with his mouth agape in shock.  Of course, he did not forget to step forward a few steps, pressing down on the golden-transformed Xiao Tian Tian. At the same time, he threw out a strand of Bluesilver Grass, catching Ye Zi Shu who was descending from the sky to avoid him being injured.  Xie Xie's shadow clone rolled on the ground with the descending Han Yu Chang, dissipating the force and standing firm. He too looked up at the bizarre scene in the sky.  Each of them could feel that Xu Xiao Yan's aura was undergoing a transformation, a fundamental change. Soul power mutation! Indeed, only a soul power mutation could cause such intense energy fluctuations and the spectacle before them.  Moreover, from her current situation, no matter how you looked at it, this should be a positive change, and a very good one at that.  Li Zhi Long was already dumbfounded; he could never have imagined that this match would turn into such a situation. In fact, even if Xu Xiao Yan had not erupted, the outcome of this match was already determined.  Xiao Tian Tian's attack and Han Yu Chang's mental impact had not caused too much damage to Tang Wu Lin. When it comes to endurance, Tang Wu Lin was definitely second to none among everyone present.  Originally facing the powerful attacks from Yuan En Ye Hui, he could bear them all along, let alone the small scene before him. These outstanding students from the Star Luo Soul Master Academy, although also strong with four rings of cultivation, were not on the same level compared to Yuan En Ye Hui.  If Yuan En was here, he could defeat the entire opposing team with his strength alone. What Tang Wu Lin was originally wary of was the observatory itself. But he did not expect that the observatory would end up benefiting Xu Xiao Yan.  With a flash of light in the sky, Ye Xing Lan reappeared midair. Bathed in the starlight, her body also had a golden halo, and the Star God Sword emitted dazzling brilliance.  She was also absorbing the star power. However, compared to Xu Xiao Yan, she was only absorbing a very small part, and her body gradually descended from the sky. She sat down cross-legged directly on the ground and began to meditate.  Opportunities don't come often, and the students from Shrek Academy never lacked the ability to seize the moment. The golden color on the bodies of the Star Luo Soul Master Academy students gradually faded, and they regained their mobility.  Seeing this scene, how could they not be shocked? There was no need to continue this match; the outcome was already clear.  Tang Wu Lin looked at the dumbfounded Li Zhi Long, walked over quickly, and said in a low voice, "Senior, what do you think about this..."  Li Zhi Long came back to his senses and asked subconsciously, "Your classmate, is her soul power related to star power?"  Tang Wu Lin nodded.  Li Zhi Long took a deep breath, "I've never seen a soul master so in tune with star power. This is really..."  He wanted to say it would be great if she belonged to their academy. With his many years at the Star Luo Soul Master Academy, his understanding of the observatory was very profound.  This baptism of star power, no matter what mutation it caused, would definitely bring great benefits to Xu Xiao Yan. Such a student, it's impossible not to be a genius! If they could cultivate such a person, it would be an unparalleled improvement for the entire Star Luo Soul Master Academy.  But obviously, that was impossible. She came from Shrek.  Tang Wu Lin said, "Senior, could you please not interrupt the star power? Xiao Yan's current situation..."  "Of course!" Li Zhi Long interrupted him and said solemnly, "Although she is not a student of our academy, such a unique situation is an adventure for her and an encounter for us. We will record and preserve this data, which will be very valuable for the application of star power. Don't worry. Let her absorb as much as she wants."  Saying this, he turned to the six students of the Star Luo Soul Master Academy and said, "You should also carefully feel the changes in the star power and see if you can learn anything from it."  "Yes!" The six-headed by Xiao Tian Tian answered respectfully. Only now, the six of them were not in high spirits.  As the outstanding young generation of the Star Luo Soul Master Academy, they have always held themselves in high esteem. Not yet twenty years old and having reached the six-ring cultivation, three of them were skilled in control.  In competitions in Star Luo City and nearby cities, they were always invincible. Especially Xiao Tian Tian's Demon King soul power was very strong.  But today, facing the Shrek Academy, which was generally one ring lower in cultivation and much younger, and without a flying soul master on the opposing side, they were utterly defeated. This was a gap in the fundamental strength. How could they not feel frustrated?  This wave of star power absorption lasted for more than an hour before Xu Xiao Yan's body slowly landed on the ground. Many spots of light appeared on her body.  Tang Wu Lin used his mental power to roughly count, and there were about three hundred and sixty-five spots of light.  Xu Xiao Yan sat cross-legged on the ground, her Mysterious Heaven Skill in operation, and the three hundred and sixty-five golden spots of light on her body flickered on and off. Her Starwheel Ice Staff stood upright beside her, completely turned golden, especially the top starwheel, which seemed to become ethereal, as if the stars were branded inside it. Looking closely, it gave the feeling of looking up at the stars.  Her soul power must have evolved, at least the starwheel had evolved. Xu Xiao Yan's soul power fluctuations did not increase by much, but the feeling was one of purity.  Under the influence of the starlight, she seemed to become completely transparent, indescribably peculiar.  All along, Xu Xiao Yan had been the weakest in terms of strength in the team, relying only on the control of the Starwheel Ice Staff at night and later, the first soul ring Starwheel Chain that could finally be used during the day, to play a certain role.  But this time, she seemed to have truly improved.  The stars gradually returned to normal, the light from the observatory receded, and the starlight on Xu Xiao Yan's body disappeared as if absorbed back into her body, quietly.  Her originally very beautiful face now had an additional layer of luster, with a faint treasure light flickering.  Taking a deep breath, Xu Xiao Yan slowly opened her eyes, and when she noticed that all eyes were focused on her, her face turned slightly red. Chapter 450: Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy  "How does it feel?" Tang Wulin asked.  Xu Xiaoyan frowned slightly, "It's very strange, I can't explain it clearly."  Looking into her eyes, Tang Wulin understood that she wasn't unable to explain, but rather she didn't want to say it here.  "Senior, I'm very sorry for disturbing you today. Xiaoyan has recovered now, so we'll take our leave," Tang Wulin said to Li Zhilong.  Li Zhilong looked at Xu Xiaoyan, "Junior, the situation that happened to you is very special. We have recorded the whole process. We will study it later. Can you leave a contact so we can communicate more in the future?"  "Okay." Having received such a big favor, Xu Xiaoyan naturally wouldn't refuse and left her soul communicator number.  Of course, it would only be useful after getting back the soul communicator, which had been taken away by the academy.  They quietly left the Sky Dou Star Soul Master Academy and got into the car.  Xie Xie followed the map and drove towards the next city.  "Competing with the academy in this way is not bad," Tang Wulin said. "It is really helpful for our improvement. In the next city, we should be a bit more tactful."  Gu Yue said, "Will we be as lucky in the next city? This time we just happened to encounter a senior who graduated from Shrek Academy."  Tang Wulin hehe smiled and pulled out a piece of paper from his chest. "Just before leaving, I asked Senior Li. Our academy has students all over the world, and which academy doesn't want to hire someone from Shrek Academy as a teacher? Senior Li gave me a list. It has the names of our seniors from Shrek Academy who are in several cities we are going to visit, along with their contact information. With these, we can contact them in advance, and then have a proper reason to seek them out for sparring."  "This works too…" Gu Yue stared at him in shock.  Xu Xiaoyan also said, "Captain, did you already plan to do this before? This is a good idea. Had we known, we should have done this from the start."  Tang Wulin said, "Xiaoyan, your martial soul should have mutated just now, right? How does it feel?"  Xu Xiaoyan's expression was a bit weird, "It mutated. I really didn't expect there to be such a huge amount of star power there. At the beginning, I didn't know what was happening, but later I discovered that after the massive star power poured into my body, it quickly integrated with my martial soul, and then my martial soul seemed to grow quickly, it's almost like it awakened."  "If I'm not mistaken, my original martial soul should have been immature, or to say, flawed. That's why there was a different state during the day and at night. Although this flaw would gradually diminish as my cultivation improved, it would always exist and would have even greater effects later on. But this time, after absorbing the star power, it helped me mend these flaws and also purified the impurities in my martial soul, making the martial soul purer."  Tang Wulin said, "Then why do I feel that after you absorbed so much star power, your soul power hasn't increased much?"  Xu Xiaoyan showed a strange expression, "There's a loss for every gain. My martial soul has been repaired, but some things have also been lost. My Starwheel Ice Staff should now be renamed Star Staff. My ice attribute was washed away by the star power. Only the pure Starwheel is left."  Tang Wulin was surprised, "Is that possible? So, all your ice attribute soul skills are gone?"  Xu Xiaoyan nodded.  Gu Yue asked, "After your Star Staff changed, did the soul skills change?"  Xu Xiaoyan smiled, "Of course. Otherwise, it wouldn't be worth it. My martial soul has evolved, so naturally, the soul skills have also evolved. My three soul skills have all changed significantly. Let me show you in the next match. In the future, I will also be like the captain, a strong attack control type."  Tang Wulin gave a thumbs up. He could tell that after the evolution of her martial soul, Xu Xiaoyan seemed much more confident.  "Xinglan, what about you? You seemed to have absorbed some star power too. How does it feel?"  Ye Xinglan smiled slightly, "My martial soul is very compatible with star power, but it's quite stable. So the only thing that increased from absorbing star power is soul power. I'm level 40 now."  Level 40 now!  As soon as these words came out, even Xie Xie and Xu Lizhi in front couldn't help turning their heads.  Xu Lizhi said with joy, "Sister Xinglan, congratulations! You're finally level 40."  Ye Xinglan nodded with a smile.  A level 40 Ye Xinglan only needed to fuse with a new spirit and obtain her fourth soul ring to officially enter the Soul Ancestor realm.  She was also the first among the six team members to reach the level 40 threshold.  With Ye Xinglan's talent and the power of the Star God Sword, once she reached level 40, her overall strength would certainly not be much weaker than Yuanen Yehui.  Tang Wulin said to Xie Xie, "Don't rush to get on the highway yet, let's find a place to buy a soul communicator."  The only purpose of buying a soul communicator was to say, "Hello, are you Senior Zhang who graduated from Shrek Academy? We are from Shrek Academy..."  As Tang Wulin said, Shrek Academy had students all over the world, and they took great care of their juniors from the same academy.  Moreover, having outstanding students from Shrek Academy come for exchange and sparring was a good thing for these academies.  In the following days, their journey went smoothly, and they had two exchanges every day. They successfully completed the ninth assessment content.  Just one more time, and they could pass this term's final exam and also return to the academy.  "Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy doesn't have our seniors there? Aren't they also ranked among the top academies on the continent? Why is that?" Xu Xiaoyan asked curiously.  Tang Wulin said, "I heard from the senior at the previous academy that Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy was once destroyed, and this destruction had a direct relation with our academy. They have been hostile towards our academy ever since. So, Sun-Moon Royal Academy is the only one that doesn't want to hire teachers from Shrek Academy. Of course, our seniors also don't want to teach here. Although it's not as good as our academy, Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy's hostility towards us has never diminished."  Xie Xie said, "Then should we still choose this place? I've heard of Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, and the elites they cultivate are also quite formidable. Many high-ranking officials of the Federation come from this academy. Shall we switch to another one?"  Tang Wulin smiled faintly, with a flash of light in his eyes, "What's the purpose of our final exam? The academy took away all our things and sent us alone to undergo this final exam as a trial. We are not just to complete the exam but also to really gain something from it. Don't you have confidence?"  Xie Xie's eyes became resolute, and he gave Tang Wulin a thumbs up.  Xu Xiaoyan was eager to try, "In the previous few matches, I haven't even performed yet."  Ye Xinglan calmly said, "Yes, I haven't performed yet."  Gu Yue glanced at Tang Wulin, "This is the last match, right?"  Tang Wulin looked at her, and a smile appeared on his face.  Since it's a sworn enemy, they can only win, not lose.  "Win, and you'll get extra points."  At this moment, a cold voice echoed in the car. The voice appeared very suddenly, startling everyone.  "Wu Teacher?" Tang Wulin exclaimed in surprise. Then he saw Wu Zhangkong outside the window.  Wu Zhangkong seemed to be walking through space, lightly following beside their fast-moving car, and the voice was indeed coming from him.  Tang Wulin twitched the corner of his mouth, "Wu Teacher, can you hear us speaking?"  Wu Zhangkong looked at him through the window and nodded.  "You represent the honor of Shrek. Since you've chosen Sun-Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, you must not fail. I will accompany you there. As the lead teacher."  Having a teacher lead the team for the exchange matches made it much more official.  Tang Wulin tentatively asked, "How many extra points can we get?"  Wu Zhangkong said, "If you win, all six of you will get full marks, plus an extra ten points. That is to say, each of you can give out an extra fifty points to others."  "Deal!" Tang Wulin agreed without hesitation.  If they could get so many points, then his goal would also be achieved.  An extra three hundred points for six people was enough to help many classmates.  Wu Zhangkong said indifferently, "If you lose, then all your previous efforts will be in vain. You will all fail."  "That harsh?" Tang Wulin was stunned.  Wu Zhangkong said, "The grudge between the two academies is more severe than you think. So, if you lose, I will also take responsibility and resign from the academy." Chapter 451: The Ruthless Dance Teacher  It's not just us that he's tough on, the dance teacher is pretty tough on himself too! Tang Wulin began to somewhat regret choosing to go to the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy. The pressure was indeed quite significant!  Bright City! The most modern city on the Douluo Continent, Bright City is situated in the western part of the continent and is the core of the entire West. As soon as they entered the area of Bright City, Tang Wulin and the others saw a scene rarely observed in other cities.  "Is that a flying car? A high-altitude flying car?" Xu Xiaoyan pointed to a flying object in the sky and screamed.  Xie Xie said, "It should be. High-altitude flying cars are still in the experimental stage, and Bright City is the most important technological center of the entire Federation. It seems that the experiment has been very successful!"  The traffic flow ahead gradually became slow. From a distance, they could see that at the highway exit, there were dozens of mechas patrolling around, and it was unclear what they were doing.  Xie Xie suddenly said, "They aren't conducting identity checks, are they?"  As soon as he said this, everyone's heart skipped a beat.  Everyone had their own identity proof, a metal card that recorded their identity information. They all had one. However, before they left the academy, they were all confiscated!  Tang Wulin realized, "The academy made us come to Bright City as our last stop, there must be a purpose in it. This... The tests really are everywhere! No wonder even our identity cards were confiscated."  Xu Lizhi looked back at him, "What do we do?"  If they checked for identity cards and found none, they would certainly be questioned, and what would happen next Tang Wulin did not know! After all, none of them had ever faced such a situation, and they had not encountered it in the cities they had passed through before.  Tang Wulin glanced at the distance to the highway exit ahead and immediately said to Xie Xie, "Xie Xie, pull the car over to the side."  Xie Xie had been driving a lot lately, and his driving skills had clearly improved. He skillfully steered the soul-guided car towards the edge of the highway.  "Abandon the car?" Xie Xie asked, "Is there any chance that Dance Teacher could show our identity proof for us? Wasn't he following us just now?"  While speaking, he also looked outside the window, but he soon realized he was being naive.  There was no sign of Dance Master Long outside the window.  "Forget it, pretend I didn't say anything."  Tang Wulin said to Gu Yue, "In a moment you do this..."  As they drew closer to the highway exit, it was indeed as expected; there was a person responsible for checking the identity cards of the people inside the passing vehicles.  With a flash of silver light, Gu Yue disappeared from the car, and the next moment, she appeared dozens of meters away in the air, her hands forming a circle, and a huge fireball shot out, streaking into the sky.  The fireball was over three meters in diameter and carried a blazing momentum, like a newly risen sun.  As it flew, its size continued to increase, pulling out a dazzling trail of flames.  After the fireball was launched, there was a flash of silver light.  Gu Yue disappeared into thin air.  Whether it was the passing vehicles or those patrolling mechas, they were instantly attracted by the sudden fireball rising into the air. Several mechas quickly took to the sky, searching for Gu Yue's figure. But their attention was more focused on the fireball.  The car quietly pulled over to the side and parked. In the sky, the fireball suddenly exploded, accompanied by roars and blasts, and countless sparks scattered across the sky, like the most spectacular fireworks.  Without considering the attack power, what Gu Yue did was to make the fireball as imposing as possible.  The car door opened, and six people quietly got out.  They didn't leave immediately; in fact, many soul-guided cars had already stopped, and the passengers got out to watch the fireball in the sky.  Tang Wulin glanced at the surroundings and shouted in a low voice, "Go!"  The six people easily jumped over the guardrail and ran wildly towards the distance.  With the cover of buildings, they quickly rushed into a cluster of buildings next to the highway.  The alarm sounded from the direction of the highway at this point.  Tang Wulin, pulling Xu Lizhi, Ye Xinglan leading Xu Xiaoyan, the agile Bao Bao, and Gu Yue's wind element assistance, they all fled like flying.  After a wild run for several kilometers, they boarded a bus heading to Bright City's downtown area, and only then did the six of them calm down.  After all, they were only thirteen or fourteen years old and not easily noticed.  Tang Wulin bought bus tickets and distributed them to his companions, and then he saw a familiar face.  Dance Master Long was sitting in a seat in the back, looking out the window as if he was in cold contemplation.  Tang Wulin walked over to him and sat down with a plop.  "We can go straight to the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy now, right? Let's not search anymore, please take us there."  Dance Master Long glanced at him, "Not bad in reacting."  Tang Wulin chuckled.  But the next words from Dance Master Long froze the smile on his face.  "Aren't you quite stingy? You've lost two cars now, aren't you heartbroken?"  Three black lines slid down his forehead. Of course, he was heartbroken! But what could he do about it?  It was all because of the devilish final exam arranged by the academy.  Dance Master Long ignored him and rested with his eyes closed.  Tang Wulin couldn't help but grumble in his heart. The academy's comprehensive quality training was really tough!  At this moment, with Dance Master Long present, Tang Wulin was not in a hurry. Whenever the dance teacher got off the bus, they would get off too.  After all, Dance Master Long had said that as long as they could defeat the opponents in the exchange match with the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy, they would naturally get full marks for the final exam and even extra points.  The architectural style of Bright City was very different from Shrek City. Shrek City had more of a cultural atmosphere, a combination of classical and modern. Bright City, on the other hand, was a pure high-tech steel forest.  Tall buildings stood one after another, each with its own characteristics, and many buildings looked strange and eye-catching.  Bright City was really big and bustling. The so-called bus took more than an hour, and they only felt like they had entered a steel forest, without knowing where in Bright City they were.  Dance Master Long stood up, got off the bus, and the six hurriedly followed.  The passing pedestrians all seemed to be in a hurry, as if pressed for time.  Dance Master Long walked in one direction, and at a bus stop, they switched to another bus, and everyone hurriedly followed.  After switching buses three times in this manner, Tang Wulin still felt like they were in a steel forest.  In terms of city size, Bright City might not be as big as Shrek City, but in terms of building density and population, it was definitely far beyond Shrek City.  "I don't like it here, it's too rushed and too oppressive," Xu Xiaoyan pouted.  Xie Xie said, "I don't like it either, it looks so busy."  While they were talking, a building in front caught their attention.  There were several huge characters on top of the building: Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy.  It looked like a metallic building, and below, the group of buildings spread outwards, connecting to three other buildings, forming a complex.  Is this a school?  Is the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy like this?  What a place of distinct character!  Tang Wulin glanced at Dance Master Long, just about to ask whether they were going straight over or if Dance Master Long was going to propose a contest to the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy through Shrek's official identity. Dance Master Long had already walked over.  Dance Master Long arrived in front of the building, and with a flash of light in his hand, something appeared.  A horn, with a metal box behind it.  This is...  Before they could react, Dance Master Long pressed a button on it, picked it up, and shouted towards the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy's building in front.  "Students of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Master Academy, listen up, the six of us come from Shrek Academy, with an average age of fourteen years old. We challenge your strongest under twenty years old. We have come here just to tell you the gap between you and the strongest academy on the continent." Chapter 452: Does it have to be so ruthless?  The cold voice was like rolling thunder, loud enough for several streets around to hear clearly. What Wu Zhangkong held in his hand was essentially a soul-guided megaphone! After saying these words, he pressed a button, then stuffed the megaphone into Tang Wulin's hands.  "Teacher Wu, does it have to be so ruthless?" Tang Wulin said helplessly.  Wu Zhangkong indifferently said, "Is it that easy to get a perfect score?"  Just as Tang Wulin was about to say something else, the soul-guided megaphone in his hand sounded again, "Students of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, listen up. The six of us are from Shrek Academy, with an average age of fourteen. We challenge your strongest under twenty. We have come here to tell you about the gap between you and the strongest academy on the continent."  What the heck, this thing even has a recording feature...  Then, Wu Zhangkong disappeared...  A cool breeze blew by, carrying a desolate feeling! Teacher Wu, what about leading the team? What about the trust between people!  The soul-guided megaphone sounded for the third time. Xie Xie looked at Tang Wulin, "It seems we have been trapped."  Xu Xiaoyan swallowed and said, "Is this what they call getting more without paying extra? It's indeed not easy to get a perfect score!"  Ye Xinglan pinched her fingers, "Just fight. If it were me, I would have shouted the same."  Xu Lizhi raised his plump hand beside Ye Xinglan, "Support!"  Gu Yue walked up to Tang Wulin, took the soul-guided megaphone, and looked at it, "It seems nothing wrong was said."  Tang Wulin sighed, "I want to give Teacher Wu a nickname, how about 'Pit King'?"  He finally found the switch on the soul-guided megaphone and turned off the megaphone that had already shouted four times.  In just these few minutes, they were already surrounded by onlookers.  There were students and staff from the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, as well as passersby.  A middle-aged man with blond hair came out of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy building. Seeing Tang Wulin turning off the megaphone, his expression had already become extremely gloomy.  "Shrek Academy?" The middle-aged man walked up to Tang Wulin and the others, asking with a somber expression.  Tang Wulin put the megaphone into the ring given to him by his master and said, "We come from the first grade class of the outer court of Shrek Academy."  "You want to challenge us, right? Very well. Follow me." After saying these words, the middle-aged man suddenly emanated a strong aura.  The aura was sharp, shooting straight into the sky, giving the surrounding onlookers a feeling as if their bodies were about to be split apart.  Everyone was shocked.  "Disperse, if you want to see the results, wait a moment, it will be broadcasted on the big screen."  After saying this, the middle-aged man suddenly retracted his aura and turned to walk inside.  Is it that easy? Tang Wulin looked at his companions, feeling a chill in his heart.  From the aura emitted by the other party, it was not difficult to see that this person had strength they could not contend with, and he might be on the same level as Teacher Wu.  The Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy has a prestigious reputation on the continent, second only to that level of Shrek Academy.  Just as Wu Zhangkong said, it's not easy to get a perfect score!  But no matter what, they had no way out now but to move forward bravely.  The pressure suddenly increased a bit, as they represented not only themselves but also Shrek.  At the street corner, Wu Zhangkong stood quietly, watching Tang Wulin and the six of them follow the staff member of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy inside, his expression still cold, but with a slight smile at the corner of his mouth.  This competition is the real tempering for them.  Entering the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, the first feeling Tang Wulin had was like walking into a modern factory.  Everything was filled with a metallic texture, and a giant metal ball quietly rotated in the center of the hall, obviously containing surging soul-guided energy, with a core array inside.  It emitted a faint light, making the whole hall's light bright and soft.  The reception desk looked more like that of a large company rather than an academy.  The white metallic reception desk had faint cloud patterns fluctuating, what was this? Clearly, it was a rare metal! Truly extravagant.  It's a pity I didn't bring my forging hammer, otherwise, Tang Wulin really felt the urge to refine it.  The middle-aged man didn't speak, just walked ahead, leading Tang Wulin and the six of them forward.  Passing by the reception, two beautiful receptionists stood up and respectfully saluted him.  There were quite a few people in the hall at this time, of various ages, many wearing the same clothes, white uniforms, which were clearly the students of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy.  Most of them looked at Tang Wulin and the six with curiosity, and in addition to curiosity, there was also rejection and malice.  The Shrek Academy, which is welcomed everywhere else, seems to be a big enemy here.  It seems that the students here have all been brainwashed.  Tang Wulin criticized in his heart and also silently observed the surroundings.  He could only hope that the upcoming competition would be a fair one, otherwise, if they specifically wanted to trap them, with the foundation of such an academy, it would be no problem at all.  The spacious elevator was also white metal; white seemed to be the color of honor here.  The elevator went up, fast and steady, without too much of an impact.  The middle-aged man always remained silent, and Tang Wulin and the six of them could only communicate with each other through eye contact.  They all seemed very calm.  The elevator stopped on the sixteenth floor, and the middle-aged man was the first to walk out, with Tang Wulin and the others following.  They came all the way to a place like a conference room, "Sit." The middle-aged man even omitted a word of politeness.  Tang Wulin was also mentally prepared, since they were here to smash the place, they had to be ready.  It would be strange if the other party's attitude was good, Teacher Wu, you really are the Pit King!  "Here to challenge us, right?" The middle-aged man seemed to want to confirm again, speaking to Tang Wulin.  Tang Wulin nodded, "A friendly competition."  The middle-aged man said, "Okay. In a moment, we will provide you with a space and choose opponents for you. Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy will not take advantage of your age, state your ages."  Tang Wulin felt a little relieved inside, secretly calling it a relief, if it's people of the same age, they really were not afraid of anyone.  "We average fourteen years old," Tang Wulin said.  The middle-aged man narrowed his eyes slightly, "Very good, we will send out students who are no older than fifteen. Their age is basically the same as yours. But there are two things I want to inform you in advance. First, this competition will be watched by our entire academy. Second, this competition will be broadcast on all the big screens in Mingdu City."  Tang Wulin felt solemn, "Isn't it just a private competition? Isn't it a bit too grand?" he asked tentatively.  The middle-aged man indifferently said, "It's needed! If you win, it will be an encouragement to all the students of our academy. If you lose, we can severely slap Shrek's face, so, it's needed."  Such a big grudge! So ruthless.  Tang Wulin now truly understood why Wu Zhangkong would use this method to let them issue a challenge. It seems the conflict between the two academies is much more intense than they imagined.  But things have already reached this point, they have no way out, and this will be a competition that they cannot afford to lose.  "Alright!" Tang Wulin's reply was just one word.  "Wait here." The middle-aged man stood up and left, leaving only Tang Wulin and the six of them in the conference room.  Just as Gu Yue was about to speak, she was stopped by Tang Wulin's raised hand, "Everyone adjust your state and prepare for the upcoming competition." This is their place, who knows if there are listening devices, talking too much can lead to problems.  Don't say anything, just fight and leave.  Gu Yue immediately understood his meaning, and all six sat cross-legged on the chairs, meditating, adjusting their states.  What they didn't know was that because of their arrival, the entire Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had already started to take action.  For the upcoming competition, within a short hour, various promotions had already spread throughout Mingdu, and even the entire Federation.  The Sun Moon Television, which spans all the cities of the Federation, announced that it would broadcast the competition half an hour after Tang Wulin and the others arrived.  And they named this competition, The Young Peak Battle of the Soul Master World.  On the street corner, Wu Zhangkong watched the big screen on the building in front of him, listening to the same voice echoing down street after street, his eyes slightly narrowed.  At this moment, his soul communicator rang.  "What's the situation?" Shen Yi's voice full of surprise came through.  Wu Zhangkong indifferently said, "Nothing much, those kids came to challenge the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, and I added fuel to the fire." Chapter 453: Showing Off to Us  Shen Yi said in a deep voice, "This is a big deal! Senior brother, why didn't you mention it earlier? The academy will be quite passive. The Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy has been promoting the event with great intensity. Now the entire Mingdu and the nearby cities already know about it, and the whole alliance has also received messages from various sources. If we lose this match, it will be a huge blow to the reputation of the academy. Have you considered all these?"  Wu Zhangkong replied, "I understand my disciples, that's why I made this decision. The greater the pressure, the better it can stimulate their potential. If they lose, I will take the blame and resign. But if they win, I believe that in the future, they will have the qualifications to challenge the title of this generation's Shrek Seven Monsters. I trust them to uphold the academy's reputation with everything they have, and I have confidence in my students."  Shen Yi was silent for a moment, "Alright, I'll ask about the academy's attitude first. I'll get back to you later."  Five minutes later, the soul communicator rang again.  "Cai Lao said that you should let go and do it. Winning or losing doesn't matter, no matter the outcome, you have to bring the kids back safely. They are the hope for the future. Moreover, Cai Lao also said..."  "Said what?" Wu Zhangkong asked, slightly surprised.  Shen Yi said, "Cai Lao said that she would prefer to see Tang Wulin and the others lose this match. Sometimes, losing isn't necessarily a bad thing."  Wu Zhangkong said decisively, "Failure is the mother of success, that’s true, but only by continuously achieving victories and building up one's momentum can one truly reach the pinnacle of success. I believe that they will definitely win this match."  Shen Yi said, "Alright, the academy will also make arrangements. Just take good care of them."  Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy conference room.  Tang Wulin opened his eyes and glanced at the clock on the wall, frowning slightly. It had been two hours since the people from Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had informed them about the match. Were they deliberately leaving them hanging here?  Through meditation, his condition had already reached its peak. Just as Wu Zhangkong had said, because of the pressure he was feeling, Tang Wulin's mental state was actually at its best, feeling as if he had endless energy.  The others also ended their meditation one after another.  "Still no movement? Should we go out and have a look?" Xie Xie asked Tang Wulin.  Tang Wulin said, "Let's wait a bit longer. Since they called us here, I think they won't just leave us here. It might be that they need some preparation work, or they are selecting opponents for us. Let's just wait and see."  As they were talking, the door of the conference room opened, and the middle-aged man from before entered again.  "The match is ready and will be held in our academy's Grand Spirit Arena. Do you need any more preparation?"  Tang Wulin replied, "We are also ready."  "Then follow me," said the middle-aged man, who, from beginning to end, had no intention of introducing himself or asking for Tang Wulin and his companions' names, and turned around to leave.  Following him, they took the elevator again, this time directly to the thirty-sixth floor, where they switched to another elevator. The elevator seemed to move horizontally and then descended. After sitting for two full minutes, the elevator finally stopped.  When the elevator doors opened, the previous metal texture suddenly disappeared. What appeared before their eyes was a stone space, with everything around constructed of stone, looking quite ancient. However, within these ancient stones, there seemed to be very strange energy fluctuations. Entering it, Tang Wulin felt a boiling sensation in his soul power.  The others had similar feelings, as if there was something here that allowed them to manipulate their own soul power more effectively.  The middle-aged man said nothing, just walked ahead.  This stone space was very spacious. Soon, they arrived at a hall about five hundred square meters in size. The surroundings were all stone, and the top was adorned with magnificent murals.  Tang Wulin looked up and saw that the mural seemed to tell a story. A young man was sitting in a square, surrounded by people, all wearing the uniform of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, but there were some differences compared to the current uniform, looking more ancient. However, the youth sitting in the center was wearing the uniform of Shrek Academy.  Who was this...? Tang Wulin felt somewhat familiar with the figure of the Shrek Academy youth in the mural.  On one side of the stone hall, there was a pair of giant doors forming a huge archway over fifteen meters high and thirty meters wide, easily allowing a mecha to pass through.  "This is the waiting area of the Grand Spirit Arena. You will be notified when it's time to enter the arena for the match," the middle-aged man pointed to the stone benches on the side, indicating that they could wait there.  Just the waiting area was this big? Tang Wulin had initially thought this was where they were going to compete.  He could vaguely hear some noisy sounds from outside. Although not clear, he was certain that the sound was real. This match was increasingly giving him a sense of oppression.  Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy must have made thorough preparations in the past two-plus hours.  The middle-aged man walked toward a side door and left. Just then, the originally faint noise suddenly erupted. The roaring sound startled Tang Wulin and the others.  A rousing voice echoed, "Shrek Academy has come to challenge us, can we tolerate this? Students of Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, let us unite and cheer for our contestants. We will make the people from Shrek leave in disgrace. We will announce to the continent that we are the strongest academy on the continent."  Is this... the sound from the competition site?  Amidst these inflammatory words, the roaring sound crazily erupted. Shouts of support and curses were interspersed.  "Are they showing off to us?" Gu Yue narrowed her eyes.  Tang Wulin said, "They probably want to put some pressure on us. Everyone, relax."  Xie Xie rolled his eyes, "What is pressure? How much does it cost per pound?"  Xu Xiaoyan was excited and eager to try, "It seems there are a lot of people out there. To show my evolved martial spirit in front of so many people, do you think I have a chance to enter the inner court too?"  Ye Xinglan said indifferently, "My Star God Sword is already longing for battle!"  Xie Xie burst into laughter, "Longing for battle doesn't seem like a phrase girls should use, right?"  "Do you want to die?" two voices said simultaneously.  Apart from Ye Xinglan, the other was from Xu Lizhi, and then a big meat bun was stuffed into Xie Xie's mouth, silencing him.  Xie Xie dodged behind Tang Wulin, removing the bun and said with a scared face, "Captain, I'm so scared."  Tang Wulin rolled his eyes, "Your acting skills are too poor. Xinglan, I don't know him. If you want to beat him up, I can help you hold him down."  Ye Xinglan snorted, "I'll take note of that, we'll talk about it when we get back. Wulin, arrange the tactics."  Tang Wulin's eyes flashed, and he nodded. Gu Yue raised her hands, and a ring of icy blue light rose under her feet, gradually forming an ice shield that enveloped the six of them.  It could isolate everything from the outside world, including sound. It was a completely enclosed space.  Ten minutes later.  "The match is about to start; please prepare to enter the arena," a cold voice came.  The ice shield did not shatter but quietly melted from the top, and the melted water elements evaporated into the air.  Watching the gradually disappearing ice shield, the middle-aged man's eyes flickered slightly. This control was very strong!  Ahead, the two giant doors of the archway slowly opened, and the noise that had already been loud became even stronger, and a fervent atmosphere rushed towards them.  Beyond the archway, the world was very bright, somewhat blinding.  The middle-aged man was the first to walk toward the gate. Chapter 454: Entering the Arena  Tang Wulin walked with his head high and stride bold, leading the way at the front. Behind him followed Gu Yue, Ye Xinglan, Xie Xie, Xu Xiaoyan, and Xu Lizhi, five people in total. They all puffed up their chests, for from this moment on, they were not representing themselves, nor were they completing their final exams. They were fighting for the glory of Shrek!  Only upon truly entering the grand Soul Fighting Arena could one feel its magnificent scale. Even Shrek Academy did not have a building of this size. It was a place constructed in complete imitation of an ancient colosseum, with a huge square that was over one thousand five hundred meters in diameter. The surrounding stands could accommodate more than one hundred and fifty thousand people at the same time.  Tang Wulin dared to say that this was probably the largest stadium on the entire continent. This should be the central area surrounded by the high-rise buildings of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy. At this time, the stands were not to say completely full, but at least sixty to seventy percent of the seats were occupied. These people could not all be from the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy; an academy with ten thousand people would already be quite impressive. But so many people were seated, it was unknown where they had come from.  From the main platform in the center, Tang Wulin could vaguely sense several auras as heavy as mountains, all their attention was on the six people who had just walked out. The moment Tang Wulin and his group entered the grand Soul Fighting Arena, the originally noisy stands suddenly quieted down, and in an instant, over a hundred thousand pairs of eyes all fell on the six of them. Even though they were in a good mental state, facing such a scale of scrutiny, the pressure they felt was enormous for a moment.  Xu Xiaoyan and Xu Lizhi were faring the worst, their complexions having turned slightly pale. It must be known that almost all the spectators present bore hostility towards them. Each person had a different aura, and when these auras came together and bore down on them, it would have a considerable impact on their mental strength and mindset. The scene was more difficult than they had previously assessed.  Tang Wulin took a deep breath, suddenly stepped forward with his right foot, and a ring of golden light rose from under his foot. The halo burst with radiance, and instantly, with his body as the center, a strong surge of blood essence suddenly erupted. His entire body suddenly grew a bit taller, and that strong blood essence spread outwards. Although invisible, it enveloped all his companions within it.  Feeling the surging and rolling blood essence emitted from Tang Wulin, the other five people felt the pressure lighten. The noise from the outside seemed to fade, and more importantly, under the protection of Tang Wulin's blood essence which seemed to be burning, their previously suppressed momentum rose again.  On the main platform.  The old man sitting in the center frowned slightly, "Golden soul ring?"  "Rare. Could it be a million-year soul ring? Impossible! Even the Spirit Pagoda doesn't have million-year soul beasts. In the historical records, there have only been one or two occurrences of million-year soul beasts."  The middle-aged man sitting next to the old man frowned deeply. "But those one or two times, they were all related to Shrek Academy. Keep a close watch," the old man said in a deep voice.  "Yes!"  Seeing the golden soul ring released from his body and his suddenly taller stature, the pressure coming from the spectator seats decreased a bit, but soon, the cursing voices that had paused earlier escalated exponentially.  Tang Wulin did not look at the stands at all, walking with his head high towards the center of the grand Soul Fighting Arena. At this moment, he had already seen six people standing there in the center of the great Soul Fighting Arena. They were all dressed in the white uniforms of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, and it seemed that they were indeed about the same age as his own team.  Apart from the six people, there was also a middle-aged man floating in the air. He looked to be in his forties, covered in a layer of armor – soul armor. Judging by the magnificent degree of his soul armor, it was actually a three-word battle armor. Is he the referee? Or is he deliberately here to put pressure on us?  It was their first time facing such a grand scale scene. It was impossible not to be nervous, but Tang Wulin was just that sort of person; the greater the pressure, the more intensely his potential was stimulated. Just like his companions often said, this guy was like a spring: the harder you press it, the harder it bounces back.  Walking with his head high, he approached the opponents and lined up with his six people.  They were not wearing the uniforms of Shrek Academy; the uniforms had been taken away. Instead, they wore dark green sportswear, representing the vibrant dark green of Shrek Academy.  "Now, the competition rules will be announced," the middle-aged man floating in the air said in a deep voice.  "What?" Tang Wulin gestured that he couldn't hear clearly.  "I said the competition rules will be announced now!" The middle-aged man's voice included a bit of soul power.  "What are you saying? I can't hear you clearly! It's too noisy here," Tang Wulin asked innocently.  The middle-aged man's face darkened, "Are you here to compete?"  "I can't hear, what are you saying? There are so many flies here. I really can't hear. Can you spray some insecticide first to quiet down the flies?" Although Tang Wulin said he couldn't hear, his voice was very loud. With the infusion of soul power, his voice was not only spread throughout the entire arena but at least the venue's sound system could record and broadcast his voice.  "Raise the protective shield," the middle-aged man ordered with a stern face.  A layer of white transparent shield slowly rose from all around, looking almost solid, and after rising, it converged together in the air at a height of a hundred meters. The protective shield also had a soundproofing effect, and suddenly, the world became quiet.  "Can you hear clearly now?" the middle-aged man asked Tang Wulin coldly.  Tang Wulin nodded, tilted his head, and pinched a paper ball out of each ear, smiling, "The world is quiet."  Not just him, but Gu Yue, Ye Xinglan, and the others also took out paper balls from their ears.  The middle-aged man's facial muscles twitched visibly. If it were not for the fact that he was under the watchful eyes of the public, he really wanted to rush down and beat them. This match was not only visible to so many people on the spot but was also being broadcast to the soul guide TV stations across the continent as much as possible. The purpose was to hype up this match. All the preparations made earlier were to pressure these students from Shrek. After all, with an average age of just fourteen, no matter how strong they were, their youthful nature could not be changed. As long as they were intimidated, the possibility of winning for his side would increase a bit.  However, what he did not expect was that they would encounter Tang Wulin, who did not play by the rules. Just this act of pulling out paper balls had caused a stir in the audience, with curses coming from all directions. Unfortunately, with the protective shield's soundproofing, Tang Wulin and his team inside could not hear any of it.  However, for those watching the match through the soul guide TV without bias or who were leaning towards Shrek Academy, they could not help but laugh out loud. Shrek Academy really did cultivate a few treasures.  "Now, the competition rules will be announced," the middle-aged man said sternly.  "Okay, go ahead," Tang Wulin said obediently this time.  The middle-aged man said, "This match is primarily for sparring, but in order for both sides to truly display their abilities, only when facing the threat of severe injury, disability, or death will I, as the referee, terminate the match. Or eliminate some people from the match. The final victory depends on which side still has people capable of fighting after the other side is completely defeated. Did everyone understand?"  Tang Wulin said, "So you mean, aside from not being able to kill them, anything goes, and there are no other restrictions, right?"  As soon as these words came out, the six people opposite all glared at him.  But due to the majesty of the person in the air, they dared not make a sound.  "You can understand it that way," the middle-aged man said indifferently, with a flash of cold light in his eyes. Chapter 455: No Joking Around Anymore  Tang Wulin said, "Can I say a few words before we start fighting?"  The middle-aged man said, "Go ahead." In front of so many spectators, it would seem very ungracious not to let Tang Wulin speak.  Tang Wulin said, "First of all, although we are students from Shrek Academy, we came here this time solely because we have long admired the strength of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, and specifically came to challenge it. However, since we have only enrolled in Shrek Academy for one term, we really can't represent our academy. So, we are here to compete on our own behalf, and I want to make that clear. We are the worst of Shrek Academy and cannot represent it."  "What?" The middle-aged man was greatly surprised. Neither he nor the high-level officials of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy expected this youngster to say such a thing! They had been busily preparing for the past few hours, aiming to make the most impressive showing possible. They were very confident about this competition. Winning would greatly enhance the prestige of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy; on the other hand, it would be a huge blow to Shrek Academy.  But now, with Tang Wulin’s words, he placed himself and his five companions at the very bottom of Shrek Academy, and he said they were not representing the academy in the competition. Wouldn't this mean that even if the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy won, it wouldn't have the expected effect? And if they lost, where would they put their face?  Looking at Tang Wulin’s innocent smiling face, the middle-aged man in the air could hardly contain himself. He controlled his body and descended from the sky, landing in front of Tang Wulin.  "Weren't you the ones who said you came to exchange pointers and challenge our academy on behalf of Shrek Academy?" the middle-aged man said angrily.  Tang Wulin sighed, a flash of light appeared in his hand, and he took out the soul amplifier he had used earlier, then pressed the button.  Wu Zhangkong's cold voice echoed throughout the competition venue, "Students of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, listen. The six of us come from Shrek Academy, with an average age of fourteen, challenging your strongest under the age of twenty. We came here this time just to tell you the gap between you and the strongest academy on the continent."  "These words don't say anywhere that we are representing Shrek Academy in the competition! It only says that we are from Shrek Academy, with an average age of fourteen. Then we want to challenge you. To show you the gap with our academy. But we represent ourselves!"  The middle-aged man was so angry that he almost spit out a mouthful of blood. We’ve prepared so much, and you say this? This is simply...  But these little guys are only fourteen years old! Can a fourteen-year-old child come up with such a shameless strategy?  Although they had been opponents of Shrek Academy for countless years, in the heart of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, the power and authority of Shrek were unquestionable.  So when Tang Wulin and his companions appeared, they didn't think twice and prepared to face them with the strongest lineup, while also wanting to strike at the reputation of Shrek Academy to the greatest extent.  But they didn't expect that this fully-powered punch would hit cotton.  The middle-aged man really wanted to ask, since when did Shrek Academy become so shameless?  But he couldn't really say that! Insulting Shrek Academy, he still didn't dare to do it.  Tang Wulin blinked, "Are we still fighting? If you admit defeat, we don't have to fight."  The light flowed on the middle-aged man’s battle armor, with an aura that seemed like it could erupt at any moment like an active volcano.  This was a three-word battle armor, equivalent to the level of a Title Douluo.  To kill Tang Wulin and the others would really be as simple as lifting a hand.  "Alright, alright. No more joking. We are representing Shrek Academy. Long live Shrek, fight for the glory of Shrek! Victory!"  Just as the middle-aged man was about to spit blood, Tang Wulin’s expression suddenly became serious, his voice high and full of momentum as he made the declaration.  The middle-aged man was stunned but also relieved that these little guys didn't continue to be unreasonable. Otherwise, how could he end this? Their Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy couldn't make things difficult for a few children, right?  "The competition is about to begin," he ascended back into the sky.  "Oh, and although we represent the academy, what I just said is also true; we really are the worst few of the academy," Tang Wulin emphasized deliberately.  The middle-aged man's figure in the air wobbled, almost falling from the sky.  Tang Wulin smiled slightly, stepped forward, and said to his opponents, "My name is Tang Wulin, from the first grade, Class One of the Outer Court of Shrek Academy."  This time he didn't say class president; after all, the Outer Court first grade was already the lowest level class.  Don't underestimate what Tang Wulin just said. With his words, the momentum that the entire venue had gathered for the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy had quietly dissolved by more than half, and even the conviction of victory of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy students was affected.  "Long Chen!" The leader of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy was a tall and handsome young man, his whole body seemingly radiating light, looking about fourteen or fifteen years old, but already tall enough to compare with adults.  When Tang Wulin said those words earlier, he was the only one among the six from the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy who did not show any change in expression, young but as stable as a mountain.  Tang Wulin said, "Looking at how tall you are, you're not over twenty years old, right? If you're overage, it doesn't count even if you win."  Long Chen glanced at him coldly, "I hope your strength is as good as your mouth."  Gu Yue stood by Tang Wulin's side, "Gu Yue from the first grade, Class One of the Outer Court of Shrek Academy!"  The opponent stepped forward to Long Chen's side, also female, "Xueliu Shuang!"  This girl was extremely beautiful, with a slender figure, standing beside Long Chen, indeed quite a match.  In terms of appearance and figure, Tang Wulin was even better than Long Chen, only not as tall.  Xueliu Shuang did not look at Gu Yue but focused on Tang Wulin, seemingly very interested in him.  "Ye Xinglan." Ye Xinglan walked to the other side of Tang Wulin.  The third member of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy stepped forward, "Yu Dingqi!" This was a youth with a sturdy frame, broad shoulders, and powerful arms, clearly one who excelled in strength.   "Xie Xie!"  "Xu Xiaoyan!"  "Xu Lizhi!"  The remaining three from Shrek Academy stepped forward simultaneously.  The other three from the opposing side also followed suit.  "Jian Mochen!" This was a plump boy with a figure that could compete with Xu Lizhi.  "Kuang Zhan Tian!" A fierce and domineering girl!  Yes, this was a girl, with such a name. It could be considered quite unique.  When Tang Wulin heard this petite but fierce-looking girl's name, he almost told her that someone like her should come to Shrek Academy! Definitely a monster.  "Weng Daimin!" The last one was a girl with a gentle and weak appearance, with short blue hair that looked very pure.  Six against six.  But unlike the competitions they had previously gone to other academies for, this time, neither side took the initiative to declare what type of soul master they were.  Instead, they just said their names.  "Both sides, retreat and prepare for the competition. Retreat to a distance of one hundred meters," said the middle-aged man floating in the air, having regained his composure.  No matter what, as long as they won this competition, there were still many angles to work with.  At that time, even if Tang Wulin and the others did not admit to representing the academy, it would already be too late. After all, they were students currently studying at Shrek Academy.  Both sides slowly retreated, and the casual expressions on Tang Wulin's face had already quietly disappeared. This time, the opponents seemed to be about the same age as them. Each one emitted a different aura, and being in their own territory, they would definitely not be easy to deal with.  They had to be careful and cautious.  During the retreat, the six of them had already formed a triangular battle formation.  On the other side, the six from the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy also displayed their formation.  Long Chen stood prominently at the forefront, flanked by the short and stout Yu Dingqi and the rotund Jian Mochen.  Could it be that they were agility-type soul masters?  Behind them were Xueliu Shuang, Weng Daimin, and Kuang Zhan Tian, lined up in a row.  Weng Daimin was in the center.  From this formation, it could be seen that Weng Daimin should be a control-type soul master.  As for Xueliu Shuang and Kuang Zhan Tian, it was somewhat unclear.  The distance of one hundred meters was quickly enough for both sides to retreat, and they fixed their gaze on their opponents.  "The competition, begins!" Chapter 456: The Battle Begins  With a loud shout from the middle-aged man, the confrontation representing the two major academies, which was also the last match of Tang Wulin and his six companions' final exams, finally started.  This time, Tang Wulin didn't rush out immediately but released his martial soul together with his companions. A large number of purple soul rings rose up, with Tang Wulin's own three rings, three circles of purple soul rings flickering. Not many, but quite impressive for their age.  The six from the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy also released their martial souls. Long Chen stepped forward, the sound of dragon chanting followed, and then he grew three inches taller, with four soul rings rising from underneath his feet. Four purples! Yes, all four of his soul rings were purple. This was somewhat beyond Tang Wulin's expectations. Such cultivation could already be comparable to Wu Siduo. Long Chen, a name that seems to really exist on the list of young geniuses. It seems to be a bit lower than Wu Siduo? Keep in mind, Wu Siduo has a twin martial soul, and she also has a martial soul fusion skill. The person in front of him seems to have only one martial soul. To be ranked close to Wu Siduo with a single martial soul shows his strength. He must be the ace of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy in this age group.  By Long Chen's side, Jian Mochen and You Dingqi also released their martial souls. You Dingqi's martial soul was a hammer, not an ordinary hammer, a short hammer handle connected to a long chain wrapped around his arm, a meteor hammer. Three rings, three circles of purple soul rings. Indeed extraordinary. But still not four rings.  As for Jian Mochen, two yellow, two purple, four rings! His martial soul turned out to be a shield, a round shield with complex patterns on it. Faintly, it seemed to be the shape of a tiger head. A defense-type soul master! The shield was so large that it could completely cover his stout body behind it.  Among the three women behind them, Xue Liushuang, a four-ring soul master, all purple soul rings. Weng Daimin, three purple soul rings. Kuang Zhan Tian, three purple soul rings. Good fellow, among the six, there were three four-ring soul masters! This lineup was enough to compare with the young genius list in our class, right?  Tang Wulin silently praised in his heart, and while admiring, he felt that was probably it. The six people chosen by the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy were indeed excellent, but Tang Wulin believed that if they faced Wu Siduo's five, it was a bit hard to say who would win. And they had defeated Wu Siduo and her team.  The students of this generation of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy were indeed strong, but unfortunately, they might not know much about Shrek Academy. The outer court first-year students of this generation's Shrek Academy could only be described as stunningly brilliant.  What Tang Wulin didn't know was that after Shrek Academy had completed its admissions, the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy did get some information. They also knew that five of the young geniuses on the list had become freshmen of Shrek Academy. But that was about it.  While Tang Wulin and his companions were waiting just now, in fact, the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy was also conducting investigations. Among their six people, not one was on the list of young geniuses. So it was natural for them to believe in certain victory.  Long Chen stepped on the ground with his left foot, and his body suddenly soared up, charging towards Tang Wulin and his companions. The light of his second soul ring flickered, and a sonorous dragon chant followed. The second soul skill, Dragon's Chant! Rolling sound waves, like substance, emerged around his body, with faint golden figures appearing, vaguely in the shape of a giant dragon. A strong aura of light erupted.  His martial soul, the Light Holy Dragon. The ace among the aces of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy! Recognized as the most hopeful to become a four-word battle armor master among the younger generation, here, he was absolutely the favored son of heaven.  When Long Chen saw that among the six from Shrek Academy, not even one had four rings, he already recognized the truth in Tang Wulin's own words of being the worst. Long Chen was very clear that the match was being broadcasted live at the scene, and countless people were watching. This was a great opportunity for him to make a name for himself! To step on the Shrek Academy students and establish his position in the soul master world was absolutely perfect.  "Hehe!" Tang Wulin laughed, and not just him, his companions laughed as well. Tang Wulin waved his hand, signaling everyone not to follow, and he lightly touched the ground with the tip of his foot. It didn't look as domineering as Long Chen, just an ordinary speed heading forward.  Tang Wulin's three purple soul rings retracted, and the golden light rings that had once shocked the audience reappeared, with golden scales slowly emerging. "Roar!" Long Chen's Dragon's Chant became even louder. One-on-one, your three rings against my four rings, and my martial soul is the Light Holy Dragon.  Good! Long Chen was overjoyed in his heart, intending to crush the leader of the opposing side first, which would definitely be the best moment to perform. Both sides were getting closer, and suddenly Long Chen felt something was wrong; his opponent didn't seem to be affected by his Dragon's Chant. His eyes were very bright, and the look in his eyes was a bit off—was that pity?  What are you pitying! The distance of a hundred meters came in an instant, and Tang Wulin also soared into the air. As he rose, the golden soul rings on his body bloomed. Blood reversed, and the mighty aura of the Golden Dragon King erupted from the center of his body.  Long Chen stepped on the ground with his left foot, rushing into the sky, his arms spread, the first soul ring flickered, Dragon's Claw! He didn't underestimate Tang Wulin at all. Being the number one young talent of the Sun Moon Royal Soul Master Academy, he was stable and solid, never underestimating his opponents no matter when. He knew he should be able to suppress the opponent, but he still gave it his all. So, while the first soul ring shone, the fourth soul ring also flickered. The dual rings shone simultaneously, a high-level soul master technique for controlling soul rings.  The fourth soul skill, Dragon's Force! The bloodline of the Light Holy Dragon within him erupted with powerful strength that suffused his entire body, a pair of dragon claws shone with dazzling golden light, and a layer of fine scales appeared on the surface of his body, although not real dragon scales, they already had some form.  He wanted to give his opponent a one-hit kill, directly crush Tang Wulin, and with their momentum greatly boosted, then crush other students from Shrek Academy. By then, even if the other side said he wasn't the strongest from Shrek Academy, they were still students of Shrek Academy! With such a defeat, what else is there to say?  At this moment, Tang Wulin's aura erupted. When the auras of both sides were sure to touch each other first. In that instant, Long Chen felt an indescribable fear suddenly arise from the deepest part of his heart. How is that possible? How could I feel fear? He was full of doubts, but everything was right in front of him. He felt as if his heart was gripped by something, and all his blood vessels trembled.  In front of him, Tang Wulin, who also soared into the sky, seemed to grow taller and taller, while he seemed to shrink in front of him. The power of Dragon's Claw diminished, and he gritted his teeth to drive his soul power, trying to control his trembling. But contrary to his wishes, Tang Wulin's aura was too strong, so much so that Dragon's Force directly collapsed. Dragon's Force was to enhance the aura of his Light Holy Dragon bloodline.  But at this time, the bloodline aura was directly suppressed, and even the effect of the soul skill was forced back. This was the gap between bloodlines, and also where Tang Wulin's Golden Dragon King bloodline was powerful.
