Chapter 449: "The Neighbor's Dog"  After carefully inspecting the house and determining there were no major issues, the decision was pretty much made. Nanfeng would talk with the real estate agent and the previous homeowner about the remaining matters.  Coily, the dog, was in an exceptionally good mood today, frolicking and enjoying itself thoroughly. Seeing this, Nanfeng laughed and said, "Coily, don't worry. Next time we come, you can move in directly and play as long as you want every day. You can swim in the sea and play with the little fish and shrimp too~"  After swimming in the sea and being called back to shore by Fang Zhao, Coily dug in the sand for a while. When it was time to leave, its doggy eyes kept staring out the car window, full of reluctance.  Coily was happy, lying in the car and starting to fantasize about its future happy life.  What impression does Coily have of the ocean? The impression is like enjoying a seafood buffet without having to pay.  Its cheerful mood continued all the way back to the dormitory.  After Nanfeng and the others left, Fang Zhao closed the dormitory door and called, "Coily, come here."  Coily rushed over, wagging its tail. "Did you have fun today?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Woof!"  "Is it fun over there?" Fang Zhao asked again.  Coily jumped up and barked again, wagging its tail vigorously. "Speak."  "Fun!" Coily said.  It was now able to switch languages proficiently, speaking clearly and fluently.  "Okay." Fang Zhao nodded and then turned on the learning machine.  Coily: "..."  Its ears twitched, and it discreetly moved a paw back, trying to retreat.  Fang Zhao ignored its retreat, turned on the learning machine, and showed it a newly created folder. Inside were newly purchased e-books:  - "Marine Environmental Protection Law" - "Youth Environmental Protection Knowledge Series" - "List of Protected Marine Wildlife" - "Marine Environmental Management" - "A Hundred Ocean Knowledge Points Every Modern Person Should Know" - "The Ocean, My Home" - ...  All were ocean-related books, twenty in total. There were not only e-books but also twenty sets of corresponding tests.  Coily: "..."  Its perked ears drooped.  "You know you read fast, it should be even faster now, right? After you finish reading the twenty books in the folder and get full marks on all twenty sets of test questions, you can go play in the sea. There are still no more than fifteen days until the move," Fang Zhao said.  For Coily, with its current memory and learning ability, getting full marks was not difficult.  Fang Zhao wasn't worried about Coily's safety in the sea; rather, he was concerned that Coily might eat some endangered animals to extinction.  Fang Zhao still didn't know the full capacity of Coily's stomach. During the "Port Star Record" show, Coily had secretly eaten in the desert and also in the sea. However, due to Fang Zhao's warnings, it had not really let loose and eaten freely.  After all, the stay on Port Star was short, and with Fang Zhao's control, as well as consideration for the other people on Port Star, it couldn't eat too much. But once they moved to the new house, Coily would have the opportunity to go to the sea every day. Without restrictions, it would be like an invasive species disrupting the ecological balance of the marine area with the force of one dog.  Fang Zhao had to make Coily understand some things in advance. It was not easy for marine life to recover to its current state, and it couldn't be destroyed by Coily.  Without getting full marks on the tests, it should not think about going into the sea and instead continue to accompany the learning machine.  That day, Nanfeng came to find Fang Zhao about the renovation of the new residence. As soon as he entered the dormitory, he saw Coily facing the wall, squatting there with its head drooping and tear stains under its doggy eyes.  Pausing for a moment, Nanfeng shifted his gaze away to find Fang Zhao and deal with the pressing matters at hand. As for Coily, this was normal, and Nanfeng was already able to approach the situation calmly.  After discussing the renovation, Nanfeng remembered something he saw that day and said, "By the way, boss, do you know about the stuff on the internet today?"  "What's up?" Fang Zhao had been writing a paper today and had his communications set to not disturb him unless it was important.  There had been many topics about him online lately, and many people were looking for him. Fang Zhao had to set his device to Do Not Disturb mode.  "Do you know about Will's painting?" Nanfeng asked.  "Do you mean the one about Will's graduation work?" Fang Zhao had seen Will's graduation exhibition and knew that it had received an A+ grade. One of the paintings was of Coily, titled "The Neighbor's Dog."  It had been two days since the exhibition, and Fang Zhao had been writing his paper in the dormitory since this morning, so he really didn't know what had happened online.  Nanfeng shared the information he knew with Fang Zhao. It turned out that after Will's graduation exhibition ended, the college displayed his paintings on the school's website, which sparked a lively discussion.  Will had successfully completed his advanced study plan last year—the short-term goal was to paint Fang Zhao, and the ultimate goal was to paint Fang Zhao's dog. The short-term goal had been achieved long ago; Will's "My Neighbor" had previously caused a stir online. Some netizens even joked that Will had painted Fang Zhao to look like an alien.  This time, following "My Neighbor," "The Neighbor's Dog" once again topped the hot search list for the day.  "The Neighbor's Dog" was the painting Will spent the most time on during his advanced studies, the one which he researched the longest and poured the most effort into, and also the work he was most satisfied with.  This painting's style was similar to "My Neighbor," only it appeared more incomprehensible. At least "My Neighbor" could be recognized as a person, whereas "The Neighbor's Dog" was unrecognizable as a dog, much less as a small pet dog. Unless someone saw the title of the painting, no one would think that the image was of a dog.  The colors were vibrant with life, mysterious, and imbued with a grand aura. It seemed too otherworldly, yet one couldn't pinpoint what was incorrect. The more one studied it, the more a sense of trepidation would arise from within.  "Is Fang Zhao's dog that terrifying?" A student from Huangyi, after seeing the painting, recalled the small curly-haired dog encountered on campus. They went online to search for Fang Zhao's dog, confirming their memory.  Those from Huangyi who had experienced Fang Zhao's graduation concert and analyzed Will's painting closely had a different impression. "If I really had to say, the feeling this painting gives me is similar to Fang Zhao's piece 'η.' It's a bit beyond the understanding of ordinary people."  Even laypeople standing in front of this painting, quietly observing for a few seconds, would feel inexplicably powerful and shiver uncontrollably, even if they couldn't understand it.  Online, the discussions were even more intense.  "I've realized that after his advanced studies, Will has completely let loose, his thoughts freely roving, beyond the comprehension of the likes of us."  "What grudge, what grievance! To paint Fang Zhao's dog like this!"  "The friend above definitely hasn't seen Will's previous work. Take a look at how Will painted Fang Zhao in 'My Neighbor.'"  "Maybe Will was bitten by a dog and has a psychological shadow over dogs. Otherwise, he wouldn't paint such a scary picture! A cute little thing was turned into a monster!"  "This is called art!"  "The world of artists is indeed not something we ordinary people can understand."  "Not to praise or criticize, but I stared at the painting for a full five minutes and still couldn't grasp what he's trying to express. Yet, I just feel like it's amazing, and there's this strange feeling in my heart."  "This kind of painting that explores deeper levels requires careful study."  "This painting can't be easy to sell, right?"  "You could buy it to ward off evil spirits."  "It's still worth investing in. I'm optimistic about Will as an artist; he's still young."  After Will's painting was displayed on the school's website, there were people who wanted to buy it. In the end, a collector from Muzhou bought "The Neighbor's Dog" at a high price, far exceeding Huangyi's estimated price.  Some people thought that the Muzhou collector was overly enthusiastic about Coily, and when it came to Coily, people from Muzhou always seemed to lack calmness.  Others thought it was pure hype, not for Will as a person but for Fang Zhao's dog. People from Muzhou are indeed incomprehensible when it comes to dogs, as if they had lost their reason.  Regarding this, Huangzhou TV's Arts and Calligraphy channel specially sent someone to interview the collector who bought the painting at a high price.  During the interview, the Muzhou collector said, "Many people buy Will's paintings, investing only in Will as a person, not in the painting itself. I'm different. I look at the painting and, of course, at the dog in the painting. I have a premonition that this painting will be hyped to sky-high prices in the future."  Seeing the interview live, Little Bear commented, "Muzhou people really have a terrifying intuition about dogs. Humans are indeed strange creatures."  Thus, due to Will's painting "The Neighbor's Dog," Coily also appeared on the hot search and made it to the headlines of Huangzhou's current affairs news.  After Nanfeng left, Fang Zhao flipped through the online news and said to Coily, "You don't need to go out these few days. Stand for five more minutes, then go back to reading. You only scored 62 on this morning's test; take another look at the section on protecting animals! Whales are not for eating! Neither is coral!" Chapter 450 Moving  Mao spent another two days on memorizing ocean conservation animals and plants, using videos and pictures to reinforce his memory. He studied both old and new century creatures, memorizing their appearances and behaviors. To obtain the permission to swim freely in the sea as soon as possible, Mao put in a lot of effort once again. The last time he worked this hard was to earn his own helmet.  Finally, Mao's test scores improved from barely passing to seventy or eighty points, and then to ninety. With one last reinforcement of his memory, he could succeed.  Nan Feng originally thought that Mao would have a small mood due to being restricted from going out because of something online and being scolded. Unexpectedly, Mao became even more spirited day by day, unaffected at all.  The follow-up work at Huangzhou Art Academy was already completed by Fang Zhi, and all the refresher courses had ended. After the other students in the refresher class had also completed their final assessments, the academy held a graduation ceremony for the students who successfully completed the Huang Art Twelve Rites refresher class and issued certificates.  The ceremony at Huang Art's highest academic hall was simple, as most of those who got into the Twelve Rites were no longer ordinary students and were more academically inclined. There was no need for anything fancy.  At the ceremony, Fang Laotaiye, as a family member, sat in the audience, watching Fang Zhi on stage with tears in his eyes. He took many photos and videos, shaking with excitement, and shared them on his Moments and the retirement home chat group.  After the ceremony, Fang Laotaiye hurried to Fang Zhi. "Let me see, let me see."  Carefully receiving the certificate that seemed to glow with gold from Fang Zhi, Fang Laotaiye couldn't stop smiling. He took several high-definition photos before handing the certificate back to Fang Zhi.  "Keep it safe; don't let dogs chew on it. There's an old man in our retirement home whose grandson's dog tore up his newly acquired diploma, and it couldn't even be glued back together," Fang Laotaiye warned, glancing at Mao.  Mao widened his innocent dog eyes as if bearing a great injustice.  Fang Laotaiye turned back to Fang Zhi, "Anyway, make sure you keep it safe."  How many people can get a certificate from the Twelve Rites refresher class each year? It's the most prestigious refresher class in the circle, and those who get in will be masters in the future—what a treasure! At least no one in the Yanbei retirement home has this.  After attending Fang Zhi's graduation ceremony and taking enough photos, Fang Laotaiye was satisfied. They had stayed in Huangzhou for quite some time, and it was time to go back.  Before leaving Huangzhou, Fang Laotaiye looked at his gentle and honest great-grandson and worriedly instructed Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, "You must protect Xiao Zhi's personal safety! I heard there are many crazy fans nowadays, and competitors use underhanded methods. My Xiao Zhi is just too good-tempered and unguarded, unaware of the malice of others."  Yan Biao, Zuo Yu: "......"  Do you remember what happened the year Fang Zhi served? Do you know how he became a reserve officer? Do you know how he dominates in games?!  How thick must the filters on the old gentleman be to say such things, or is it that memory fades with age, selectively forgetting some key events?  But then again, Fang Zhi does seem a lot more gentle now? Could this be the influence of art?  No matter what they thought, Yan Biao and Zuo Yu could only stiffly assure Fang Laotaiye, "Yes, we will definitely protect him!"  After another photo with Fang Zhi, Fang Laotaiye left contentedly, planning to visit again when Fang Zhi moved into his new home and had some free time.  The academic refresher was temporarily concluded, and the students were about to leave the school. However, before that, they would hold an academic conference report at Huang Art, mainly for students. It wasn't a formal and serious academic report, and the student union even set up a live stream for those who couldn't attend.  Fang Zhi didn't hold back; he shared all the experience and techniques he had summarized during the refresher year. The academic report lasted two hours, but the follow-up interaction and signing event went on for four hours. Some even suggested that Fang Zhi should stay at the school, as with his current strength and honors, he was qualified to become a lecturer at Huang Art.  "Ah, it would be great if Fang Zhi could stay at Huang Art permanently," a student sighed.  However, they soon found that although Fang Zhi had left, he still appeared in their exam questions...  ---  After completing a year of refresher studies and leaving Huang Art, Fang Zhi returned to Yanzhou to pack up and move. The weather was nice, and he moved from the city center of Qian Market in Yanzhou to the seaside.  Perhaps sensing the ocean, "Rabbit" was exceptionally lively today, moving around in its tank, with its "ears" always trying to probe outwards.  Fang Zhi had a large aquarium custom-made and transferred "Rabbit" from the portable small tank to the big one. In its new home, "Rabbit" crawled around in the aquarium, looking like a fluffy, moving cotton candy. However, this cotton candy almost stung two burglars to death. It was perfect camouflage. Not only the overly colorful ones are dangerous, but also those that look too cute.  The happiest about moving to the new home was Mao. It had completed the test the day before moving, and early this morning, it was running around, urging Fang Zhi to move. Watching the collection shelf move into the house and seeing that not a single game helmet was missing, Mao wanted to lock its own learning machine on the shelf, but Fang Zhi took it out.  "The learning machine is still needed," Fang Zhi said.  Mao whined in disappointment, walked out with its tail down, but soon perked up again, eager to inspect the new territory. Zuo Yu was on the lead.  Dogs have a strong sense of territory, and marking territory is their nature. The new home had a larger territory, and Mao happily patrolled it, howling a few times to greet the other dogs in the residential area. From today on, it would live here!  By the time Fang Zhi finished tidying up, it was dark. He let Yan Biao and the other two go home and gave them a couple of days off. Once they left, Mao, which was lying at the door, scurried over.  "I want to go swimming in the sea," Mao said.  "Just swimming?" Fang Zhi asked.  "...and also to find food," Mao cautiously watched Fang Zhi's expression. "Hungry."  During the refresher period at Huang Art, Mao was often in a state of hunger, only managing to sneak some food when Fang Zhi took it out. It had been seriously hungry this year.  Fang Zhi had noticed that Mao's appetite had been increasing. Its diet had also expanded. It would now sniff at things it wasn't interested in before, as if judging whether they were edible. Once, it sniffed around in the car for a while, and Nan Feng thought someone had tampered with the car and immediately sent it for inspection. In the end, apart from some unexplained scratches, there was nothing wrong with the car. Later, Fang Zhi asked it, and it said it was hungry at the time and smelled food.  What could be eaten and what could not, Mao knew. Even if it hadn't seen it before, it could distinguish. Before, it hadn't had the opportunity to eat freely, but now that it had moved to a new house, it didn't want to miss the rare chance to eat to its heart's content and didn't want to wait any longer.  Mao had been enduring all day, waiting for Nan Feng and the others to leave before suggesting going out to forage.  Fang Zhi checked the weather forecast, which promised clear skies for the next few days. Since Mao had met the test requirements and quickly and accurately answered several questions, Fang Zhi decided to let it go out.  However, it was easier to be noticed during the day, and people from the nearby neighborhoods were active along the coast. Fang Zhi had seen people going out to sea on yachts while moving. It was best for Mao to go out at night.  "Okay," Fang Zhi said.  "I want to swim further out to find food, awoo," Mao added, saying it would return before eight o'clock the next morning. It wanted to play a little longer.  Fang Zhi thought for a moment and agreed. "Pay attention to weather changes, avoid boats, and return immediately if something is wrong."  "Yes!"  "Remember, you can't eat protected animals!"  "I won't eat! Definitely won't eat!"  "Don't eat randomly either!"  "I won't eat randomly!" Mao promised.  "Go ahead."  Permission granted, Mao dashed out and plunged into the sea under the cover of night. Chapter 451 Disappeared!  Fang Zhao looked at the distant sea, placing the dog leash on the cabinet by the door. This was the first time he had let Curly go out on its own, and he was still somewhat worried. However, he couldn't always keep an eye on Curly. After such a long period of discipline, he was willing to give Curly a chance to go out independently. He would decide on what measures to take in the future based on Curly's performance this time.  Curly's affair was not a trivial matter. Fang Zhao had never relaxed his constraints on Curly. Without proper guidance, it could become a killing weapon in the hands of those with ulterior motives. Weapons have no concept of right or wrong; the rightness or wrongness lies in the person who uses the weapon. Fortunately, Curly had its own consciousness, cognitions, and notions; it was a complete living being.  Moreover, Fang Zhao had always felt that his rebirth was related to Curly, but so far, he had not discovered what exactly it was. Being strict with Curly was both guidance and protection.  "Don't go astray."  The wind at night had gotten a bit stronger, and the waves forcefully washed against the shore before retreating to an invisible place. Everything was filled with the unknown.  At the same time, completely unaware of Fang Zhao's worries, Curly was truly like an unleashed wild dog, swimming around in the sea and riding the waves. Oxygen? Breathing? It didn't need that. Once it plunged into the sea, it completely forgot there was such a thing. Ignoring breathing, water pressure, and light, Curly happily chased after schools of fish.  It couldn't eat coral, so it licked the stones next to the coral. Not tasty. It also went up to tease a sea turtle. It could even sing.  "La la la la la la, watching that sea turtle swim in the water~"  As a musical artist dog, if it could talk, it could sing. No one was around to hear it, so there was no need to worry about being discovered. If it sensed someone nearby, it would dive deep or hide.  Although hungry, once Curly entered the sea, it did not open its mouth to eat, deciding to play first. It could play for a long time this trip since Fang Zhao was not around and no one was watching it. After chasing turtles and fish for a while, Curly spotted a large fish, still among the protected marine animals, belonging to the category that could not be eaten, but this did not lessen Curly's interest in it.  Protected animals could not be eaten, but no one said they couldn't be played with~ Curly gave up on the schools of fish and the turtle, chasing after that fish instead, closely following it and occasionally touching it with its paws.  I'm not eating; I'm just touching.  The fish sped up, and so did Curly. With a stroke of its doggy paddle, it kept up easily, without thinking how it could swim as fast as a sailfish with its doggy paddle.  After playing for a while, Curly grew even hungrier and decided to eat something first. It would not eat any of the protected marine animals, not even a fin, even if Fang Zhao couldn't see, it didn't dare. After all, it was its first time running out, and it didn't have the gall yet. As soon as it thought of eating, the first reaction in its mind was the books Fang Zhao had shown it and the test questions in the learning machine, as well as the reflection after facing the wall.  As for those not among the protected animals, it would not be polite!  Time to eat!  While excited, Curly was also a bit confused. Where should it start? As the first time it could independently hunt in the sea, its first prey should be special; this should be the "sense of ceremony" that Nanfeng mentioned before, right?  Curly carefully searched for its first prey of the day. Finally, it found one. It looked somewhat like a fish in the protected animal album, but that was just in appearance. Curly recognized at a glance the differences in that fish and quickly analyzed multiple pieces of evidence, so even if it returned and Fang Zhao asked, it could respond confidently.  Having ruled it out from the protected animals, Curly had the confidence to act. Although this prey was not large, less than a meter long, it was very attractive to Curly. Once the target was determined, Curly dog-paddled and chased after it.  ---  One o'clock in the morning.  A certain counter-terrorism department in Yanzhou was still working tensely.  "No suspicious individuals have been spotted by the night duty team, and the sonar array has not detected any suspicious targets."  "Continue to strengthen the defense and control of the target area, pay attention to patrolling and near-shore detection, carefully identify subtle abnormal sounds and energy fluctuations; don't let even a bird or a fish slip by!"  They received a message that the notorious "Empire of Tomorrow" also known as the "T" organization, would launch an attack on Yanzhou at two in the morning Yanzhou time. They only knew the general area, the specific location was unknown.  Moreover, the "T" organization had stolen the latest bionic technology, and no one knew what kind of modifications those lunatics had made.  At the same time, in a hidden basement.  In the dim basement, only the glow from the screens could be seen. Seven or eight people, standing or sitting, were staring at one of the screens.  "We successfully bypassed a patrol boat!" one of them exclaimed excitedly, his bloodthirsty gaze sweeping over the area on the map marked with a blood-colored "T".  They had devised a new plan, the first operation in their plan, a probe—using a newly developed bionic torpedo to attack a port about a hundred kilometers from Qi'an City in Yanzhou. Although they only released one bionic torpedo this time, the high-energy material it carried was enough to destroy dozens of cargo ships in the port, causing a strong impact.  Bypassing those patrol boats was expected, but the resistance against coastal defenses was the key.  "Approaching smoothly, almost there!" The person holding the controller stared unblinkingly at the dot on the screen.  As they were about to enter the Yanzhou near-shore defenses, he had to be more cautious and see if their newly modified product could successfully deceive Yanzhou's defense system.  If this attack succeeded, the follow-up actions could immediately unfold!  Everyone in the basement was concentrating on the screen.  Just as they were about to enter the Yanzhou near-shore defense range, and everyone held their breath in anticipation, the dot on the screen suddenly disappeared.  Everyone in the basement: "???"  For a moment, they all doubted their eyes.  The person holding the controller had an expression that momentarily stiffened.  Where's my torpedo?  Looking again, it indeed disappeared, vanished clean, without warning.  This sudden turn of events panicked the few people in the basement.  They had considered several possible scenarios, but not the one happening right in front of them!  It seemed as if not even a splash was made before it ended. The psychological impact was too great, and they were unable to accept it for a moment.  "What's going on?"  "The bionic torpedo has lost contact! No energy reaction detected! Reason unknown!"  "Impossible! Could it be a display malfunction?"  "No, the display is normal, the controller is normal, but there is no response from the torpedo!"  They had spent a huge price, invested so much manpower and resources, and took so long to plan to create the current product!  And it just disappeared without a trace??  "Has Yanzhou's near-shore defense become this strong?... No... I don't believe it!"  The person holding the controller trembled his lips, his face twisted and ferocious, his bloodshot eyes filled with resentment and madness. He could not accept this failure!  Another person who had been sitting in a corner with a gloomy face said, "Notify others, all actions stop immediately! First, find out how their near-shore defense system intercepted it!"  They had taken a considerable amount of time to devise a plan targeting Yanzhou, and the first link in the attack action had failed.  On the other side, Yanzhou's counter-terrorism department was also confused.  They waited and waited past two in the morning, not daring to relax, not daring to take it lightly, and continued to wait until seven in the morning.  There was no movement at all.  The "T" organization's lunatics would not easily stop their actions. Even if they knew the news was leaked, they would not stop, but instead continue their madness in a provocative manner.  However, this time until dawn, they did not receive any news of an unidentified attack.  It was calm on land and also calm at sea; there should be no detection blind spots.  Why was there no movement?  It's really strange.  Was the information wrong?  ...  The night gradually retreated, and the clouds brightened.  The rays of the rising sun scattered across the sea, dispelling the coolness of the night.  Whoosh—  A dog's head emerged from the water, and its nose puffed out air as if suddenly remembering it could breathe, moving on the water's surface and inhaling the moist air of the morning.  Curly slowly swam towards the beach, its dog legs stirring up some splashes and sand.  After landing, it shook its fur refreshingly.  "Burp~~~" Chapter 452: Not a Big Eater  Fang Zhao gave Nan Feng and the other two a break, but Nan Feng considered himself a responsible assistant and a busy person. He left a message for Fang Zhao and, after getting approval, came over early in the morning.  After Fang Zhao left Huang Yi, many people sought him out for collaboration, thinking that since his studies were over, he could start business activities.  However, Fang Zhao had no intention of participating in various business events.  Despite being rejected, most people did not give up and turned to Nan Feng instead. After all, Nan Feng had a history in the entertainment industry of Huangzhou and knew many of the workers, making it much easier to contact Nan Feng than Fang Zhao.  Thus, Nan Feng, who had given himself the title of "part-time agent," was full of energy and brought his work with him.  After summarizing the work at hand, Nan Feng reported to Fang Zhao and then looked around but did not see Juan Mao.  In their small team, aside from the boss, Juan Mao, the dog worth nearly 300 million, was what Nan Feng cared about the most.  "Where's Juan Mao?"  After moving to the new house, Juan Mao had been very excited, so why was it not seen today? Did it play too much yesterday and found a place to sleep today?  Fang Zhao looked at the time and said, "It went swimming, but it's coming back now."  Nan Feng opened his mouth, wanting to say, "Are you out of your mind to let a dog worth nearly 300 million play in the sea by itself?" but eventually, he did not dare to.  Putting aside the documents, Nan Feng said, "Boss, I'll go check on the beach," and ran out.  As soon as he stepped out, Nan Feng received a call from Yan Biao, asking how things were here and if he and Zuo Yu needed to come over.  While on the phone, Nan Feng looked toward the beach to find Juan Mao.  At that moment, Juan Mao was coming out of the sea, shaking off the water, and running back towards the house.  Under the morning sun, Nan Feng thought that even the fur of Juan Mao shone with a metallic luster when it ran.  "Deserving of being our nearly 300 million worth dog! Even sunbathing can bring out a metallic sheen!" Nan Feng exclaimed, took a photo, and shared it in their group chat, "Even the footprints on the beach are so cute!"  Yan Biao, Zuo Yu: "..."  Nan Feng continued, "I'll turn on the camera for you guys, do you see it? That sparkling figure running, our little Juan really is the brightest pup in the area!"  Yan Biao: "Also the most expensive, right?"  "The boss, he..." Nan Feng wanted to say the boss was out of his mind but remembering Fang Zhao's hearing, he changed the subject, "The boss doesn’t have time to always watch the dog, we need to pay close attention when we're here, especially when it goes swimming in the sea, it's too dangerous!"  Saying this, Nan Feng ran toward Juan Mao.  Juan Mao, stopped by Nan Feng, shook its wet fur.  Burp~~~  Pfft——  Juan Mao burped and then farted.  Nan Feng was excited, only regretting that he didn't capture that moment, "The first time I’ve seen a dog fart in person, truly befitting of a dog worth nearly 300 million. Whether it's a burp or a fart, the scent is so lingering, and if you smell carefully, there’s even a hint of gunpowder."  Yan Biao, Zuo Yu: "..."  This comrade's brain has been deeply corroded by money.  There's no saving him from blindly praising!  Nan Feng kept finding unique ways to praise, "My dog is truly different," while Juan Mao had already run past him and dashed back into the house.  Checking the time, it was 8:02 AM.  He had told Fang Zhao he would be back before eight...  He was over by two minutes.  Juan Mao had to defend himself.  "I was onshore before eight o'clock! I just wanted to shake off the water outside before entering the house! Nan Feng even stopped me!"  Juan Mao wanted to explain further but hearing Nan Feng's footsteps, it hummed twice and then shut up.  "Dry your fur by the dryer," Fang Zhao said.  By the time Juan Mao was done drying its fur, Fang Zhao had already sent Nan Feng away.  Fang Zhao checked Juan Mao's teeth and found only a bit of green residue that looked like some kind of algae but nothing else.  "How much did you eat this time?" Fang Zhao asked.  Mentioning this, Juan Mao became confident.  "I ate one fish, just one! The rest were just small snacks."  Juan Mao wanted to prove that its appetite was not big.  It had heard many times that keeping pets was expensive, especially those that ate a lot, and they were easily abandoned.  Juan Mao had to clear its name.  Its appetite was not big!  "Really only ate one fish? Not hungry?" Fang Zhao asked.  He knew Juan Mao's appetite well.  "Really! Not hungry!" Juan Mao affirmed.  "…Did you steal a whale?"  "No! I didn't eat a whale! I didn't eat any other protected marine animals either! Not even a single fish scale! The fish I ate was just a bit longer than me, it just looked like a protected animal, but it wasn’t, I checked it several times!" Juan Mao quickly explained.  This needed clarification! It didn't want to face the wall!  "What snacks did you eat?" Fang Zhao continued to inquire.  "Just two shells, I ate some seaweed on the way back, and some other things I don’t know the names of, all just licked, none tasted good."  "Mhm."  After a careful look at Juan Mao, Fang Zhao noticed that aside from being a bit overly excited, there were no other abnormalities. Unsure if Juan Mao really wasn't hungry or just saying so, he decided to pour a bowl of dog food for it.  Just as he was about to stand up, he heard Juan Mao burp again.  Fang Zhao’s steps halted.  He carefully distinguished the scents in the air, his expression turning serious.  Putting the dog bowl aside, Fang Zhao approached Juan Mao, stretching and yawning, and examined it closely.  Thinking of something, Fang Zhao asked, "The fish you ate today, what did it look like? Have you seen it in a book?"  Juan Mao: "It looked a bit like one of the protected marine animals."  Fang Zhao brought over the electronic atlas and had Juan Mao point it out.  "This kind, it just looks somewhat similar, but it's definitely not! I can tell!" Juan Mao said with some pride.  Fortunately, it had observed carefully while hunting and remembered the differences between that fish and the protected fish species in the atlas.  Under Fang Zhao's questioning, Juan Mao detailed its findings, even pointing out each fish scale, including a "T" mark on the belly of the "fish" that wasn't easy to notice, all of which Juan Mao remembered clearly.  Fang Zhao took a pen and paper and, based on Juan Mao's description, drew a picture.  From the "fish's" swimming direction, Fang Zhao compared the map and gathered information, drawing several lines.  After pondering for a while, he marked three routes, one of which pointed to a port 100 kilometers away from Qi'an City.  Looking at the drawn routes and the "T" mark on the fish's body in the picture, Fang Zhao asked Juan Mao, "What was the texture like when you ate it? How hard was it?"  Juan Mao, confused: "I don't know. Anything bigger than me, I just swallow."  Fang Zhao: "..."  Perfect logic.  From this point of view, Juan Mao fully followed an instinct similar to that of wild animals — minimizing physical exertion for the highest energy intake.  Why bother chewing in batches if it can be swallowed whole? No one saw it anyway.  Seeing Fang Zhao silent, Juan Mao, unsure if it had done something wrong, cautiously continued to defend itself, "Although I don't know what the texture was like, I feel that its composition should be more complex than dog food... Definitely more complex! Or shall I chew it up next time to taste properly? The books I read before didn't discuss the meat quality of those protected fish species, so without a reference, I don't know how it compares to other similar-looking fish. It's just that I felt a bit full after eating."  Fang Zhao's gaze shifted from the notebook and he patted Juan Mao's head, "No need, you did very well."  Juan Mao, reassured by the praise, wagged its tail happily.  "How do you feel now?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Feeling? After eating that fish, it's like you guys eating compressed biscuits, so full."  Saying this, Juan Mao emphasized, "My appetite is really not that big!"  Still not reassured, Fang Zhao conducted a simple examination on Juan Mao.  After moving to the new house, the equipment used for Juan Mao's checkups was also moved.  The examination results showed that Juan Mao had no wounds and was very healthy, but the blood test showed abnormal results, with slightly higher levels of heavy metals than usual.  Juan Mao's blood had always contained higher levels of heavy metals than other dogs, and now after swallowing something that resembled a bionic torpedo, the change was only slight.  This surprised Fang Zhao.  After careful observation, Juan Mao's fur seemed to have changed in luster slightly.  Even when Nan Feng had done fur care for Juan Mao before, such a sheen had never appeared, and its fur wasn't easily altered by ordinary chemicals.  These were changes that happened overnight.  Just to be safe, Fang Zhao attached a miniature detector to Juan Mao's leg, so that if any crisis occurred in its body, he would know immediately.  "You shouldn't go into the water these next few days," Fang Zhao said.  "Okay."  Juan Mao had played to its heart's content this time and felt so full that it was getting sleepy; it would stay home to watch TV and sleep for the next few days!  "If you run far next time and find that kind of 'fish' that can fill you up, if you really want to eat it, swallow it whole, don't bite into it. Come back immediately and tell me after you eat."  "Okay!"  Juan Mao wagged its tail happily, looking forward to the next time it got hungry.  When it was truly hungry, it felt that one meal could last at least half a month!  This could save Fang Zhao a lot of money!  It's just that after eating, it always burped. Chapter 453 "Enemy Attack, Ao!!"  After a full meal and without being scolded, the curly-haired dog felt a sneaky joy of escaping disaster and went to sleep in the doghouse with a yawn. Fang Zhao originally planned to check out the nearby area today; he even inquired about renting a speedboat from the property management the day before. With his studies concluded and his thesis completed, he intended to relax for a while, go out to sea to leisurely fish for a few days, and incidentally catch some fresh seafood for "Rabbit." However, the incident brought back by the curly-haired dog made Fang Zhao give up his original plan.  Returning to his study, Fang Zhao scanned the drawings he had made in his notebook and displayed them on several screens in front of him, along with a map of Yanzhou. He marked out an area and reviewed it together with the previous drawings. "T" represents the organization from the Tomorrow Empire that always likes to conduct attacks and seemingly wishes to bring about another apocalypse. Fang Zhao's first encounter with them was during his service on Baiji Star, and he had also encountered them once on Whale Island.  Looking at the three routes drawn on the map, Fang Zhao analyzed the purpose of the enemy. As someone who had spent nearly a hundred years in the apocalyptic era, he was still very sensitive to many things. Some influences had penetrated deep into his soul, and even switching bodies or backgrounds, living in the peaceful era of the new century for such a long time, could not erase them.  The belch with the smell of gunpowder from the curly-haired dog almost instantly triggered Fang Zhao's nerves. In the apocalyptic era, the smell of gunpowder signified war and bloodshed.  Beep—beep—Just as he was thinking, a prompt tone from his personal terminal rang out, and Fang Zhao shifted his attention from the map to check the alert. It was from the miniature detector he had tied to the curly-haired dog's leg, which would notify him if there were any anomalies.  The screen that popped up displayed the real-time monitoring results. An hour ago, the blood's heavy metal content was only slightly above the standard, but now it was rising dramatically. No, it should be said that it was changing dramatically! Several metal contents suddenly increased and then dropped rapidly, and some heavy metals that should not be present in a normal dog's body appeared.  These metal elements must have come from something the curly-haired dog ate today. People also ingest some non-essential elements from food, but the current situation was obviously different. In less than ten seconds, according to the detector, the content of one or several metal elements in the curly-haired dog's body had plummeted from the highest alert level to zero and then rose to a staggering value!  Fang Zhao knew of no creature that could exhibit such changes! For instance, according to the real-time measurements from the instrument, if the content of several heavy metals detected were present in a normal human body, the person could not possibly survive. The same would be true for dogs!  But curiously, the curly-haired dog had not lost vital signs, and Fang Zhao could still hear its regular snoring. However, the sudden changes detected by the instrument were not normal at all!  Was the detector broken? Fang Zhao quickly stepped over to the curly-haired dog's bed and looked at the dog lying on its back, snoring in its sleep. He paused for a moment and then placed his finger in front of the dog's nose to test its breathing.  The curly-haired dog always liked to snore after falling asleep; it did not belong to the short snout breed, nor was it overly fat, yet it always snored. Fang Zhao had taken it to the vet for a check-up, and nothing was found. At the moment, the sleeping snoring dog breathed with strength, not too fast, but the temperature of the exhaled gas was abnormally high, much higher than what the detector on the dog's leg measured.  As a homeotherm, the temperature of the exhaled air was more than double the usual body temperature. Was that normal? Fang Zhao patted the curly-haired dog's head.  "Curls?" The curly-haired dog continued to snore.  Fang Zhao patted it again and said, "The game console was stolen."  "Ao wu..." The curly-haired dog gave a struggling low growl, licked its nose, changed its position, and continued to sleep, going from lying on its back to lying on its side, with all four legs making running motions. After a while, the snoring continued.  Fang Zhao's face grew more and more serious. Even the keyword "the game console was stolen" couldn't wake it up? It seemed that the situation was more serious than imagined.  However, he had never encountered such a situation before, not even heard of it, and Fang Zhao did not know what to do. Should he forcibly wake up the curly-haired dog, or continue to observe? He was not sure if forcibly waking it up in this condition would have adverse effects and dared not act rashly.  While Fang Zhao was pondering what to do, the alarm from the detector became more urgent and piercing, and the monitoring chart displayed on the personal terminal showed changes that made one's heart tremble with fear. Heart rate, pulse, blood pressure, and so on were also rapidly changing.  And these were just the detectable changes; who knew how many more were beyond the range of the instrument. The screen displaying the monitoring chart flickered, and the image appeared distorted as if pulled by some force.  The light sources in the room also became unstable, flickering as if they were being interfered with. The electrical appliances in use emitted urgent alarm sounds one after another. A series of ringing sounds caused strong discomfort, but luckily Fang Zhao could bear it. If it were someone else here, they might have already lost consciousness.  Chilly wisps of air seemed to flow through the air. Fang Zhao's instincts, honed in the chaos of the apocalyptic era, made him acutely aware of the unknown danger emanating from the curly-haired dog, and he rapidly retreated several steps.  The data collection of the detector was interrupted, and the sharp alarm sound stopped abruptly. The connection between the instrument and the personal terminal was severed. The lights that were on in the room burst simultaneously. Sparks flashed from the electrical outlets.  A cold metal reflection suddenly appeared, a huge... it seemed to be a... paw? It struck down impossibly fast, almost like an illusion.  Boom! Dust and debris from the floor were thrown into the air. A sudden powerful airflow made the curtains flutter loudly. The entire three-story building shook.  Then, the metallic light disappeared. From appearance to disappearance, it was but a blink of an eye, as if it were an illusion. Fang Zhao looked at the huge paw print in front of him and the cracks in the floorboards and fell silent.  The area overshadowed by the huge paw print still had a chair in it. It was a high-priced gift from Nanfeng to Fang Zhao for his housewarming. When Nanfeng was buying the chair, he felt that solid wood appeared more classy, as pure solid wood furniture was a luxury in the new century. However, the seller also mentioned that for those with dogs at home, it might be better to choose sturdier furniture, especially the legs of tables, chairs, and stools, as they were not resistant to chewing. Therefore, Nanfeng chose the alloy one. It was sturdy enough.  But at this moment, the "sturdy enough" high-end alloy chair praised by the seller had been flattened and was deeply embedded in the floorboards.  The curly-haired dog that had been sleeping all this time seemed to suddenly wake up from a nightmare. With its innocent dog eyes, it looked around at the chaotic scene, at the large cracks in the floor through which one could see the floor below, and at the ferocious paw print on the ground. Frightened, the curly-haired dog jumped out of its bed and barked loudly, "Enemy attack! Ao!"  Seeing Fang Zhao, the curly-haired dog quickly ran over and stood beside him, growling at the huge paw print that had appeared in the room at some unknown time. With its ears pinned back, the fur on its neck bristling, deep wrinkles on its nose, and exposed sharp teeth, the dog was in a combat state, as if it were a warrior sworn to defend its territory and resist foreign invaders. Its demeanor was extremely fierce.  "Ao!!" Fang Zhao: "......" Chapter 454: Can't Fit  Fang Zhao truly intended to rest low-key for a while, however, things just wouldn't stop. There was too much noise on this side, and the security network set up by the property management in the community detected the disturbance and quickly called to inquire.  "Is there any trouble where you are, do you need us to send someone over to help?"  "No need, it's just the dog causing trouble," Fang Zhao said.  The property manager responded with a smile.  Alright, if you say it's the dog causing trouble, then it's the dog causing trouble. I'll pretend to believe you on the surface.  The property management wouldn't continue to ask as long as it didn't affect other residents or endanger anyone else's life. Even if you tore down your entire floor, it wouldn't matter.  Although the houses here were somewhat distant, Fang Zhao had just moved in, and many people were watching the movements of this Yan Zhou celebrity, so any slight disturbance would be noticed.  Thus, when Nan Feng and two others received Fang Zhao's call and rushed over, others had already come to investigate.  A middle-aged businessman walked his dog over, claiming to be visiting, but his eyes always carried scrutiny and suspicion.  Fang Zhao didn't let the man into the house, just saying it was a bit messy inside, and entertained him in the yard where there were tables and chairs.  "The dog caused trouble? Ah, I understand your feelings, some troubles are only understood by those of us who keep dogs," the man said with a knowing look.  After talking for a while, the businessman felt that he had probed enough information and wouldn't get anything more by continuing, so he left with his dog.  As soon as he turned around, he told other friends in the same community.  "There was quite a commotion at his place today, seems like a lot of things were smashed... Didn't see the dog, I suspect he was hitting the dog... No, you know some people are different inside and out, they look fine outside, but who knows what they are doing at home, hehehe... They vent themselves at home after facing pressure outside, especially those celebrities, many of them have bad tempers in private... I understand, every family has its secrets, any disturbance can be blamed on the dog since dogs can't talk."  People living in this area wouldn't casually leak information to the media, they just talked privately.  Soon, a rumor spread in certain small circles.  It was said that Fang Zhao had violent tendencies and was not honest in private.  At the same time, there were various rumors.  Some said Fang Zhao was plotted against by rivals, was troubled by romantic entanglements, was attacked by terrorists, and so on.  There were also people who coldly observed and believed they had found the truth.  Trouble in a new home so soon, who had Fang Zhao offended?  Fang Zhao knew what these people were gossiping about privately, but he didn't plan to pay attention to it, instructing Nan Feng to repair the house quietly. The original damage caused by the curly-haired dog was too obvious, so Fang Zhao had to destroy that footprint himself, resulting in a direct hole in the already cracked floorboard.  The day after moving in, this newly renovated house had to undergo major changes again.  Yan Biao and Zuo Yu both wore ashamed expressions, such destructive power must have been someone's sneak attack! This was their dereliction of duty as bodyguards!  Although Fang Zhao had given them time off, the security systems inside and outside the house were personally supervised and arranged by them, but they didn't serve any purpose at all!  It was indeed their responsibility, they were sorry for the high salary their boss gave them!  The two discussed how to upgrade the house's security system.  Nan Feng's face was pale, and his trembling hand touched the floorboard embedded with a chair pancake.  What kind of force was needed to flatten an alloy chair that was said to easily bear the weight of an elephant?!  The first floor was not so bad, but the second floor suffered more damage, it was a mess, half of the newly bought household appliances were already scrapped, two-thirds of the lights needed replacement, and the walls needed to be repainted.  Nan Feng's mind was filled with various scenarios of assassination, vendetta, and crimes of passion, deeply concerned about Fang Zhao's personal safety.  He didn't dare to ask the reason, and seeing Fang Zhao's stance, he didn't seem inclined to tell, so they could only keep all their questions to themselves.  "Boss, do we need to hire a few more people?" Nan Feng asked.  "No need."  Fang Zhao let Nan Feng handle the house repairs and called the curly-haired dog, which had been shrinking in the corner with its head down facing the wall, into the study.  They were previously on the second floor, fortunately, the house was sturdy, otherwise, that slap would have brought it down.  It was also fortunate that they had moved. If it were in the previous house, who knows what impact the downstairs residents might have experienced.  After calling the curly-haired dog in, Fang Zhao closed the door to the study to isolate the sound.  The curly-haired dog was still doubting its dog life.  After Fang Zhao told it the truth, it remained in shock, far more than the first time it found out it sang while playing games.  "Do you really not remember?" Fang Zhao asked.  "I really don't," the curly-haired dog insisted.  It refused to believe it was the kind of dog that would destroy a home!  Fang Zhao nodded and took out a recording.  Although all the surveillance in the house was destroyed, there was a recording before it happened, which sounded like a series of tinnitus-like noise.  "Listen."  The curly-haired dog's ears moved, and it gradually went from being convinced that it wasn't that kind of dog to becoming a bit doubtful.  "It sounds familiar," the curly-haired dog said weakly.  Fang Zhao raised his eyebrows, wondering if something similar had happened before.  "When was the last time you heard this sound?" Fang Zhao asked.  The curly-haired dog thought carefully, "When you were locked up."  Fang Zhao: "......"  After searching his memory, the curly-haired dog was probably referring to the time Fang Zhao was isolated.  "On Whale Island?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Yes!"  "What did you do then?"  "I swallowed a person."  "......"  "But I fainted on the spot after swallowing! I wasn't discovered by anyone!"  "......Good. Any other similar situations? Think carefully."  This time, the curly-haired dog took a long time to recall.  "It seems there was another time, but I can't remember when."  The curly-haired dog couldn't remember, but Fang Zhao found a memory.  Once, Will wanted to find inspiration for painting and took the curly-haired dog to an art exhibition, but an accident occurred, and the curly-haired dog dragged Will out of the fire.  That time, the place where the dog was kept, the dog cages were all cut with gaps, all surveillance failed, and the perpetrator has not been found to this day.  And the curly-haired dog only remembers biting through the cage, it was unclear about the surveillance cameras.  At that time, the curly-haired dog didn't have that awareness.  Even now, the curly-haired dog didn't know that every time it underwent such a change, it would destroy the surveillance equipment.  From biting through the cage and destroying surveillance to swallowing people on Whale Island, to now suddenly growing a giant paw that almost tore down the building.  In just a short year, the changes were getting bigger and bigger, Fang Zhao speculated it was transforming into some kind of form.  Something like evolution.  But how long this process would last, no one knew.  What would happen was also unpredictable.  Even more worrying was that the curly-haired dog couldn't control these changes itself.  What to do if such a thing happens again next time?  They must find another place with no people.  Fang Zhao recalled the size of the paw that cracked the floorboards, that was just one paw, if it fully transformed...  The house can't fit it!  "How are you feeling now?" Fang Zhao asked.  "I don't feel anything... Does a slightly itchy paw count?"  The curly-haired dog lifted one of its front paws.  After the floorboard was cracked, Fang Zhao had checked its suspected giant paw, only finding some minor scratches.  But now, looking at the dog's paw again, all the scratches had disappeared, and the paw looked as if it had been carefully maintained.  After talking to the curly-haired dog for a while about what to watch out for, Fang Zhao flipped through his savings, worrying.  It's tough to provide for a family, sigh.  With a helpless sigh, Fang Zhao called Nan Feng over.  Nan Feng was worried about how to repair and further reinforce the house. He thought Fang Zhao was calling him over to discuss how to repair the house discreetly and had already thought of several plans, but...  "I want to buy an island," Fang Zhao said.  Nan Feng: "???"  Buy what?  Calm down, boss!  Don't buy an island!!  In Nan Feng's view, Fang Zhao had no need to buy an island, even many laypeople knew that private islands were depreciating!  There was a period in the new century when buying islands was indeed popular, a group of businessmen jointly drove up the island prices, but later due to environmental and other reasons, some islands were prohibited from being sold, and the number of private islands available for transactions decreased, making the island prices even higher.  However, with the continuous development of outer space, those with money in their hands have shifted their targets to investing in outer space, who is still investing in buying islands here? Tiny plots of land on this planet have been hyped up to exorbitant prices, especially those remote and unpopular small islands, which might even hide viruses that could end the world! What's the point of buying them?!  With more options, some things become less coveted.  Naturally, people will choose the better option.  Indeed, there are many private islands up for sale today, but they are difficult to sell.  Buying is easy, just prepare the money, and you can trade immediately, those island owners are very happy.  Nan Feng suppressed the shock in his heart, cleared his throat, squeezed out a smile, and analyzed the current island trading situation for Fang Zhao.  "People say buy on the rise, not on the fall, and the island prices on this planet have been falling, it's hard to sell once you have it in hand... Some people who followed the trend of buying islands, bought them and left them vacant, not knowing how many poisonous insects and plants are on the island, it's very dangerous, the island prices were originally high, and the upfront investment costs are also high..."  Nan Feng rambled on analyzing for Fang Zhao, telling him that this investment wasn't worthwhile.  After listening to Nan Feng's analysis, Fang Zhao said, "The curly-haired dog needs more space to move around."  Nan Feng looked at Fang Zhao with a numb expression, unable to see even a hint of joking in Fang Zhao's eyes.  Seeing that Fang Zhao had made up his mind, Nan Feng could only comply.  "Okay, I'll make a list and budget."  Nan Feng thought to himself: I don't know what exactly the boss has encountered, has it become so serious that he needs to hide from the world?  Nan Feng decided to go back and buy another insurance policy for himself.  He really wanted to ask Fang Zhao: Do you regret donating so much money? If you hadn't donated, as long as it's tradable, not to mention one small island, buying a whole group wouldn't be a problem!  While muttering in his heart, Nan Feng searched the internet for private islands on sale, filtering for small islands that could have buildings and helipads.  He estimated that after buying a small island, Fang Zhao's savings would be depleted.  If it were for any other reason, Nan Feng could understand, but if it was really for keeping a dog, that would be too...  That day, Nan Feng learned a life lesson from his boss—keeping pets can make one poor. Chapter 455: Not Knowing How Strange One Looks Without a Mirror  The islands on this planet were easy to buy, with plenty of choices. Nan Feng selected a few and showed them to Fang Zhao. Fang Zhao chose one of them.  A buyer came to inquire about the price, and the island owner was ecstatic. Having seen more and more people investing in planets outside of Earth in the past two years, he too was anxious and wanted to sell the island quickly, even compromising on the price during negotiations.  The transaction was swift. They inquired about the price one day, and the deal was settled the next.  Seeing Fang Zhao handle the procedures so quickly, Nan Feng felt helpless: Fang Zhao didn't know how to invest, he needed a wise investment advisor.  Even though he didn't know what exactly had happened in the house that day, it surely wasn't so urgent to buy an island, right?  Alas, the boss should just stick to his music and art. Investing loses too much money.  Not just Nan Feng, but the former island owner also thought Fang Zhao was foolish. Seeing the trend of falling prices for islands on this planet, yet coming to buy, isn't that foolish?  Indeed, still too young and impulsive.  The new island Fang Zhao bought was not too big but sufficient for Juan Mao to move around. It was located a bit remotely, at some distance from all the continents, and didn't have any distinctive shape or fame. The original owner hadn't lived there for nearly twenty years, only sending people over to do simple cleaning twice a year, making it a very pristine island.  The disaster at the end of the world was global, and there was no utopia untouched by it. This small island too had suffered from the catastrophe of the end times, but over five hundred years, it had recovered to its current thriving vitality.  The existing house on the island was built more than fifty years ago and had been upgraded twice due to frequent storms. Fang Zhao didn't make significant changes; as long as it was sturdy and livable, it was fine.  After the security system was set up, Fang Zhao sent Nan Feng and the other two back to stand by.  The island was not big and had limited food, which was mostly transported from outside. Fang Zhao stocked up on some supplies, and later on, whenever there was a shortage of goods, he would have Yan Biao and Zuo Yu bring them over.  After receiving the subsequent royalty payments, Fang Zhao bought two more aerospace flight vehicles, the kind that can only fly within the atmosphere.  The somewhat filled wallet was depleted once again.  Nan Feng and the others felt the pinch on his behalf. They all had the impression of "Has my boss gone mad?"  Of the two new aerospace flight vehicles, one was kept on the island, and the other was used for transporting goods to Nan Feng and the other two.  "Boss, you... are going to stay here alone?" Zuo Yu asked again worriedly.  "Uh-huh," Fang Zhao seemed a lot calmer.  "Don't you need more people?" Yan Biao also asked.  "No need."  "Well... if you have anything, contact us immediately, we are on standby at all times."  Nan Feng boarded the aircraft, looking back every three steps.  Watching Nan Feng and the others leave on the aircraft, Fang Zhao returned to the house and called Juan Mao, who had been hiding in the doghouse.  By now, Juan Mao had completed its psychological transition from "I can't possibly be such a dog" to "Should I go out and make money?"  It had thought that the "fish" it had swallowed would last half a month, but in less than a week, Juan Mao was starting to feel hungry again.  Fang Zhao brought out a big bag of dog food—50 kg in a large bag.  "You eat, I'll watch you," Fang Zhao said.  "Can I swallow it directly?"  "Yes."  Juan Mao licked its nose and quickly approached the bag of dog food.  Then, Fang Zhao saw something that looked like a big... mouth suddenly appear.  A flash of silvery metallic luster.  The 50 kg bag of dog food was gone.  "Full?" Fang Zhao asked.  Juan Mao hesitated for a moment, then nodded, "Still... a little hungry."  That meant it wasn't full at all.  Fang Zhao brought out another 50 kg bag of dog food, "Can you slow down this time? Slow down the swallowing?"  Juan Mao nodded decisively this time, "Slow swallow!"  This time, Fang Zhao saw even more clearly. The dog's head changed, but the rest of its body remained in its regular dog form. The slightly long curly fur seemed to shrink back into Juan Mao's body at that moment. The shape of the changing part of the head was blurry, as if composed of some metal, and it was not clear what it looked like. All that could be seen was a big mouth with sharp teeth that swallowed the 50 kg bag of dog food effortlessly.  Not to mention 50 kg, even 100 kg would probably not cause any hesitation.  Fang Zhao watched this scene thoughtfully.  Perhaps, this dog could no longer be simply classified as a carbon-based life form.  It might have another form.  Normally it's a dog, but what does it become after transforming? A metal dog? An unknown metallic life form?  The camera that had been placed in the room, unsurprisingly, malfunctioned. Only part of the footage was recorded, and from the moment the change began, it was already being interfered with.  Looking at the other monitors placed around the room, those that were close also suffered severe malfunctions, and the footage captured at that moment also showed tearing and distortion.  All electronic devices were affected.  Fortunately, Fang Zhao had prepared many backups when moving in.  As for these changes, Juan Mao was unaware, and since electronic devices couldn't be used, Fang Zhao went looking in the warehouse and moved out a fitting mirror left by the original owner.  Juan Mao swallowed dog food in front of the mirror again, but this time it almost choked. It was stunned.  It was almost scared to pee by its own reflection in the mirror.  Indeed, without a mirror, one wouldn't know how strange they look!  The shock was greater than when it realized it had demolished the house in a dream!  However, no matter how great the shock, it was replaced by the feeling of hunger.  After transforming a few times, Juan Mao felt exhausted, as if the three large bags of dog food had been fully consumed.  Hungry.  So hungry!  With no other choice, Juan Mao went to the sea to hunt for food again.  This time, with no other residents around, Juan Mao didn't have to wait until night. After getting permission from Fang Zhao, it rushed into the sea to hunt.  It was like flipping a switch; in the following period, Juan Mao's transformations became more frequent, sometimes enlarging its paws while digging holes, creating pits.  Fang Zhao didn't dare let it sleep inside the house. What if it dreamed of chasing thieves and destroyed the house in excitement?  Along with these frequent transformations was a massive demand for energy.  Food!  Fang Zhao really couldn't solve this, so he let Juan Mao hunt for food in the sea.  Fang Zhao emphasized some important issues and things to pay attention to every time. After making its daily rounds in the sea, Juan Mao swallowed two bionic torpedoes near the coast of Yan Continent in one week.  But now, one torpedo didn't last half a month, and if the transformations were too frequent, it would have to go out again after two or three days.  Juan Mao was quite happy, able to eat its fill and save money.  However, after swallowing the third bionic torpedo, it couldn't find any more. Juan Mao made several trips near the Yan Continent coast but never encountered them again.  Fang Zhao knew that the people from the T organization might have given up on using bionic torpedoes. He wondered what they would do next.  The anti-terrorism efforts in Yan Continent were good. Even without Juan Mao swallowing torpedoes, the likelihood of intercepting the bionic torpedoes was high.  With no more torpedoes, Juan Mao had to shift its target. This time, it planned to swim farther out.  Fang Zhao neither agreed nor disagreed, handing Juan Mao a set of comprehensive exam papers with questions he had personally devised. The questions were about responses to various critical situations and some issues he had emphasized repeatedly.  Juan Mao quickly completed the set, scoring 93 out of 100. After deducting seven points, Fang Zhao gave Juan Mao a supplementary lesson before agreeing to let it go out.  This time, Juan Mao was out for slightly longer, taking 12 hours to return. It seemed energetic upon returning, apparently having eaten and drunk its fill.  "What did you eat?" Fang Zhao asked.  "I ate a big box!" Juan Mao simply recounted its experience, which could be summarized as: After leaving the island, it swam and swam, seeming to find something delicious, so it ate it.  Fang Zhao asked some detailed questions and learned that the place where Juan Mao found "food" was a submarine sunk deep in the sea, and the "food" Juan Mao mentioned should be some sort of high-energy material inside the submarine. There were eight large boxes, and Juan Mao ate two at once.  Because the distance was a bit far, Juan Mao could not control its transformations and couldn't bring the boxes up for Fang Zhao to see. After swallowing the first box, it felt full and intended to bring one back to show Fang Zhao. However, while carrying the box, it swallowed it.  Juan Mao didn't want to swallow a third box, but with Fang Zhao's admonitions, it dared not forcefully break open the boxes and could only return to the island first.  "I'm so stuffed," Juan Mao said, rarely experiencing the feeling of being too full.  Without a submarine, Fang Zhao could not check and could only guess based on Juan Mao's description. With insufficient information and not knowing how old the sunken submarine was, and Juan Mao not recognizing it, Fang Zhao couldn't draw it. They could only wait for Juan Mao to go hunting again for clues.  After eating its fill, Juan Mao's effects were significant. From initially being unable to control the sudden transformations to vaguely sensing the feeling of change, it could avoid unnecessary destruction before each change, and no sudden pits appeared on the island anymore.  However, the transformations became even more frequent and intense.  To prevent being detected by patrolling aircraft or satellites in outer space due to abnormal energy fluctuations, Fang Zhao instructed Juan Mao to run to the sea whenever it felt a transformation coming. Land or sea had no effect on Juan Mao.  Over the next month, Juan Mao went out several times, swallowing the remaining boxes inside the sunken submarine in batches.  Fang Zhao, based on the information Juan Mao brought back and combined with the clues he found, could almost confirm that it was a submarine belonging to the T organization that was sunk by the Yan Continent navy a hundred years ago. Rumors said that there were at least eight tons of Grade-A energy ore on that sunken submarine...  Many had attempted to salvage it, not for the submarine, but for the eight tons of Grade-A energy ore inside. However, all attempts were fruitless. The area was prone to being swallowed by undercurrents, attacked by deep-sea creatures, and was rumored to be a magnetic anomaly zone where communication was easily interrupted, and diving equipment was prone to malfunctioning. For an uncertain rumor, it was not worth it.  Gradually, people forgot about that sunken submarine and the legendary eight tons of Grade-A energy ore.  Looking at the reasons for the sudden deployment of the Yan Continent navy back then, Fang Zhao was silent. His feelings were complicated. Chapter 456: Poor Signal on the Small Broken Island  Curl didn't have many thoughts in its mind. After devouring all eight boxes, it persevered and scoured the area a few more times but found no more of those boxes. Fang Zhao cautioned against randomly devouring marine life from the area, suggesting to scare them off instead of eating them. With no other choice, Curl gnawed on more submarine wreckage, especially the energy cabin.  Above the sunken submarine, three fully equipped submersibles cautiously approached the demonized trench zone. Nearing the infamous abyssal danger zone, they indeed experienced several communication disruptions. Fortunately, they did not encounter any strong undersea currents during their descent.  The extreme environment of the ocean floor imposed some limitations on the submersibles, creating an uncomfortable sense of oppression and fear towards this unknown realm. Humanity had ventured into space and to other planets, yet they still hadn't completely conquered the ocean. Many parts of the deep sea remained off-limits.  "Approaching smoothly... Yes, if the map we obtained is correct, we should soon reach our target point."  "No dangers detected, seems like we're lucky today."  They hadn't expected to succeed in one go; this was a probing action. Who would come here, risking danger, if not compelled by necessity?  It was strange that all three biomimetic torpedoes they fired off seemed to disappear from the world without a trace. Three failed fish attacks made them even more wary of the defenses near the Yan Continent. Truly, a hauntingly powerful interception!  Not even a sound was heard!  As a result, the "T" organization's other branches immediately halted their biomimetic torpedo attack plans to investigate this interception technology.  They had reasons to suspect whether the biomimetic technology stolen from the military had bugs or if the military intentionally planted them and let them be stolen!  In the process of stealing biomimetic technology, they had lost many men and exposed several bases. Now it seemed this was all part of a chain of plots targeting them! How cunning indeed!  They had to change their original plans as the organization's higher-ups were dissatisfied with the Yan Continent branch. If they didn't achieve something noteworthy, they wouldn't last in the organization, and the consequences would be dire.  Either they had to stage an attack or do something else to gain merit.  After losing three valuable biomimetic torpedoes, their funding was temporarily cut, all biomimetic torpedoes were reclaimed, and the original plans were halted. It seemed they were being left to hang dry.  The head of the T organization's Yan Continent branch was recently so worried he was nearly going bald. He had thought about bombing some crowded place with lax security, like certain shopping centers in Yan Continent.  But he also feared disrupting the organization's other plans. Lately, the organization seemed to be moving again, but their branch wasn't privy to the information. The actions of the different branches were separate, and it was impossible to get precise information.  Moreover, the Yan Continent military was watching them closely, and they probably wouldn't even get close to a shopping center before being intercepted.  With no other choice, they had to look for other ways to achieve merit, such as through supplies.  After much thought, he set his sights on the submarine that had sunk over a hundred years ago. One of his seniors had been on that doomed submarine, responsible for transporting energy ore. Unfortunately, they encountered the Yan Continent navy and failed to escape, eventually sinking the sub with everyone on board.  Eight tons of Grade A energy ore had sunk to the bottom of the sea. Eight tons! The result of so much effort to obtain eight tons of Grade A energy ore, all sunk to the bottom!  The incident had dealt a significant blow to the organization, leaving it demoralized for a long while and much more low-key, entering a period of recuperation.  Since then, the organization never transported more than two tons of ore at a time. Grade A energy ore was especially transported in dispersed quantities to avoid a repeat disaster.  Those responsible for the transport had been unlucky. Their well-planned energy ore transportation had not anticipated a sudden Yan Continent navy drill. Reportedly, it was due to a commemoration of the death of some significant figure from the Era of Annihilation, and a drill was held on a whim.  They hadn't received any prior information; it was too sudden. When they heard the news, they were baffled.  Damn the Yan Continent navy!  What was the name of that big shot from the Era of Annihilation? Something with the surname Fang?  Who cares? Dead is dead.  It was said that the organization had planned many times to bomb the martyrs' cemetery but were thwarted by the tenacious tomb guardians, never succeeding even once.  The T organization held grudges. Since the "eight-ton" setback a century ago, every head of the T organization's Yan Continent branch received orders: if there was a chance, they were to bomb the graves in the Yan Continent martyrs' cemetery, especially that Fang surname's grave.  Inside a concealed underground room, the head of the T organization's Yan Continent branch commanded the salvage operation with a somber look.  If he wasn't truly desperate, he wouldn't have set his sights on a submarine that had sunk into the trench a hundred years ago.  Although more energy ore discoveries had led to a slight price drop for Grade A energy ore, it was still worth around 14 billion by today's standards.  Luckily, with improved communication technology, the salvage operation had been going relatively smoothly despite a few interruptions.  As they neared their target without encountering undersea currents or deep-sea creature attacks, it seemed that fortune was with them!  "Stay alert for deep-sea monster attacks."  "Understood! But boss, are there really legendary monsters here?" asked someone from inside one of the submersibles.  "I don't know."  "The area we're approaching is very quiet. Maybe at this depth, there aren't any fish, let alone deep-sea monsters. Just dead water. Documentaries only filmed shadows, and it's uncertain whether they're the legendary abyssal creatures. There are also rumors that the production teams fake these things."  They said this, but deep down, they still believed in the existence of deep-sea monsters.  The people inside the three submersibles tasked with the salvage operation heightened their vigilance.  "We found it! There really is a sunken submarine here!"  The submarine that had sunk here a century ago was barely recognizable now.  "Search for the ore first!" came the anxious voice from the communicator.  "Right away, boss!" The people inside the three submersibles were also excited.  Eight tons of Grade A ore, worth more than 14 billion! If they completed this task, they'd be set for life!  Three submersibles: one carried out the mission while the other two provided protection.  However...  "Boss, we can't detect the ore."  "The boxes that contain the ore are made of special materials, hard to detect. Get closer and search for those boxes. The eight tons of ore must be in more than eight boxes."  After a while, the mission-carrying submersible reported back.  "Boss, the submarine is severely damaged, leaving only wreckage. The severed edges are uneven... as if gnawed by a dog."  "That's not funny," the voice from the communicator was ice-cold, clearly not in a good mood.  "Boss, I took a closer look, and it really looks like bite marks. There really is an abyssal monster!!!" The person inside the submersible grew fearful. If it could gnaw a submarine like this, wouldn't it easily do the same to them?  Honestly, they would rather bomb the Yan Continent cemetery than become fish food here.  "Find the boxes!" the voice from the communicator barked.  "Yes!"  Ultimately, the "eight tons of Grade A ore" overcame their fear of the "deep-sea monster."  However...  "Boss, no boxes found! This place is empty, and a large chunk of the submarine is missing! The energy cabin has vanished as well! Judging by the break... it looks freshly gnawed."  "..."  Heavy breathing came through the communicator, likely from someone very angry. It seemed like nothing had been going right for a while.  "Keep searching! Look around! See if there's any... *static*... fallen... *static*"  "Boss, what are you saying? Can't hear you clearly!"  The connection was lost.  But they didn't panic. They had encountered a few communication breakdowns during the deep-sea operation before, and it usually recovered after a short while.  However, as they waited, the communication did not resume, and the submersibles' control systems began to malfunction, worsening progressively.  Now the people inside the three submersibles panicked.  "Retreat, retreat, retreat! Quick, get back to shallower waters first!!"  The submersibles increasingly showed signs of losing control, becoming less responsive.  They had managed to ascend slightly when the control panels of the submersibles suddenly went dead, as if there was a power failure. A ringing noise filled their ears, and their consciousness began to blur.  ---  On the other side, Fang Zhao was talking to Nan Feng.  Nan Feng reported recent events to Fang Zhao. He had received many invitations—variety shows, news interviews, collaboration offers—and which to accept or decline depended on Fang Zhao's decision.  Since Fang Zhao moved to the island, Nan Feng's responsibilities had increased, but he wasn't complaining; in fact, he was pleased.  Fang Zhao gave him another raise, which of course wasn't the most important thing. The most important thing was that Nan Feng could meet more people, which would benefit his career path.  "I'll turn down the variety shows, accept an interview with Yan Continent TV, and about the collaborations... *static*..."  Nan Feng hadn't finished speaking when he heard static, and soon after, the communication was completely cut off.  Nan Feng said to Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, "I told you, places like that remote little broken island just have poor signal, always unstable."  Having lost contact with Fang Zhao's side, Nan Feng and the others were also concerned. They had planned to go check it out but received a warning from the Yan Continent Coastal Monitoring Station. They reported a minor earthquake near a trench and severe magnetic anomalies, advising people at sea to avoid the area if possible and to wait until everything returned to normal before going out to sea.  With no other options, Nan Feng and the others could only sit and wait. The minor earthquake wasn't much of an issue, but magnetic anomalies were troublesome. Who knew if the severity would increase? What if they lost all control mid-flight?  "Ah, the city is so nice, why did the boss have to move to a little broken island?"  At this time, on the island.  After the communication was cut off, Fang Zhao noticed flickering screens that he recognized. Stepping out of the house, Fang Zhao looked towards the sea.  Something was changing, happening right now. Chapter 457: Even Dogs Should Have Goals  The interference lasted for nearly two hours before it disappeared. Fang Zhao received a call from Nan Feng and the others, who reported that they were safe, but he didn't ask them to come over just yet. After the call, Fang Zhao didn't immediately go back inside. Instead, he sat on a stone by the shore and checked the online reports about the recent abnormal magnetic forces at sea.  There were no casualties. Since the area with the strongest magnetic anomalies had little human activity and the earthquake was weak, the public mostly glanced at the news and didn't pay it much attention afterward.  After browsing the news for a while, Fang Zhao heard something in the water approaching at high speed.  He didn't dodge but stood up to look.  Splash—  A dog emerged from the sea, landing on the shore with such speed that, possibly due to excitement, it didn't stabilize and rolled for quite a distance before stopping.  After shaking off the water and sand from its body, the curly-haired dog ran towards Fang Zhao, looking quite excited, its tail wagging exuberantly.  Fang Zhao didn't find any injuries on the curly-haired dog and patted its head, "Are you full?"  "Full, woof!" The "woof" was strong and carried a hint of pride.  "What happened? You caused quite a commotion this time."  Fang Zhao showed the curly-haired dog some news about the incident.  Looking at the news, the curly-haired dog became a bit guilty, but realizing it hadn't caused any serious problems, it relaxed.  "Can you transform now?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Yes!" The curly-haired dog was confident again.  Fang Zhao didn't let it transform there and then. Although there were no other people on the island, due to the recent magnetic anomaly incident, satellites were probably monitoring more closely, so one had to be careful.  "Go to the sea."  Fang Zhao changed into a diving suit and, with his equipment, swam out far.  One reason was to avoid satellite detection. The other was to prevent the island's electronic equipment from being affected, as the stock was already insufficient.  After reaching a certain distance from the island, he dived underwater before allowing the curly-haired dog to transform.  Sunlight penetrated the surface of the water, lighting up the sea, and one could see some floating particles in the water.  Various fish leisurely waved their fins.  Suddenly, a ripple spread, and the fish scattered in panic.  Below the surface, a massive creature appeared, with a metallic sharpness and coldness.  The sunlight passing through the water reflected a faint blue light off of it.  Light and shadow shifted with the flow of the water, adding a touch of mystery.  It had ears, limbs, a tail, and sharp teeth, and one could just make out a dog-like shape.  Fang Zhao's legs were not as long as its.  Judging by the size of the dog's mouth, it could easily swallow a person.  Fang Zhao watched this unfamiliar form in front of him with amazement. He couldn't imagine how the curly-haired dog, which looked similar to a small pet dog, could transform from a carbon-based life form into a new type of creature that seemed to be made entirely of metal. During the transformation, he even heard a high-pitched sound similar to a machine over-speeding.  After waiting for it to stabilize in its new form, Fang Zhao opened the underwater communicator.  "Very impressive. Can't you make yourself smaller?"  "Can't... I think?" The curly-haired dog tilted its large head and thought, "Not now, maybe later. I can control the transformation now! I just can't maintain it for very long." It emphasized, "As long as I don't transform into this form, I won't need to eat much!"  In the curly-haired dog's view, as long as it didn't transform into this large form, it wouldn't get hungry so easily, and it could save on dog food!  The curly-haired dog quickly reverted to its small dog form, paddling happily around Fang Zhao.  It believed it had finally solved a big problem and no longer needed to worry!  Fang Zhao had many questions to ask the curly-haired dog, but this wasn't the right place for a detailed discussion.  Back on shore and in the house, the curly-haired dog told Fang Zhao about the cause and process of the incident.  "There were no boxes to eat, and after gnawing on the submarine, I followed that trench and smelled food in a deeper area, which I dug out and ate."  "Food? What did it look like?" asked Fang Zhao.  "It was a white, round stone, about the size of a soccer ball."  The curly-haired dog couldn't say much more; it hadn't paid much attention at the time and was too hungry, so it just ate it after digging it out.  Fang Zhao guessed that what the curly-haired dog described might be a new type of energy mineral, possibly containing higher energy than Class A energy minerals.  The stone from the trench could either be native to the planet or a meteorite that fell from space. During the Era of Dusk, many meteorites fell, some containing energy minerals.  Fang Zhao was inclined to believe it came from outside the planet.  However, since the curly-haired dog had already eaten the stone, it was indeed difficult to confirm its origin.  As long as it was determined that the stone was beneficial to the curly-haired dog, that was enough.  "Did you find any more of those stones in the trench?" asked Fang Zhao.  "No more! Just the one."  The curly-haired dog felt regretful; if there were more such stones, it wouldn't need to spend money on dog food, and it could switch between two forms every day. It's a pity that such satisfying food was scarce.  Fang Zhao didn't dwell on it but asked about the causes of the magnetic anomaly and earthquake.  The curly-haired dog cautiously glanced at Fang Zhao, drooped its head, and defended itself, "I ate too much and couldn't hold it in."  After gnawing on the energy cabin of the submarine and swallowing a stone that might be a high-grade energy mineral, the curly-haired dog realized it was about to transform again and found a place to hide and wait for the period to pass.  "I didn't expect to complete the transformation this time. I checked that there were no people around, and there weren't many fish in the trench... I even tried to control it; I didn't want to cause a commotion."  Suddenly, the curly-haired dog's eyes brightened, and it wagged its tail at Fang Zhao, looking for praise, "After the transformation period, I found three submersibles not far away, all with people inside who were still alive, so I sent them to the nearest naval vessel! I pushed the submersibles secretly, without being discovered!"  At that moment, Fang Zhao noticed a new news update from the account he was following.  Fang Zhao clicked to read it.  The news reported that the Yanzhou naval patrol fleet had found three submersibles and confirmed the identities of everyone inside, all members of the T organization. The location data on the submersibles matched the epicenter of the earthquake and magnetic anomaly.  The public also suspected that the T organization was behind the unusual maritime event, and one could imagine how they were being criticized now.  Fang Zhao looked at the curly-haired dog squatting there, oblivious, tilting its head and scratching itself with its hind leg, and after a while, he said, "You handled this situation very well!"  The curly-haired dog immediately perked up, rubbing against Fang Zhao and looking at him with hopeful eyes, seeking praise.  "Then can I... can I have a gaming console?"  "Yes."  In fact, Fang Zhao had prepared some things in advance.  Fang Zhao took out two boxes from the warehouse.  The first box contained a gaming helmet.  The curly-haired dog's eyes went wide at the sight of the brand-new gaming helmet. A real gaming helmet! Not a deceitful study machine, woof!  Fang Zhao opened the second, smaller box.  Inside was a personal terminal in the style of a pocket watch, decorated with a small dog pattern.  The curly-haired dog's attention shifted from the gaming console to the new personal terminal. This was the terminal it had longed for!!!  The curly-haired dog licked its nose and approached Fang Zhao, wagging its tail in a flattering manner.  "Which one do you want? You can only choose one," said Fang Zhao.  The curly-haired dog struggled to choose between the gaming helmet and the personal terminal, whimpering softly in indecision.  "Actually, there's another problem," Fang Zhao spoke up.  The curly-haired dog looked at Fang Zhao with big, innocent, and pitiful eyes.  "Whichever you choose, you won't be able to use it for long," said Fang Zhao.  "That's impossible!" The curly-haired dog was very protective of its belongings. Even if it didn't want to use the study machine, it would place it on the collection shelf and ask Fang Zhao to keep it safe.  Fang Zhao presented evidence, starting from the time the curly-haired dog tore up the floorboards to the recent magnetic anomaly incident's collected data.  "Every time you transform, you interfere with electronic devices, and in serious cases, it leads directly to their failure."  Facing the evidence, the curly-haired dog fell silent and became dejected.  "However," Fang Zhao continued, "I've seen great progress in you. From initially not being able to control your body's changes to now being able to independently complete a full-body transformation, I believe you'll soon be able to do so without affecting electronic devices."  Hearing Fang Zhao's words, the curly-haired dog regained confidence.  Fang Zhao gave it time to make a choice, provided it could control its impact on electronic devices.  The curly-haired dog quickly entered a new training period.  Even dogs should have goals. Goals give motivation and direction.  Otherwise, all it would think about was what to eat today, tomorrow, and in the future, sleeping after eating, and thinking about playing games upon waking.  Fang Zhao rearranged the warehouse to accommodate the curly-haired dog's transformed size.  Even if the curly-haired dog accidentally grew too large, it wouldn't burst the house.  Every day, the curly-haired dog practiced swallowing dog food cans, fruits, and bones, trying to control and reduce interference each time.  Now that its control over bodily changes had improved, with only head transformations releasing less interference than before, nearby electronic devices wouldn't be directly destroyed.  The trial mirror was put back in the warehouse by Fang Zhao.  Occasionally, the curly-haired dog would look at itself in the mirror to see its new form.  Only by looking in the mirror could it know what kind of dog it looked like.  After settling things with the curly-haired dog, Fang Zhao contacted Nan Feng and the others to replenish supplies.  Even though there were plenty of fish in the sea and possibly energy minerals on the seabed, it was still necessary to stock up on supplies.  Receiving Fang Zhao's order, Nan Feng and the others were full of questions. The amount of supplies Fang Zhao wanted to restock was too much. Dog food cans were one thing, as they were for the curly-haired dog to eat.  But there were so many fruits, meats, and compressed biscuits. With only Fang Zhao on the island, could he finish them all?  Looking at the shopping list, Nan Feng said to Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, "I suspect the boss secretly keeps a shark... Or some other fish? Oh, seeing the amount of cargo this time, maybe he's keeping more than one." Chapter 458: A Good Dog Brings Its Owner Bone Sticks  The boss has secrets, but Nanfeng and the other two dare not dig too deep, as they don't want to lose their jobs.  When Nanfeng and the others delivered supplies, Juanmao was no longer training in the warehouse, but was lying on the sofa watching TV. After inventorying the goods, Nanfeng looked back and said with a smile, "Yo, little Juanmao is watching TV again?"  After finishing his work, Nanfeng stretched his muscles and ran over to sit on the sofa to watch TV with Juanmao. The TV was showing a program about dogs, with a dog owner proudly showing off his dog. "Having a dog and land, you can tell they're from Muzhou," Nanfeng commented on the program content while drinking water.  "Hey, look at that shepherd dog in there, it even brings gifts to its owner! Look how happy the dog owner is! Little Juanmao, let me tell you, a good dog is one that can bring its owner bone sticks. When will you bring one for your owner? Your owner will definitely be very happy!"  Nanfeng was just saying this casually. He knew that Juanmao's intelligence was almost like that of a child, able to understand some simple words and commands, so he was just teasing Juanmao and didn't take it seriously after saying it.  However, Juanmao's ears moved, it looked at Nanfeng and then at the TV program, lying on the sofa as if pondering something.  "Boss, the goods are all loaded, and the electronic list has been sent to you, please check," Zuoyu said to Fang Zhao.  "Hard work," Fang Zhao replied.  "Do you want a domestic robot next time? It can sweep, cook, and even chat with you," Yan Biao suggested.  "Not for now," Fang Zhao shook his head. Before Juanmao could fully control its interference ability, it's better not to have too many electronic devices.  A while later, Nanfeng and the others left. Juanmao on the sofa immediately jumped up and shouted to Fang Zhao, "I'm going out for a bit!"  "Going far?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Not far, just swimming around the island."  Juanmao looked left and right but did not look directly at Fang Zhao. Fang Zhao's eyebrows twitched, knowing the dog had some small idea, but still said, "Go ahead."  "Woof! I'll be back soon!" After saying that, Juanmao ran off.  Fang Zhao wanted to see what the dog was up to, but he received an incoming call. It was from Molang.  After graduating from the Imperial Art Advanced Class, Fang Zhao had been in frequent contact with Molang. Fang Zhao went back to the room to take the call, as the wind outside was strong and there was too much noise.  Molang first asked if Fang Zhao had encountered any trouble and if the previous magnetic anomaly incident had affected him, advising Fang Zhao to hire more people. The Yan Zhou Navy had just caught some terrorists at sea, and Molang was worried about Fang Zhao's safety.  Of course, the reason Molang called was not only to express concern for Fang Zhao's safety after seeing the news but also to tell Fang Zhao an important piece of information.  "There's a very important performance, and all the invitees are very prestigious musicians. The organizers also have their eyes on you. Do you want to go?"  Hearing Molang's words, Fang Zhao remembered that one of the judges had mentioned a very important performance during the graduation concert, which was likely to be confidential.  "Who are the organizers?" Fang Zhao asked.  "The military. The venue is a bit far."  "Going."  Molang smiled, pleased with Fang Zhao's reply.  "This kind of performance will be beneficial for you in the future. Someone will contact you within a week. If you have any questions, you can ask them directly. You have nearly a month to arrange things on your planet."  "Alright."  One month should be enough. According to Molang, the performance venue was on another planet, and Fang Zhao couldn't know which one yet. However, if he were to participate in the performance, it wouldn't just be for three or five days. Fang Zhao felt uneasy if he didn't personally keep an eye on Juanmao, but there were risks in taking him to the performance. He could only wait and see Juanmao's performance over the next period.  If Juanmao could control not to interfere with electronic devices, Fang Zhao would take Juanmao to the performance. Of course, that was provided the organizers allowed dogs.  Even if he couldn't bring a dog, as long as Juanmao could skillfully control its abilities, it wouldn't be easily exposed. With the stimulation of the gaming helmet and personal terminal, Juanmao had made significant progress over the past few days, reducing the interference range to within the warehouse. Outside the warehouse, electronic devices were rarely or almost unaffected by interference.  After talking with Molang for a while, the call ended, and Fang Zhao checked the time. He had been talking with Molang for over half an hour.  Juanmao had not yet returned.  "Juanmao?" Fang Zhao walked out of the house and called a few times.  No response.  Listening carefully again, he heard sounds from beneath the sea near the island, like digging.  Fang Zhao didn't call out again but opened an electronic book and sat by the shore to read.  He was reading a legendary work revered by the people of Muzhou— "Su Mu Talks About Dogs." Written by an old war buddy he knew from the Era of Destruction.  As the leading figure in the battlefields of Muzhou, Su Mu's influence was significant, and his opinions and stories were collected and compiled into books by the people of Muzhou. "Su Mu Talks About Dogs" is about how Su Mu raised dogs. Of course, only part of it contained words actually spoken by Su Mu; the rest were analyses and expansions by later generations.  The people of Muzhou loved dogs partly because of the influence of their ancestors. However, true to his reputation as the first person recognized in the Era of Destruction for raising dogs, the content in the book made sense.  Fang Zhao thought he still had to learn more from this old war buddy with rich dog-raising experience.  Even if Juanmao turned into a mechanical dog, it was still a dog at its core.  As he was reading, Fang Zhao heard Juanmao coming ashore. Juanmao walked out of the sea without even bothering to shake off the water on its body, carrying a bone much larger than its head, trotting all the way.  Fang Zhao's eyelids twitched when he saw the bone. Probably for fear of breaking that bone, Juanmao was very careful, holding it in an almost sea lion ball-balancing pose, moving slowly with the bone that was five or six times its size.  Only when it reached Fang Zhao did Juanmao put down the bone. The bone had tooth marks and was cracked.  As a dog that could easily chew up a submarine, maintaining this was already the result of Juanmao's controlled effort.  After putting down the bone, Juanmao seemed much more relaxed, shook its fur, and shook off the seawater.  "This bone is too soft! It breaks on touch! The ones grown in rocks aren't even as hard as the rocks! I saw bones in the rocks when I was digging for fun underwater last time, but they don't taste good, not filling at all. But they're big! Especially big!" Juanmao wagged its tail, looking at Fang Zhao with a look that sought praise.  The bone it brought back was much larger than those the dogs from Muzhou brought back on TV.  "Amazing!" Fang Zhao said, patting its head before picking up the bone in front of him.  The bone wasn't whole; Juanmao had snapped it, and the break revealed some granular crystals. Part of the bone was still attached to a rock, as Juanmao wouldn't do such meticulous work while digging bones.  There were some lines on the bone, similar to blood vessels.  A fossil! A fossilized bone of some giant creature that lived tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of years ago!  The disasters and wars of the Era of Destruction destroyed too much. Survival was the priority, and everything else was secondary. Anything could become a sacrifice in that century-long battle for survival.  After the end of the Era of Destruction, people of the new era gradually became interested again and obsessed with those prehistoric giants. They tried to excavate again, but most of the time, they could only find fragments. Finding a complete skeleton could make a museum's treasure and give them something to boast about for many years.  The huge skeletons displayed in museums were mostly made using old-world materials and technological means, not real fossilized bones!  And according to the fossil trade records of the last twenty years, a tooth from a carnivorous dinosaur from seventy million years ago could be worth an apartment of over a hundred square meters in the center of Yan Zhou's Qian Market!  "Juanmao, your dog food is secured." Chapter 459: Dominating the Headlines in a Unique Way  Curl didn't quite understand what Fang Zhao meant; it truly didn't find the bone tasty at all, nor was it filling. However, it could tell that Fang Zhao really liked this "gift."  While Curl was standing proudly with its chest puffed out, waiting for Fang Zhao to continue praising it, Fang Zhao said, "Curl, if you can control your transformations within a week to not affect electronic devices within one meter, you can have both the terminal and the gaming helmet."  Curl was so surprised by this that it momentarily froze, and then it leaped up and vigorously wagged its tail to confirm with Fang Zhao, "Really?"  "Mhm. The timer starts now."  Curl immediately dashed off to the warehouse to practice.  Fang Zhao carefully placed the fossilized bone fragment that Curl had brought back and, after changing into a diving suit and gearing up, entered the sea and headed to the spot where Curl had dug the hole.  The sea near the island wasn't too deep. There were many signs of digging underwater, as Curl often dug holes and played with things underwater near the island.  The hole where Curl dug up the bone was small, only big enough for Curl itself to enter. Fang Zhao didn't use any tools to dig but instead took out a small energy wave emitter.  Without a professional detector, Fang Zhao had to rely on his own hearing to get a rough idea of the situation within the rock layer. Listening carefully to the changes of the sound waves within the rock layer, Fang Zhao's brain was like a tomographic imaging device, sketching out a rough picture of the situation inside the rock layer.  There were many disturbances within the rock layer, but Fang Zhao had gained a preliminary understanding.  After returning to the shore, Fang Zhao marked several spots on the ground and started digging with tools. Of course, he wasn't planning to dig out the giant beast's fossil, which had been buried for who knows how many years, by himself with limited tools. He was just doing some preliminary work to divert people's attention and cover up the "abnormal" traces left by Curl's digging process.  Over the next few days, Fang Zhao did this work, which was made easier by the fact that part of the giant beast was large enough to be directly excavated on the island, though the digging was a bit deep.  On the other hand, Curl, stimulated by the promise of a gaming console and a personal terminal, made rapid progress. It didn't take a week; in just five days, Curl managed to reduce the interference range to within one meter and then eagerly ran to Fang Zhao to ask for its reward.  A gaming console! A personal terminal! How long had it waited!  It felt great not having to choose between the two!  Fang Zhao didn't deceive Curl. After checking and finding that Curl really met the requirements, he gave Curl both the gaming helmet and the terminal, even specially modifying the pocket watch-style terminal into a dog collar and putting it around Curl's neck.  "You can use these two things normally, but keep them away during transformations. Remember to take off the terminal before transforming," Fang Zhao instructed as he put the terminal-equipped dog collar on Curl.  "Roar!" Curl responded.  Curl would always be mindful of these instructions; after all, these were hard-earned rewards. How could it not take good care of its very own gaming console and terminal, the first it ever owned in its dog life!  After putting on the special collar, Curl even ran to the warehouse mirror and admired its reflection for nearly two hours. Curl was familiar with the gaming helmet, and the terminal was new to it, but the operation was very simple. After reading the electronic manual written by Fang Zhao once, Curl remembered it. Now, Curl didn't need to run to Fang Zhao to talk; it could just speak through the terminal!  While Curl was admiring itself in the warehouse mirror, Fang Zhao looked over the "Children's Terminal Usage Instructions" once more and deleted it.  However, the fact that Curl managed to reduce the interference range to within one meter in just five days was beyond his expectations. It seemed that Curl's control over its abilities was getting stronger and stronger. He would have to raise the standards in the future.  After dealing with Curl's matter, Fang Zhao contacted three people named Nan Feng and started a voice group chat.  When they received the group chat notification from Fang Zhao, the three didn't dare to delay and immediately went online to wait for their boss's orders.  The trio guessed that the boss usually contacted them once a week, and now it had only been five days. Had the island run out of supplies? That shouldn't be the case; they had sent so much last time, enough for a month of food and drink. Had something happened? But looking at the boss's demeanor, he didn't seem to be in a hurry. Or possibly... was he finally going to reveal his secret to them? For example, keeping a group of sharks on the island?  Suppressing the surging curiosity in their hearts, the trio patiently waited for Fang Zhao's words.  "Curl dug up a bone," Fang Zhao said.  Nan Feng's voice was excited, "Our little Curl is already bringing bones home!"  Left Yu ignored Nan Feng's silly expression, "Boss, is it human or animal bones?"  The now sober Nan Feng, with a serious expression, asked, "Is there a problem?"  According to the island purchase contract, the island was not a deadly one. Since the last owner bought it, there had been no accidental deaths. After all, the previous owner didn't live there much, and besides some simple renovations and building construction, nothing else had been buried there.  Could it be that there was some malevolent event that even the previous owner didn't know about?  If it were just ordinary bird or beast bones, there would be no need to contact them.  The three watched as Fang Zhao seemed to be not frightened, so they patiently waited for the rest of what Fang Zhao had to say.  "After preliminary identification, it is a bone fossil, belonging to a giant beast from tens of millions or even a hundred million years ago," Fang Zhao continued.  The trio: "..."  Sounds of sharp intakes of breath could be heard.  "A fossil?" Left Yu's lips were trembling.  Yan Biao didn't know much about fossils but was still relatively calm... calm my foot!  "Is it a dinosaur? The legendary prehistoric giant beast!" As a dinosaur enthusiast, Yan Biao wished he could fly over there immediately.  He loved listening to dinosaur stories as a child and even fantasized about becoming a dinosaur hunter!  "It's not necessarily a dinosaur; it could also be some kind of marine reptile," Fang Zhao said.  "To me, they're all dinosaurs!" Yan Biao didn't care about the specific definition of a dinosaur; land or marine, in his eyes, those creatures from that period were all dinosaurs!  Yan Biao asked Fang Zhao to send several more photos of the bone fossil, "This bone is really big! There must be a big creature buried underground! Boss, you can't dig it out by yourself; I'm coming to help you now!"  Nan Feng, on the other hand, had been silent, but there was some noise. After a while, when Left Yu and Yan Biao had calmed down a bit, they heard Nan Feng speak.  "Boss! I just checked the relevant laws and consulted a few authoritative lawyers. In the new century, fossils have become a commodity that can be traded, and anything dug up from a private island is privately owned! Boss!! You've hit the jackpot!!!" The latter half of the sentence was screamed, showing how excited Nan Feng was at the moment.  Private island transactions had all been explored before. However, early explorations were mainly to detect whether there were energy minerals or dangerous substances such as the doomsday virus. The island Fang Zhao bought was the same.  Don't even think about energy minerals; if they were there, they would have been mined long ago, and even the island might have become non-tradeable. Therefore, islands without energy minerals, after a certain range is delineated, become commodities for merchants to buy and sell, including everything on the island.  Fossils are a big deal for circles such as new century archaeology, collecting, and paleontology research. Over the years, if not for the fact that the number of fossils dug up is really too small, they would not have gradually been ignored by people.  In fact, countless fossils of ancient creatures that have passed through millions of years of historical mist, such as certain insects and plants, can still be dug up even after the doomsday century, but people still have a special fondness for dinosaurs; it's just that dinosaur fossils are too rare.  However, who would have thought that under such a remote little island, there would be ancient creature fossils from tens of millions of years ago?  Fossils! Real fossils!!  Different from the excitement of Nan Feng and the others, Fang Zhao calmly arranged the fossil excavation related matters. To excavate fossils, it's still necessary to find a professional team.  Therefore, Fang Zhao took photos of the excavated bone fossils and also shot a video of the excavation site he had made, posted them on social media platforms, and expressed that he was sincerely looking for a professional team to cooperate with.  After the post was sent out, Fang Zhao's personal terminal never stopped ringing. Those research bigwigs always found a way to get his contact information. Major media outlets also directly called to inquire.  That day, many people were stunned by the real-time pushed news headlines.  "Fossils? Are those the ones mentioned in textbooks from millions or even hundreds of millions of years ago... the fossils of prehistoric overlords? Are they real or just hype?"  "Looking at the already excavated bones, they are big enough, and the rest still haven't been dug out; it's definitely a big creature!"  "Is it Fang Zhao again? This way of dominating the headlines is truly unique."  "Was it his dog that dug it up? I suspect the bone with the scent of earth my dog gave me yesterday was also a fossil! But I threw it in the garbage processor— I feel like I've lost billions!"  ...  Fang Zhao, who already had a following, plus the fact that dinosaur fossils have special significance in the new century, made this a big event, and the whole world knew—on a small island recently purchased by Fang Zhao, his dog, yes, the nearly three billion-dollar Curl, dug up a dinosaur bone from tens of millions of years ago.  The news was so significant that it directly moved the traffic of several circles for a while. At the same time, more professional excavation teams were flying to Fang Zhao's island. Chapter 460: The Bustling Island  The discovery of dinosaur fossils by Fang Zhao on the island caused many island owners, who had originally planned to sell their islands, to hurriedly take down their for-sale signs and contact professional detection teams to check their own islands and the seabed nearby. No, they wouldn't be reassured until they contacted at least three different teams to check more than three times!  "Quick, quick, quick! See if the island I bought has buried fossils!" For a time, many professional fossil detection teams, which had been almost on the verge of disbanding and had been ignored by people, were revived!  It's a pity that all the senior research teams are now focusing on Fang Zhao's island. They don't know about other islands, but they are sure there are fossils on Fang Zhao's island, and it's a big one!  As a result, the anxious island owners could only find geological survey teams or other non-scientific research teams. Some teams that had already flown to Fang Zhao's island changed their route temporarily due to high compensation offers, planning to check the employer's island first. Who knows, they might detect fossils too?  The most frustrated one was the former owner who sold the island to Fang Zhao. He knew all too well the many flaws of his island: its remote location, difficulty in management, and the huge costs that would be required for transformation. Considering market conditions, it could not be commercialized quickly. How happy he was when he sold it, getting rid of a problem.  But how long had it been since he sold it? Half a month? Watching the news that was being pushed to him, the former owner almost spat out a mouthful of blood. He was filled with regret and hatred, his face twisted in frustration.  However, that's how business transactions are. It's hard to say who the winner is. Yesterday, he thought he was the big winner, but today he found himself losing face. Look how many jokes are being made about the person who sold the island to Fang Zhao online!  Thinking of the fossils buried beneath, the former owner's heart was bleeding. Regret! He should have re-investigated the island back then!  Fang Zhao! Sinister! Too sinister! He didn't believe that Fang Zhao hadn't received advance news! He must have known about the dinosaur fossils beneath the island and that's why he was in a hurry to buy it!  Indeed, every one of Fang Zhao's actions is purposeful! Every move is worth studying, you can never guess what he will do next!!  Because of the news stirred up by Fang Zhao this time, people around the world were discussing it so much that even Molang, who didn't usually pay attention to the news, got to know about it.  Molang originally thought Fang Zhao would be preparing for a performance on that remote island, but he didn't expect that just a few days later, there would be another commotion! Concerned, Molang quickly called Fang Zhao to make sure he wouldn't forget about the upcoming performance due to the fossil matter, as it was a very important event related to his future!  Of course, Fang Zhao hadn't forgotten about the important performance. Recently, besides dealing with the fossil matter, he had been preparing for the performance.  After reassuring the anxious Molang and ending the call, Fang Zhao saw Curly approach him.  Curly ran up to Fang Zhao, lifted its chin, and looked up at him almost as if gazing at the sky.  "The new collar looks good, quite nice," Fang Zhao said.  Curly barked happily and expressed, "Next time I'll dig bones in a different place!"  "Do you like digging bones?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Like!" Curly replied without hesitation.  There's a game console to play with when digging bones! Look, this time it dug up half a bone and got a game console and a terminal. What a good deal!  Fang Zhao thought of something and nodded, "Alright."  He had changed his mind. He originally planned to exchange the fossils for dog food, but now Curly could control its own transformation and could hunt for food in the sea by itself. As long as it didn't stay transformed for too long, the consumption wasn't too big, and he could still afford to keep it.  Moreover, this fossil event could probably earn him a sum of dog food money, so there was no need to rush to sell the fossils.  In the future, if Curly brings back more bone fossils or some other things, he would also help Curly to keep them. Didn't his old comrade Su Mu's book say it, "Take every gift they give you seriously"? Fang Zhao thought that made sense.  Or, he could just set up a private collection museum and collect everything Curly picked up into the museum.  The more Fang Zhao thought about it, the more he felt it was a good idea.  Digging bones is better than playing games at home all day.  Fang Zhao had already told Curly about the arrival of many strangers on the island. Curly wasn't worried; it could now control its interference and wouldn't suddenly transform and scare people. No matter how many came, it wasn’t worried about being exposed.  However, with more outsiders coming to its territory, Curly decided to patrol its territory more, both on water and underwater!  "Is this terminal waterproof?" Curly asked worriedly.  "Water-resistant up to 200 meters. As long as the diving depth doesn't exceed 200 meters, it should be fine," Fang Zhao replied.  "Only 200 meters?" Curly decided to be more careful and not to wear the terminal when patrolling the water.  Hearing the sound of a flying vehicle landing, Curly looked over and then ran towards the direction with its dog legs spread out.  It was Nan Feng and his two companions arriving.  After receiving Fang Zhao's call, Nan Feng and the others rushed over immediately. Even before they landed, they had noticed that the southeast part of the island was already riddled with holes.  But it didn't matter! Digging up fossils, they wouldn't mind even if it was all dug up!  Just getting off the flying vehicle, Nan Feng saw Curly running up to them. Curly raised its head to show them the new terminal on its neck.  If it were any other time, Nan Feng might have noticed, but now his mind was filled with dinosaur fossils, and he didn't pay attention to Curly's subtle emotions.  Now, looking at Curly, it was like looking at a hen that lays golden eggs. "Look at our little Curly, knowing that it has done a great thing, standing tall and proud! Good job, Curly!" Nan Feng said excitedly.  Curly's pair of dark dog eyes looked at him.  Then he heard Nan Feng continue, "Your owner is going to make a fortune this time. That's a dinosaur! And a very big one. Thousands of years ago, a small dog like you wouldn't be enough to fill the gaps between its teeth!"  Curly glanced at them again and walked away.  Nan Feng had no time to care about so much now. He first learned about the situation from Fang Zhao, then went with Yan Biao and Zuo Yu to dig out two fossil bones themselves, excitedly turned on the camera, and took a mad flurry of photos, showing off on social circles and social platforms.  Since there were others coming soon, the three of them didn't have much leisure time. After digging up the fossils, taking photos, and showing off, they each got busy with their own things.  The fossils buried under Fang Zhao's island were likely the first complete prehistoric behemoth fossils over 20 meters long to be discovered in the new century for over 500 years, attracting a strong interest, and various teams arrived quickly.  However, the island was privately owned, including the surrounding areas, all belonging to private property. Trespassing without the owner's permission, Fang Zhao could directly open fire.  Nan Feng was responsible for communicating with these teams.  Fang Zhao also hired some people to come over to maintain order on the island and its surroundings. The Yanzhou Navy also said they would send a team over to help. There were too many people coming, all from various continents, and the Yanzhou Navy had to take it seriously.  This time, even if it wasn't Fang Zhao, if it were someone else, they would negotiate with the island owner.  Fortunately, Fang Zhao was very cooperative.  After Fang Zhao sent out that message looking for partners, professional research teams from various continents actively requested to participate in this excavation operation without asking for compensation, as long as Fang Zhao allowed them to join the excavation.  Some people even fought over it, just to compete for a spot.  In addition to these teams, various media outlets were not far behind, and Yanzhou TV even scheduled an interview with Fang Zhao.  The originally quiet island became bustling, and some temporary housing was quickly erected.  The sea near the island was also full of ships of various sizes, and the number was still increasing.  If they couldn't land on the island, they would live on ships!  People who wanted to see the excitement also grouped together to charter boats to go there. As long as they did not enter the private island's territorial waters, it would not be considered trespassing.  There were many private flying vehicles in the sky. Without permission, they did not dare to fly into private areas, only flying around nearby, with people holding telescopes to observe. There were also those who did live internet broadcasts.  This excavation operation was very significant, and competition among the teams was fierce.  Fang Zhao chose twelve teams from twelve continents, mostly research-based teams, from among these teams.  Such a large project being divided among them, the teams were not very happy at first, but they understood Fang Zhao's intentions. If anyone was unwilling, they could leave.  There were still many private teams waiting eagerly on the side, just waiting for a team to leave so they could squeeze in.  Therefore, even if they were not happy about sharing with others, the twelve teams still agreed. No one wanted to give up this opportunity, and now they could only cooperate.  Fortunately, Fang Zhao did not micromanage, saying that he trusted the professionals with professional matters.  This time, Fang Zhao also met with the representatives from the world's number one collecting family, the Blaine family, who had come to him proactively.  Fang Zhao had some impression of the Blaine family. During the era of world destruction, this family made a huge contribution in the imperial continent's battlefield. Today, they own the largest private museum in the imperial continent—the Blaine Museum.  The Blaine Museum has the only Tyrannosaurus rex skull in the world, as well as a complete Velociraptor fossil.  Apart from those precious collections, what the Blaine family is most famous for are the people in their family.  The Blaine family members, regardless of gender, are very attractive. However, it is well known that this family does not value looks. Not long ago, a family member almost turned into a wild man just to find a hundred-million-year-old amber insect.  This time, the leader of the Blaine family and also the director of the Blaine Museum, knew that private teams were not easily able to participate alone, so they joined forces with the imperial continent's museum to form an excavation team to cooperate with Fang Zhao.  He came to Fang Zhao hoping that after the dinosaur is dug up, they could rent it for two months each year, with the Blaine Museum and the imperial continent's museum each displaying it for a month.  It would be great if they could buy it directly, they didn't mind paying more, but Fang Zhao made it clear when they first arrived that he wouldn't sell.  So, they could only ask for the next best thing. If they couldn't buy it, then they would rent it.  Fang Zhao didn't want to talk about these matters right now: "Let's talk after it is dug up."  He had to see the performance of these teams before deciding.  The management capability of different museums and their attention to collections vary. Fang Zhao didn't want the dinosaur that was dug up to be ruined by careless museums.  The Blaine Museum director didn't expect Fang Zhao to agree now, he just hoped that after the fossil was excavated, if Fang Zhao was looking for partners, he would consider them first. They came with the greatest sincerity!  The Blaine family brought five people with the museum director this time, regardless of gender. They all personally participated in the excavation work.  Sweat was shed, dust flew, and their faces were smeared with mud and water so that their appearances could not be clearly seen, only those pairs of fervent eyes were visible.  They didn't care about the cameras that followed them, nor did they mind appearing in front of a global audience like that. After all, the style of their family had long been famous.  What is a face worth? The fossil is what's important!  With many professional teams properly assigned, the work efficiency was much higher.  While they were busy digging fossils, Fang Zhao was already surrounded by reporters.  A reporter from Yanzhou TV, which had the advantage of being local, was the first to come to interview Fang Zhao.  "How did you first discover the fossils? Was it really your dog that found them?" The reporter glanced at the dog sitting next to Fang Zhao and asked with a smile.  "Yes, it was it that dug up the first bone," Fang Zhao confirmed.  The camera turned to Curly, which was sitting next to Fang Zhao.  Curly's dog head lifted slightly, showing off its collar and the terminal with a little dog pattern, not letting a single dog hair cover it.  On the other side, the camera, after filming the dog for a while, turned back to Fang Zhao.  The reporter asked some questions that the public was very curious about, such as why Curly was able to find the underground fossils.  Fang Zhao explained, "Just after buying the island, there was reconstruction on the island. Due to the construction, the rock layer below was exposed, but nobody paid attention to it. It was Curly that dug up that bone."  Nan Feng and the others who were following the interview: "......" To weaken the power of his own ears, the boss even pushed this to Curly? Don't other people know, but don't they know? There were no large-scale constructions on the island!  As for why Fang Zhao would buy this island, he simply said he wanted to find a quiet place that wouldn't be disturbed, and that discovering the fossils was really just luck.  Luck? Most people didn't believe it.  Ha, what luck! Does he still need to cover up his ears now?!  Regardless of what the reporters thought internally, they kept a face of "So that's how it is" on the surface, and followed the conversation by praising the obedient Curly sitting next to Fang Zhao.  Curly, being praised by everyone, was very proud and excited! After the interview, it ran around to patrol its territory, and when the time came for the broadcast, it stayed in front of the TV.  As an official television station in the Yanzhou region, the news was quite serious. The interview segments that were broadcast were Fang Zhao's original words, with no distortion or ambiguous editing.  Curly's footage also got several seconds of airtime. In today's environment where even tabloid news is in ultra-high-definition, the official TV station's news footage was clear enough for viewers to see the dog.  The terminal on the dog's collar, probably to avoid suspicion of advertising, was pixelated by the TV station.  Curly, which had been guarding the TV: "......" Chapter 461: The Watchdog  Curly, who failed to show off his new collar, was deeply struck and became listless. Fang Zhao went to the excavation team, and when he returned, he saw Nanfeng anxiously saying something to Curly, but Curly just walked slowly with his head down.  Seeing Fang Zhao, Nanfeng quickly reported the abnormal behavior of Curly. "Boss, is Curly having a stomach problem? Or is he not used to the strangers coming to the island? Is he sick? He was fine before."  Fang Zhao took the leash, signaling Nanfeng to go about his business, and he would handle it here.  Walking Curly back to the house, Fang Zhao could roughly guess the reason for Curly's behavior. "Curly, I have a task for you," said Fang Zhao.  Having something to do, Curly wouldn't have time to dwell on other things. Curly looked up at Fang Zhao.  "A large warehouse has been built on the southeast side of the island, and all the unearthed bone fossils are stored there. Help me guard it, and don't let anyone steal them."  The prehistoric creatures buried under the island were too large, and excavating them was difficult to minimize damage to the fossils. Although there were twelve teams responsible, they couldn't finish in one or two days.  Fang Zhao built a temporary large warehouse on the southeast side of the island, not only to store fossils but also tools and supplies for the excavation teams, including a temporary rest area.  Although a security system had been installed, Fang Zhao trusted Curly's abilities more and at the same time wanted to divert Curly's attention.  Recently, there were too many people on the island, and Curly always needed someone to lead him when moving elsewhere, requiring a leash which restricted his movement.  Now, Fang Zhao simply let him move freely inside the big warehouse. It might be a bit small, but there was no need for a leash.  "If you perform well, I'll take you to an alien planet to play after a while," Fang Zhao said.  Curly's eyes brightened, and he perked up instantly. He knew that Fang Zhao would leave for a performance after a while, and he might not be able to follow.  Now that Fang Zhao said this, of course, he was happy.  So, Nanfeng, who had just finished a phone call and was walking back, saw Curly rush into the warehouse like the wind, full of vigor.  "What's this?" Nanfeng asked Fang Zhao, puzzled.  "Guarding the warehouse door," replied Fang Zhao.  Fang Zhao greeted the warehouse staff and hung a sign next to the "Notice" at the warehouse entrance: Danger! No entry for non-staff!!!  The warehouse staff stared at the three exclamation marks on the warning sign, wondering what the danger was. They had been working there for two days and hadn't noticed any dangers in the warehouse. It was just a dog that had been added.  "Will the island owner's dog chew on the bones?" someone worried.  "If it's placed on the table, it can't reach it."  "Since Fang Zhao chose to let it in, he'll be responsible if something happens."  Even though the warehouse staff were reluctant to see a pet dog in such a place, who could argue when Fang Zhao was the island owner?  Alright, you're the owner, you can do as you please.  Curly, who had entered the warehouse, was already in work mode. To show results and have Fang Zhao take him to an alien planet to play, he inspected the warehouse very carefully.  He walked around the warehouse, checking every nook and cranny, not letting even a bug slip by.  After patrolling, Curly lay at the warehouse entrance, watching the staff coming in and out without barking or running around, taking his job as a watchdog seriously.  Meanwhile, at a distance from the island, a yacht was at a standstill, surrounded by many other boats that were there to observe the situation. This one was inconspicuous.  "We've successfully infiltrated the island and are very well disguised! The current bionic technology is amazing, it was worth the high price we paid on the black market, the seller didn't cheat us!"  "According to the manual, this is the latest bionic technology that can bypass most civilian security systems. It's useful but expensive, and we can't be sure how long it will last. We've invested a lot of our fortunes into this."  "And it's also small, only able to carry objects under twenty kilograms."  "I'm not greedy, I just want a small piece of bone. With such a large skeleton, missing one or two small ones certainly won't be noticed."  "I'm not greedy either, I'll be satisfied with just one bone."  "We'll split the money from the sale!"  "There's a night guard at the warehouse, we need to be extra careful."  "Don't worry, I've added a dissolving anesthetic needle, strong enough to knock out an elephant, and the needle can't be found."  "Fang Zhao is too impatient. As soon as he found the fossils, he made it public without being prepared. On this isolated island surrounded by sea, with so many people coming, there aren't enough security personnel."  "Moreover, Fang Zhao trusts so-called intelligent security systems too much, he's still too young, not knowing the pace of electronic equipment upgrades."  "Shall we act at night?"  "Yes, it's more convenient at night."  The sun set, and the night grew deeper.  The busy excavation team returned to their quarters, and after a simple cleanup, they rested. At first, they were too excited to sleep, and on the second day, they slept late. By the third day, the workload wasn't very large during the day, but it was particularly draining. A slight inattention could damage the fossils, and they didn't trust intelligent machines to excavate on such an important matter. They all chose to do it themselves.  So, when night came, they seized the time to recuperate.  According to the current progress, in two more days, the entire beast buried under the island could be unearthed, and they would be able to see the skeleton of this prehistoric giant that had been buried for tens of millions of years!  The excavation staff entered their dreams with smiles on their faces, unaware that in the darkness, many shadows were stirring.  The island was much quieter at night, and nocturnal insects came out one after another.  A small reptile crawled out from the bushes towards the warehouse.  On the sea outside the island, in a certain yacht, a few people stared at the monitor screen.  The footage was from the reptile's perspective, approaching the warehouse, and the next moment, it was about to squeeze through a window crack.  The people watched intently, and just as they were about to rejoice at having entered the warehouse, they heard a harsh "zzt—" sound, and the connection was lost.  "What happened?"  "Was it discovered?"  "Has the civilian security system been upgraded?"  "That shouldn't be the case. How could it be upgraded so soon after the new generation of bionic technology came out? It wasn't this fast before."  "The security system in the warehouse was set up by Fang Zhao's bodyguard and a security company. Maybe they used military equipment?"  A repressive silence followed.  That was most of their fortune!  On the sea outside the island, on many inconspicuous boats, similar incidents occurred.  The high-priced detection devices, stealth photography tools, and intelligent theft tools they had bought through various underground channels and said to be made with new bionic technology were all lost as soon as they were deployed. Each one went offline as soon as it entered the warehouse, some seemed to be crushed, others just disappeared abruptly.  Whether they flew in, crawled in, or burrowed in from underground, the result was the same.  Forget stealing a bone, they didn't even manage to take a single photo!  They also quietly inquired about which company helped with Fang Zhao's security system.  However, they didn't believe the information they found out.  It must be a superficial message, released to mislead people!  Indeed, the more powerful you are, the more secretive. Fang Zhao must be hiding a trump card!  Could it be that Fang Zhao really sought the help of the military?  Inside the newly built warehouse on the southeast side of the island, Curly carefully carried a severely deformed reptile in his mouth, placing it in a box in the corner.  The fifteenth one!  Collecting twenty would earn him an extra chance at a game console! Chapter 462: Top Apex Predator  The security system at the warehouse was mainly controlled by Zuo Yu and Yan Biao, who took turns on watch. Juan Mao's behavior was, of course, under their surveillance. Juan Mao knew about the cameras in the warehouse and understood that this was another test given by Fang Zhao. To prevent Juan Mao from developing a bad habit of eating anything it sees, Fang Zhao had indeed made considerable efforts, and this was also a test to see if Juan Mao had corrected its behavior.  Juan Mao was very willing to participate; it could swallow these small bugs even without transforming, and they wouldn't even be detected by the surveillance, or should it just catch a few for fun? But if catching twenty bugs would earn it an extra gaming session, it certainly wouldn't want to miss out. It counted each bug carefully as it released them, worried that someone might tamper with its box.  Yan Biao, on duty in the monitoring room tonight, couldn't help but be amazed. "Deserving of a dog that has done inspection work!" He had already noticed that the number of bugs in the warehouse was unusually high tonight, even though pest control had been done.  Watching Juan Mao catch each bug one by one and put them into the box Fang Zhao had prepared, Yan Biao knew something was wrong when one of the bugs emitted sparks as Juan Mao stepped on it. He immediately contacted Fang Zhao.  Fang Zhao instructed that the warehouse should be personally guarded by Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, without substitutions or allowing others near the monitoring room. If they needed to take leave, they could directly explain to Fang Zhao, and Nan Feng would cover for them or Fang Zhao himself would come to guard.   If there was any abnormal event at the warehouse, they must inform Fang Zhao immediately and not leak any information to the outside.  Yan Biao and Zuo Yu simply thought Fang Zhao was attaching great importance to the fossils and didn't find his orders unusual. However, after Yan Biao promptly reported the anomalies to Fang Zhao, Fang Zhao only told him to keep an eye on the monitors and not to worry about the things Juan Mao had caught.  Yan Biao also consulted some retired comrades to gain some insights. Recently, there had been a surge in sales of bionic devices on the black market, although they were pricey and rarely purchased. With the recent fossil news from Fang Zhao's side, the sales of these bionic devices on the black market had skyrocketed. Just now, he had received a warning from a comrade.  It turned out that the security system was not as useful as Juan Mao. None of those released devices had managed to get close to the dinosaur fossils!  Watching Juan Mao pull out a seemingly ordinary weed from a crack and throw it into the box, Yan Biao sighed deeply, thinking that it was time to upgrade the security system tomorrow. If everything depended on Juan Mao, wouldn't he become utterly redundant?  For the next two days, various disguised objects, some looking like insects, others like plants, all with excellent camouflage, attempted to infiltrate the warehouse. However, none of the skeletal fossils sent to the warehouse were stolen, and no unauthorized photos leaked.  There were also attempts to bribe the staff, but Fang Zhao's selected team consisted of experienced members with strict internal management. If there were any, they would be expelled from within before Fang Zhao needed to take action.  When they signed the contract with Fang Zhao, it stated that if anyone within a team caused an issue, the entire team would be held responsible. They would not only be expelled from the project but also have to pay a hefty penalty. Because of this, they were even more active than Fang Zhao in rooting out any traitors.  One noon, a digger feeling unwell was asked by the leading professor to rest in the warehouse's resting room. As the worker entered the warehouse carrying a box, he was stopped by Juan Mao's barking.  The warehouse guards gathered around, and other workers also turned to look. The worker holding the box turned pale, not because he was guilty but because he was genuinely scared.  The guards took him aside and opened the box that Juan Mao had been staring at. Juan Mao pointed its paw at a geological hammer inside the box. The stopped worker's expression changed dramatically: "This isn't my hammer! My hammer has my name engraved on it! There's no name on this one!"  He quickly contacted the leading professor, "Professor! My box has been tampered with!"  In order to protect his prized student and keep his team in the project, the professor reacted swiftly and cooperated fully with the investigation. Soon, the team members proved their innocence and helped catch three suspicious individuals.  The incident in this team made other digging teams more vigilant. Besides themselves, no one was allowed to touch their toolboxes! They checked their clothing every day and were extremely cautious around anyone who tried to approach them.  Before, they were eager to be interviewed by mainstream media; now, the media were the ones trying to block them every day. If it hadn't been for the tampered box incident, they might still be somewhat complacent, but the day's events served as a cold reality check.  It was the final stage of the excavation, and the skeletal fossils were nearly all unearthed. Being kicked out of the project at this moment would be a huge regret! They couldn't afford to stumble at this critical time!  Soon, others on the island noticed that while the digging teams used to work with laughter, the atmosphere had now become very serious. No matter how busy, there was always a team member responsible for watching the surroundings.  With the combined efforts of the twelve teams, the skeletal fossils buried beneath the island were finally excavated. The skeletons were relatively intact with not many parts needing replacement. After computer simulation and reconstruction of the skeletons, they proceeded with the mounting process.  The moment the mounting was completed, they looked up at the nearly fifty-meter-long skeleton, as if they had traveled through time and seen the apex predator of the seas from seventy million years ago. A young worker on site was beside himself with excitement, while several older professors in charge of the mounting were moved to tears.  "I never thought... I would be able to see the top predator of the seas from seventy million years ago with my own eyes!" After an hour of non-stop discussion around the newly unearthed gigantic skeleton, they had to face one issue.  "It needs a name," said one of the leading professors.  After searching through a lot of data and finding nothing corresponding, they were certain that what they had unearthed was an unknown species, so it needed a name. But the problem was that this find was not discovered by a single team but by several teams together, and the skeleton belonged to the island's owner.  "Should we follow the naming rules?" "Do we have the right to name it?" "What about Fang Zhao? Hey, Fang Zhao, the island owner! This naming..."  "Whatever you decide is fine," Fang Zhao said.  The leading professors were thinking of how to persuade Fang Zhao if he named it casually, but to their surprise, Fang Zhao left the naming decision to them.  In the old century, such paleontological fossils of scientific research value belonged to the state. Although the new century's cultural relics management law was different, Fang Zhao did not have much attachment to these matters. If it hadn't been for Juan Mao, Fang Zhao might have directly donated the skeleton to one or several museums.  Fang Zhao glanced at Juan Mao, who was yawning next to the box of insects. Apart from games and eating, this dog really had no interest in anything else.  Hearing Fang Zhao say he would leave the naming to them, one elderly professor trembled with excitement, and his quick-thinking assistant immediately gave the old man a couple of pills.  The twelve excavation teams engaged in a heated debate over the naming. In the end, they named this prehistoric apex marine predator "Hai Huang Long" (Sea Emperor Dragon). It was the largest skeletal fossil discovered to date, and judging by the teeth, it was carnivorous, undoubtedly an apex predator of its time. The word "Emperor" was fitting.  Next was the documentation process, which led to another intense debate among the twelve teams. Strictly speaking, the newly unearthed Sea Emperor Dragon should be classified as a marine reptile, and theoretically not a dinosaur. However, mainstream culture commonly referred to creatures living during that period with distinctive characteristics as dinosaurs.  There was a proposal in the new century for paleontologists to re-establish classifications. Gaps were significant in the new century's paleontological research, and the limited data left from the old century were only taken as a reference, not wholly believed. They only trusted their own research.  After the documentation was complete, a paleontologist professor held Fang Zhao's hand, "I see you have a connection with dinosaurs, would you be interested in participating in paleontology research?"  Fang Zhao: "...No."  These people were asking him to study paleontology under false pretenses; their actual goal was the Sea Emperor Dragon's skeleton.  In the following two days, news about the "Sea Emperor Dragon" almost dominated their screens on various online platforms. Whether it was the archaeological circle, entertainment circle, dinosaur enthusiasts, early childhood education, life sciences, geology research, and so on, it was all about the Sea Emperor Dragon.  The general public felt a sense of shock and comfort, thinking, "Our planet also once had such huge creatures, not inferior to those alien creatures that have been revealed." They went online and raved about it, making up all sorts of stories as if they had seen it with their own eyes.  "Those 'ocean masters' discovered before now seem like little brothers." "Unbeatable! Truly unbeatable!" "Apex predator of the ocean! Looking forward to a Sea Emperor Dragon movie!" "I wonder if the Sea Emperor Dragon skeleton will be on public display?" "The skeleton is too valuable; I guess it won't be open to the public." "A model would do, when will the Sea Emperor Dragon model be available?" "This... That probably depends on Fang Zhao's decision." "I declare, the only one who can stand on the Sea Emperor Dragon's head is Fang Zhao!" "...Huh?" "That's right, actually. Fang Zhao is literally living above the Sea Emperor Dragon's grave, so saying he's standing on its head isn't wrong."  Soon, a new topic emerged. #FangZhao, TheManWhoStandsOnTheSeaEmperorDragon'sHead#  Nan Feng laughed at the suddenly trending topic on the social networking platform. These days, because of the Sea Emperor Dragon's skeletal fossil, other things aside, just the rent collected was a substantial amount.  "Boss, you really struck it rich this time! If you sell the skeleton, you'll return to the billion-dollar club!"  "I'm not planning to sell," said Fang Zhao.  After a moment of surprise, Nan Feng had a moment of realization: "Right! How could you sell such a unique and valuable item in the world? It must be kept in your hands for a couple of years!"  "I plan to open a collection gallery, not just for the Sea Emperor Dragon, but I might gradually add some other things," Fang Zhao added.  "A collection gallery?" Nan Feng was surprised again, then realized, thinking: That's the boss for you, always thinking long-term.   Temporarily not selling the skeletal fossil and opening his own museum to play with, he could also make money with various peripheral products! The Sea Emperor Dragon is the largest living creature unearthed on this planet to date. There might be larger creatures on other planets, but for paleontologists, their own planet's history was still unclear, so how could they have the energy to look at extraterrestrial ones?  Moreover, people's attachment to their own planet is irreplaceable, with the history of human development and a shared history for all. Emotionally, there's a bias.  Apart from these, under the current policies and management, there is a strict limit on extraterrestrial organisms. In terms of collection value, those from this planet undoubtedly take precedence; others cannot replace them.  Feeling like he had guessed Fang Zhao's thoughts, Nan Feng was satisfied. His boss still had an investment mindset.  Nan Feng looked at the various possible appearances of the Sea Emperor Dragon simulated by the research team and exclaimed: "Worthy of the ocean's apex predator, no matter which one looks fierce enough. It's a good thing it's extinct."  "It's just that I don't know what the universe's top predators look like."  Nan Feng began to fantasize again, "They must also be quite impressive."  Fang Zhao glanced at Juan Mao, who was still counting insects beside the box, and said, "Not necessarily. Some creatures look cute but have great lethality."  Nan Feng: "Hahaha, boss, you're so funny!"  Fang Zhao: "...One day you'll understand."  Nan Feng showed agreement on his face, but inside, he laughed again.  Alright, you're the boss, so whatever you say is right. Even if you say Juan Mao is the top predator, I fully support you! Chapter 463: Impossible to be Worse than a Dog  The overwhelming reports about the Sea Emperor Dragon have led to a surge in the publication of paleontology research papers. Many things previously thought impossible in documentaries have been overturned. A student studying ancient vertebrates said with a laugh during a media interview: "Our teachers used to say that just like documentaries and archaeological excavations, they are always subject to being disproven as new information emerges. The discovery of the Sea Emperor Dragon is a significant event for us, and we believe that there are many more surprises waiting to be discovered in places we don't know about."  The excavation of the Sea Emperor Dragon on Fang Zhao's island has shifted everyone's attention from the land to the islands and oceans. In those rarely visited places, more ancient creatures that have luckily avoided cataclysmic extinctions are surely buried. Islands have increased in value! Although not a sharp rise, the number of people interested in buying islands has increased, and the price of islands has quickly stopped falling and started to rise.  Even a paleontology enthusiast has specifically bought an island to set up his own research base and established a new exploration team, targeting the rock layers beneath the sea. After the Sea Emperor Dragon was unearthed, Fang Zhao and the Brian Museum, as well as the Huangzhou Museum, signed a cooperation agreement. For the next two months, the Sea Emperor Dragon will be transported to Huangzhou for exhibition in these two museums. It is said that the online ticketing channel sells out every day as soon as it opens, and tickets for the two months available for pre-sale are all snapped up, quite the frenzy.  As for the Yanzhou Museum... the director is so frustrated he wants to cry.  There's no helping it. The Yanzhou Museum does have a geographical advantage, after all, Fang Zhao is from Yanzhou. But! In terms of strength, they are not yet able to handle the various pressures that come with the Sea Emperor Dragon. However, with two months of buffer time, they will certainly be ready to welcome the Sea Emperor Dragon! Otherwise, where would they put their face!!  After the Sea Emperor Dragon was moved out, the attention was shifted elsewhere, and Fang Zhao's island became quiet again.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Fang Zhao plans to build a museum, but the island is not a good place for it. His time away is unpredictable, and should someone cause trouble on the island, he wouldn't be able to take care of it. He wouldn't want the things Curly Hair has dug up to be stolen. He hasn't found a suitable location at the moment, and also lacks sufficient funds, so he can only wait until he has saved enough money to proceed.  With the Sea Emperor Dragon rented out, some businesses have approached him for cooperation. However, Fang Zhao's focus is still on the upcoming extraterrestrial performance. He has received an invitation from the organizers. It was only at this time that Fang Zhao found out who the organizers that Molang had not told him about were.  Hidden Star.  The foremost of the three major extraterrestrial military strongholds!  There's little other information, and even military reports rarely cover events on Hidden Star. However, Hidden Star is unanimously recognized as having the highest scientific research capabilities.  "......These are the basic matters to pay attention to, I will send you a detailed electronic document, and the itinerary will be arranged uniformly, someone will notify you at that time......" The other party briefly explained the issues to pay attention to Fang Zhao, then asked, "Do you have any other questions?"  "Can I bring a dog?" Fang Zhao asked.  There was a pause on the other end of the communicator, and the voice which was usually devoid of emotion showed a rare fluctuation: "Are you talking about Curly Hair? It can be brought, other dogs cannot. Of course, if you don't have time to feed the dog during your stay on Hidden Star, we can help. We can also let it interact with our spaceport anti-smuggling team."  Fang Zhao was not surprised that the other party knew about Curly Hair. Curly Hair has indeed been registered with several military districts and departments and has made notable contributions. Every spaceport anti-smuggling department wanted to snatch the dog. Hidden Star's spaceport did have intentions for Curly Hair, but when they knew Fang Zhao was unwilling to let the dog go, they didn't make a sound.  Of course, they were also very interested in Fang Zhao's ears, but since Fang Zhao was too focused on musical arts, it was even harder to poach him.  After finishing the call with the organizers on Hidden Star, Fang Zhao received an electronic document that included guidelines for accompanying personnel and pets. Fang Zhao mentioned this to Nanfeng and the other two, but did not tell them the destination was Hidden Star. The three expressed their desire to follow.  Nanfeng, with his sharp insight, guessed that the place Fang Zhao was going to must be of high standards, so he was definitely unwilling to be left behind! Hearing that Curly Hair would also be brought along, Nanfeng worriedly said, "Didn't they say the place we're going is strictly managed? Can dogs be brought too?"  Although he didn't know exactly where they were going, a place with such complex and strict approvals that allowed pets to be brought along?  Fang Zhao didn't explain much, only saying, "I'll give you the application link; just submit the application for Curly Hair when you do yours."  "Understood, boss!" Nanfeng acted quickly, calling on Yan Biao and Zuo Yu to submit their accompanying applications together.  The scrutiny for these accompanying personnel was much stricter, with political vetting in the first round. Inappropriate public remarks or blemishes on one's record could block the application.  "Even pets need political vetting?" Nanfeng found it novel, but still followed Fang Zhao's instructions and submitted the application for Curly Hair.  A minute later, Curly Hair's political vetting was approved.  Nanfeng: "......"  Is the vetting for pets so fast nowadays?  An hour later, Yan Biao was approved.  Another half-hour later, Zuo Yu was approved.  Nanfeng...  Nanfeng hadn't received any notification by dinner time.  "Why did you guys pass the vetting so quickly? Then me... I... couldn't be..." Nanfeng's face was pale, and his speech trembled.  Yan Biao consoled him: "It's probably because you've been in the entertainment industry for a while, so they're scrutinizing you more closely."  Nanfeng's heart was still hanging high. He had been in the Huangzhou entertainment industry and worked at the bottom level, where he might have been more casual in his speech and actions, but he certainly hadn't said anything he shouldn't have, nor had he done anything outrageous!  Nanfeng didn't sleep that night.  Fortunately, he received the approval message the next day, and his heart finally settled down.  "OK! Apply for the next round of vetting!"  The following few rounds of vetting went smoothly, but the last one required them to go to a designated location for a physical examination within seven working days.  Fang Zhao went with them.  "Boss, you've already passed everything, right? You don't need to come with us, I can handle this." Nanfeng said.  Physical examinations are simple!  "I'll go and have a look," Fang Zhao said.  At the designated place, the three men and the dog entered different testing channels.  Fang Zhao found a bench to sit down and read a book.  Half an hour later, Curly Hair trotted out with its little dog paws, easily and without pressure.  Two hours later, Yan Biao came out of the testing channel.  Seeing that Zuo Yu and Nanfeng were not there, Yan Biao felt somewhat proud. Look, he was indeed the strongest. Having served on Baiji Star for many years, he had an advantage! As for Curly Hair, Yan Biao didn't take it seriously. He thought that the standards for pets must have been relaxed here.  Curly Hair yawned.  When Zuo Yu came out, Curly Hair yawned again and found a comfortable position to continue lying down.  By the time Nanfeng came out of the testing channel, Curly Hair had already fallen asleep next to Fang Zhao's feet.  Nanfeng, who had just walked out of the testing channel, still felt a bit dizzy and nauseous.  "This test was quite strict, and the standards for the physical fitness test were set very high."  From the physical fitness test inside, it was evident that the place they were going to perform was certainly not a very comfortable one.  Zuo Yu mocked from the side: "I say, Nanfeng, you used to be from Baiji Star, right? Not good, you've regressed! You need to start increasing your training from tomorrow!"  Yan Biao also agreed: "You do need to enhance your training. You say you, you can't even beat a dog, aren't you embarrassed?"  Nanfeng looked at Yan Biao and Zuo Yu, who were already sitting on the bench, and then at the snoring Curly Hair, his expression bewildered.  "No... impossible... I can't be worse than Curly Hair!"  After being discharged for so many years, have I really degenerated to the level of a weakling? Chapter 464: Departure  After all the applications were approved, Fang Zhao turned down all subsequent collaboration invitations, not even attending the opening ceremony of the first public exhibit of the Sea Emperor Dragon's head in Huangzhou.  On the day of the Sea Emperor Dragon's head exhibit, a long queue formed outside the Huangzhou Museum. People attracted by the Sea Emperor Dragon were so excited that their faces flushed red, enduring the slow security check in line. Next to the queuing channel, there were also some dinosaur-related models and toys for sale, and those waiting in line couldn't resist buying a few to play with.  The invited media reporters entered the museum through the press channel and furiously snapped photos of the Sea Emperor Dragon. Not all of them were allowed to visit Fang Zhao's private island, so they hadn't been able to take any photos before and mostly just shared reports from other outlets.  The directors of the Huangzhou Museum and the Brian Museum had continuous smiles during the opening ceremony, but once they returned to their offices after the interviews, the smiles disappeared from their faces. The director of the Huangzhou Museum looked at the several bionic mechanical reptiles on the desk with a very ugly expression.  The Brian Museum's director was also relieved: "If it weren't for Fang Zhao's reminder to conduct a special upgrade, there would have been losses this time."  When Fang Zhao handed over the Sea Emperor Dragon fossils to them, he reminded them and suggested a security upgrade against bionic mechanical technology. The two directors took Fang Zhao's advice seriously, and before the transfer of the Sea Emperor Dragon, they had already arranged for a special upgrade to be carried out in their museums.  While the two directors were both angry and relieved, a group of people who had set their sights on the Sea Emperor Dragon were hopping mad.  "Not being able to get into Fang Zhao's warehouse is one thing; we can assume that he is using some kind of military equipment. But not being able to get into both Huangzhou and Brian Museums, what does that tell us?"  "This technology is outdated!"  "I spent so much money only to buy outdated stuff!"  "The seller tricked me!"  The so-called latest bionic machinery hyped by the seller was a total pitfall!  Spending so much money all for nothing!  If the technology is outdated, it's worthless. Black market goods are expensive, but there has never been such a scam!  Feeling thoroughly cheated, the people who thought they were scammed tried to get a refund from the seller, but couldn't find anyone. In a fit of anger, they spent a lot of money to put a hit on the original seller and warned others: "There's a lot of shoddy goods in the black market!"  Within the T organization, the person tasked with selling the bionic technology was now in a sorry state of flight.  Ever since they discovered that the stolen bionic technology was ineffective against Yanzhou's sea defenses, the people in the T organization had been thinking of ways to make more money with bionic technology, and just at the time when Fang Zhao discovered the fossils, they seized the opportunity to create a batch of bionic machinery and made a fortune on the black market!  However, not long after, people who bought the bionic machinery started clamoring for refunds.  This convinced the T organization that the "bionic technology" was a conspiracy against them!  It was acceptable for military use, and they would admit defeat if it couldn't get past sea defenses, but even civilian security systems had been upgraded to anti-bionic technology versions. They had expended so much effort only to steal an outdated technology!  Fang Zhao, who caused all this, had indirectly stabbed the T organization once again.  After discovering the presence of bionic reptiles on the island, Fang Zhao reported the matter. Following the upgrades at Huangzhou Museum and Brian Museum, more critical locations would undergo upgrades against bionic technology.  However, Fang Zhao currently had no time to pay attention to the security upgrades, as he was now packing to head to Hidden Star. This departure would also take a bit longer, so he informed his grandparents. He didn't provide details, only mentioning that he had matters to attend to and would be out of contact for a while, and if they couldn't reach him, he asked the elders not to worry.  "Boss, the eighty million... should this 'rabbit' be left at home?" Nan Feng asked.  "Mhm," Fang Zhao replied, glancing at the water tank. He had placed the "rabbit" in his seaside residence, not on the island, because if anything happened here, the alarm would sound and the property management could respond quickly.  "Alright." Although still somewhat worried, Nan Feng didn't say more and continued with the report, "The construction team on the island is making smooth progress. Everything should be restored by the time we return."  Due to the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil, the island had undergone digging, building, and dismantling, so now people were hired to restore it. The big pit from the digging had to be filled, and other areas on the island needed to be repaired and rebuilt.  After packing, Fang Zhao received a call from the military district's personnel sent to pick them up.  The aircraft landed on the tarmac.  Two soldiers came to verify identities.  Fang Zhao, as well as an assistant, two bodyguards, and a dog.  Nan Feng noticed that the soldier checking identities lingered on Curly Hair for quite a while, as if to confirm whether this was indeed the dog listed on the application form.  Four people and one dog, identities confirmed and luggage checked for security, the two soldiers led them onto the aircraft, heading to the Yanzhou military district.  Fang Zhao would travel to the outer space port with other invited personnel from Yanzhou to assemble.  Nan Feng's trio, one with a special forces background and two with extraterrestrial garrison experience, all puffed out their chests and stood tall, showing their steely demeanor in front of the Yanzhou military district's personnel. At this time, they couldn't let Fang Zhao down.  However, after boarding the aircraft, the two soldiers only glanced briefly at the trio and then focused their attention on Fang Zhao and Curly Hair.  The soldiers' orders were to take extra care of Fang Zhao and his dog, while Nan Feng's trio wasn't in their care remit, and verification of their identities was enough.  In fact, they weren't specifically there to pick up Fang Zhao; they were just the closest after completing a mission and were assigned to pick him up.  Inside the tightly closed energy cabin, there was a box of energy ore and some cargo, all destined for the military district; this trip was just conveniently picking up some people on the way.  Curly Hair lay quietly at Fang Zhao's feet, its glossy dog eyes sweeping around, licking its nose, and then looking up at Fang Zhao, whimpering a couple of times.  Fang Zhao glanced at it and patted its head.  Curly Hair lay back down contentedly, but occasionally licked its nose and smacked its lips.  Seeing this, a soldier asked, "Is it thirsty?"  "Yes, it's thirsty. Nan Feng, take out its water bowl," Fang Zhao said calmly.  "Yes!" Nan Feng flipped out the dog bowl and handed it over.  Yan Biao watched the scene and thought to himself: Geez, pets are really pampered.  Fang Zhao held the bowl, accepted the water offered by a soldier, and after thanking him, he poured half a bowl of water in front of Curly Hair, tapping its head as a warning.  Ever since Curly Hair was able to transform, its diet had expanded, and its appetite had grown. It had been let out to forage for food just yesterday.  Thirsty? No, it was just greedy for a taste.  Of course, Fang Zhao wouldn't say the real reason. He couldn't possibly say it.  Otherwise, how could he explain it? Say that Curly Hair was drooling over the energy cabin of someone else's aircraft?  Fang Zhao was somewhat troubled. It seemed that he still needed to keep the dog close to him; otherwise, he wouldn't be at ease. He would have to keep a close eye on it this time; if he wasn't careful, it might run off and eat something strange, not even leaving behind any scraps. Chapter 465: No One's Stealing The Dog  At the Yanzhou Military Region, several journalists were preparing to interview a certain armored division that had just returned from a mission. While discussing the upcoming interview, a surprised voice from one of the journalists was heard, "Isn't that Fang Zhao?!" The others turned to look. "It seems like it!" "Judging from the dog following him, it's definitely Fang Zhao!" "What's he doing in the Yanzhou Military Region?" "I just noticed that they came off a military aircraft, escorted by two soldiers." "Interesting, what is he up to this time?"  A young journalist was about to take some photos but was stopped by the others. After calming down, he also regretted acting impulsively. Once inside the military base, unless it's a scheduled event, no random pictures should be taken. So, although they were dying of curiosity, they still had to control themselves, or else they would be kicked out directly, and their careers could end there.  However, even without taking pictures, they would still gossip privately. "I think Fang Zhao is up to something again." "Lately, it's all been about him in the news. I thought he was busy with the Sea Emperor Dragon fossil matter, but I didn't expect to see him here." "Now that you mention it, there hasn't been any news of his whereabouts recently. The leaks online are all about the fossils, none about him." "I heard from a friend that many entertainment journalists are looking for him, but can't find him. The entertainment journalists nowadays have regressed. Back in my younger days, those journalists were so quick that they would dig out news before we could even report it."  Indeed, as these journalists said, due to the hot discussion about the Sea Emperor Dragon, everyone naturally paid attention to Fang Zhao. However, what was different this time was that many investors were also keeping an eye on Fang Zhao. They analyzed the Sea Emperor Dragon excavation process and believed that Fang Zhao must have received the news in advance, which is why he rushed to purchase the island.  Analyzing Fang Zhao's path to fame, it always felt like every move he made would lead to a big event. The Sea Emperor Dragon fossil incident was definitely not the end! This time they were watching Fang Zhao closely, especially his movements, wanting to know if he had secretly gone to dig up more fossils? Or had he found something else valuable?  However...  He freaking disappeared again! Fang Zhao, including his assistant and bodyguards, as well as that dog capable of digging up fossils, all freaking disappeared! He didn't even attend the Sea Emperor Dragon's first exhibition ceremony. There must be something more important!  But there had been no recent mention of him attending any events.  Investigate! Find out what that kid has been up to recently! Is he going to cause trouble again?!  However, as they waited and waited, there was still no news. Not to mention the investors who were holding back their frustration, even the online crowd anxious for updates were getting impatient. The last time Fang Zhao appeared in public was in Yanzhou, so the netizens from Yanzhou began to exert effort.  As usual...  "Wang Die, you failure!"  "Wang Die! Come out and work!"  "Wang Die, look, we've even started a crowdfunding campaign, see? It just launched and already more than ten million people have participated. Conservatively estimated, by this time tomorrow, it will definitely surpass a hundred million! If you can dig up news about Fang Zhao, all this money is yours! Surprised? Unexpected? Happy?"  Thus, the crowdfunding campaign, which saw its popularity soar rapidly, pushed Wang Die into the trending topics.  Wang Die: "......" Thank you on behalf of your whole family!  While the online crowd was busy crowdfunding to trap Wang Die, Fang Zhao had already transferred from Yanzhou Military Region to the outer spaceport. They needed to stay at the spaceport for two days before heading to the hidden star.  At the spaceport, Fang Zhao met other artists invited to the hidden star and also encountered an old friend. During the filming of "Genesis," he had collaborated with the villain specialist & wife dazzler Qiao Tingzheng. His wife, Windsor, was invited to perform on the hidden star, and this time he accompanied her as a family member.  Seeing Fang Zhao, Qiao Tingzheng was very happy and said he would come over to chat with Fang Zhao after settling his luggage.  Nan Feng approached Fang Zhao and whispered, "Boss, looking at the artists invited this time, you are the youngest among them."  And also the least experienced. Although Nan Feng didn't finish his sentence, Fang Zhao understood his implication. Being the least experienced, he might have to endure some grievances. However, Fang Zhao was prepared for this.  While they were talking, a middle-aged artist passed by them, his gaze sweeping over the curly-haired dog at Fang Zhao's feet, frowning deeply, showing extreme dissatisfaction, then looking at Fang Zhao, wanting to say something, he opened his mouth but ended up snorting and left angrily.  Fang Zhao, who was about to greet the other party, was left puzzled: "??"  Fang Zhao knew this middle-aged artist who stormed off for reasons unknown—David Herl, one of the three great violin masters in the world, and the teacher of the "Fiery" Fai Harmonic who plays the violin with flying red hair. Recently, Fai Harmonic seemed to have started another battle with Saro, sparring online. However, Fang Zhao hadn't followed their battle recently and didn't know the outcome.  Unlike Fai Harmonic, who was always in entertainment news, David Herl, his teacher, was much more low-key. Other than music concerts and lectures, he rarely appeared in public. Fang Zhao had never spoken to him before, and they didn't have much interaction. This was the closest they had been, but Fang Zhao didn't understand what the world-class violin master was angry about.  After David Herl walked away, Nan Feng approached and whispered, "I also know the guy who just passed by, a violin master, his student is Fai Harmonic, who has a strong presence in the entertainment industry and is often compared with you. He probably doesn't like the look of you. He already has prejudices, and now seeing you attend a performance with a dog, he must be even more unhappy."  Such things were too common in the industry, and Nan Feng believed he had found the truth. Even if it wasn't the exact truth, it was close to it.  Fang Zhao didn't think it was as Nan Feng said, but he really didn't understand where David Herl's anger came from. The question was answered when Qiao Tingzheng came over to chat with him.  "David Herl? Oh, him," Qiao Tingzheng glanced at Fang Zhao and the curly-haired dog beside him, "Of course he's angry! Because his request to bring his own dog was denied, before coming here I heard someone consoling him saying 'you can't bring dogs to perform on an alien planet,' and he was feeling depressed. As soon as he arrived at the spaceport, he saw you with a dog. How could he not be angry?"  Qiao Tingzheng shared with Fang Zhao the story of the renowned violin master's journey as a dog slave, all of which he had heard from his wife.  "......The thing he loves most now, apart from his violin, is his dog. In front of these two, even his direct disciple Fai Harmonic has to step aside. There, that's his beloved dog."  Qiao Tingzheng showed Fang Zhao a photo of David Herl's beloved dog that he had saved. David Herl's beloved dog belonged to a new century artificially bred dog breed, with the genes of three elegant old-century breeds and a hunting dog. Its signature was the "long hair," which indeed looked elegant when groomed.  Nan Feng also took a peek. "This master... seems to have a special fondness for long hair."  Qiao Tingzheng laughed and said, "Right, he does like long hair." Then he looked at the curly-haired dog at Fang Zhao's feet, "Your dog's fur isn't particularly long; he probably doesn't care for it. But you can rest assured, he's good to dogs. It's just envy, jealousy, and hatred towards you. You don't need to mind, he's not really angry with you."  Qiao Tingzheng then looked at the curly-haired dog, knowing that it had made big news recently, "Did it really dig out the first Sea Emperor Dragon skeletal fossil?"  "It did," said Fang Zhao.  "I thought the news was just making things up," Qiao Tingzheng said, looking at the curly-haired dog as if it were a rare animal.  The curly-haired dog opened its mouth and stuck out its tongue, droplets of saliva dripping down, continuously licking its lips, seeming somewhat restless.  "Is it feeling too hot in here?" Qiao Tingzheng asked. Although he didn't understand dogs, he knew some common sense, such as dogs sticking out their tongues and panting to cool down when hot... No, that couldn't be saliva, should it be considered sweat from a dog?  However, Qiao Tingzheng checked the indoor temperature and pressure, which were all normal. It shouldn't be like this.  "It's just not very adapted," Fang Zhao said calmly.  "Right, most pet dogs have difficulty adapting to the atmosphere of a spaceport. I heard that dogs are afraid of heights, so going to outer space is kind of like being afraid of heights, haha!" Qiao Tingzheng laughed at his own joke.  Fang Zhao also smiled politely, but was actually even more worried. The dog had gone to the sea to forage the day before departure, hadn't transformed frequently, and hadn't consumed much energy, so why would it be hungry? It was just greedy.  The spaceport had too many energy sources, and for the curly-haired dog, whose diet had expanded, that was a huge temptation. Fang Zhao even suspected that if he didn't keep a close eye on the curly-haired dog, it could eat the entire spaceport if it really started eating.  Seeing the curly-haired dog's reaction, Fang Zhao strengthened his restraint on it and even gave it a lesson in private. The curly-haired dog then restrained itself somewhat, at least it wasn't constantly drooling, but its eyes were still sneakily looking around.  Fang Zhao and the others invited to perform were occasionally called to meetings, so it was impossible to always keep the curly-haired dog by their side. Therefore, he entrusted the task of watching the curly-haired dog to Nan Feng and the other two. He brought three people to keep an eye on the dog.  "Keep a close watch on it."  Nan Feng and the other two solemnly replied, "Understood!"  No one's stealing the dog! Chapter 466: Rational Star Chasing  Yinxing is a globally militarized managed place. Apart from a few areas where people gather and live, vast spaces are used for various product experiments and military exercises. The natural environment here is not suitable for human habitation, but due to Yinxing's rich energy mineral deposits, the first extraterrestrial military base was built here. The current top aerospace technology, more than 90% of it, comes from Yinxing.  From departure to landing on Yinxing, Fang Zhao and the others couldn't see the outside situation at all. During this period, they also signed a confidentiality agreement. In short, they were invited to participate in a cultural performance, and as for other matters, they were advised not to be too curious.  When Fang Zhao and his group exited the aircraft, they had already landed in the designated area of Yinxing. The special nature of Yinxing means that there is very little real information about it on the internet. Even the veterans in their art troupe who have visited several times only know some art-related information; they don't understand, and they dare not delve too much into other matters.  As a first-time visitor to Yinxing, Fang Zhao didn't know much else, but he was certain that the energy mineral deposits of Yinxing were extremely rich and abundant—the drool of his curly-haired dog just couldn't stop.  Upon exiting the aircraft, they could see a huge protective shield enveloping the area above. Without protection suits, they could only move indoors, but it didn't feel narrow or crowded.  "This is the accommodation arranged for the teachers..." A person wearing the standard uniform of Yinxing introduced to them.  This was a reception center, with dormitories, a cafeteria, and an activity area. They had been informed of some things to note in advance, and they had signed the confidentiality agreement. For the following time, they just needed to follow the arrangements and collaborate with Yinxing's bands and dance troupes for the cultural performance. During their free time, they could move around as allowed.  Regarding accommodation, family members were allowed to stay together, but assistants and bodyguards were arranged in another building.  "Fang Zhao, your dormitory is over there," the guide said.  "Can dogs be brought over?" Fang Zhao asked.  "Yes."  Fang Zhao took his room card to the assigned room. The space inside was not large, but it was fully equipped, with two bedrooms and a living room, as well as a study. The decor had a technological feel and was also infused with some artistic style. In addition, there were dog bowls and a dog toilet. Truly thoughtful.  After settling in briefly, the team leader gathered them for a small meeting to explain the plans for the next few days and the distribution of tasks. Their invited team consisted of musicians, dancers, actors, and painters, among others, with different specializations. After arriving at Yinxing, they would collaborate with different partners.  The people Fang Zhao would be working with were from a youth art troupe of Yinxing. The personnel in these art troupes of Yinxing were mostly amateurs, and they couldn't be held to professional standards.  "Fang Zhao, you will be the conductor of the youth orchestra. Any problems?" the team leader asked.  "No problem," Fang Zhao replied.  The piece chosen by this youth orchestra of Yinxing was a major composition by Molang, the epic series "Genesis" overall ending theme, a ten-minute long piece titled "Legend." On this, Molang insisted that the conductor must be Fang Zhao. This piece was co-created by Fang Zhao, who understood it better than anyone else.  This was also a test Molang gave to Fang Zhao.  After the meeting ended, everyone went back to rest, and in the afternoon, they were arranged to visit the exhibition hall.  Only those invited personnel could visit these exhibitions, and most of the accompanying personnel were not allowed, not even Qiao Ting, who was a family member, let alone bodyguards and assistants. Therefore, Fang Zhao arranged for three people, Nan Feng, to take care of the dog and did not bring them along.  The exhibition hall was mainly about aerospace research products, and it was Fang Zhao's first visit, so he was very interested in these things.  In the exhibition hall, what Fang Zhao was most interested in was the warp engine. The warp engine ushered in the era of space travel and is recognized as the greatest invention of the new century.  The guide in the exhibition hall was introducing information related to the warp engine. "What's placed in front of you is part of the first generation warp engine. It's this engine that made space warp possible. However, the energy needed to maintain the warp engine is far beyond everyone's imagination. The old energy sources could not support the engine's operation, so people sought new energy sources..."  The guide went from the warp engine to the innovation of energy technology and then to ore mining, but he didn't mention the key points. Such as how the warp engine was born, its development process, how long it took to research and develop, how far it could support space travel, and other questions Fang Zhao was particularly curious about; none were mentioned.  However, the people who came along all knew that here, they should listen to what others say and not ask too much. What the guide didn't mention was definitely not allowed to be mentioned, and no matter how much you asked, they wouldn't tell you.  From the discovery of energy minerals, the continuous upgrading of energy conversion technology, to the classification and mining of energy minerals, these stories were just like listening to tales for the other members of the art troupe. Perhaps they would laugh and pass it off, or perhaps they already understood, but Fang Zhao was listening very seriously.  Since the warp engine could not be understood in depth, Fang Zhao still wanted to listen more about energy minerals. The more he knew, the more he was moved in his heart.  It's too fast! The breakthroughs in new energy and aerospace technology in the new century are too rapid, far beyond Fang Zhao's expectations. During the era of the world's destruction, he had repeatedly asked related scientific researchers whether space travel could be realized. The reply he got was, "Perhaps by the day humanity is extinct, there may not be any significant progress."  However, just a hundred years after the end of the era of destruction and the establishment of the new century, the warp engine had already appeared, creating the pioneering "Dream Team" of seven spacecraft for the exploration of space in the new century. This was probably beyond the expectations of anyone who lived through the era of destruction.  A hundred years seems long, but Fang Zhao knew all too well the situation at the end of the era of destruction. In his view, a hundred years might just be used for recovery and rebuilding. The actual development speed of the new century, in Fang Zhao's view, was nothing short of miraculous.  The warp engine appeared within a hundred years of the new century, and now it's been over five hundred years since the new century began; who knows how many generations of warp engines have been developed. Unfortunately, he couldn't see it.  However, it was still very good to see a part of the original warp engine. He felt quite comforted in his heart.  What Fang Zhao felt in his heart, others didn't know. The artists invited here might not be interested in these things, so they didn't stay long in the exhibition hall. After that, there was a small fan meeting, where fans from various departments of Yinxing came to meet their idols.  With signatures, group photos, and many people around, it was not chaotic but very disciplined. The special management environment of Yinxing made this kind of fan meeting more efficient.  The fans who could come had been selected, as too many people wanted to come, so the number had to be controlled.  Fang Zhao's fans included both young and old, especially the elderly who had watched the "Genesis Yanzhou Episode," who looked at Fang Zhao with eyes full of pity.  Not far away, two high-level management personnel who organized the fan meeting walked over, seeing the long queue at Fang Zhao's side, they laughed.  "It's not apparent, but Fang Zhao has quite a few fans here in Yinxing!"  "Our families, old and young alike, like him a lot. This kid is indeed good; it's just a pity he didn't continue to develop in the military."  "Speaking of which, why haven't I seen Xiao Yuan? Wasn't he clamoring to prepare a big gift for Fang Zhao?"  "Right, I looked for him and didn't see him anywhere. Ever since the list of invited personnel was confirmed, Yuan Zheng kept asking me about the invited artists. I gave him the schedule."  "There's only half an hour left for the fan meeting."  "Did he oversleep? Or got too involved in work and forgot about the time? Or maybe there's a sudden mission and he can't get out?"  ——  Yinxing Warp Engine Technology Research Institute.  Inside the security checkpoint at the entrance of the institute, a young man who looked about the same age as a college student was sitting on a chair, tapping his fingers anxiously on the table and constantly looking at the time.  The security personnel of the research institute, sitting opposite him, had an expressionless face as he took out the last checked item from the gift box and placed it properly on the table.  "So, you want to give these..." The security personnel pointed at the items on the table, "a star interstellar voyage fleet, to a celebrity?"  "That's right!"  "But these have not been made public yet. Not to mention the confidential technology involved, at least two of the models will probably not be announced for at least ten years."  "These are just models!"  "Even models are not okay. Please be rational."  Yuan Zheng took a deep breath, "I chase stars, but I am a rational fan. I am different from those brain-dead fans who blindly praise without any bottom line! Please do not belittle my intelligence!"  "I don't doubt the intelligence of a Golden Badge engineer."  The security personnel's face was unchanged, "Wasn't your previous idol the Master of Eternal Stars?"  "My idol is still the Master of Eternal Stars! He is a god in the hearts of everyone in our research institute! One can only look up to him! However, my Brother Zhao is more down-to-earth. Brother Zhao is my idol, and I just think he is exceptionally awesome! What does star chasing chase after? It's the shining things they have! My Brother Zhao, that's a huge shining body! Tell me, which entertainment figure can achieve so many honors at his age?"  The security personnel nodded, indicating understanding. He knew about Fang Zhao; his cross-field influence was so strong, not to mention Fang Zhao also carried military honors. It was rare for someone in their twenties to be invited here to perform.  Seeing that the other party's expression had softened, Yuan Zheng continued, "Have you heard a saying? 'The goal is in front, the idol is by your side.' It's a kind of spiritual motivation, understand? Progressing together, understand! I even have a poster of Brother Zhao in my room!"  The security personnel nodded again, indicating understanding. He had heard that when Fang Zhao won the Galaxy Award's Star Prize, Yuan Zheng had put in a lot of effort to be promoted from a Silver Badge engineer to a Golden Badge.  Of course, it's understandable for young people to chase stars impulsively. He also admired a basketball star from Mazhou when he was young, but that basketball star didn't pass the review and couldn't come here. Those who are invited to come here must have gone through layers of review. Not only their professional abilities but also their character and personality must be examined.  In comparison, Yuan Zheng was lucky; at least he could see his idol in person. However, Fang Zhao, even though he had strong abilities, was still too young and might not be able to keep secrets. Unreleased model types should not be given away.  Seeing the other person's face becoming stern again, Yuan Zheng quickly played the emotional card. "Uncle, you've seen me grow up. You know what kind of person I am. When facing my idol, of course, I want to show off my achievements. Uncle, you've also chased stars before; you can understand, right? I've made models of some of the models involved in the projects I've participated in. Some key parts have been blurred. There's absolutely no intention of leaking secrets!"  "Of course, I believe you," the security personnel's demeanor softened, however, "Second application, denied."  "Uncle..." Yuan Zheng looked pitiful.  "All models are confiscated. I'm sorry, duty calls."  Yuan Zheng's eyes were almost filled with tears. The space fleet models he had prepared for so long were stopped at the security checkpoint!!  Seeing Yuan Zheng sitting there dejected and devastated, the security personnel sighed, "How about this."  Yuan Zheng looked up at him with hopeful eyes.  He saw the security personnel pick up one of the spaceship models... and dismantled a small part of the engine... and placed it in front of him.  Yuan Zheng sat there dumbfounded, holding his breath.  Then he said with a collapsed face, "My Brother Zhao finally came to perform, and I'm giving him... a part?"  The security personnel said expressionlessly, "This is the bottom line. Kid, be rational when chasing stars." Chapter 467: Second-Generation Fold Engineer  When Yuan Zheng arrived at the venue for the meet-and-greet, it had already ended, and the artists had left on their return vehicles. With no other choice, Yuan Zheng had to make a detour to seek them out. It was not easy to have the chance to meet his idol; he couldn't miss the opportunity.  For the artists invited to Hidden Star, the first day was quite busy, with the older ones already showing signs of exhaustion and fatigue. After returning from the meet-and-greet venue, Fang Zhao took over the care of Curly Hair.  "Boss, is Curly Hair not used to the environmental conditions here? Why do I see it drooling and panting all the time?" Nan Feng was worried.  "It'll adjust in a couple of days," Fang Zhao said.  Nan Feng thought for a moment, "That's true, it takes time to get used to the environmental conditions here on Hidden Star. Even Left Yu, Yan Biao, and I felt a bit dizzy when we first arrived."  Nan Feng handed over the newly received dog food and pet supplies to Fang Zhao, "The reception gave these, and said to collect more when they are used up."  Seeing that the other artists were all tired and preparing to rest, Nan Feng didn't say more, "Then boss, you go back and adjust yourself. If there's anything, just communicate with us, we'll handle it, ready at any time!"  "Okay, you guys also go and rest."  Fang Zhao took Curly Hair back to his room and poured a bowl of dog food for it. Curly Hair ate reluctantly, cherishing each piece. After finishing the bowl, it would have to wait another four or five hours for the next meal.  After arriving on Hidden Star, it could no longer do whatever it wanted. Apart from dog food, it couldn't eat anything else, and it couldn't eat too much.  "You need to learn to control yourself," Fang Zhao said. "If you behave well, you can watch TV. The television broadcasts here are synchronized with the rest."  Curly Hair gulped down the dog food in the bowl and pushed the clean bowl towards Fang Zhao, meaning—Look, I didn't even eat the bowl, am I behaving well?  "Alright, go watch TV yourself."  As soon as Fang Zhao finished speaking, Curly Hair ran to turn on the TV in the room, switched to the current affairs news channel, and sat down with a serious dog expression.  After a while, Fang Zhao went to the study.  Curly Hair peeked inside and saw Fang Zhao buried in work. It quietly changed the TV channel to the gaming competition channel and watched a live broadcast, engrossed.  Inside the study, Fang Zhao sighed silently. He was aware of Curly Hair's little antics but pretended not to notice. It was good to have something to distract it, so it wouldn't keep drooling around.  Sorting through the musical scores, Fang Zhao continued to modify the plan. For the upcoming performance, he had to rework "The Legend" to give it new vitality. The reworked score had already been reviewed and approved by Moron.  When it came to understanding the work and the will of the composer, Moron only trusted Fang Zhao.  So, Fang Zhao had a lot to do. Next, he needed to communicate with the orchestra members, supervise their rehearsals, point out flaws in the process, and provide solutions.  Just as he was organizing the plan, the doorbell rang.  Fang Zhao hadn't put up a 'Do Not Disturb' sign at the door and wasn't sure who would come to find him at this time since the other artists had gone to rest.  Opening the door, Fang Zhao saw a young man and two soldiers standing outside.  Scanning the young man's golden badge, Fang Zhao was surprised. Although new to Hidden Star, he already knew what the badge represented; the two soldiers were likely responsible for the young man's safety. People with golden badges usually had security when they went out.  However, to reach the golden badge level at such a young age, he must be an extremely important talent; it was natural for him to be protected.  When the young man saw Fang Zhao, he was excited and somewhat restrained.  "Zhao-zhao-zhao-zhao-ge, hello! My name is Yuan Zheng! I'm your die-hard fan!!" His words were forceful and loud, especially the last three.  The two soldiers behind him: "......"  Wasn't he supposed to be a rational fan before coming?  Too nervous and said it wrong?  However, Yuan Zheng didn't realize he had said anything wrong, nor did he remember what he had just said. At the moment, his mind was filled with excitement at seeing his idol.  "Zhao-ge, am I disturbing you?" Yuan Zheng scratched his head awkwardly.  "No, come in," Fang Zhao said with a smile.  "Ah! Thank you, Zhao-ge!"  When Yuan Zheng entered the house, the two soldiers followed. Yuan Zheng quickly explained, "Zhao-ge, these two are for my safety. According to the regulations, we golden badge engineers need to have at least two soldiers accompany us for protection."  "That's appropriate."  Fang Zhao also poured two cups of water for the soldiers and then turned to Yuan Zheng.  In front of his idol, Yuan Zheng tried to show his excellence. Before coming to Fang Zhao's place, he had worn all the medals he had received and polished his small golden badge, symbolizing the level of a Hidden Star engineer, not wanting to embarrass his idol.  "I was born on Hidden Star, and I am currently a golden badge engineer at the Fold Engine Research Institute. My parents are also fold engine engineers; I am the second generation in our family. Zhao-ge, you can also call us 'fold-second-generation'! I have participated in many important projects..."  "Cough!"  Yuan Zheng had just started speaking when one of the soldiers next to him coughed softly, reminding him there were some things he couldn't say.  Interrupted, Yuan Zheng paused, skipped the part about "important projects," and continued, "Anyway, I'm very awesome! In terms of talent, I am the first... second in our institute, except for little Bear who came not long ago, I am the youngest golden badge engineer in our institute!"  As he said this, Yuan Zheng was a bit upset. He used to be the number one talent in the institute, but ever since that kid surnamed Bear arrived, he had been bumped from the first place.  "I even prepared a big gift for you knowing you were coming! I made a fleet model with my own hands! Unfortunately, after passing the security check, only one part was left... I couldn't make it to the meet-and-greet this afternoon."  The more he spoke, the lower Yuan Zheng's voice became, and he put on an awkward and bitter smile, handing over a piece the size of a fingernail.  A fleet model went through a security check and only one small part remained. Yuan Zheng had no choice; this was the limit set by the security officers. Even he, a genius golden badge engineer, could not make an exception.  Yuan Zheng had no other suitable gifts on hand, and due to the rush, he was not fully prepared, so he had to give away the part.  "Zhao-ge, you'll be staying on Hidden Star for a while, I'll go back and make a gift that can pass the security check!"  "This is already very good," Fang Zhao said, taking the seemingly insignificant small part. "This is part of the fold engine from the model, isn't it?"  "Right!" Yuan Zheng wanted to say more, but the soldier next to him coughed softly again, and he held back.  Yuan Zheng felt aggrieved.  It's so hard! Being a golden badge engineer and a fan is too difficult! He couldn't talk about this or mention that, and even the prepared gifts couldn't be given away, making it embarrassing to even speak in front of his idol!  Scratching his head over how to explain, Yuan Zheng looked up and saw Fang Zhao looking at him. A smile, kind.  Confused by Fang Zhao's gaze, Yuan Zheng saw Fang Zhao hand over a palm-sized box. Inside was a model of a Sea Emperor dragon skeleton.  "For me?" Yuan Zheng stammered with excitement.  Fang Zhao nodded.  Yuan Zheng extended his hands solemnly to receive it, holding it as if he were receiving a sacred decree.  "Zhao-ge, could you... sign your name on the base of the model?"  "Sure."  Fang Zhao found a suitable pen and signed his name on the base of the Sea Emperor dragon skeleton model.  Not wanting to disturb Fang Zhao's rest, Yuan Zheng didn't stay long and soon left. Even as he walked out the door, Yuan Zheng held the box containing the Sea Emperor dragon skeleton model tightly in his arms.  Walking further away, Yuan Zheng's eyes were red. "I'm so moved! I only gave away a broken part, and I received a gift from Zhao-ge!"  However, the two soldiers following him couldn't share his sentiment, "According to the rules, any external gifts you receive must go through a security check. Please cooperate."  Although the luggage brought by the invited artists had gone through rigorous security checks, Yuan Zheng's received gift still had to be checked again. This was also for his safety.  Yuan Zheng reluctantly handed over the model box, "Be careful, don't break the bones, especially the base, don't rub off the signature!"  When Yuan Zheng returned to the research institute, Fang Zhao didn't continue his previous work but looked at the small gift he had just received. Although Yuan Zheng had revealed little information, Fang Zhao could still make some guesses.  Combining it with previous questions in his mind, he had a hypothesis. He also remembered what Barbara had said when they first discovered the Yao Guang—the "Dream Team" of the elder-level exploration team carried the pinnacle of intelligence from that era.  "The pinnacle of intelligence from that era..."  Fang Zhao looked at the small part in his hand and murmured. The "Dream Team's" Yao Guang was a ship that existed four hundred years ago.  Yuan Zheng had also mentioned "Little Bear," which was very likely the seemingly ordinary child with a mechanical core that he had met before, the one who had been on the Yao Guang. Capable of perfectly disguising oneself among people, that was no ordinary artificial intelligence.  During the era of the Catastrophe, Fang Zhao had also come into contact with many great scientists of that time, and he knew that with every flash of human intelligence, the world's development would leap forward.  But artificial intelligence, energy technology, space folding, spaceships, and so on, all these fields undergoing multiple flashes of intelligence and stacking up in just a hundred years since the establishment of the new century, how likely is that?  This period also required the world to recover from a devastating disaster, city planning to be rebuilt, and the new order of the Twelve Continents to be formed.  "Is it a burst of intelligence, or..."  Fang Zhao's gaze stayed on the small part in his hand, as if through this tiny piece, he was looking at a much more distant scene.  There was another possibility.  "Outsider."  Star visitor. Chapter 468: I'm Still a Baby  It's impossible for Fang Zhao to confirm the truth right now. However, from what he has understood, if there were outsiders, the most likely "aliens" would be the legendary creator of the warp engine and the founder of the Poly-Universal Foundation, the "Master of Stars," who brought many changes and established the special status of the Foundation.  No one knows the purpose of the "outsiders," or how many there are, but at least for now, they seem to have no hostility and have even nurtured many top talents. But these are all just speculations.  Fang Zhao is reminded of the shock he felt when he "resurrected" in a small rented room in the black street and saw this new world. Looking at the unremarkable small component in his hand, Fang Zhao smiles and puts it into a box.  "The future has arrived." —— Hidden Star Warp Engine Technology Research Institute.  Inside the security checkpoint. The same security officer, different visitors to be checked.  A child with a golden badge is lying on the table, crying loudly. "Wahhh—You can't confiscate my 'Little Fortune'! My 'Little Fortune' wahhh!" The sobs were full of ups and downs.  The red-rimmed eyes and trembling lips, occasionally hiccuping, gave the security officer sitting across the table a sense of guilt.  The normally expressionless face of the security officer showed a rare sign of distress. He had no idea that the child would burst into tears at the drop of a hat. Headache-inducing.  The security officer softened his voice: "That black ball... that thing, your 'Little Fortune,' is still under inspection."  Speaking to this child, a more talented engineer than Yuan Zheng, he was worried that raising his voice might scare him. However, as soon as he finished speaking, the child burst into tears again.  "It's already been fifteen minutes and seven seconds! Why is security so slow! Has something happened to my 'Little Fortune'?" The child wailed without lifting his head from the table, tears flowing even more intensely.  The security officer glanced at the time displayed on the wall monitor, thinking to himself: As expected from a golden-badge engineer, he doesn’t even need to look at the time to be so precise to the second. But the situation is complicated, and security naturally takes longer.  Yuan Zheng's fleet model took even longer before. It's only been fifteen minutes.  After nearly five more minutes, the black small sphere was brought over. Seeing the approval mark on it, the security officer handed it over quickly, pinching it as he did. It felt good to the touch, suitable for stress relief, no wonder the child liked it.  After "Little Bear" got 'Little Fortune' back, he said, "I also want my 'Egg' and 'Leftover'! What rules did they break! Without them, I'll feel lonely and scared!"  "Those are dangerous items; you can't take them out without permission. As for your safety, don't worry, we will assign someone to protect you," the security officer said.  "I want them! My 'Egg' and 'Leftover' wahhh—poor things wahhh—" While crying, he took out a bottle of water from his backpack, gulped it down, and continued crying after finishing it.  The security officer continued to feel the headache; they had already asked the superiors how to deal with the two mechanical dogs. They indeed belonged to Little Bear's personal possessions, but were also equipped with weapons and needed to be handled with caution.  While anxiously waiting, the security officer rummaged through a drawer and handed over a lollipop. "Here, have some candy, stop crying."  Little Bear, still sobbing, put the lollipop in his pocket and then continued to sob.  The security officer: "......" My head hurts.  Amidst Little Bear's sobbing, they finally received the approval.  The security officer let out a sigh of relief and pulled a smile he considered friendly.  "Alright, it's approved. You can take your 'Little Fortune,' 'Egg,' and 'Leftover' and leave, but remember to follow the rules when playing outside."  "Okay!" The crying stopped, and Little Bear leaped off the chair, holding two mechanical dogs in one hand and the black sphere in the other, happily leaving.  The security officer: "......" That was a quick change of face.  What an actor! Are kids nowadays all this impressive?!  The security officer felt like he learned something from today's events.  The already departed Little Bear was very proud. Pretending to be a child is great! Being young means you can be willful! At the institute, people are very tolerant towards genius children. Now, with the institute developing a new generation of warp engines, Little Bear's contributions are significant. Compared to that, his occasional tantrums are trivial, so everyone indulges him.  However, speaking of the warp engine development, Little Bear is dissatisfied. He has been driving the Yao Guang for four hundred years, and there's only been so little progress. It's too slow!  Back then, seven super-intelligences plus the Master of Stars were developing at such a fast pace! Engines were updated quickly, their efficiency was superb, and current spaceship pilots can't even keep up!  It's just a pity that, after four hundred years, the other six super-intelligences either rebelled and were destroyed or malfunctioned and went into hibernation. Now, he's the only one left who can get things done.  Alas, the seven super-intelligences that accompanied the Master of Stars! Now, only he remains.  It's really... exciting!!  Hahaha, no one can bully me now!  I'm the biggest now! Those six above me finally rolled away!!  Who needs peers? Humans are so much more fun!  Especially these ones here, weak and non-threatening.  I just like playing with these emotionally rich species!  Whenever I get bored, I can just create a few playmates for myself.  Little Bear is very satisfied with his life now. Since returning from the Yao Guang, his days have been carefree.  ...Just one thing isn't good.  Why do I have to work! I'm still a baby!  I was a baby four hundred years ago, and I'm still a baby even after four hundred years!  The world is so beautiful, and I haven't had enough fun yet!  If it weren't for paying off debts, who would want to come here?!  My movements are restricted, and I have to go through security checks when I go out to have fun. I almost got 'Little Fortune' confiscated!  And I have to be followed when I go out.  Little Bear glanced at the two soldiers following behind him and pouted unhappily.  Pouting is something he learned from a child star on TV, supposedly making him look cuter and more likable.  However, Little Bear only pouts in front of outsiders. If he deliberately acted cute in front of the big devil Cuihua, he would be punished.  Although the Master of Stars is dead, his descendants still have ways to restrain him, like Cuihua.  In Little Bear's eyes, Cuihua is a big devil, a demon who always makes people work overtime!!  It was just borrowing some money to buy music rights, was it necessary to throw him into this place full of workaholics?!  Fortunately, he's good at pretending to be a child.  Little Bear continued to feel proud. He liked how these weak humans treated him with the attitude they reserve for minors, saving him a lot of trouble.  Apart from the high levels of Hidden Stars and some core managers of Poly-Universal Foundation, no one here knows his real age.  Heeheehee~~~  Thinking about this, Little Bear cheered up again.  Let's just work overtime, as long as there's fun to be had!  Little Bear was planning excuses to take leave in the future to go out and have fun, leading a dog with the air of a young ruffian on patrol towards the reception area.  He was going to find Fang Zhao to play.  He had heard someone mention Fang Zhao in the institute, and the artists invited to the Hidden Stars Art and Literature Gala had already arrived today.  Fang Zhao knew his secrets and was easy-going, so Little Bear was happy to interact with Fang Zhao more.  At least with Fang Zhao, he could act cute as he pleased without worrying about being hit by Fang Zhao.  Last time, when he said he cried watching "Genesis," Fang Zhao even reminded him to drink more water.  What a nice person!  The reception manager recognized Little Bear, who had a high recognition rate, a kid with a golden badge leading two mechanical dogs. There's only one like that in the entire Hidden Stars.  Moreover, Little Bear stayed there for two days when he first came to Hidden Stars, so everyone had a deep impression.  However, due to Little Bear's status as a golden-badge engineer, people usually didn't call him "Little Bear" or "Master Bear," "Teacher Bear," "Master Bear," but jokingly referred to him as "Young Master Bear."  For such advanced technical talents, everyone is always tolerant.  After all, he's still a child!  Seeing Little Bear coming over and saying he was looking for Fang Zhao, the reception staff personally took him upstairs to find him.  As they entered the elevator, Little Bear took out a lollipop from his pocket and gave it to the building manager.  Bribery is not accepted, but a lollipop is a gesture of goodwill, especially from a child, so the building manager did not refuse. He took the lollipop, thanked him, and showed a kind smile. He wanted to pat Little Bear's head, but seeing the golden badge, he withdrew his hand.  The head of a golden-badge engineer is not something you can just touch.  This is respect for high-level talents!  Fang Zhao's room.  Curly, who was watching the game channel and the esports arena live broadcast, moved his ears, licked his nose, and reluctantly shifted his gaze from the TV screen to look at the door, then walked over drooling and lay down next to it, his clear dog eyes fixated on the door.  Fang Zhao, who was editing sheet music, also looked at the closed door.  On the other side of the door.  Little Bear approached step by step, but the closer he got to the door, the smaller his steps became and the slower he moved.  The previously rosy complexion turned pale, and sweat beaded on his forehead.  He stopped in his tracks.  He had been too pleased with himself just now and overlooked something important.  Now, he remembered.  In Little Bear's hands, the slightly relaxed 'Little Fortune' once again became a perfect circle.  Seeing Little Bear suddenly stop, the building manager said, "Fang Zhao's room is right ahead, less than five meters away."  "No, I think now is not a good time. It's better not to disturb him," said Little Bear, shaking his head vigorously, not taking another step forward.  Noticing Little Bear's pale face and profuse sweating, the building manager panicked. This kind of genius cannot have anything happen to him!  "Are you feeling unwell? I'll take you to the medical room downstairs!" The building manager said and was about to contact the medical staff.  "No, no, no, I just remembered something important. I have to go! Bye!!"  "Evil Young Master" with the dogs, turned, and slipped away.  Running out of the reception area in one go, Little Bear wiped his sweat, swiped his employee card at the water dispenser for a bottle of water, and gulped down the entire bottle. He was severely dehydrated today and needed to rehydrate.  Looking at 'Egg' and 'Leftover,' who seemed unaware of the recent crisis, Little Bear regretted it: "I can't believe I spent all my salary on you two intelligent crutches!"
